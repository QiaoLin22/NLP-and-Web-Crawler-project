Coincidence? &&I’m not saying it is bullshit or anything but I always just find it funny how reddit allows promotional material to the front page without question yet other times something as simple as having a Coca Cola can or McDonald’s bag makes the entire comment section read “r/hailcoporate.

It wasn't terrible, but it tried so hard to be funny throughout 95% of the movie. Albeit, there were a few parts that made me laugh. Haven't really met anyone with the same thought though. So might just be me. &&Oh man i can't wait for another DP circlejerk for the next six months&&That's a good flashdance, honey!&&My pants just shrunk 2 sizes! &&Nope. It's a Tide ad.&&Nope, Tide ad. &&Peep his fit&&Moviepass for May is looking real good. &&A glorious mess. &&This will be a week or two after Avengers Infinity War. They're really confident with this I guess&&Avengers

uhh what else? I know I'm missing some.

Either way I'm looking forward to seeing lots of movies in May and checking out the box office numbers.&&This is where working in a movie theater gets bittersweet. On the one hand, I can see all these movies for free. On the other hand, I have to work in a movie theater when these movies come out&&[deleted]&&I'll probably g to the movies more in the month of May than I did all of last year. &&Thank you MoviePass!!&&A mess, how? It's going to be an awesome month for movies. &&He was born to play Deadpool.&&I’m glad he finally got the movie to happen. He was saying how the Deadpool movie was like the worst girlfriend ever because it was a very “will they or won’t they” scenario. &&Do you think that Deadpool got this far on his superior acting ability?&&Is Ryan Reynold actually under the costume in the poster?&&[Some might say Deadpool was created with keeping him in mind.](http://i.imgur.com/SNV8o.jpg)&&Or as much as the marketing team for these movies love their jobs. The advertising for both movies have been spot on.&&Has everyone forgotten Nolan North? He was *the* Deadpool for years.&&Aaaand it's a Deadpool ad.&&So every movie is a Deadpool movie now too?&&Good heavens, can you imagine if David Harbour and Ryan Reynolds got into a trailer feud where each of them was invading each other's invasions of other trailers?

""Hello, ladies, imagine if your man...""

""Nope, it's a Tide ad.""

""No, it's a Deadpool ad. And I'm taking this horse. I need its head for something awesome.""
&&Didn't Disney do something similar for Lilo & Stich? I remember Stich interrupting the big dance scene from Beauty & Beast. &&Reminds me of the old ads for Lilo and Stitch where Stitch just shows up in famous Disney movie scenes and messes them up. That could totally work for Deadpool&&[deleted]&&fantastic idea&&My problem with the first Deadpool movie can be boiled down to the exchange between Pool and TJ Miller when he take shis mask off. The trailer had four or five readings of clearly improvised lines about how ugly he looked, all of which were hilarious. I'm 100% certain that Reynolds and Miller sat there just riffing on that scene for ages with all kinds of hilarious improvised lines. Why put the only four lines from the trailer in the film, or vice versa? You've just ruined that bit, which was a really funny bit, by putting all of it in the trailer, despite the fact you *definitely* have other takes you could have used.&&He is. &&Iirc He’s in the Deadpool bob Ross thanksgiving painting from the teaser.&&He's in the sequel.&&tfw no more Other Space &&He's in the first poster &&I'd like to imagine him being berated on how to pour the shells for this poster photoshoot.&&My hope coming out of seeing the first one was that there would be a super overly violent opening scene where Deadpool has to break him out of prison after the police found the body in his trunk&&Wasn't he in the debut trailer?&&He's in the trailer, no worries&&He was in the trailer&&You don’t have to be fat to enjoy tater tots. &&Has anyone had tater tots made from other vegetables, like cauliflower? Are they as demonic as they sound?&&*heavy breathing intensifies* &&Hey Napoleon! Gimme some of your 'Tots!&&I wouldn't put that past Deadpool.&&My co-worker thought they were pills.&&I didn't know I wanted to be showered in tater tots until I read this.&&I thought they would be Tide pods&&And he's KILLING like he's never killed before.
&&That song will be in the trailer in some way, calling it now. &&Naw... just Deadpool.&&Cue the rap

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBcehv2Xh8o&&Thank you!&&What will happen if Cable meets Thanos? Deadpool would definitely have something to say about that.&&>risky business

No, this is Flashdance&&Why's everyone saying May is a risky month to release something?

Edit: Oh cool, can't wait for May :3&&Oh shit now Deadpool has to do a Risky Business poster...Wade in half his suit in his underwear dancing in a hallway.&&tbh I grew up in the 90s and watched a fuckton of movies and even the movie referenced in the poster but my brain just forgot until I read someone explaining it&&Mind explaining because it seems familiar but I have no clue what the poster is referencing &&But you didn’t even explain it’s a Flashdance reference! Stop shirking your duty&&You're like a *messiah* for us 2000s kids (now adults...*officially*)&&I AM an 80s kid and knew it was Flashdance.  If there is an ad of Deadpool with leg warmers I’m going to lose it.&&This is one of those things where I've never seen the movie it came from, but I've seen this scene spoofed by so many other pieces of media that I knew exactly what the poster was going for. &&Deadpool marketing is beginning! Does this mean we are getting a real trailer soon?&&Well now I feel old.&&Don’t believe /u/TooShiftyForYou, we all know which [movie this comes from](https://i.giphy.com/media/LJxcXF8d5he0w/giphy.gif)&&I had feeling it was referencing something. Thanks. &&And considering the lyrics of the song in the scene for the original movie, it's really a perfect spoof :)


He doesn't mean a thing to me, just another pretty face to see
He's all over town, knocking 'em down, honey
I'd never let him next to me

Oh he's the kind of guy who thinks he's smart
He's the type that always looks the part
He's on the make, it's undertake, honey
An' I never let him touch my heart

Right now, ask me if I care, look, it's coming closer, oh I'll swear
He's got to be the toughest guy I've ever seen
I can't believe he's lookin' at me
He's a dream

He didn't mean to catch my eye, well he's lucky, he just walked on by
'Cos he hasn't met a girl like me, are you kiddin'
Well I tell him that I'd rather die

Right now, ask me if I care, look, it's coming closer, oh I'll swear
He's got to be the toughest guy I've ever seen
I can't believe he's lookin' at me
He's a a a (he's a dream)
(He's a dream) tonight (he's a dream) oh I know
(He's a dream) Okay (well he's a dream)

Right now, ask me if I care, look, it's coming closer, oh I'll swear
He's got to be the toughest guy I've ever seen
I can't believe he's lookin' at me

Right now, ask me if I care, look, it's coming closer, oh I'll swear
He's got to be the toughest guy I've ever seen
I can't believe he's lookin' at me
He's a dream&&Maniac is a great song with [a great video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DN37VU0zKs)&&Jennifer Beals was hot as hell in that movie.&&>Bein’s believing&&Ugh, stupid genius marketing&&Such a clean outfit&&Red doesn't show blood.&&That would be as brilliant for Deadpool as it would be for Tide, if it was. &&yes&&Well, the difference IMO is that Deadpool advertisements are regarded as art and a piece of culture, in contrast with pushing products and consumerism. No one is clapping when McDonalds French Fries appear on the big screen&&I'm 26 and I only know of it due to the scene being parodied in everything from Dexter's Lab to Family Guy.

Still haven't seen Flashdance. &&If they somehow managed to find a way to parody the first movie’s posters, it would be glorious.&&I don’t think you have to hope, just expect it&&Idk why but I had to read this sentence at least 10 times before I understood what you were saying.&&More like a brass shower. &&And it's not called ""Deadpool 2"" - the official name is ""Untitled Deadpool Sequel"", which is fantastic.&&https://www.chanti.nl/pictBig/2/236480-0.jpg&&Feels like it's trying too hard &&Christ I really hope not &&I’ve seen a number of people who share that opinion, you’re not alone.&&G L O R I O U S&&Please god let Moviepass stay in business until then.&&And a week before Solo, which could cut its legs.&&> They're really confident with this I guess

I'd hope so - Deadpool is really the ONLY super hero movie that genuinely surprised anyone since this trend started and truthfully the only superhero franchise that caters exclusively to the adult audience with it's R rating.

I watch basically all the super hero movies out there and enjoy them all ""enough"". Some more than others, but they don't really excite me any more. 

Deadpool is exciting, different and refreshing. &&Not gonna lie, I'd rather go see Deadpool during opening weekend and those other movies a few weeks afterwards to avoid their crowds.  I'm sure all three of those movies will do well, and there's a chance they may feed off of each other.

Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, if I had those options there's a good chance I'd try to go see two of them in one day (as long as I had the time and money to do so).&&Well... Deadpool’s girlfriend is Thanos’ motivation for going after the infinity gauntlet so ... Deadpool Deuce is maybe actually Infinity War 1.5 ... or maybe I’m just mixing universes in a too hopeful way again ...  https://i.imgur.com/Fu4lcgz.jpg &&There's more, but they won't make as much as those 3.&&June hits hard not too long afterwards with Incredibles 2 and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.&&I already have three Saturdays planned out in may.&&Tyler Perry’s Madea 19 probably&&Dude same, my movie theater is a dine in too so we have even that much more to do. Bittersweet is the perfect descriptor.&&Seeing the movies for free isn't even as extravagant as I thought it would be, because a lot of the time I don't want to go to work on my day off and overall I think it's resulted in me seeing way less films. &&Not really. Ocean's 8 and Deadpool wouldn't really share an audience. Same with The Incredibles, although that would come 2 weeks later And Jurassic World 2 wouldn't have released 3 weeks after by which point Deadpool 2 would have made bulk of its money.&&Thank you [MultiPass!!](https://medias.spotern.com/spots/w640/3477.jpg)&&Are you also the friend with MoviePass who has to convince his friends without MoviePass to see the movies in 2d? I have one buddy who is a real hardass about seeing shit in 3d. Like dude, I am not paying full price for 3d if I can see it in 2d for free.&&This so much. I couldn't **live** without my **MoviePass**!&&He originally first talked about the quote in a review with the Latino Review in 2009, saying

>Ya, I love the character. I’ve always loved the character. I remember reading one of the Deadpool comic books, and somebody asked Deadpool what he looks like. And he said he [looks like a cross between a Shar-Pei and Ryan Reynolds](https://imgur.com/9vnBu15). And I was like, I really, really wanna play this guy at some point. I thought it was pretty cool. It’s a guy that knows he’s in a comic book. &&For a while before Hawkeye joined the MCU I wanted him to play Hawkeye if the character was ever going to be in a comic book movie.&&I like to pretend that Van Wilder is the same character in an alternate timeline.&&It definitely helped. He plays the role exceptionally.&&How much of Ryan Reynold's success is raw talent and how much is just advantageous bone structure?&&I dunno about Deadpool, but that Ryan Reynolds sure didn't.&&I think actor choice could make or break the role or just kinda sit there in meh territory but Ryan Reynolds blew it out of the water with how well he plays Deadpool.&&I really can't think of very many actors who could do the role as well. I was fully expecting the movie to be cringy and not done well and was pleasantly surprised and I think Ryan Reynolds acting plays a big part in how good the movie was for me &&Well... it could be Keira Knightley - she's got range.  &&I assume the entire thing is CGI.&&When Deadpool was created Ryan Renolds was 15 years old so probably not.&&When did that come out? Reynolds was playing Deadpool back in 2009ish so this could've just been a reference to that.&&> Ryan Renolds

It bothers me they spelled it Renolds&&Huh, so that's what Batou looked like before his cybernetic eyes.&&A Deadpool-Tide cross-over would be funny if Tide went for cleaning bloody bullet holes out of your red and black gimp suit.&&This will happen within a month, I guarantee.&&""It's okay that you didn't wear the brown pants, there's no stains here.""&&Waiting for the next big Oscar worthy British Victoria-era drama about transgender butlers marrying aristocrats with cancer is gonna be DOPE AS FUCK if they end up being Deadpool films somehow. Especially if Badersnoot Crimblebaff is playing the lead and turns out to be Doctor Strange the whole time. 

Imagine if like a quarter of the way through the film, it turns out that Doctor Strange was thrown through time and stuck in the 1700’s England, living as an aristocrat, Deadpool and Cable show up out of nowhere because they can and hijack the film into chaos. Deadpool ends up King of England and America never gets created. &&You know this will turn into product placement adds inside other adds though&&Tweet them and make it happen.&&Yes. He also stole Jasmine from Aladdin & showed up on the rock instead on Ariel.&&Yep, you can see them all [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbM84jGi20U)&&""Get your own movie...""&&Anyone have a link for this please? Would love to see it!&&>Then in some other trailer for a different movie show him getting shot up and looking at his clean self and then holds up a Tide pod and all he says is meta before he eats the pod. 

It was all good until this part. That's pure concentrated cringe&&Well then, I am not disappointed&&619 +-5 shells to be exact





~~Yes I counted them, so what?!~~&&[You're goddamn right.](https://imgur.com/a/M26Xy)

Juggernaut's back too.&&After he's done disposing off Bandhu&&Correct, that comes later!&&But it helps&&You don’t have to be an ass to be fat. &&They aren't bad but not really equal either. The cauliflower has a mushier texture. &&The broccoli cheese ones are amazing. &&I really like them! But I really like cauliflower in general. If you don't like cauliflower, you're not going to like it shaped like tator tots. &&No, go find you own!&&It’s actually a tide poster&&Perhaps [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsgTn6qbbis)? (nsfw)&&Sounds like a fucking franchise&&Disappointed it isn't like a mid nineties-ish rap song about the plot of the movie.&&>Deadpool would definitely have something to say about that

Oh shit, since you've given them an idea, someone's going to post an awfully awful Deadpool line, aren't they?&&Cable would get rekt.&&I’d love it if they packaged trailer to directly follow Avengers teaser if Thanos is still last shot of that - and Deadpool starts with a joke about dating Death who Thanos is crazy about &&Well Dr Strange met Dormammu and both were played by bumblesnitch clumserswac&&It would be like Megadeth Sweating Bullets...hello me this is the real me!&&No, this is Patrick!!&&Because Solo and Infinity War are also releasing in May&&Everyone here is a film analyst. &&Same. I remember the poster style, just couldn't recall which movie it was. I first thought it's Dirty Dancing.&&[Flashdance](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/df/b6/a9/dfb6a9194b26fa53aa2fad64a075115b--movie-poster-db-film-posters.jpg)&&I think it's referencing Flashdance (1983).&&Yes please&&Technically. I've got a few months yet.&&Fuck you, youth! *cries in mid-20s despair&&I remember it being [parodied on Dexter's Lab](https://youtu.be/AGhKcqjD2so) 16 years ago.&&Don't forget Tommy Boy. Farley's gas station dance to ""I'm a Maniac"". That's the earliest reference I can remember.&&There are so many things from the simpsons that I latter saw the thing they were Parodying and had that oooohhhh moment. This movie and scene are one of them &&Valentine’s Day apparently.&&Deadpool trailers are the best. They give away zero plot points.&&Experienced...  Experienced was the word you were looking for. Right?   Right? 

Oh, God, I am old. &&I...didn’t even consider that this wasn’t common knowledge. Pass the Geritol...I’ll need an extra spoonful.&&What a feeling.&&When isn't Deadpool referencing something? ;P&&There goes my knowledge of 80s pop&&Stupid sexy Flanders &&Seltzer water and lemon doesn’t compare to tide&&Brown pants are the secret.&&But also fate? &&If your clapping for a movie, I hope you are with the actors, otherwise you may need to reevaluate movies as somehow above consumerism.

They are the both part of our culture and consumerism. Art, sadly, is subjective.&&Yeah 3 younger guys at my work were talking about old movies they never seen and we quizzed them on some 80s movies. Heres what the results of that were:

The Breakfast Cub: Heard of it but havent seen it

The Goonies: Never heard of it

Gremlins: 2 heard of it never saw it, 1 never heard of it

Back To The Future: Heard of it because its such a huge hit. 2 had seen it. 1 never saw any of them

Pretty In Pink: Never heard of it

Point Break: 1 heard of it before the remake and loves it. 2 only know it becasue of the remake

Ferris Buellers Day Off: All heard of it none seen it

Footloose: Never heard of it

Lost Boys: Never heard of it

Weird Science: Never heard of it. 

and pretty much any Feldman/Haim movie they had no clue. Plus and smaller films that became cult hits like 3oclock High, Cant Buy Me Love, The Burbs, Critters, Goblins, Fright Night... Nothing. They had no clue. &&I probably needed some punctuation somewhere in there&&Tho that this thing aint not gunna do&&Even better. Good gooooood&&NO I WON’T GIVE IN&&#G L O R I O U S&&I imagine the ven diagram of deadpool and pro wrestling fans is a circle&&It will. In the UK all the cinemas are doing it (there are only a handful of national chains) and it's been profitable as hell for them.&&When you cancel your subscription you can’t resubscribe for another 9 months...I cancelled in Dec because I hadn’t used it at all since August :(&&Please don't tell me it's tanking.&&The R rating on Untitled Deadpool Sequel will probably work in its favour to keep it safe from the other two&&Its the summer, people will see all of them. &&Don't forget though: all 3 of these movies are being distributed by the same parent company. 

https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2/&&They'll just grow back&&There is literally 0 chance that Solo does better than DP2. 0. &&It’s pretty gutsy to release the film so close to a Marvel and Star Wars summer release, but perhaps people go to the movies more frequently on summer break? Wonder why they’d choose that particular slot.&&I don't get why everyone's freaking out about a Solo movie. So many better characters to give a solo movie to before him.&&I dunno, BvS really surprised me with how absolutely mediocre it was&&Logan was rated R and a huge departure from previous X-men and Wolverine movies. Iirc it’s up for an Oscar. Patrick Stewart hard carries that movie but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Like Deadpool, it had a unique perspective on the genre and made us relate to something other than the hero’s girlfriend or dead parent(s). 

I also watch pretty much all superhero movies and TV shows. I wasn’t excited for Logan and it doesn’t need a sequel but I would put it with Deadpool in superhero movies that gambled and won. Anyway, I’m gonna fuck off and rewatch Logan because you just reminded me how much I love it. &&Is that real? I thought thanos was in love with death or some shit like that? He wants to kill everyone so death loves him or something, and that's why he wants the infinity gauntlet.&&Am I wrong to think that Thanos is in love with Thor's sister Hela? She seems to be the goddess of death in Thor: Ragnorok. Just curious...&&[Heh](https://youtu.be/3eZBevXohCI?t=28s)&&[deleted]&&> hits hard

Just serve bourbon and fresh chocolate chip cookies only. People will still come.&&My theater has a bar. So I can’t see anything opening night, I have so much more to deal with, and I have to deal with the occasional drunk. But I save a lot of money so it’s fine, I’m fine &&Why do you think oceans 8 and Deadpool 2 won't share an audience? I worked at a theater when Deadpool 1 released and the wildest thing was that EVERYONE was seeing Deadpool. From ages 10-100. Men and women in equal numbers too. &&I will see both movies. There’s your shared audience. &&my wife and i both want to see both O8 and Dp2.&&Relax, Leeloo&&Nah that one isn't me. I hate movies in 3d. It just doesn't add to the enjoyment at all.&&#MoviePass ^TM &&And we are all glad you were wrong&&What if Deadpool plays Hawkeye, would that work for you?&&If they had Hawkeye closer to how he was in the comics, Reynolds would be a solid choice.&&I always thought Ryan Reynolds would make a great Flash (Wally West).&&I see Hawkeye as a more down on his luck sort of guy thanks to the Matt Fraction run which I really like. I could see Ryan Gosling doing the hapless yet still hot and talented version version of him. &&And thus, 'Topless Tutors' was born. &&I can only hope there are deleted scenes or at least casting outtakes with her reading for Cable.&&How old was Ryan in Van Wilder (irl)?&&Yeah maybe not, but maybe they saw the familiarity afterwards :)&&Yeah, but Cable and Deadpool started in 2004.&&Deadpool was very, very different when Liefeld created him. He didn't really start taking shape until Joe Kelly's run in the late 90s. Timelines still don't match up, but just adding a bit of info.&&It wasn't, that comic is from 2004 (Cable & Deadpool, awesome comic btw).&&Let's not remember that movie ever existed.

I'm trying to forget about it.&&If I'm not mistaken, his brothers were big fans of the character and showed him this panel, and that's what introduced him to the character.&&It's on purpose. They also spelt Tom Cruise as Thom Cruise in an arc where Deadpool was cursed to look like him. &&Deadpool's only weakness are the forbidden Tide Pods

This is gonna be the best May EVER!&&Infinity War comes out 2 weeks before whatever the hell they’re calling the Deadpool sequel (I’m not kidding, Fox said that it’s still untitled), so the people that are going to see “Untitled Deadpool Sequel” (that’s what Fox is calling it until we get an official title) will have already seen Infinity War. As for Solo, it’s most likely going to be rated PG-13 (opposed to Deadpool, which is obviously going to be rated R), meaning that parents will take their kids to see it, and also it’s Star Wars.&&You know you're young when you're in your mid 20s and think you're not young anymore&&/r/me_irl&&What the fuck lol&&I can't believe you remember that specific scene from a show so old!

Edit - I'll honor this as long as you make it clear that you'll take me up on it&&Never tell me the odds!&&Solo may perform below expectations if it gets bad word of mouth like TLJ did which performed way below what Disney was hoping.  People will start to get burnt out on Star Wars, too many in too short of a time.&&See, I appreciate that you said it was mediocre and not the worst wovie ever made like everybody else. It was not a good movie, and it was not a bad movie. I however enjoyed it for reasons that only make since to me.&&Yeah, in the comics Deadpool dated death for quite a long time. Then he got tired of her, and married the queen of hell... The queen of hell just so happens to live in the sewers under New York City.

Comic Books are weird. Anyway, the whole Thanos-Deadpool dynamic is actually pretty fun, there have been several stories written around it.&&This is correct, but Deadpool has also been somewhat romantically involved with Death in the comics, so I imagine that’s what he’s referring to, and not the movie girlfriend. This even made Thanos so mad he cursed Deadpool with eternal life so that Deadpool couldn’t die and hook up with Death.&&Deadpool dates death &&Yea, in the comics Thanos is born an ugly little pacifist who eventually becomes an angsty little nihilist who naturally falls in love with the physical embodiment of death (Mistress Death), and then starts killing people to impress her. Eventually he tries to start a family and build a new life for himself, but Mistress Death visits him again, so he murders his entire family and goes off to try and collect the infinity stones and kill literally everyone.&&Yep.

I thought those all had really awesome, unique styles and premises that didn't ""fit"" in what most super hero movies have become these days. 

I haven't honestly enjoyed any of DC's newer stuff. Man of Steel was fun but I have a really hard time re-watching it. BvS I struggled to finish. Suicide Squad was like watching a train wreck.... 

I REALLY wanted to enjoy Wonder Woman, especially with all the praise it got - and while I thought it started out super strong, I really disliked just about everything after she got to the city. 

I feel like these days DC is trying really hard to compete with Marvel on the same style of movie making and it's just not working well at all IMHO. &&I disagree. It was an objectively bad movie. It completely assassinated Batman and Lex Luthor’s characters, had an absurdly nonsensical plot, and the trailer completely ruined the twist, so everyone saw it coming and it wasn’t surprising. Not to mention that they blew one of Superman’s biggest nemeses in a complete throwaway fashion.

I do think George being out of the picture kinda muddied the universe and its kinda lost its soul.  People have been reminded (perhaps for the better) that they are just movies.  That aught to be enough to kickstart the waning of interest in new films.&&B A N K R U P T C Y&&I'll never forget that poor doggo next to the swimming pool.&&I think Ryan Reynolds has just done such an amazing job, seemingly fitting the character perfectly and effortlessly, which makes it terrifying to picture anyone else in the role.

But Tony stark and Robby J have become synonymous at this point, as he has disappeared into the role (I sometimes say Tony stark in response to ""who is the actor that plays iron man?"") 

It's a credit to these actors and is a load of fun to watch.&&Yeah I actually really like what he did with hawkeye. In the first avengers movie he wasn't written very well.

Like, in Macaulay Culkin's AMA he talked about wanting to play Longshot, my wheels started turning on the obvious movie: Deadpool 3: Deadpool Goes to Mojoworld.

No way people go to all three with the summer slump the box office has seen the last few years.&&To be fair though, that’s Episode VIII, not a Star Wars spin-off. I’d wager that more people have seen TLJ than Rogue One.

It's true, it can be very hard to separate an actor from a recurring role, but it can be done and even very well. There have been three major versions of the classic Hannibal Lecter character; played by Anthony Hopkins, Mads Mikkelsen and Brian Cox. And the greatest thing about it, is exactly how different their takes on such an iconic character were, all of them came off as intelligent, charming and terrifying in their own way, not trying to emulate each other.&&It's like envisioning Hugh Jackman not being the man who's playing Wolverine.&&Well Thanos is the reason Deadpool can't die... so that would be appropriate.&&Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe, but this... does put a smile on my face.&&Is?&&WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

Question though - Is Han Solo a bigger draw than stealing the Death Star plans?  I think Rogue One's trailers were really strong, they really made Felicity Jones' character interesting.

I'd still see the movies in an alternate universe where their roles were reversed, but I'm glad I don't live in it.&&You know, that's how I view the joker, and I think it's unfortunate that people grabbed on to Heath Ledgers joker in such a way they couldn't see the beauty in a new take my a different actor.

If you look at Ledgers joker, he departed from most of the comics in a drastic way, carving his own version of the villain. It seemed as though the joker versions were following a similar path as your reference to Hannibal Lector, having ledger not try to emulate, say, Jack Nicholson, but instead taking the role to a new place. 

Jared Leto's joker was a new step, as he carved yet again his own path, as opposed to trying to walk in Ledgers shoes. I think this was the right choice, and I loved his take on the joker, basing it off of certain comic books and adding a new take on a legend. Unfortunately, rather than enjoying this different spin as you have with a different movie, audiences condemned him, holding the joker in general to the standard created by Ledger, which not only isn't fair, but it takes away from the entire point of multiple actors playing the same character, being to add their own, new spin. 

I wish we could see a batman v joker movie with Leto and Affleck, if for nothing else than the weird shit Leto would send batman in the mail off set. Doesn't seem like it'll happen, but here's hoping. &&Thanks for clueing me into that...Googled it and learned all about it.

Buster Keaton gets rejected by a hatcheck girl without a word being spoken in Seven Chances (1925),76488,7vl262,https://i.imgur.com/o0RWXp1.gifv,1624,1517893366.0,,"x-post r/silentmoviegifs

For some context, the plot of Seven Chances involves Buster's character inheriting $7 million, but only if he can get married by the end of the day. 

First he's just going up to random women and proposing marriage with no luck, but then the news of his situation gets out and a mob of women start chasing him.

&&My college experience wrapped up in one gif &&People who think Silent Movie Acting was always ""unnatural"" or theatrically overblown need to see more wonderful performances like this.&&I wonder why she went with the short necklace.&&I know it's sort of a meme at this point, but I really wish more mainstream movies had enough confidence in their viewers to just rely on visual cues like this instead of over explaining every scene. &&Silent zoned again&&Buster Keaton was such a legend. The absurd acts he would do would have to be taken in one shot,If not,He would scrap it. He wanted the audience to believe that those antics are real. If it has to be rehearsed or perfected,It's not real. 

P.S. He never repeated the same act. Much of his antics like a heavy object falling but the object has holes just big enough to not affect the person upon which the object is falling are still used today. &&So much said without any words. Superb. &&I went to a popular club in Gangnam called Octagon.  That is how every woman rejected me that night.  Lol it was hilarious.  Still had a ball dancing.   And I ended up getting fucked anyway, by the club's drink prices.&&My brother was almost named Buster after him. But I like the name Keaton to honor him.&&I've been meaning to actually sit down and watch a Buster Keaton film for a while now. Looks like there are a handful on Amazon Prime, but they don't appear on any of the ""Buster Keaton's top films!"" lists that pop up on google. Anyone got recommendations? Here's what's on Amazon right now: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dprime-instant-video&field-keywords=buster+keaton&&Part of me wishes there were still some silent feature films in modern times. I remember watching the opening scene of Suckerpunch (the pinnacle of film, I know) and loving the way they conveyed so much without the use of words, wishing the whole movie would continue down that path. Another time when I was watching Wall-E for the first time my soundbar was having issues and I thought it was supposed to be silent for a good 15-20 minutes or so, and I thought it was fantastic. When you take away such a cornerstone of plot conveyance, the aspects of cinematography need to be more carefully considered and put together in a calculated and meaningful way that to me often comes off more powerfully. (thinking back now, Fantasia was also one of my favorites as a kid)

Are there any modern movies out there that are silent or have minimal talking? I was really excited for Shape of Water originally, knowing the main character was mute, but they didn't really play off that any in the movie.&&[deleted]&&r/watchpeopledieinside&&We should always appreciate limitations, they have given us some great things, such as actors like Buster and Chaplin, great games like the original Pokemon Games that had to be tirelessly optimized to fit on such a small cartridge and films such as the Cube and The Man from Earth that had a low budget and required one location shooting. 

By removing technology, or money or schedules we have had some amazing experiences, it makes the creators think hard about what is possible with current means. We are getting to be a world of little limitations causing everything to become non optimized and not interesting.&&TIL I learned ""hatcheck"" is one word.&&Aubrey Plaza has a lot of range.&&she’s actually very beautiful. wow.....&&Sporting that Louise Brooks style bob cut, which in the 1920s was damn near like having a mohawk.

Weird request, but I’ve always been curious&&Funny enough I had a moment like this happen to me in real life but in addition to the head shake, I flash my wedding ring for assurance that the guy gets the picture. &&That almost disapproving *glare* makes my heart throb.&&Not pictured: Buster going home and posting an 800-word no-punctuation diatribe on Facebook about how women don't want nice guys like him.&&Waiting for  the incels to call her a bitch for rejecting a nice guy.&&Is it me, or the girl reminds me of Aubrey Plaza?&&Well if she doesn't want him, I'll take him!&&/r/me_irl

It is just *so good*.  Buster was an absolute genius, and his comedic timing was impeccable. The plot is simple and easy to follow, but it has great pacing and builds masterfully. The jokes are hilarious the secondary characters are dynamic and believable. It's fun, exciting, brilliantly written and acted, and it's short.  I see no reason why anyone that enjoys movies should pass up the chance to see this. Especially if they think they don't like silent movies.&&Three Stooges short with Shemp did this too.&&[removed]&&""If I had a dollar for every girl that found me unattractive, they would eventually find me attractive""&&That's legitimately a good movie plot, especially considering the era&&Look at Mr Fancypants - going to a college with a hatcheck.&&In my case it would be something like this: https://imgur.com/gallery/dFRX9HG

[Buster Keaton - The Art of the Gag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWEjxkkB8Xs)&&Aka literally any other silent performance from Buster Keaton.  Absolutely the king of understated comedy at the time.  &&O man there is a relevant video out there that I can’t find. Peter Weller (original robocop) is giving a interview/ lecture to a class or group of people about the creation of robocop- particularly the mechanics of his movements. 

They originally had him training to do all these cool fluid martial art motions (typical 80s action stuff) but Weller was having a extra tough time with the suit and at some point there was a breakdown. One of the main guys- might’ve been the director- told Weller to watch this silent movie (I think it was a silent Dracula film). The actor who portrayed Dracula was overblown as you say, but Weller was soon mesmerized by his movements which told so much. I think he said it was the best acting he had ever seen. They decided that that’s what robocop needed. Not the fluid movements but the big gestures and movements that are reminiscent of the silent movie era where motion was the primary dialogue.

Anyway it worked beautifully and Robocop became iconic. (I was born after the movie but I was nuts for robocop as a kid and still get amped when I hear the main track)&&Aw yeah time to bust out my boy Tony! 

[Every Frame a Painting: Buster Keaton- The Art of the Gag](https://youtu.be/UWEjxkkB8Xs) &&That's one of the things that I love about Keaton: As well as doing the [big stunts](https://i.imgur.com/TAtVE1p.gifv) and gags that he's most famous for, he was also brilliant at smaller scale, [more subtle comedic moments](https://i.imgur.com/79iPb8m.gifv).

He was like a magician who could do spectacular illusions and closeup magic equally well. &&There's tons of silent movies that are overlooked by many simple because of this stereotype. Like, the silent Phantom of the Opera from 1925/1929 (its like a mash up) is considered the best phantom of the opera film to this day.&&It made me want to watch more. &&I need a Venn diagram of 'People who think Silent Movie Acting was always ""unnatural"" or theatricality overblown' and 'People who Reddit'.&&sidenote: personally I don't even get why ""unnatural"" acting is generally considered bad by (seemingly?) so many. it's not a documentary, but a feature film.

(and who doesn't love things like actors and actresses ""hamming it up"" for certain movies or scenes?)
&&This scene seems unnatural and overacted to me.&&Someone bring back silent movies but for movies like *Lucky Number Slevin*, *Jack Reacher* and *The Mist*&&How do you go about finding silent movies?&&Probably because she went with the long hair.&&Man in RotJ when the emperor is electrocuting Luke and Vader is torn between helping him or not, you can tell just by the cinematography that he is torn, even through his mask.

 In the Blu Ray version they added audio of him saying ""No... No...."" While debating on who to help.It's like the smallest change that irritated me the most. It's almost like they think we're stupid. &&Mad men did, and it was glorious. Adult drama by and for adults. &&The first version often does. Then you screen it to test audiences and find 60% don’t get it. So you make it a little less subtle, you lose a little charm and that number goes down to 30%. So you make it obvious and the number goes down to 15%, and by this point it’s lost its charm completely and your publisher is still complaining that some people are finding it incomprehensible. So you say “fuck it, we’ll do better next time,” and you give in and beat people around the head with the plot and the themes.&&And then people who need to constantly ask questions during a movie go bonkers. I love it when my girlfriend asks about a scene and all I say is to watch and find out. Of course of there is an actual missing piece of information we go back to catch it 😀. Game of thrones is a recent show that I've seen has little foreknowledge along the way. &&Hah. Yeah. My favorite trope is when there is a running commentary by the main characters on everything that's happening. &&Suggestions, unsaid things, ellipses are what separates a good movie from a bad movie. Subtle things are always better than over showing or explaining in a scene or a movie. 
 &&I mean, watching and complaining about mainstream movies is a bit like only listening to pop music and asking for different motifs.

That being said, there are plenty of mainstream films that are well done, and follow the “show, don’t tell” rule.&&The main reason I can't watch most anime&&There's a great episode of Every Frame A Painting analysing Edgar Wright's use of visual storytelling within comedy. They explain that the majority of modern comedy is just lightly edited improv whereas they show, with examples, how Wright can wring a laugh through editing and shot selection, *AND* advance the plot without a word being spoken.&&>over explaining every scene.



Only bad movies do this.&&In a couple of years there will be dissertations written about silent movies comeback in the age of gifs.&&> Buster Keaton was such a legend

Buster Keaton **is** such a legend. I don’t see any reason he should stop being a legend.&&Its like daredevil meets improv!&&Keaton is one of my favorite actors. He carried so many movies with such a presence, all the while basically performing an acrobatic circus act with the stoic gaze of a man caught up in situations he had no business in, and directing everything himself. 

But these moments are where his real genius shone through. 

I hear everyone saying Chaplin's the GOAT from his era, but I'll always be a proud Keaton supporter in that debate.&&The best actors dont need words. Really though, their body language and facial expressions are enough to convey most everything. There are some cases where the voice adds a lot like with the Joker but the greatest performances ive seen have had some long periods of silence.&&#&&Upvote for Octagon!&&> And I ended up getting fucked anyway,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QmMHu1mhLE&&Strangely enough, one of the last films Buster Keaton made, and his last silent film, was a film for the National Film Board of Canada in 1965 called ""The Railroader"" and it's free on the NFB website.
https://www.nfb.ca/film/railrodder/&&I'm no expert but there's one called 'the cameraman' which is quite good.

Also a Twilight Zone episode he made when was older which is entertaining. &&Fair warning, The General has some neat moments but feels long and slow - I don't really care for it, even though I do like his shorts and Chaplin and Lloyd's features. I'd recommend Keaton shorts first actually, Cops! Is a good one.

YouTube link of decent quality https://youtu.be/jCp5ggu0Rh4&&The Artist from several years ago was a primarily silent movie (and about silent movies). There's also a fantastic documentary called Baraka from the 1990s which -- except for one scene in a foreign language -- is full of silent images. The only real sound you hear is an instrumental Philip Glass score.

And though not a silent movie, the first 15 minutes of There Will Be Blood has no dialogue. So when you hear the first words spoken, it's kind of a jolt.&&Not a movie, but I immediately think of a season 4 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer that’s mostly silent: “Hush”. May sound lame but a highlight in modern tv nonetheless, definitely recommended.&&You should check out The triplets of Belleville. It's animated movie from 2003. It's basically silent movie and great example of 'show don't tell' principle. I think it was nominated for 2 Oscars. &&Drive has very little dialogue and has a killer soundtrack.&&There’s also the Mel Brooks classic, ‘Silent movie’.  The only line js spoken by Marcel Marceau. &&> Are there any modern movies out there that are silent or have minimal talking? I was really excited for Shape of Water originally, knowing the main character was mute, but they didn't really play off that any in the movie.    

• A great deal of Guy Maddin’s work is near-silent, and he also often recreates common visual aesthetics of silent-era films in exciting ways. My favorite might be the short but sweet (just over an hour-long) *Cowards Bend the Knee* (2003), or *Dracula: Pages from a Virgin’s Diary* (2002)  
• *The Turin Horse* (2011) – Bela Tarr  
• *Le Dernier Combat* (1983) – Luc Besson  
• *La Antena* (2007) – Esteban Sapir  
• *Begotten* (1990) – E. Elias Merhige  
• *Tuvalu* (1999) – Veit Helmer  
• *Into Great Silence* (2005) – Philip Gröning  
• *All Is Lost* (2013) – J. C. Chandor  
• *Juha* (1999) – Aki Kaurismaki  
• *Hukkle* (2002) – György Pálfi  
• *After the Apocalypse* (2004) – Yasuaki Nakajima

Inheriting things happens. Some parents, grandparents, uncles or aunts are unreasonably hung up on getting their bachelor relatives married. It's not such a leap to come up with a plot idea where this leads to a testament with marriage as a condition for inheritance, and fiction logic at the very least - I'm not certain it'd play out like that IRL - demands that this causes potential suitors to toss themselves in droves at the beneficiary of the inheritance to get a chance of that sweet sweet cash.

So much was said, even though no words were uttered.&&Watch the scene in RotJ when Luke is captured and turned over to Vader.

When he gets off the lift with the officer and troopers, he makes eye contact (so to speak) with Vader. While the officer is talking, Vader and Luke are focused on each other, and the officer isn't even in the shot. We hear him, but just get closeups of Luke and Vader. When the troopers and officer leave, Vader starts walking down the hall and Luke doesn't hesitate, just starts walking alongside him.

Luke is showing confidence, but it's not genuine. He's *acting* confident. When he finally gets to the ""that's why you won't take me to the Emperor now"" bit he has to turn away. Outward confidence, but inward doubt. When Vader tells him ""there is no conflict,"" the confident exterior is gone. Just a little bit of change in facial expression and tone and a lot is communicated.&&> It's almost like they think we're stupid.

Their major money making demographics are.&&I think it’s because movies now sometimes rely on you not figuring things out for yourself. For example, if you watch Captain America: Civil War and only rely on what you’re told then you’ll come out of it feeling like Cap was the best and Tony was out of line. 

Now if you watch the movie and take note of everything going on you’ll probably come out of it feeling like Cap went way too far and Tony was justified.

And since Cap is “the best” and marvel needs him to remain being “the best” they can’t have people making their own assumptions. You just have to know that Cap is a “nice guy” and Tony is not a nice guy. &&They do think we're stupid. And most of the time they're right.&&Not a movie, but in Halo 4, at the end a character says something to Master Chief that has a reference back to something Cortana had told him.

No one said we don't have creative people doing worthwhile things now.   
   
Working within limits can help foster creativity, that's a fairly uncontroversial statement and millions of artists would happily tell you that. 
  
You just have to look at something like *South Park*, where the creators started off with one idea and couldn't get it past the censors, so came up with things far worse and far funnier which *did* make it past the censors.  
  
Compare *Star Wars* IV—VI to I—III.

I'd love to see how he went about approaching all the scenes.&&To me theatrical would mean playing a scene in a very broad way, with a lot of dramatic gestures etc. A lot of early movie actors had come from theatre, where they were used to performing so that even the people in the back rows of a 1,000 seat theatre could see what they were doing.

As an example of a more ""theatrical"" take on Joan of Arc, here's Geraldine Farrar in [Joan the Woman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zUNhZ-RqsOo) from 1916.

The performance in Passion of Joan of Arc is certainly very intense, but I don't think it really fits with the stereotype of what silent film acting was like. It's a much more [natural performance](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C4_KDf4xhU8) to the extent that some people think that Dreyer may have pushed his actress to the breaking point to achieve it, though I don't think there's really any conclusive evidence on that.&&The word is being used in the sense of “performed as if this was a play in a theater “ rather than a film. Stage actors spend their careers being taught to project- to play to the back of the house- with both their voice and with their gestures. You cannot be subtle on most stages or it just won’t read to the audience. 

This makes for a very grand, over the top style of acting. When film became a thing, most of these new movie stars had learned how to act on a stage and so in a lot of older films the actors look a bit like caricatures to us now. Film is so much more up close and personal; a single eyebrow raise or jaw clench or a little hum can tell you so much about the character, their relationships etc., so much that would just not have been easy to convey on the stage. 

However it seems like most actors and a lot of filmmakers took a long time to catch up to this new sort of era of subtlety and realism that the nature of film allowed, and continued in this very over the top, over enunciated, over gestured way. As far as the filmmaking side goes, you’ll see so many older films that were shot as if it was a play being performed on a stage- one or two camera angles, from the audience point of view (a lot like today’s sitcoms). 


So many older films turn me off for this reason, even though I actually really love theater (both acting and watching). It’s because I see them as two distinct mediums I guess, that *generally* (not always) don’t do well when mixed. When you go and see a play, no you don’t get to see all the subtleties of the face and body (unless you’re extremely close) but you get strong commanding performances that show off the actor’s ability as a *performer,* and more importantly you get live energy- everyone in the room, actors and audience, are all part of this thing together. As a stage actor (*very* small time) I know how much the audience matters on any given night- you feed off their energy, what they’re laughing at, how they’re reacting, and you find yourself giving some line reads/interpretations you’ve never even thought to give in all your time rehearsing, but it just clicks right then and it’s all happening right there in the moment. It’s just dynamic and exhilarating for both sides. 

With a film you obviously don’t get any of that raw energy, that interaction, so when a film is shot and acted in the style of a play it often falls very flat; but on the other hand, what you do get (when it is used to its potential) is that close up subtlety and realism, like the actor is not performing *for you* but rather *you’ve* been sort of dropped in to secretly watch their life, from all angles, wherever they go. And that’s amazing too. 

A good example of two productions that have completely embraced all that their respective mediums offer is if you watch Ruthie Henshall’s stage performance of “I Dreamed a Dream” in Les Miserables and compare it to Anne Hathaway’s in the recent film. They are both *seriously* amazing but in completely different ways, and both performances would likely fall flat if transplanted into the other medium. 


Do any of you know of some good early movies that really embrace the film format? Or even some stage-y type movies that are super good anyway? This is all just my opinion obviously, and I could be totally missing out without knowing it!&&Hot diggity dog&&Christopher Walken?&&Though not an actor himself, I nominate Wes Anderson.&&9/11 was a national tragedy. &&Norm's dry humour makes him an honourary Australian.

NEVER go for youtube versions. NEVER! People are often fooled to think that welp, that was the film quality of the time. What they don't know is that the original film can be restored to 4K. Analogue film has always had great quality, what changed over time was the technology to project it and to translate it to other media.

If you can find a bluray of a silent film, go for that. The quality will be really good. The youtube versions often don't let you see the actors' faces or any of the crucial details. Your time would be effectively wasted with those.

I learned it the hard way by watching a youtube version of Les Vampire and Intolerance, and only afterwards learned about the issue. I went to rewatch Intolerance, which was a good decision, but I'll never watch Les Vampires again because it's way too long. Never will get those 5-6 hours back either.&&Yeah I've always known about Nosferatu and that it was a spin on Dracula, but my God I just read the plot synopsis and that is almost identical to Bram Stoker's. &&Yeah it's a bummer.

The interesting thing about Keaton is how well he transformed from stage to screen. His deadpan persona worked on both. But the screen absolutely highlights his physical acting since his face simply just is there. Keaton was such a unique talent. He put the physical into acting.

Have you noticed how much Keaton Johnny Depp has in him til this day? I know he used it for Benny&Joon. And I believe I saw him use it in Edward Scissorhands. That guy eats other actors and absorbs their soul.

Also in theatre a chair can be both the throne in Elisnore, the ramparts and a pirate ship. Theatre really really asks a lot of the audience when it comes to props.

The trick I used (suggested to me by some people who are much better at dating than I am) is do the countdown. Tell yourself 'Ok, I'm going to go up to this girl and have a casual conversation with her for maximum one minute, after which I'm going to ask her out'. When it comes time to do it, just count it down in your head - '3,2,1', after which you *immediately* ask her out. Really committing to doing this after the count-down stops you from choking from hesitation/overthinking. 

Have also used this with going for the kiss/otherwise making a move when I was seriously nervous/uncertain about what I was doing. Had some decent success as a result.

Also - remember that if she likes you, a girl will probably forgive you for making a move at the wrong moment. But she absolutely will not forgive you for not doing so at the right one. You have less to lose by giving it a shot.&&Steph Curry is GOAT three point shooter.

In a desperate bid to outrun a violent pandemic, Andy and Kay have holed up on a houseboat with their one-year-old daughter, Rosie. Their protected river existence is shattered by a violent attack, which sees Kay tragically die and Andy infected. Left with only 48 hours before he transforms into one of the creatures they have fought so long to evade, Andy sets out on a precarious journey to find a new guardian for his child. A flourishing Aboriginal tribe are Rosie's best chance of survival--but with their merciless attitude toward the afflicted, they also pose a grave threat. A young Indigenous girl becomes Andy's only chance of safe passage into this sacred community. But unfortunately the girl has no desire to return to her people--she is on a quest to cure her own infected father by returning his stolen soul. Each in their own way is seeking salvation... but they will need to work together if they hope to achieve it.

Okay so I had no idea they were making a full length movie out of Cargo. With Martin Freeman, no less. I'm sure it's been quite a journey for the filmmakers, the guys that made the short are making this.

If you are a fan of Freeman but haven't seen the first season of *Fargo* for some reason, do yourself a favor and watch it immediately. That there is one of the finest shows on television, especially the first season (even tho the other seasons are just as perfect in their own way).

I mean the short accomplished an amazing story with minimalism and is beautiful but Titanic could have just shown a couple clips of a couple of youths getting on the ship, meeting, dancing and making love for 4 minutes then just skipped to the ship sinking and the man drifting into the water as the girl clings to a door. Same story but the details make it a different thing altogether.&&I know, right? Like that time they tried to make a movie from that Stephen King short story about a guy in prison. There was nothing left to be said!&&It'll have to throw a few predictable elements in, I assume. If they're clever like the short, they'll skip the set-up (idyllic lifestyle, rumors of zombies, attack, chase, car crash) and dive right in where the short starts.

Other than arguably Frozen, it had a better story than the other 10 highest grossing films of 2013.

I hope the filmmaker gets more than credit, they should get paid. That is the kind of talent that needs funding and encouragement.

&&My son was one when I first saw the short film. So many onions were cut that day. So. Many. Onions. &&I loved that film&&While I can't speak for certain on this specific film, often movies will be aired at film festivals which are frequented by reviewers. Sometimes there are advanced showings as well, specifically for the media.&&Its actually a 2017 film that Netflix picked up (like with Cloverfield Paradox). There is already a teaser trailer out and images, but apparently it's time for the marketing users of reddit to start the ""first image -> teaser trailer -> social media round up -> funny anecdote post about movie/cast -> final trailer -> ""hey guys, got to go see a screening last night, it's awesome, and don't listen to X thing you heard, focus on Y thing I want you to"" cycle.

There are four of five power users on the sub that repeat this cycle over and over. I suggest RES tagging regularly. Makes it easier to spot the artificial discussion from the more organic interest in a film.&&Early screenings at film festivals, companies will send writers, producers, etc. copies to generate interest/funding in distribution amd future projects, there are test screenings for bigger movies. 

Before IMDB revamped, it was easier to follow users in the forum who obviously worked on shows/movies. So sometimes people who work on these movies/shows will anonymously comment or review. I specifically remember a guy who worked on Breaking Bad would immediately add all this behind the scenes trivia to episodes after they aired which was cool. He'd explain the planning of episodes, effects, etc.

One thing to remember is that a ton of these movies have a hundred percent ratings before they are released publicly, and then tank when the general population gets to see them. Not to trash the show at all, it looks really good, but a lot of things will come out at 100%, and a month later they will be down 20% or more.

Edit. OMG I REMEMBER THIS! I watched this when it first came out, all the Walking Dead hype, the second I saw the ballon...

I was (and am) blown away at the direction, the shots and emotion are amazing for not having any dialogue. I hoped at the time it would be a movie or something, now I'm super excited for the show!

I usually try to avoid synopsis or trailers because they practically can ruin a films excitement. &&It sounds like it basically describes the first act. That's an acceptable level of spoiler, I think. You know the main characters and what they want to do.&&Good thing I never read anything that's longer than a couple of lines on Reddit.&&Yeah, I absolutely agree. I would rather it have just said ""Expanded and adapted from the short film and directed by the same, Cargo follows a couple and their child. Andy, Kay and one-year-od Rosie have holed up on a houseboat in a desperate bid to outrun a violent epidemic.""&&It’s pretty spoiler-heavy, but I downvote people that complain or pre-empt downvotes, so I’m downvoting you just for that.&&> Jesus, there's a lot of spoilers in that description. 

Not really, on screen that's gonna probably take 15 minutes to execute, that leaves at least an hour and more of materials.

And even if that was all the movie, there's way more to movies than its plot points. &&Was it his thrusting in Love Actually? &&Agreed. He’s a great actor and anytime he’s in something, it makes me think “If he agreed to be in it, then it must be worth watching.”&&He just makes me happy, can’t really put my finger on why exactly.&&I think it's the fact that he's not an ""ac-tooor"", if you catch my drift.  By that I mean: he seems to deliver a performance that doesn't seem like a performance, but reminds you of someone you know, or would like to know.&&Recently he's been in two TV shows and two movie franchises. That's not that much.&&Have you seen Sherlock? It's amazing&&he's a character-actor, so he mostly targets small roles, small movies, or limited roles in television where they need an actor to fill his cocky everyman personality he usually performs. &&I'll never forget his performance in Pulp Fiction.&&I mean. Who doesn't love Gordon Freeman?!&&Me too but this will star Martin Lawrence.&&thanks for the recommendation&&Mm not quite. He's missing an arm but dont hold that against him.&&Looks like Netflix kept the Writer&Director duo together from the original short, so that's a plus however I do wonder how much of the short was just a limited bag of tricks or a limited budget and how that'll translate into a large project. 

Who knows, but I'm glad to see some unknowns get a shot rather than seeing the dregs of Hollywood getting a second chance on Netflix.&&We were at the movies, and at the end of Black Panther, me and my wife knew an additional scene was coming while we watched 75% of the theatre leave.

That being said, if they make it well, I'll enjoy it. Definitely works amazingly as a short film, though.&&Apparently the rendition starring Freeman was released back in october at a film fest. A review might be lurking around somewhere for the curious enough.

"The year that made The Matrix, Office Space, The Iron Giant, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, The Blair Witch Project, Fight Club, and more: Looking back at 1999, before franchises took over theaters",72784,7vht5v,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/1999-at-the-movies-the-year-of-livingdangerously/article37815375/,4158,1517863406.0,,"I guess directors figured with the impending Y2K virus, they'd have to make their magnum opus before the end of the world. &&Edward Norton went from American History X and Fight Club to Keeping the Faith a romantic comedy. I remember thinking damn this guy has range.&&Interesting to pinpoint 1999 as the last year before franchises started becoming as big as they have. If I remember right, it was a pretty slow ramp-up to action/superhero movies turning into big franchises. I remember a lot of criticism at the time that Hollywood was churning out too many sequels, but most studios hadn't turned to full-on franchises yet. But let's not forget the biggest box office movie of 1999 was a huge entry in a franchise: The Phantom Menace.

The year 2000 brought us the first X-Men movie, which would become a franchise, the 2nd Mission Impossible, and the 3rd Scream. So not a ton. 4 out the top 10 box office movies were a sequel or the first movie in a franchise.

The year 2001 churned out: the first Harry Potter, the first Lord of the Rings (both we all knew would be multi-film franchises), the first Shrek which would go on to become a franchise, the third Jurassic Park, the first Planet of the Apes remake, the 2nd Mummy movie, the 2nd Rush Hour movie, and the 2nd American Pie movie. This is just looking at the top 30 or so box office movies from the year.  In 2001, 9 out of 10 top box office movies were either the first movie in a franchise, a remake, or a sequel.\

It's pretty crazy comparing the top movies from 1999, which had a few sequels, usually to comedies or family movies where the original had done well at the box office vs. 2001, where we saw the beginning of huge movie franchises and the rise of big box-office remakes.&&Come to think of it, it was a very good year. Magnolia, American Beauty, Eyes Wide Shut, Fight Club and Being John Malkovich are all pretty great.&&Is no one going to talk about the best super hero film of 1999?

[MYSTERY MEN!](https://youtu.be/XovkfHKOPBU) &&Interesting thumbnail choice&&For the sake of balance, let's not forget that 1999 also gave the world Wild Wild West and Bicentennial Man.&&blurp blurp blarp blarp &&1999 is probably my favorite year for film. In my book, the following are all legitimately great films:

The Straight Story

Election

The Matrix

Three Kings

The Insider

Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai

South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut

Audition

Being John Malkovich

The Limey

But there were so many of us that that year, that year was: The Matrix, Election, Fight Club, Being John Malkovich, Three Kings, and Magnolia, that was all of us. And The Matrix was the only film that did well commercially.

&&Office Space is the best of the bunch don't @ me&&The podcast they mention in this article is really worth checking out.&&Eyes wide shut is one of the greatest films ever made&&Every year there's fewer and fewer movies I have a desire to watch in theaters. &&Comic book movies have ruined cinema to its core.&&On the bright side, we can look forward to two Star Wars movies a year for the rest of our lives, I guess that fanbase is easy to milk.&&1994 > 1999&&Franchises suckkkkk&&For those that say the quality of movies has gone down - I'd point out that when comparing which movies are getting funding and making money at the box office, we consider evolution of technology as a contributing factor.

In 1999, HDTV's were just beginning to release for the average home consumer. Projection big screens and Plasmas were only obtainable by the affluent home theater enthusiast. LCD 1080p screens would soon become affordable to the everyday American, taking more and more people out of theaters.

Internet piracy was getting to extremely high levels, nearly every movie was leaked by DVD screener and people now had the TV's to watch them. 

Theater viewership declined causing the movie industry to turn to 3D movies as a way of bringing people back to the theater. James Cameron doubled down on this technology when Avatar released in 2009. 

The point is that there are still plenty of original movies, it's easier to make a movie now than ever before. The funding for full length feature films is highest where they make the most money, guaranteed blockbuster franchises which are best viewed in theaters or the occasional date night romcom or scary movie. &&Yesterday's Super Bowl trailers were almost all sequels. &&This guy 1999s&&[removed]&&You joke but where I work there was a legit fear of it in substations. Our city had to rebuild the smart relays in all of there substations to yk2 spec. My boss said that year was absolute hell for our power company.&&Most of the directors of the films in the title are still making great productions, be it TV/online or film.&&[deleted]&&Then The Score and Death to Smoochy. He gets even better!&&He's one of my favourite actors. He always steals every scene, he has such a presence on screen. There's very few films he stars in that I don't love. He was brilliant in Birdman too&&Everyone learned that when he broke out in Primal Fear. &&To be fair you're not going to get away with making LotR into any less than 3 movies.&&The first Fast and the Furious movie came out in the summer of 2001, too. If you'd have told me at the time that it would go on to spawn one of the biggest and most lucrative film franchises over the next 15 years, I'd have called you full of shit.

Even more surprising is how much I actually enjoy those movies despite their massive, glaring flaws. &&The same thing happened with the gaming industry, but at a later date. Until the 6th gen (playstation 2), we had a lot of new IPs in the market and the AA industry was thriving, then came the cancer known as the 7th gen, gaming became the ""in"" fad, which attracted the masses and devs started pumping out endless sequels. The core fanbases were all sacrificed one by one because devs wanted to make games extremely accessible to maximize sales, which translated in massive ammounts of handholding, casualization and an overbearing focus on cliche hollywood stories left and right with complete disregard for actual gameplay design and complexity, level design and lore. Couple that with aggressive monetization schemes and the industry today is a bad joke in comparison to what it used to be up until the last decade with creativity at an all time low.&&The Green Mile, The Mummy, Girl Interrupted, Boondock Saints, Dogma, Galaxy Quest, Mystery Men, South Park, the list goes on and on.  

Edit: Troy Duffy may be a huge douchebag, but I must admit I'm impressed he still generates this kind of controversy.&&1999 and 2007 have been my favorite years of movies since, well, 2007.&&It was a particularly good year and let us not forgot that before franchises, every year was NOT like this.

However, it's undeniable that f they continue, the chances of a year like this again dwindle greatly &&Not even a mention of American Pie!  One of the single greatest teen/summer comedies ever made.  Like ""Animal House"" and ""PCU""-level great.

Yeah, 1999 was an amazing year for cinema.&&The few years before and after are great as well. Its sad how much of a decline movies have been going though. At least big budget Hollywood movies I think indies have stayed pretty consistent at least. &&I shovel well!&&The police said he fell down an elevator shaft...onto some bullets.&&I'm now realizing that All Star was 1999's Can't Stop the Feeling. &&Well how do you explain his glasses? Captain Amazing doesnt wear glasses!

He takes them off.

But then he couldnt see!&&That's one of those movies that I watched countless times in 1999-2011 but haven't watched it since. At this point I'm scared to watch it, I don't want to ruin the good memories of it doesn't hold up&&You dress in the manner of a male prostitute!&&Legit one of my all-time favorite superhero movies, that movie oozed style.&&""I'm invisible, can you see me?""


""...yes.""&&SOME&&Go fork yourself!&&When you can balance a tack hammer on your head, you will head off your foes with a balanced attack!&&[Lets get real, I think the waffler should get his own netflix series.](https://youtu.be/QXFR1L_gOg8)&&Eyes Wide Shut, I think&&Bicentennial Man remains the best Asimov adaptation to date. It's also a good example of Robin Williams' range, which is why it didn't do well - people wanted a goofy robot comedy. Like Heartbeeps, but less shit. Instead it's a slightly over-long story about what it means to be a person. 

Last I saw it, there wasn't too much zeerust on their vision of the future. A little plasticky and neon, but hey, that's the 90s for you. &&Awwwww I love Bicentennial Man. :(

And WWW is ridiculously cheesy but I guess that was the intention. I mean, nobody puts a steampunk cyborg and a movie projector made with a severed head in a story and expects it to be taken seriously.&&[deleted]&&And Ep. 1&&I liked Bicentennial man.
&&>Bicentennial Man

WTF is wrong with you? That is an amazing movie. What about that movie don't you like?&&What's wrong with Wild Wild West?&&Why do people hate Wild Wild West so much? I don’t get it. I thought it was a really fun movie. &&I hope you’re not suggesting Wild Wild West isn’t in the same category as The Matrix, Office Space, and Fight Club. &&Wild wild west is a national treasure. It's got our beloved fresh prince saving our nation! &&I like Bicentenial Man. Always thought Robin was really underrated here. He found a good medium between his serious and goofy roles I found. What a treasure he was.&&I liked those films. Thought they were fun. Though bicentennial man gets distracted with the romance.&&Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Alien, Poltergeist, Jaws, Back to the Future, Halloween, Toy Story (?), Police Academy,  Friday the 13th, Scream probably many more...&&Godfather.

If we want to go back a bit, there's the Thin Man series, Blondie, Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, they made a couple of Sam Spades, Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Godzilla, Billy Jack. Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Pink Panther, Dirty Harry, Muppets, Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Crocodile Dundee, Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser, Evil Dead, Conjuring, Omen, holy shit I could go all day with 70s-90s horror films alone. &&Star Trek and Bond. &&The title is 'Before franchises took over theaters', not 'Before franchises existed'. Franchise movies dominate the top 10 charts this past decade in a way they didn't even come close to doing in the 90s&&Planet of the Apes, Conan the Barbarian, Rambo&&MASSIVE HITS:  Home Alone, Speed, and of course Leprechaun, Troll, Wishmaster, and Phantasm.  All enormous hits.&&What is happening in this thread. Does everybody but me actually understand what ""blurp blurp blarp blarp"" means? Is this what having a stroke feels like?&&You seem to have missed the point, even though it's right in the title.

It's not that franchises didn't exist in 1999, it's that they didn't dominate the way they do now.

From the article: In 1999, the top-10 highest-grossing films of the year ""included five original films – that is, with no intellectual property attached.""
""In 2017, eight of the year's highest earners were sequels or spinoffs of no special distinction, the remaining two reboots of equal measure.""&&Star Trek, Die Hard, Alien, and Bond are the big ones.&&Yo, nobody seems to remember Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Absolutely hilarious movie.&&Three Kings is so underrated.&&I've seen every single one of those except The Straight Story.

I keep meaning to see it.&&Nice to see Audition.&&This coffee smells like shit!
&&1999, even the bad movies were good&&She's all that & 10 Things... teen years were great.&&> Bowfinger, probably my favourite of all time $66,384,775 

[Roger Ebert on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfHwCevk3F4&t=5m35s)&&Wait...Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura, and The Mask all came out in the same year? That must have been a crazy time to be Jim Carrey...&&Fight Club, Office Space, and American Beauty all had a lot of similarities. They all contained fantasies about screwing over your boss. American Beauty had a very similar scene like in Fight Club where they blackmailed their boss. In fact, I've wondered if one plagerized the other with that scene. I think writers for American Beauty were probably reading the Fight Club novel at the time.&&Franchises are not inherently evil, it's just the market is so saturated with them.  I get it....if you're producing a movie, you can guarantee a good return using a franchise with an established audience.  But that doesn't change the fact that it drowns out new and interesting voices, and that's a shame.  &&Someone else mentioned that in 1999, 5 of the top ten grossing films were original ideas (the others were franchise/reboot/adaptation). Compare that to 2017 where none of the top ten were original ideas and you can see that OP has a good point.

The strongest performer was generally a franchise, but the market wasnt dominated by them.

EDIT: Excluding remakes, reboots, and franchises, I think the top grossing original movie in 2017 was ~~Get Out at number 15~~ Coco at number 12, with only ~~two~~ four original movies in the top 20. Looking [here](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2017) for reference.&&An age of Chinese steel.&&2017 gave us IT,Get Out,Baby Driver,Lego Batman,War For The Planet Of The Apes,Coco,mother!,The Disaster Artist,The Big Sick,Lady Bird and Phantom Thread. and those were just the movies i saw and loved&&I dunno, there's plenty of great movies too. Yeah the mainstream stuff are franchises for the most part, but there are some really good movies out there.&&2017 was a great year for film. You just have to look past a couple shitty blockbusters that come out every single year.&&You're looking for ""Dark Ages"", but I completely disagree. There are so many great movies coming out. Some franchisee. Some aren't.

That said, we are certainly in a Golden Age for people looking for reasons to complain about movies. The options are endless! 

3D movies, expensive tickets, annoying audiences, prequels, sequels, reboots, too many big budget movies, too many small budget movies, too many horror movies, too many superhero movies, too much Chinese influence, death of comedies, bad scripts...etc.&&its hard to portray modern teens for a few reasons but mainly because they are so technology based and technology is constantly changing by the time the movie is out it wouldn’t be “relevant”. also teens dont see movies much anymore &&And, without those films, we'd never have Not Another Teen Movie.&&I taught high school a couple of years ago, and was kind of shocked at how few of the kids actually watched movies. They seemed to mostly watch YouTube; there are a surprising number of videos showing people play video games, and they were incredibly popular. 

I tried to do my part and did a whole unit on film noir in one of my advanced English classes, which went over well, so there’s hope for them yet. &&It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you&&Yippee!!!&&Yeah, while not great, it was a *big* deal.&&Duel of the Fates intensifies &&that's from 2000 though http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093/&&Slim Shady LP&&Californication...

Common.&&Is his name Christopher Walken?&& I really want this to be true but it can't be.&&you need to start a sub for /r/bunkeruncle  asap and keep us updated, you could totally have a book and movie deal if you work it right. &&RemindMe! 6 months&&It’s time sealed?&&Don't fuck with us on this, are you serious? If he's still alive when he gets out you need to have him do an AMA. Like he'd even know what that is. Holy cow.

Sad also that the guy who played schaunessy just died.&&Ah, fucking Norton and Williams, loved it.&&After The Hobbit, I’m grateful it was only three&&Interestingly enough, I believe when LOTR was pitched to studios, it was done so as a two movie deal. New Line Cinema told Peter Jackson he could make three. &&Yeah it started with two franchises (hp, Lotr) that would always have multiple movies regardless of how successful the initial movies would be. It showed studios that audiences love and will keep turning out for the next chapter. &&They also marketed the fact there would be 3 movies in 3 years.&&I also love the Fast Franchise, but it is incredible to me how mediocre the first film is. Fan opinions vary on which is best, but almost nobody says it's that one, and of course the second was total shit, the third was basically a reboot, the fourth was a more different reboot.... and then they start being really faithful to this ""series"" that hated itself for most of it's run. It's nothing short of a hollywood miracle&&This is nonsense, gaming has always been full of sequels and franchises. Mario, Sonic , Pac Man, Street Fighter, Zelda, all sports games, Doom, Half Life, Warcraft, Sim City. There's so many sequels in gaming and there always has been. &&Even the...let's call it the B list:

American Pie, 10 Things I Hate About You, Big Daddy, She's All That, Cruel Intentions, Notting Hill, Deep Blue Sea, The Bone Collector, ...&&HOLY FUCK GALAXY QUEST WAS FROM 1999? kill me now.&&The Phantom Menace &&Holy shit, that's crazy.  I love all of those movies, except I don't know girl interrupted. I think mummy might be my favourite - it has a special place in my heart. &&2007: The year that brought us both There Will Be Blood **AND** No Country For Old Men.&&Holy shit I went to the movies WAY more times in 1999 than I did in 2017!&&To this day I cannot think of “PCU” with getting the “This penis party’s got to go...” chant stuck in my head &&PCU. Used to rent that one when I was like 15, couldn’t wait to go to uni and live that crazy life.&&The Highest grossing films for 1999 were The Phantom Menace (a franchise), Toy Story 2 (a franchise), Austin Powers 2 (a franchise), The Matrix and The Sixth Sense. Franchises have always been a thing, and remembering that the best of popular culture will last the test of time doesn't mean it was the most popular in its heyday. It's like when people get nostalgic for 80s music and forget that Queen had way less #1 hits back then than Wham.&&In some respects I think film franchises are great as it shows that there's more story to be told. 

If we take a look at television (which many say is in its ""golden age"" right now), we can see that the traditional episodic serial has fallen by the wayside (which isn't to say those are unprofitable or unpopular, but the trends are readily apparent) in favor of big-budget, long-form storylines with the quality and consistency of film told over 8-12 hours and multiple seasons. 

It's not necessarily that we're lacking for original content in entertainment media, it's just that we want more of a good thing.&&I shovel very well!&& You shovel better than anyone I know.&&""I always expected a bit of Foul Play..."" &&All Star was the actual song for this movie.

&&I watched it in 2017. 

It holds the fuck up well. 

It holds the fuck up very well. &&Eyes Wide Shut, for sure&&The forever gorgeous Nicole Kidman&&""if you men only knew""

gets me evry tiem

;_; why u gotta hurt me alice?&&Me too!

When I was small, *Bicentennial Man* was the most philosophically challenging thing that I had ever seen and actually *understood* as a kid. 

I guess it’s a pretty normal moral question (AI rights, uploaded consciousnesses, etc.) if a computer can be sentient, but I was like 10 so I didn’t know or have the capacity to understand any of that haha

It also put me on Isaac Asimov much later&&Lol, I remember when that movie came out Howard Stern mocked the fact that a black guy in that era would ever be given such an important mission. Then someone asked him (I think it was Robin Quivers? Or maybe it was a caller, I forget) why is that such a stretch when the plot has a giant mechanical steam-punk spider walking around....&&WWW isn't primarily a western, which might throw people off based on the name.

It's a buddy cop comedy film set in the wild west with steampunk technology. If you watch it expecting a serious western then you'll definitely be disappointed.&&Kenneth Branagh just having a fucking whale of a time. I love it. &&Don't forget the giant spider that was going to be in [John Peters' *Superman Reborn*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo2KB1dEDdk&t=07m58s).&&Bicentennial Man is a good movie.&&The movie was only 2 hours and 12 minutes long but it felt like a bicentennial. &&Was definitely the truest to the original work of all the Asimov movies that have gotten made.&&I think 1999 is significant for the hysteria of Episode 1 rather than the quality of the film itself. &&Meesa trying to forget that piece of shit. &&WWWWWW?&&Right? Smith killed it&&Isnt the romance a huge part of what ties that movie together? Like he cant be arguably human without love?&&Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White and Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight and Benito Mussolini and the Blue Meanie and Cowboy Curtis and Jambi the Genie, Robocop, the Terminator, Captain Kirk, Darth Vader, Lo Pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger, Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan, Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock and Hulk Hogan&&>Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream

Jeez, we could go on for a while with just horror franchises. Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser, Child's Play, Pumpkinhead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the entire Universal monsters universe, Amityville Horror, Psycho, Evil Dead, The Fly, The Omen, Gremlins, Critters, Leprechaun...&&Don't forget the Dark Universe was originally made with Frankenstein, Dracula, wolfman, and Abbot and Costello.&&Rocky, Lethal Weapon, Home Alone &&Thin Man is so good that I'm a bit surprised it hasn't been revised yet.  Casting would be critical though.  There were some decent mysteries in recent years but there aren't a lot of big players in the genre and certainly nothing that could draw in and retain a fandom like a series.&&Go outside of the US and there are others. I know Lone Wolf and Cub, and Zatoichi in Japan. &&I think he edited his comment.&&Franchises are a whole lot *better* these days than they used to be. LotR started a trend, I believe, showing how you could successfully make a 9 hour epic if you release it in three installments. Common wisdom used to be that a sequel was always inferior as it was simply a studio trying to milk more money out of the original. That's still true sometimes but you have to admit with examples like the MCU movies the industry has figured out a new way to tell much larger stories. &&Are people in this thread insane/cynical enough to suggest that there *hasn't* been a massive shift in blockbuster films toward franchises, sequels and established IP material in the last 10-15 years? You'd have to live under a rock or be purposely disingenuous to suggest that stuff like the cinematic universes and endless sequels we see nowadays are anything comparable to Jurassic Park: The Lost World or a couple of Jaws and Home Alone sequels nobody saw or liked.

Yes, sequels and reboots have been a thing forever. But they're *the only thing* now. That's the problem.&&Couldn’t it just be that they’ve gotten better at good sequels? &&Dr. Evil didn't go to Evil Frickin Medical School for four frickin years to be left off this list.&&Great movie... classic&&I just saw this movie like a month ago. I didn't think it was going to be good, but that movie is awesome. &&Buffalo Soldiers (2001) is a similar film, I recommend it&&It's great, and (surprising for David Lynch) literally a Disney movie.&&The question is, are less original movies getting made? 

Are we getting dominated at the box office by franchises because more movies in general are being made or is it because less originals are being made?

Also it is worth saying, the quality of television is far better today than 99 and the format of a TV Series is a far better medium for telling a story.

TV is in its golden era and I think that is where creatives have gone to tell great stories.

Edit ‘99 not ‘90&&You missed Coco at number 12. In the top 20 Coco, Dunkirk, Get Out, and Boss Baby are all original ideas no?&&The Chinesium Age&&The 'Charts' to me no longer means what is of the best quality, but who could afford to advertise the most. ;P This is why there are so many advocates of the 'underground' world... a bunch of creators putting money into the work rather than the promotion. &&Thank you. It bugs me when people say they don't make good movies anymore. It's probably the same people who only listen to top 40 and complain about the state of music.&&Less a dark age than a gilded age. Too much money, not enough class. Everyone's throwing money at big-ass movies, because the main element of success is advertising, and that shit is expensive no matter how much the movie costs. Big dumb popcorn movies make better trailers. No significant population is going to the theaters regularly and seeing whatever's novel - they go to see a specific movie. Only fanatics wind up seeing theatrical releases on a whim. 

DVRs and Netflix are a cleaner dose of what people want.

Or consider that in 1997, Titanic was in theaters for *six months.* People went and saw it over and over and over. Who would bother, nowadays? The new Cloverfield movie was streaming an hour after its first trailer. That is the future of films - no hype cycle, no waiting, no need to get off your couch. Success detached from one specific weekend's performance. Why would a trailer need to lie to the widest possible audience when every single person who might be interested in seeing a film can do so whenever and wherever they please? &&No. I don't buy this. Yes, the tech is constantly changing but we don't go to movies to see tech. We go to see human stories. Boy meets girl is boy meets girl no matter the apps involved. What does McKee call stories? Blueprints for living or something like that.

People aren't fundamentally different today from how they were 20 years ago. Teen-centered stories either aren't being written (unlikely) or they're just not being green lit (likely). Probably because the market dried up. So the question is why teens aren't going to see the movies.

Speaking of which, does Pitch Perfect count? That series started when they were teens.&&Now THIS is podracing!&&[removed]&&Ahh. Back when a nude picture of a chick took 45 minutes to download via Napster/Limewire. Check it at 25 minutes to see if the titties are fapworthy. &&Yea he's gonna be pissed when he realzies nothing happen. He is a little crazy obviously and has lots of money. A lot of people in my family think he's dead. Like if the air stopped working or something. &&The only proper reaction in this thread.&&BUT WHY WOULD HE LIE MAN IT HAS TO BE REAL&&I mean, he DID say no joke, so... &&It's a risk reward thing. The odds of this being real are astronomically bad, but the small cost of investigating is well worth the potential payoff. OP has proven themselves as an inventive storyteller, so why not see where it goes?&&You sir just referenced my favorite movie...I'm taking you to fine dining and dancing at taco Bell!&&Because when the electronic lock rolled over from 1999 to 2000 it glitched and now he's trapped &&Radiation maybe. If he thought nukes would go off he'd wait so long to avoid radiation. I bet someone stuck down there so long would have killed themselves by now though.&&>Common.

If you say so.&&There's a better chance that this is the beginning of a viral marketing campaign for 'blast from the past 2' than of this being real. &&yes how did you know? My cousin, Brendan Fraiser been missing for a while now also, may be in the vault. &&Buncle?&&RemindMe! 6 months&&Yea, how does that work?&&Shenanigans?&&I haven't even read the book and I didn't like those movies. The third one was straight up bad. &&I actually love the first one and it still is my favourite of the franchise. Can’t pinpoint it exactly, but I think it’s a brilliant film and I’ve probably watched it more than 20 times. &&10 Things I Hate About You still makes me smile. In terms of lightweight teen comedies that came out while I was in high school, that's one of my favorites. 

&&Doesn't matter how old I get, I will never stop loving American Pie. &&> Deep Blue Sea,

MY ~~HEAD~~ HAT IS LIKE A SHARKS FIN!?&&The hell you call a B movie? I’ll have you know Big Daddy is the all time greatest movie. 
Hip. Hip hop? &&[deleted]&&..Ravenous.

Okay, yes, I know it bombed and nobody remembers it but I love that movie, great performance by Robert Carlyle and a fantastic soundtrack by Michael Nyman & Damon Albarn.&&“Ever see Deep Blue Sea? A shark ate me, it fucking ate me” -Samuel L Jackson

-Michael Scott&&Notting Hill made me fall in love with England!&&Okay, where do you live?&&Shit 1999. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.&&Not just The Phantom Menace. But The Phantom Womenace and The Phantom Childrace too. &&I like girl interrupted quite a bit. Brittany Murphy, Angelina Jolie, Wynona Ryder, Whoopi&&I like the mummy a lot too. I was 8 when I saw it in theatres and it was pretty much the perfect adventure flick. The bugs that eat you from the inside out were horrifying. Damn, 1999 really was epic for films. &&Something I will never forget. I didn't even need to double check.&&*The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford*, too!  God damn what a beautiful film. &&Can you blow me where the Pampers is?&&Hey hey ho ho &&Every time I'm at a concert and see someone wearing the t-shirt of the band that's playing I think of PCU.&&Oh, you must be talking about Wham!  I was confused because of your spelling error.&&Franchises haven’t always dominated at the box office. Even in 1999 they were far less dominant than they are today. And just look at the years before that

In 1998, 2 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films.

In 1997, 2 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films.

In 1996, 2 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films (and that’s only if you count remakes as franchises).

In 1995, 3 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films.

In 1994, 1 of the top 10 films at the box office was a franchise film.

In 1993, none of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films.

Compare that to more recent years, when all 10 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films in 2017 and 2012, 9 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films in 2015, 2014, and 2011, and 8 of the top 10 films at the box office were franchise films in 2016 and 2013. There’s a big difference there.&&[deleted]&&Non franchises and sequels **bolded**.

This isnt out of nostalgia. I'm also not talking about box office because that is NOT a good indicator of whether a film is good or not. The number of original, big budget Hollywood movies has most definitely declined. Not to mention those franchises you mentioned were like the only major ones of 1999. Hell there are movies that completely bombed that were much better and original than the crap they have been pumping out today, like Stir of Echoes or The Limey. &&""Oh my god. We killed him!""

don't get me wrong, he looks *incredible* both for his age and in general. but i don't know, maybe it was the pairing of him with a hot twenty-something wife in the movie, the makeup, him just being 60ish years old,

i don't know where i was going with this. he's starting to look close to his actual age&&Which is one thing I appreciate now- it's genuinely refreshing when a blockbister movie actually has a closed ending.  Both Oblivion and Edge of Tomorrow held this distinction.  The irony of course is that the latter is getting a sequel. &&I don't know that I'd say it's similar, but I do definitely agree with the recommendation. Maybe Joaquin Phoenix's best work.&&> the Oscar-nominated film Boss Baby

FTFY&&You're right, I wasn't looking closely enough and was in a hurry.  Thanks!&&And the worst part of that “the past is better” is no one remember or can even listen to the old crap music.  I remember my friends dad saying how much better things were back in the day talking about music in the 60s but I wonder what % of the music from then you can easily listen to and it’s only the good stuff. 

Sort of how when we move to whatever comes after Blu-ray no one is going to bother to convert Highlander part 5 or the other junk movies out there that didn’t make it to Blu-ray, two more conversions on and how many movies from the 90s are left on easy to access platforms.&&It's kind of circular because if only shitty movies are being made for teens, teens will tire of it and stop going, then people decided teens don't go to movies so might as well only make low effort movies for teens.&&Are you an angel?&&I miss the days when Jim Carrey was the comedy king&&Holy fuck, I spent a solid 12 hours downloading a blowjob video.

It was great, she was beautiful and just got really into it. I even showed it to my buddy who was over. 

Then she stood up and we saw her cock.

Very enlightening day.&&Really had to study those thumbnails before committing to loading dem titties. &&My friend and I got some chick I met on AIM or Yahoo! Answers to send us some nudes... before sexts were a thing. Glorious stuff. We literally printed it out. What a strange time, whereas now, I can just go to bing video and eventually, someday, I'll find what I'm looking for.&&At the time I thought I was so balling saving my very grainy nudie pics on floppy disks so there would be no trace of them on my Windows 3.1 computer. I thought I was so clever naming them Volcanic Eruptions, disks 1-17.

Man they were confused when my science fair project was building an alarm clock out of various vegetables. &&I'll never forget the first naked lady I saw on the internet. Neighbor mom would let me use their AOL in exchange for babysitting. She came home and I was in a chat room and I was showing her all the cool stuff I could do like type :waves: into the chat and it would make an ocean sound. 

Then we heard the ""You got mail!"" Oh cool! I was 13, and rarely got mail. Neighbor mom wasn't sure what it was so I showed her. It had an attachment and I explained it was probably a friend from the Nintendo forum sending a map. The file name was like 7 random characters, so I opened it and we both watched 1 picture start to load. It wasn't until about 1/4 of the way down we realized it wasn't a map. 1/2 way and it was some blondes face. So this is like 2 minutes into watching this pic load and we see bikini straps, then more chest and then even more. It was getting awesome, but I started apologizing and she told me to let it load. When it was done a couple of minutes later, it was just some chick showing her assets by a pool.

Neighbor mom says ""those are nice. Don't tell your parents and shut it down. Be more careful with those emails."" And that was that. 

I went home and masturbated furiously.&&Don’t forget Kazaa!!&&Don't forget about that Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape.&&If this is for real please contact a filmmaker and have a documentary made.&&Hey Reddit I found a safe!

Ah-la-la-la!&&I saw a Wham! tribute band, they were called Wham!!&&[deleted]&&Yes but there's an understandable reason franchise films are the norm. Summer blockbusters have become ridiculously expensive to make. So studios want reliable returns or the execs get canned. 

Mission Impossible is safe. Star Wars is safe. Star Trek is safe. 

And they still try, John Carter wasn't that bad. It also fucking bombed. 

In 99 a $100 million movie would have been really high budget. Now that's nothing but the ad budget. &&Big Daddy was #7 for the year in 1999? Seriously? Wow. I had no idea. thanks!&&If you're marking ""It"", might as well mark Jumanji and Beauty and the Beast. All basically reboots.

&&What makes you say It was not a franchise and Beauty and the Beast was. Are they not both remakes?&&If you're saying It wasn't a franchise, then neither was The Mummy. &&I have to nitpick just a little here. While The Mummy did produce numerous sequels and spinoffs, you can't really count the first one as a franchise film in this context. At this point in time it was a one-off. It had no franchise appeal or pull.&&If you cherry pick which movies you bring up, then you can make any year look better than any other year. ""Movies from 1999 like Sixth Sense and The Matrix are so much better than modern crap like Pirates 5 and Jumanji"" can be turned around to become ""Movies today like Dunkirk and Get Out are so much better than the crap they were making back in '99 like Wild Wild West and The World Is Not Enough."" Or you could compare 1988 and 1996 and come away thinking 1988 was the better year for movies (because Die Hard is better than Michael) or you could think 1996 was better (because The Rock is better than Twins). You can look at any year since the 50s and find big- and small-budget movies that are masterpieces and disasters, but when you're thinking back to movies from 5+ years ago, you're only going to remember the good, memorable movies over the bad forgettable ones. You only remember the Geostorms and End of Days of the world for a few months, you remember the Fight Clubs and The Shape of Waters for years to come&&Funding woes after the 2008 financial crisis maybe?

This was my biggest issue with the hobbit. Its one fuckin book. Make it one fuckin movie. 

The book was good as fuck though. &&Eh. I feel like two would've been ideal. The Hobbit isn't a long book but it's very dense. You'd have to cut out large parts of the story to fit it cohesively into one film.

The Lord of the Rings movies were able to fit into one movie each without cutting out a lot because of the way Tolkien wrote them, I think. He could spend pages describing the landscape and visuals but paragraphs describing the actual plot.&&Agree.  The book was great and could be read in an afternoon... when they said a trilogy I was just confused as to how.&&Can Confirm: a fan edit exists that cuts all three movies down to the contents of the book; nothing more, nothing less. It's available to download online. &&There was a trend of adapting classic literature into teen films for a while. Clueless (which is like Emma), 10 Things I Hate About You (Taming of the Shrew), Cruel Intentions (Dangerous Liaisons), She's the Man (12th Night), O (Othello), She's All That (Pygmalion, in the same way My Fair Lady is Pygmalion), Whatever It Takes (Cyrano de Bergerac), and Get Over It (A Midsummer Night's Dream).

People unfamiliar with the series aren't going to identify the name with anything. They could have titled it ""John Carter of Mars"" and it would have added a basic hook. There's also the fact that Disney tried to sell it hard on the special effects because the overall movie was bland.&&Why have blockbusters become so much more expensive?&&I don't think anyone's saying there isn't a reason for it.

But I’m sure he’s good.&&Until he gets out&&https://i.imgur.com/zGHQb4O.gif&&When I was 12, my dad went to Barnes & Noble to get some books for me to read because I had pneumonia and was confined to my bed. He came back with The Forever War, Dune and The Hobbit. I read The Forever War in about 6 hours and then The Hobbit over two days because I fell asleep reading it that night. Dune took me about a week because I had to keep going back and re-read chapters and even whole portions of the book.

That week and a half completely changed the content I enjoyed reading, and the level at which I was reading. My dad admitted Dune was a bit much for my age, but I still remember how proud he was that my reading comprehension was at that level, and his excitement that he could share his love of fantasy and science fiction with me. Up until that point he and I did not get along well at all; I read these books yearly and credit them with a few of the really good memories I have of my dad. He killed himself less than two years later and to this day I don't have many positive memories to go with the thought of him...but every time I think of The Hobbit, it makes me think of him listing off the Dwarves in Bilbo's party in a sing-song way a d it makes me happy without fail.

Read The Hobbit, it's a good fuckin book.&&A small book at that. &&I feel two would've been enough. I mean sure it's a really short book but IMO the appendix stuff from LOTR that was included in the films (Azog, Sauron etc.) was interesting especially for those that haven't read the LOTR thoroughly. Making a third one however was just stretching the plot too thin. First movie could've ended when they reach the mountain and the second one would contain Smaug and the battle of five armies. Despite it I enjoy the hobbit movies quite a lot. Sure they're not nearly as good as LOTR but I don't think they are necessarily bad.&&When they first announced it would be two movies I was baffled. When Peter Jackson later decided to further make it a trilogy I thought he had lost his damned mind.&&How dare you forget Get Over It (A Midsummer Night’s Dream), starring Ben Foster, Kirsten Dunst, Mila Kunis, Zoe Saldana, and a true renaissance man in Sisqó.&&Not to mention Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo+Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio&&D for dogshite&&I feel like anyone who was under 18 at the time loved that movie tho &&Oh my god so much dry humor in that movie probably one of my favorite Kenneth Branaugh performances BECAUSE it was so cheesy.&&Nooooooo what&&""We're going straight to...""

Advertising has gone up. God forbid you have someone like a Downey Jr. or Hemsworth in that particular movie cause you can't just swap those kinds of actors out and not expect the audience to notice so they have a ton of bargaining power. I'm not familiar with Daisy Ridley's contract but if its not a 3 movie deal you can see why she would have significant leverage for example. &&I'm making a guess that it's big name actor contracts and directors, cgi work, and on location filming.&&Inflation of currency, more focus on bankable stars that can name their price, good CGI needs a lot of working hours, more platforms to promote on, and probably more factors big and small that I missed&&Well that's why the Netflix/Amazon/Hulu services are becoming so interesting. They're buying up smaller films and shows at festivals around the world. 

If you can get past the desire to waste $30 at a theater, we're still getting lots of interesting movies. I'm actually fine with the current film industry. There's plenty of stuff to watch and imo more. Big actors being willing to do shows that would have been beneath them in the 90s is leading to really interesting content. &&He still is, it's just gotten much, much worse.&&Include me in the screenshot of its founding. &&That was quick&&Yeah /u/Ninja392 is just too uncultured to understand it's beauty.

"Brendan Fraser on His Comeback, Disappearance, and the Experience that Nearly Ended His Career",70192,7zf7e1,https://www.gq.com/story/what-ever-happened-to-brendan-fraser?mbid=social_twitter,4121,1519309315.0,,"So odd how this was passed off as a laughing matter when reported just 3 years ago.

""Brendan Fraser threatened to sue the Hollywood Foreign Press Association under the strangest of circumstances. He claimed the president of the organization, known for putting on The Golden Globes, reached behind him and grabbed a giant handful of ass during a formal charity dinner. The story attracted a few curious double takes back in the day, but now, it’s hilariously taken on a second life after the president in question, Philip Berk, decided to tackle the subject in his explosive autobiography With Signs And Wonders.""

https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Ex-Hollywood-Foreign-Press-Association-President-Admits-He-Pinched-Brendan-Fraser-Butt-62871.html&&If they cast Brendan and Keanu together in a somber roadtrip film I think I'd just spend an hour and half crying.

Brendan and Keanu's Down-to-earth Adventure.&&Damn I would have never known it was this bad. I hope Brendan makes a fantastic comeback if he wishes. &&I've always loved Brendan. Time for another Blast from the Past rewatch soon.&&I think what stuck with me the most, is what Danny Boyle says about Fraser as an actor. His movies, not matter how far fetched or ridiculous they seemed, worked because Fraser's personality made you suspend your disbelief. He's such a charismatic guy, who could be trying to sell you the elixir of life, and even if you know it's all a sham, you'll listen closely to every word he says. He's truly, a great human being. &&> Eventually all these injuries required multiple surgeries: “I needed a laminectomy. And the lumbar didn't take, so they had to do it again a year later.” There was a partial knee replacement. Some more work on his back, bolting various compressed spinal pads together. At one point he needed to have his vocal cords repaired. All told, Fraser says, he was in and out of hospitals for almost seven years.

Damn, no idea he had gone through all that.

> “I'm okay,” he says. “I think I just need to let some arrows fly.” He excuses himself as I ponder what this means. A few minutes go by. When he returns, it's with a leather quiver full of arrows strapped to his back. He steps out onto his porch. Outside, he lofts a bow, nocks an arrow. Down below on his lawn, maybe 75 yards away, is an archery target. He releases the arrow straight into the target's center. Bull's-eye. Then nocks a second arrow, and does it again. Finally, he exhales. “I feel a lot better now,” he says. He hands me the bow: “Okay, now you try.”

Now I wanna go shoot some arrows with Brendan. 


 

&&this is actually a lot heavier than I was expecting

> As it turns out, what was behind the sad Brendan Fraser meme was…sadness. His mother had died of cancer just days before the interview. “I buried my mom,” Fraser says. “I think I was in mourning, and I didn't know what that meant.” He hadn't done press in a while; suddenly he was sitting on a stool in front of an audience, promoting the third season of a show he'd barely been on. “I wasn't quite sure what the format was. And I felt like: Man, I got fucking old. Damn, this is the way it's done now?”          

Was this mentioned after the interview came out? I don’t remember hearing about it

> On Fraser's way out of the hotel, he was hailed by Philip Berk, a former president of the HFPA. In the midst of a crowded room, Berk reached out to shake Fraser's hand. Much of what happened next Berk recounted in his memoir and was also reported by Sharon Waxman in The New York Times: He pinched Fraser's ass—in jest, according to Berk. But Fraser says what Berk did was more than a pinch: “His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.” Fraser says that in this moment he was overcome with panic and fear.         

It really kind of makes you wonder how many of these stories are out there that people have just forgotten about 

> Fraser says when the day came to shoot the scene where he punches himself out, he put on the most ostentatious clothes he could find to play Brendan Fraser. “It was my vision of the worst version of myself. And I get to deck me.” And the point, finally, is this: “The reason I was adamant about wanting to do that”—by which he means take a film role with a bunch of cartoons that involved punching himself in the face—“even if I didn't realize it until much, much later, is that at that time I think I wanted to knock myself out. I wanted to take the piss out of myself before someone else would, 'cause I had it in my head that I had it coming.”          

I feel like this is quite relatable for a lot of people          

Edit: misspelling of don’t&&His story almost reads like a parable for the rat race culture - he was making so much money and recognition - but he couldn't just hop off the ride even if it was breaking his body - the horse from animal farm is so appropriate...&&I was able to meet him last year when he came to my University. My city has a film festival every year, which gives achievement awards to certain actors and Brendan was one of them. There’s also a local filmmaker, who was also a theater professor, who has worked with Brendan when he was younger and was the one who nominated him. 

He was very down to earth, appreciative of speaking to us and for the award. He’s naturally funny and fun to chat with. Pretty much a great person. He’s also a lot bigger in person (tall and broad). 

Later that evening, they screened one of his movies at the local theater, which he was introduced and spoke about the movie before it played. He sat in the row right in front of us during the movie. He stuck around after and answered any questions we had. 

https://i.imgur.com/61F4zUH.jpg&&I'd love it if he made a comeback. Dude has been through so much shit.&&The Mummy was like the defining action movie for my family growing up. My dad, mom, both brothers and I could sit down and watch it together every night, GLADLY, if we had to.

And I thought that was him on The Affair! I hit season 3 with the lady last night and asked her but she had no clue and I forgot to look it up! He's pretty legit in it.&&>He's compulsively honest. His mind is like a maze. You wander in and then emerge, hours or days later, disoriented but appreciative that something so unpredictable can still exist in this world.""  
 
 I read the online version of the article and was so saddened to hear all the struggles he went through, but thought a lot of the article flowed eloquently and represented Brendan in a soft beautiful light that I've always seen him in.  

  I once met Mr. Fraser when I was 8 years old, opening day of the Jurassic Park, 1993. My family and I were standing in a crazy long line waiting to get into the theater when I saw this beautiful giant man walk by with his wife. I was like, ""Encino man??!"" but my older siblings hushed me. Once we made it into the theater, we sat 2 rows behind the man I'd seen earlier. I saw a theater worker come over to him and they spoke for a moment. I saw the side of his face and couldn't shake my belief that this might be the caveman from my favorite movie. This time, I nudged my mother and exclaimed, ""Mom, that's Encino man! I love him, mom!"" she hushed me quickly. But the beautiful man turned in his seat and smiled at me. **It was Brendan Fraser**, I knew it.  I sat there excitedly in my seat, not only was I going to see Jurassic Park, but I got to see my Encino man too! I was nudged out of my gleeful daze by my brother who motioned to the theater worker I'd seen earlier. He had one of those old-fashioned candy-striper box things with a ton of candy on it. He smiled and said ""a guest has bought all the kids candy and you get first pick."" I was so excited I squealed to which Mr. Fraser turned around and shot me that big beautiful smile again. I squealed out a big thank you, I love you! Then the dinosaurs came on and my day was made. (Big apologies for the formatting in my comment, I'm new to it but really wanted to share)

&&This is a tremendous profile. I highly recommend you wait until you can give it your undivided attention, and read the whole thing.

EDIT: forgot a word.&&This is one of the best things I’ve read in a long time. Great interview. &&everybody is talking about the mummy but now i have ""george, george, george of the jungle"" on repeat in my head.&&I hope he finds peace and love regardless of his career. &&>	Fraser eventually was able, he says, to remove Berk's hand. “I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.” He rushed out of the room, outside, past a police officer he couldn't quite bring himself to confess to, and then home, where he told his then wife, Afton, what had happened. “I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me,” he says now. 

As a male survivor of sexual assault myself I’ve never read a more accurate and succinct description of how it feels to be assaulted.&&Brendan Fraser and Idris Elba as a cop duo in Season 3 of True Detective while trying to catch a sadistic serial killer played by Adam Sandler would be amazing. Adam Sandler pulls off serious roles very well. &&Always remember seeing The Mummy, one of the defining films of my life. Rick O’Connell was an Indy for modern audiences, Nathan Drake before Nathan Drake was even a twinkle in Naughty Dog’s eye. &&Save Brendan&&I have loved every role I've seen him perform. I have not had enough Brendan Fraser. &&>“I think I need to let some arrows fly.”


Maybe my new favorite way of saying “let some stress go.”&&This is heartbreaking. He seems like such a swell dude. &&Every time I see one of those insipid sidebar links to an article that says “Why Hollywood won’t cast (so and so) anymore,” I immediately assume it’s because they turned down Harvey Weinstein or someone similar.

And every time, I’ve been correct because an article like this one comes out confirming it. &&Sad story but a good read. I always did wonder why Fraser disappeared as I grew up around the time he was making it big as a star and fondly remember a lot of his leading roles.&&That is such a well written article, there's such a huge gap in skill level in writing articles like this these days.  So many people and outlets think they do it well and they don't, good on you Zach Baron.&&Man, I miss Brendan Fraser, his commentary for the first Mummy film is one of the best film commentaries I've heard. Its just him hanging out cracking jokes and telling cool stories about the shoot. &&What an excellent read.  Man, Hollywood will chew you up and spit you out.  It's a shame he went through all that.  I'm totally rooting for his comeback.&&Brendan Fraser looks like the kind of guy you could have a beer with and just talk about life for hours. &&I would 100% support a serious Fraser playing Superman back in the day.&&I met Brendan Fraser at a Nascar race in 2008. He was a cool, down to earth guy when I met him. Wish him the best. &&Loved him in Blast from the Past. Waiting for your next flick, man.&&i just want more Brendan, he was one of my favorite movie stars growing up. i loved the first two mummy movies and i still watch them every once in a while to this day. Even the third one just for shits and giggles, but he was so charismatic in that role. Despite how everyone says that the third was was crap its a million times better then the one with Tom Cruise. &&This is your weekly reminder to rewatch The Mummy. It’s such a good film. Fraser is amazingly charismatic in it.

I remember reading that when it came out it made a staggering amount at the box office largely because of the time of its release. It came out at the same time as the new Star Wars movie (Episode 1) and most studios had delayed releases because of that. So The Mummy has a really clear run at the cinema. &&Fraser would kill on Netflix.&&All I want today is for Brendan Fraser and Patton Oswalt to hug. And then I want to hug them.&&I was lucky enough to interact with Brennan at a few industry events and during the world premiere of George of The Jungle at the San Diego zoo. I was just a kid but he genuine kindness was something that struck me even them-- nothing about him seemed faked or forced, he just came across as an authentically good man. My mom  also has stories of running into him and just casually chatting in way that made him seem so down to earth.

I'd be lying if denied my eyes got watery reading all the pain he's suffered over the last decade. I wish he knew how much he was able to touch the hearts around him, that he is a special kind of person who is universally loved. &&>He pinched Fraser's ass—in jest, according to Berk. But Fraser says what Berk did was more than a pinch: “His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.”

People really need to stop grabbing other peoples junk. Every time I read about something like this I picture someone sizing up a big animal by feeling the heat radiating off its testicles. Just keep your fucking hands to yourself.

-Edited to include relevant part of story.&&2 years ago went to Disney and we were waiting for a table.  In walks Brendan!  I said to my Cousin is that Encino Man?!  He was with his family.  He was extremely attentive to his son who we identified as having some type of issue.  He is a real person and a loving Dad.  He sat 2 tables over from us in the restaurant.&&He was so beautiful and pure in George of the Jungle, as odd as it sounds.&&Brendan and Paulie Shore should do another movie together. Not a goofy Encino Man type movie. &&Wait.... comeback? What am I not watching with Brendan Fraser in it????&&I'd love to see Brendan Fraser make a Michael Keaton-style comeback.&&[deleted]&&I want a Danny Boyle / Fraser Mummy movie. I want Brendan in a Tarantino movie. I want Brendan in so much more. I want to make it right for Brendan. He deserves it.&&I am very impressed with both the article and Brendan Fraser himself.

I had no idea he went through all of that while accomplishing so much. Great read, here's hoping Fraser storms back into movies the way he's launched into tv&&I always wanted Fraser to play Mike Patton in a movie about the band Faith No More.&&IIRC he also suffered a lot when his wife milked him dry in court, taking all his money and assets. &&With Honors has to be in my top 20 movies of all time.  I love that movie.  He always seemed like a nice guy.  Sounds like he has had a rough time.&&I just watched School Ties last night. 

This dude needs to come back.&&Brendan deserves better. Hoping to see him get his stride back and land some big roles again.&&If you ask Cr1tiKal, Brendan Fraser was always with us.&&I'm a grown man, and I teared up at many points while reading this. I really hope Brendan finds true happiness. I hope we all do!&&Let everyone note what it does to a person to be sexually assaulted. I think it changed him forever. What the hell is wrong with these predators? We have this idea that celebrated actors and actress have their own power and clout. Now I believe that they are considered meat to movie executives. Bodies to exert authority over. &&This is the definition of 'bittersweet' for me right now. Really glad that he's getting a career resurgence after all this time and being more in the public eye, but damn if his story isn't heart-breaking. Losing your mom, your body breaking down, the acute self-loathing, failed marriage...Its a small wonder the man managed to persevere and still build a decent life for himself and his kids. Big respect to Fraser from a lifelong fan, I hope his second wind as a character actor takes him far.&&Damn I loved this guy, genuinely seems like a nice dude.
Wouldn’t mind seeing him do some more stuff. We need to make a subreddit to show him some love like we have other people in the biz &&The word ""hilariously"" has been removed from the current on-line article. But you can't hide from the way-back machine.

I loved him in that. &&BLESS MY LUCKY STARS. *A NEGRO.*&&I absolutely adore that movie! &&George of the Jungle will always have a soft spot in my heart. 

George, George, George of the Jungle!!

I couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing when I was a kid. He made me laugh SO much. &&> He's such a charismatic guy, who could be trying to sell you the elixir of life, and even if you know it's all a sham, you'll listen closely to every word he says. He's truly, a great human being.

I think this is why he's so beloved on Scrubs. The guy was in three episodes and [his character's death is one of the saddest moments on the show](#spoiler) &&> I think I just need to let some arrows fly

I honestly thought that was metaphorical at first &&I want to fund and film an archery contest between Brendan Fraser and Bo Jackson.&&This reminded me of that movie Weatherman starring Nicholas Cage. 

Basically it's just a guy whose life is not going well. He starts taking up archery as a personal hobby and finds that it's really therapeutic for his anxieties. He starts trying to get his life heading in a better direction. There's no super significant plot events or unusual happenings or dramatic resolution. It's trying to be as close to real-life problems as possible. The only unusual thing in the whole movie is that it's a middle-aged man taking up archery as a hobby, and so that's what ends up on the movie poster. &&The dude just needed a win in that moment, while a lot of his life is marked by the inability to control what happened to his career. It's heartbreaking really.&&Brendan Fraser for Robin Hood lets go boys.&&As someone who took up traditional archery recently... yeah flinging a few zingers definitely has therapeutic quality.&&Brendan has to safe Arrow! Brendan for Arrow in Season 7!&&The fucking Berk guy sounds like a douchebag. &&Shit. I feel super bad now. Hopefully Brendan gets a second chance in his acting career.&&Berk looks like exactly the dude to finger your taint in a crowded room and then blame you for making a big deal

edit: Folks were asking me about his missing eyebrows, so I fixed his face to make it [less disconcerting](https://i.imgur.com/hYCvuol.png).&&damn so he got sexually assaulted basically . . . not just women&&Sounds like what Chappelle has been saying since he came back from Africa. &&In acting, as in a lot of professions today, you can't take one step back. You can't decide to ease up on your schedule a bit, take it easy with the stunts, do a few fewer press junkets. You either keep going on your trajectory or you fall burning to the ground. Nobody is interested in your middle ground.&&Wow. He looks way better than I thought he did. Last picture I saw of him, he looked old and defeated. I'm glad he got better and looks great&&That sounds like an awesome opportunity. He seems like a real thoughtful, genuine and humble guy.&&He kind of is, not the meteoric comeback that people envision, but he’s working on multiple projects right now.&&I think Universal really dropped the ball with the Mummy sequels. We didn't want more of Imhotep, we wanted more Rick O'Connell. Leave the Mummy behind, and put him in another Indiana Jones style treasure hunt setting, with a little supernatural flair. Chasing Aztec gold in Mexico, hunting for the treasure of the copper scroll in Israel, or sailing after the wreck of the Flor de la Mar in Sumatra. I would have watched the shit out of these movies, and I'm guessing lots of other people would have, as well. &&Heck yeah! I just watched The Mummy with my grade 10 class in Taiwan a couple weeks ago. They loved it, and I'd forgotten how awesome it is. I mean, I remembered it was great, but I forgot *how* great.&&I loved him in it and was so delighted to see him back on the screen. He seems like a super good dude. &&Please stop making me cry on my train ride to work&&Damn, that's such a nice thing for him to have done and a heartwarming story. I bet that might be one of the best memories you'll be able to relish in your life (although I wish you many more but I gotta say I can't see too many things making a more purely happy, memorable recollection than an unbelievable childhood memory like this one you shared). &&I love everything about this story, thanks for sharing.&&Thanks! Usually I skim through the comments because some awesome Redditer posts exerts from the article (which is true here), but this sounds like I need to read it myself. It’s nice to see someone give him the time to tell his full story. I love him. &&The profile really is incredible. There's no stone left unturned. I hope he finds his way into less dramatic parts over time, but I couldn't be happier he's working again. Especially after the read. &&Agreed. I went in expecting to skim through but lo and behold I was reading the entire thing&&That's exactly what I was thinking! It's been a long time since I read such a well-written article. &&The journalist did such a great job. I have never read an interview that was as riveting..  

Much satisfy.&&Remember nobody dies in this movie. They just get really, really big boo boos. &&Is that just not a wonderful movie?  I can't believe how few people remember it, and how perfect he was in it. &&The best joke from that movie (imo):

*no, awe as in a-w-e.*

Group: ooooooooooh&&School Ties, Encino Man, that one where he gets locked in a bomb shelter, the one where he dates the devil.  Dude is up there with Johnny Depp.  &&The man deserves it &&'In the aftermath of the encounter, Fraser thought about making it public. But ultimately, “I didn't want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative.”'

I still struggle with this part.  I don't necessarily want everyone to know about my assault, because then that will be ""my story"", and I'm so much more than what someone did to me.  

But it's a fine line between living in denial and choosing to write your own story.  I don't think most people understand what victims give up by coming forward about things like this. &&Sign me up, that actually sounds fantastic.&&Adam Sandler crouches down to face Rob Schneider, who is chained in the secret sex dungeon under Sandler’s mansion.

*Sandler cuts him off in the baby voice before switching to the manic yell he often uses*: no, no, No,

Season 3 is pretty much already fully cast&&Friendly shoutout to r/SAVEBRENDAN&&I recently rewatched Bedazzled because it popped into my head and wouldn't leave. Elizabeth Hurley is obviously partly to blame for global warming (I'd wager still is) but Fraser is so damn funny across a range of characters. The loser he plays until he makes his pact is better and more painful to watch than it needed to be for a mere comedy. 

Worth the watch for Hurley and Frasers portrayal of a basketball player alone. His [110 percent interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b5IpCpeb0M) is a razor sharp sendup of all post-match interviews.

&&His role in scrubs and the episodes he was in made me tear up hard, scrubs always had some real good humane real moments but his part was heart wrenching. &&Inkheart. Little known treasure. Andy Serkis also makes a terrific villain as always. &&he was fun to watch. Never took himself too seriously

I can't wait to introduce my kids to George. &&What makes Fraser unique is that he's a grown man with the innocent aura of a precious six year old. Nobody else could have played George, or pulled off the jokes in it.

The first time I watched that film, when he said *""butt flap!""* I had to pause it for a good ten minutes, I was laughing so hard. And I don't think anyone else could have made a joke that dumb funny.&&What gets me is how big of an impact he had on the show and he was *ONLY* in 3 episodes. It feels like he was in more episodes. His charisma really made that character feel ""lived in"" as if he did have this long past history with the characters of the show.

I'm watching his third episode right now and he's fine, they're on their way to the birthday party....&&I think his death was sad because of how Doctor Cox handles it and his mental breakdown. &&Holy shit I had to check.

Not only is personal grooming important, but things like small changes in weight to being a little dehydrated have a much greater impact on your face.

Having your hair tousled or having a 3-day beard might even be seen as sexy on a 20 year old, but it makes a 40 year old look like a hobo.

There’s so much victim blaming (both obvious and subtle). Talking about it, for many, means reliving it; the sights, smells and sounds come rushing back and BOOM, we are right back at that moment when we were assaulted. Once is enough. Having to relive it like that is just fucked up.

Then there are the curious questions, which I understand, but it doesn’t make it any less painful to have to share more than we were prepared to share. I mean, even when it’s not assault, who wants to talk about intimate sexual experiences with strangers? Ok, maybe Reddit isn’t the best place to ask that rhetorical question....&&I second this motion. I would watch the hell out of that. &&Or this:

Sandler is dancing around a soundless, windowless dungeon to a very loud “Meet Me in St. Louis” by Judy Garland. His victim is a naked man who is tied upside down. Sandler shuffles over to him and slides a bucket beneath the man’s head with his foot.

In a woman’s voice, Sandler sings:
“A bucket for your thoughts!”

The man:
“Please, please! Why are you doing this?!”

In a pouty woman’s voice, like a small child that didn’t get their ice cream, Sandler says:
“Becawws, it makes me feew goooood, daddy. Hahahahaha!”

He lets out a deranged cackle. 

The man (helpless):
“Aww noooo. God, please!”

Sandler takes out a drill and pulls the trigger in the air, it spins loudly.

Sandler:
“Does the doe wanna drown in it’s bloooood? Poor baby doe.”

Sandler drills a hole in the man’s carotid artery and the bucket begins to fill.

The man:
No! Nooo—

Some blood splatters on Sandler’s dress, that’s made of skin.

Sandler:
“Aw shucks Polly, you wet my pretty gown! Maybe it’ll look good in red for the ball!”

He turns the music up some more and continues dancing as the man’s body flails like a dead fish until it doesn’t.&&Punch Drunk Love was a great dramatic role for him&&Well, Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish come to mind.

I was never a *huge* fan of his, mostly because (just like the article indicates) he played very similar roles in most of his movies: the babe in the woods. I had no idea all of the shit that was going on in his personal life, which is a huge contrast from his outward persona. It’s really tragic what happened to him, but fortunately it at least sounds like he’s gained a lot of valuable perspective from it. (Still, fuck Berk for his non-apology “apology.”)

I’ll have to watch “Trust” now so I can see him in a darker role.

Rick and Jonathan are chilling at their home and out walks Evelyn (played by Rachel Weisz) complaining how long it took ""that enchantment"" to wear off. 

A brief flashback shows that somewhere before Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, the group stumbled across the Jekyll/Hyde formula, but in magic form. Weisz partially read the enchantment out loud as she was studying it, changing her into Bello.

Back to the present- Ardeth shows up saying ""dark reflections"" of people are showing up and he needs their help. The group realizes it is the magic Jekyll/Hyde formula, hijinks ensue, fun summer movie.&&This sounds absolutely glorious &&No, the terrible Scorpion King was great, it pushed it into shitty B-movie territory and I was fine with that.

Some gruesome tales tho&&""A day without having watched _The Mummy_ could have been a better day."" -Mark Twain&&Emojis are basically hieroglyphics man&&DC has the money, but nobody high up is as visionary and as free as Kevin Feige.  That means they don't have someone who understands what people like about it's characters and stories while trusting it can translate, who has an eye for talented directors, and allowing the directors to have a certain level of freedom while also checking certain boxes.  While there certainly is some formula to the whole thing, there's incredible variety within it, all the while making character development and growth as a primary focus.    Iron Man, First Avenger, Avengers, Guardians, Ant Man, Spider-Man Homecoming, Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, and Black Panther all have pretty unique styles, tones, and even theme to some extent.  

DCs* biggest problem is putting money behind the wrong people.

*Edit: DC not doc&&> I mean Marvel gave everyone the blue print on how to do a universe perfectly and people keep fucking it up.

Yes!  This!  

I mean, I'm not surprised that Hollywood has this tendency to say, ""people liked this, so we'll repeat this"", without trying to figure out *why* people liked it.  

Whether or not you're a fan of the MCU, you have to give mad props to Kevin Feige, who planned meticulously, controlled everything, and made damn sure that everything fit together and had a cohesive feel, even when the movies were for different characters.  &&[Recent photo](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZjNTZiOWQtYzNjOC00MzUwLTkxNDQtMzQxZmE1NDBkZWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcyNTEzNTk@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL_.jpg) that you might like, if you're into ""salt and pepper"" on a guy. &&He does, it was a popular phrase to say in an exaggerated American accent down here in Mexico for YEARS after that movie was released.&&Oh God the rabies episode. I tried to forget about that one.....

One of the saddest ones for me was like the 4th episode in season 1 where an old lady was told she needed dialysis or else she would die, and she said ""I'm ready to die"". JD was a fresh new idealistic doctor who worked tirelessly to convince to do dialysis and stay alive, but she continuously refused. She could tell he was incredibly stressed out, and asked him ""how are you doing""? And all JD says is ""I'm scared"". Then she hugs him in a loving and comforting way that only an old lady could do. It was so cool how this lady kept teaching him things throughout the episode.

For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies.

Kevin Feige literally built the MCU with a box of scraps. He didnt have access to the A list X-men and Spiderman characters. While the characters he used are well known to comic book readers they werent to the general public. Like who actually gave a fuck or knew there was a talking tree and raccoon character?

‘Star Wars: Episode 9’ Hires ‘Blade Runner 2049’ Art Director,63411,7xcrc9,http://www.slashfilm.com/episode-9-art-director/,3101,1518556720.0,,"Interestingly, the original ""Blade Runner"" (1982) borrowed crew from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980). &&*Skyfall, Game of Thrones, Prometheus, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Children of Men, and of course, Blade Runner 2049*


He also did Dracula Untold and Jason Bourne (2016) all of which are certainly very good looking films anyway.&&Well this can only be good news.&&Yes please.&&2049,

Episode 9,

(If this trends continues...)

Fast 9&&I think it’s important to note that an Art Director is not a Production Designer. The Art Director does have creative input, but their role is primarily to facilitate the artistic vision of the Production Designer. The Art Director oversees a team of draftsmen, prop makers, carpenters, etc. to bring to life the aesthetic, not necessarily create the aesthetic. 

This hire is still very exciting, because clearly he’s shepherded some fantastic projects in the past, but his role may not be what a lot of people assume. &&Oh shit, is Star Wars gonna be sci-fi now? 

EDIT: I love you fucking nerds

PHANTOM EDIT: Since no one asked, I think the argument stems from cinematic sci-fi versus sci-fi literature. The movies are obviously aesthetically science fiction, with lasers and space ships and dumb names containing numbers. But from a storytelling perspective, you expect science fiction to confront the theme of futuristic technology and how it impacts our lives. Star Wars does this nominally (a space ship that can destroy a planet, my dad is a robot!) but it isn't the main thrust at all. While it looks like science fiction, Star Wars is just the hero's journey in a space suit. It feels classical. Personally, I would call it sci-fi, because whenever I hear Space Opera I think of Pavarotti on Jupiter, but a strong argument can be made either way. &&Guess this means r/movies has to like the movie now.

EDIT: worldbuilding&&Cool I guess. However one thing all three new Star Wars movies already did really well is look fantastic. &&Omg please let this mean we're going back to Coruscant!&&To be fair. The Art style certainly wasn't what was wrong with TLJ. In fact the visuals are absolutely fantastic and brought us some of the best moments in Star Wars history.

What a beautiful film all around.&&Urban planets??&&Oh they so need to work Nar Shaddaa into episode 9 now&&ART director. Man, I was hoping it was the director, who made my favorite sci-fi flick in years with Arrival. Nah, it's just a visual guy. Well, OK, bruh. My problem with the Last Jedi wasn't how it looked. It looked pretty stellar, pretty consistently. &&They should go ahead and hire their writer too.&&don't care, who's on the script?&&Good. I hope he brings back the dirty, gritty look the OT had.

How did things fall so far between E7 and E8?&&remember when star wars was fantasy scifi not pure sci fi.&&imo art direction was one of the last things that bugged me about the new movies&&“Just do what you did with Blade Runner 2049.”

“Okay!”

“Wait, what are you doing? This isn’t what we’re used to. You’re fired!”&&Imagine if Denis Villeneuve was given the chance to direct this? I'd wager he'd be fired within days. Blade Runner 2049 is incredible.&&For a 2019 release, I would have thought the movie is further along than ""looking for an art director"".&&The artwork is fine, the writing is the problem.&&Yes Disney keep focusing on making it pretty instead of making a coherent story line. That should do well.

 Star Wars is dead. R.I.P.&&Confirmation that the turd will have a professionally polished veneer upon release.&&I feel art direction isn't really the issue with Star Wars at the moment. TLJ looked great and had some visually stunning shots and use of colour. But so did Prometheus. And both movies came across as average at best because both failed in their characters, logic, story execution, and plot. 
Visuals count for nothing if you can't pull off the story.
Personally, this just feels like the ol 'you can't polish a turd, but you can roll it in glitter.'&&Thats great. Now get a good writer.&&It's not the art that's lacking in the star wars movies. It's the story :/ Stop killing off the reasons I watch Star Wars. &&I don't think the art director was the problem in the last movie... they should look for story writer, but this is just my opinion&&Don't care. You could hire Leonardo himself and he still couldn't save this franchise from the shit state Disney has left it.&&Should hire Roger Deakins while they're at it.&&Now if only they would hire better writers...&&I'm not dissapointed as this art director has done some visually amazing movie but I really wanted this sentence to end with '... 2049 director, David villeneuve'. Him doing a star wars movie would make my life complete. &&After seeing both e7 and e8, IMO they should spend some money on decent writers instead of putting all their eggs in one digital basket...&&Why they hire all these talented people and directors and then force them to make safe and sterile movies?&&Last Jedi destroyed any interest I had in the current star wars franchise. It showed how much having different directors impacts the story. Last Jedi destroyed all of the things that force awakens started to establish. &&I’m about as interested in a good looking piece of shit as an ugly one.  &&I think Blade Runner 2049 was underrated last year, each movie scene is perfect cinematography &&Sounds awesome but I think all 3 of the New Star Wars movies have been spectacular visually so far anyway, and Solo looks like it will be also.&&They should hire Denis Villeneuve. &&At first I thought the title said Denis Villeneuve will be the new director of Episode 9. I almost back flipped from excitement. &&Just make it look like star wars, throw in some legacy aliens with some new aliens and I will be happy.&&It’s like poetry, it rhymes&&I wonder if any of them worked on the prequels&&Holy shit look at all these gorgeous movies. 

(You don’t have to like Prometheus *on net* to appreciate that it is visually stunning) &&Yeah. The set in Dracula untold were the best parts&&Children of Men is a masterpiece. &&Oh Skyfall is one of my favorite movies in what I call ""Movies that look so good you'd love to stare at it and fall in love""&&Wow, I love finding stuff out like this. A common thread through some of my favorite movies. &&You had me at Children of Men. That's one of my all time favorite movies.&&children of men is easily one of the most underrated movies of all time.  Visually stunning and Clive Owen is unbelievable.&&Why hasn’t he done a DC film yet? That’s where the high level fucking art requirement lies. That’s where the real uncapped money is. &&Ok this is a little bit of a weird misleading article. The art director, and particularly the supervising art director, is certainly not the “head” of the art department in the same way that the production designer is. The supervising art director largely manages budgets and keeps the department running smoothly. It’s a very important job for sure, but the production designer is the one who establishes the “look” of a film. && Hope so. Blade Runner 2049 was probably my favorite movie of last year. &&Is there an overall vision for the sequels or is it just hire whoever's hot at the moment?

I've never read an article about an art director being hired.  To some extent it doesn't matter, and the production designer is the important hire here.  They are REALLY reaching for something to write about.&&This comment needs to be at the very top. The Production Designer is much more important creatively.&&Seconding this. I assumed the article meant to say production designer as the titles used to be interchangeable. I’ve literally never seen an article like this about a supervising art director hire. &&Thanks for making this distinction. While I loved how 2049 looked, this trilogy has such a disjointed feeling already, making the 9th feel AND look different really doesn’t help the lack of cohesiveness 7th and 8th already had.&&I heard Star Wars 9 just hired the Key Rigging Grip from Harry Potter 7. I'm so pumped.&&This really should be top comment. I think a lot of people here are assuming this is the cinematographer or something. Not that the art director doesn't have importance, but a lot of what people are pointing out would be more from the cinematographer (who happens to be Roger Deakins for Skyfall and Blade Runner 2049).&&Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no substitute for a good blaster by your side.&&We love you to you... *fffffffucker*&&I like to call the genre that Star Wars lives in ""Space Fantasy"". &&I always liked “science fantasy” &&I'm in the Space Opera camp. Opera refers to Soap Opera, not classical opera. The term was invented to differentiate the pulpy sci-fi from hard sci-fi just as Soap opera is distinguished from serious romance/drama.

Space opera is a subgenre of Sci-Fi so I guess it's both.  I don't like Sci-Fantasy for Star Wars. There just isn't enough fantasy for me to put it in that category. &&Spaceships, Lazers, faster than light travel, and strange aliens? Star Wars couldn't possibly be defined as sci-fi.&&always heard star wars described as a space opera, definitely fits that mold better than a heinlein or like asimov type &&Star Wars is fantasy. Hope this helps.&&I don't think anyone complained about TLJ being an ugly movie.  It was a gorgeous movie.  I think the complaint by people was the story.&&If only r/movies had a fucking clue what below the line crew actually worked on. I say this as a film fan who has no fucking clue what below the line crew actually work on.&&Maybe this one will have a coherent plot. &&Most of the stuff here deals with posters, still shots from the movie, and weekly finance reports. That is like /r/food posting McDonald's sales figures every week. &&I think they looked *good*, but I really wanna see if they can start innovating as far as aesthetics. Shit on the Prequels (rightfully, they sucked dick), but they managed to really nail a particular aesthetic in its universe that managed to take influence from as wide a pool as A New Hope did back in '77, without feeling in any way derivative of either the Original Trilogy or any sci-fi works that had sprung up in the 20 years between it and The Phantom Menace. 

The Sequel Trilogy actually looks gorgeous, and it's realistic that technology remains relatively stagnant, but it really doesn't help the overall sense that the ST really is just an extended homage to the Original Trilogy. Considering the way The Last Jedi ended, there's a *lot* of room to move away from the rusty metal space western meets WW2 action film aesthetics of the OT into fresher material. There's so much more to sci-fi settings than just the stuff Star Wars pioneered, and I'd love to see Lucasfilm play with that a bit more. &&yeah, no one said TLJ didn't look good. It's the story, editing, and character development that were off putting for most of us. &&I think a lot of the art style actually sucked. Especially in creature design. The use of animatronics instead of CGI was good but the design of some of the prominent creatures felt very uninspired such as the crystal foxes and those long ear horses. Porgs were unique enough, but the Crystal foxes were literally just dogs. And the long ear horses were just that, literally long ear horses. They even have HOOVES! I really feel like they deliberately tried to make things as familiar as possible so that they could sell more toys. I get it, people dont by sarlax pit plushies, but I don't have to give a shit about your long term business model. I just want a good movie set in a unique and unfamiliar universe. Hell, Del Toro's films take place on EARTH and fill you with a greater sense of wonder and awe and all the unique and interesting things you see.


Overall my greatest criticism of Star Wars is it got soft with Disney.

In the original trilogy Luke got his fucking hand chopped off, he almost died in the cold, and its highly implied that Leia was tortured by Vader. In the prequels Anakin got his legs chopped off, Darth maul got sliced in half, Qui-Gon got stabbed through his chest. It felt like things were really at stake.

Now fin gets a cut on his back but you know hes fine. Kylo gets a cut on his face but you know hes fine. And Rey, fucking hell Rey, Not a scratch on her throughout both movies. You feel like they all have this bubble of safety around them. All the thrill is gone. I was almost thinking ""THANK GOD"" when I thought fin was going to sacrifice himself to save his friends. Finally, SOMETHING is happening. Something with weight and significance. But nope. Couldn't even commit to that. What are you keeping him around for? Tell a damn story! In a story not everyone has to make it to the end. But hey, you cant show anything too sad or scary or dramatic or unpredictable or else it will upset our charts that show what viewers want.

TELL A DAMN STORY. At least in The force Awakens they told a story. Things were happening. The plot moved along. What was accomplished with the last jedi? the last jedi felt like a filler episode where all the characters decided to go to the mall or some shit, but instead they spent 70% of the move ""just barely running away from a ship behind them"" cut back, still running away, next scene? still running away. Are we going to go anywhere with this? nope, still running away. Okay its the last 10 minutes of the film, Hey a planet was right there the whole fucking time!

Just ugh. My issues were never that they ""ruined the expanded universe"" or any of the other BS excuses that people on here like to play criticism off as. My issues were it was just bad film making and bad writing. And since Ryan did both, hes to blame for both.&&Reddit was doing that anyways.&&Oh what’s that? You’re a fan of the most famous movies in the world? Color me impressed. /s&&It broke new ground!&&First one wasn't either&&Please. I love seeing the civilizations of the galaxy, I'm tired of these characters hanging out in galactic backwaters&&I really hope they return to Coruscant and we get to see how Palpatine twisted the Jedi temple. Also makes sense the whole main series would start and end there.&&This is the important part.&&JJ Abrams so far I believe&&>Rouge

The nightmare never ends&&I think ""rouge"" is the most made-fun-of misspelling in modern history. &&Interesting take. I thought rogue one had a very airbrushed on fake grittiness to it. 

&&You mean like a good sci-fi movie with a script?&&It'll take a miracle to fix this fucking mess now.  &&Make the film look amazing to compensate for the cucked boring storyline and characters. &&Different directors isn't the issue. Marvel movies have had different directors for almost every movie they released, but they still tell a coherent story. The biggest issue with star wars is that no one has taken charge and thought out where the story was going to go.

The fact it was nominated for an Oscar supports this.  It was highly rated and everyone who sees it agrees. 

I am not a huge fan of the original, but 2049 was my favorite movie last year because of the cinematography. &&Jar Jar’s the key to all this.&&Excuse me, but I feel like I’ve heard/read this in something and I can’t put my finger on it, what is it?&&What is it with Ricks?&&how high are you?&&Say what you will about the prequels, they were movies.&&wtf does 'on net' mean in this context?&&I don't think anyone would disagree with that.

I was in Grozny from 1994-1996 as a civilian during the russian invasion and occupation and I often find myself watching the ending to that movie simply because it was SO damn similar to how Grozny looked and felt at times. 

It really is just the single most realistic and devastating image of what urban combat can feel like, especially at that level of intensity. Those scenes are pretty widely regarded by veterans and survivors as an unfortunate look at how it really is. &&One of my favorite movies of all time.

I'm not even one of the downers over TLJ, I liked it. But I don't care about the characters or their story, not really interested to see the final film of this current trilogy.

Really excited to see what Johnson does with his own thing, if he's still doing a trilogy. There are so many goddamn SW movies coming out I forget who's doing what.&&Hot take: There wasn't an overall vision for the Original Trilogy either, which makes sense given how much the production and writing teams changed over the course of the three movies.

When A New Hope was released, nobody had yet even come up with the idea that Darth Vader was Luke's father or that Leia was Luke's sister.&&They're rushing these movies into existence without much concern for quality control and it's getting so disappointing. 

Rogue One has characters that lack any discernable character, and Last Jedi feels like an unpolished first draft. &&> Is there an overall vision for the sequels

Nope, they're winging it. It's safe to assume JJ had some form of plan based on the sheer amount of setup we got in 7, but considering that roughly 80% of said setup now longer either matters or has relevance he's in an awkward position for 9. Rian wanted to do his own thing entirely, and while that's fine in theory, I feel that he didn't properly think through the impact said decisions will have on the next film.

I sincerely believe Denis Villanueve is the best working director today and I'm still pissed that JJ is returning to direct episode 9.  Almost all the problems with The Last Jedi were caused by JJ's mystery box formula with Episode 7.  Episode 10 will be hated by fans because JJ will just set up a bunch of cliffhanger-y plot threads in episode 9 with no idea where they'll go just like he did with TFA.&&~~and also with you~~ and with your spirit&&and Muppets 9&&And then the British version: 0118 999 881 999 119 7253&&Holy shit.

I don't think that's literally *ever* been a complaint about Star Wars.  The inherent, consistent and chronic complaint about Star Wars from anyone who isn't a fanboy is that often the writing and dialogue are terrible.  

And getting rid of George Lucas hasn't actually fixed the problem either.  In fact it's made the problem worse because now not only is the dialogue often stilted and awkward the *big picture* is missing too.

In episodes 4-5-6, George Lucas had other professionals to direct *literally and figuratively* the movies- including his ex-wife apparently.  But coming back for episodes 1-2-3, everyone seems to have treated George like the second coming of Jesus Christ.  And it shows, because every stupid thing George Lucas wanted to appeal to children is in those movies, and his dialogue whether between old friends, lovers or political enemies is awkward and stilted.  These aren't movies written for the 20 - 49 demographic who actually wanted to see them.&&""Below the line crew""?&&A hint at an interesting one at the very least would be nice. &&> the Prequels...managed to really nail a particular aesthetic

That aesthetic was: Early 2000s CGI

&&The prequels have a certain grandeur while the sequels have felt somewhat small and cramped. I much preferred the Rogue One aesthetic.&&I think there was a lot wrong with the prequels, but I can at least respect George Lucas for wanting to explore the starwars universe in a different direction instead of the standard story of 5 heros in a rag tag team gotta save the universe from a giant super weapon. I heard the criticism of starwars that: ""where can you go, the story will always need to be a small team taking down a super weapon. without out that its not star wars. the universe cant grow beyond that"" but i think thats bullshit. The expanded universe has TONS of great stories that dont involve that plot theme. Not everything has to happen during that one 50 year time span. All the starwars universe is, is a setting. It's the background painting and props. You can tell what ever story you want within that. And it's an entire universe. Not everything has to do with the Sky walkers and involve Tatooine, Naboo, or what not. George lucas at least took us to some really cool places with tons of variety. There were tons of interesting aliens and worlds and cultures to ponder on. You felt immersed. Recent star wars is borring and WAY too human focused. Yes humans are the main players in the universe but besides Chewbacca you almost never see a single alien outside of a background shot, let alone have lines or a role in story. For fucks sake the ""salt"" planet had fucking foxes. FOXES. How insanely uninspired. Sure they're covered in ""crystal's"" but come on, it just looks like spikey hair.

For what it’s worth, I never preorder anything.&&See, I get the feeling Rian Johnson is good with fewer characters. Star Wars is all about plate spinning (that's a good trick) and I felt like if he just had to do the Luke/Rey/Kylo/Snoke thing, it would be excellent. **That** is the part of TLJ I was really immersed in.

Example: The original trilogy slowly introduces new characters, but mainly hinges on Luke, Han, Leia, Vader, Chewie, C3PO & R2-D2. Later on, we get some b-villains like Jabba, get introduced to Lando, a larger Rebel force, the Emperor (not properly until the climax of the trilogy). 

But he's also got to do something with Leia, Poe, Finn, Rose, Hux, Phasma, BB-8, C3PO, R2-D2, Chewie, various other Rebels/FO people....and doesn't really know what to do with them. Kind of felt like he may have written himself into a corner - I don't know.&&Lucas had a foundation on where the story would go. He didn't have all the details fleshed out but he knew he had to go from A to B to C. Overtime people helped Lucas fill in the details.


The prequels suffered because Lucas had the foundation but didn't have the right people to help him fill in the details. That was the major problem with the prequels.


The new trilogy feels like a mess because I don't even know if Disney knows how to get from A to B to C let alone fill in the details. The Last Jedi felt like 10 scripts slammed together at the last minute.&&Ummm the writing team did NOT change much at all over the course of the three OT movies.  The same guy is credited for writing the story for all 3.  Lawrence Kasdan came on board for Empire and Jedi.  That's way more coherent than the ST.  Did you know that Rian Johnson is the ONLY person credited with writing The Last Jedi?  No Lawrence Kasdan, no George Lucas.  TLJ is the first Episode ever written without one of them.  The lack of consistency created by that is hard to ignore.&&The difference is that it was all created by one guy and a small group of others who had a consistent vision for the OT &&The difference being the OT was executed better. &&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0805  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/65793)&&You guys need to stop saying that. He had a rough draft of the whole trilogy and made changes here and there where he saw fit. When he proposed it to Fox he even mentioned he'd have to split it up into 3 movies. ANH was left feeling like it could just be a standalone movie because Lucas wasn't sure if it'd be successful.

This sequel trilogy has no united vision or planning. They're just allowing each director to do their own thing which is why a lot of people have an issue with this trilogy so far. 

Meanwhile Disney also owns Marvel and they announce the next 10 movies ahead of time. They have amazing cohesion with each other and have one of the most successful movie franchises because of it.&&> There wasn't an overall vision for the Original Trilogy either

What?? Lucas wrote the story for all 3 original movies.&&> Hot take: There wasn't an overall vision for the Original Trilogy either, which makes sense given how much the production and writing teams changed over the course of the three movies.

Lucas says he asked Fox to guarantee the 2nd and 3rd movies would be made in his original contract for the first one. 

A biographer in 1983 quoted Lucas as saying he wanted 3 trilogies, one dealing with socio-political themes (PT), one about personal growth and self-realization (OT), and one covering morality and philosophy.

Mark Hamill said Lucas told him in 1976 that the plan was for 4 trilogies.&&I mean if we're going off of JJ's past works, I'd say it *isn't* safe to assume that. Look at the new Cloverfield movie or the tired example of LOST. He's good at establishing questions but hasn't yet nailed the skill of providing satisfying answers.&&> It's safe to assume JJ had some form of plan based on the sheer amount of setup we got in 7

Have you seen Lost? JJ is great at posing questions, not so great at answering them. He often seems to work with no plan at all, just trusting that things will work out in the end.

At any rate, I agree that the two movies were handled pretty terribly with respect to continuity and just general communication between directors. Hopefully they've learned from that now that they seem to be commissioning people for trilogies/series now instead of single movies.&&[deleted]&&WAIT WHAT &&Man, I really hope episode IX isn't just setting up episode X.&&Luckily Villeneuve is doing the ""Star Wars for adults"" instead. &&Well the mystery boxes worked great in that movie to intrigue the viewer and get them invested and have some potential reason for Rey's ridiculously powerful force affinity.

It was the people behind 8 who decides that rather than expand on all of that in a sequel is better to throw it all out.&&wholeheartedly agree.  Seems like JJ is good with first and second acts but his closure is lacking most of the time.  I found out after I saw BR2049 that he had done Arrival and that cemented him in my category of ""doesn't matter what it's about, ________ directed it so I'll see it.""  That list is pretty short &&>just like he did with Lost.

FTFY&&Honestly, with the way the 7 and 8 have been, I feel like he would be wasting his time. I rather he be working on other projects.&&So his mystery boxes made Canto Bight necessary? Or how Luke was handled? Or the myriad pacing and tonal inconsistencies?

Okey doke. &&No, leave him to be with Dune! &&Honestly. JJ's mystery box formula is one of the laziest, most pointless strategies to filmmaking that I've ever heard of. Writing a plotline based purely on drawing someone in with no idea what your payoff is going to be (or if there will even be one) makes for a really crappy watching experience when it's all said and done&&yeah I'm not really interested to see the end of this current trilogy. TLJ was okay but it felt so.. different that it kinda turned me off from the characters. i don't care what happens to them next.

hopefully Johnson will just have a clean slate to do his own thing -- *that* i think will be awesome.&&/r/unexpectedmulaney&&NEIN, NEIN, NEIN!!!!&&I want more muppets. &&Help, help! I'm being savagely oppressed!&&I mean it's just my opinion. Yeah, the force is basically a magic system. The marvel movies (Dr. Strange and arguably the infinity stones) have a magic system I don't call them Comic-fantasy. I think of Sci-Fantasy as being more like Shadowrun. &&It's almost like.....it's both science-fiction....AND fantasy.&&Best Western is the Star Wars of hotels.&&The ending of ANH is literally a canyon cavalry charge. There's a lot of western in the first movie, especially. &&> cinefix called it the best western, which the originals definitely leaned towards

Okay. I can see shades of that, but I'd still call the series a sci-fi/fantasy before anything else. &&I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you but if you lived in such an environment and were so used to it would you need to explain everything? When you watch Die Hard or John Wick, for example, there is no explanation for electricity, the internet, how computers or cars work, the chemistry of powder in a bullet, or the atomic structure of a gold coin.

I don't think the definition of sci-fi should hinge just on in-story stuff being explained that the people in the story would find tedious.&&I honestly wish it was MORE space samurai western, I love that shit&&And the fact that it absolutely fucking destroyed the entire previous movie's story with a nuclear bomb that spelled out a ""Fuck you"" in the mushroom cloud.

No but seriously, after watching The Last Jedi, all I could think was ""Rian, Did you even watch the previous 7 films? Because this has almost nothing to do with the previous 7 films.""&&On a film budget, the top sheet has the Cast, Writers, and Directors above an actual physically drawn line, as this is usually the most expensive part of making a film.

The Phantom Menace, yes, definitely. But Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith have CGI which still looks fantastic. The battle over Coruscant looks like it really happened.&&I can't imagine how that wasn't questioned more when the movie was in post...

""You sure we shouldn't just kill off Leia in this scene now that Carrie Fisher has passed away?""

""You kiddin'? People love when characters use the force completely out of context and in ways not previously established in any of the other movies! This movie has a ton of that. People will love it! Besides, well just kill her character off screen in the next movie like we did Admiral Ackbar. No one gives a shit about these old fucks. People want new characters with no backstories so they can start fresh with the series amirite? Right?!""

Right...&&/r/nothanks &&Nothing really happened in the first hour of either movies. The first movie had a romantic element that wasn’t fleshed out even a tiny bit, and the 2nd movie had a lot things that were done to be arts for arts sake. Biggest factor I think is both movies had really anticlimactic endings. They were good endings, but anticlimactic nonetheless.

Prometheus and Alien: Covenant should have both been amazing or at least decent. But it's really hard to enjoy watching a movie where even I would know what they are doing is stupid. Scientists who don't behave like rational scientists just blows my belief in the world. I can handle supernatural things and make believe science, but at least behave like a fucking rational scientist. Biologists meet potentially hostile alien life and instantly decide to play with it?

I'm gonna remain optimistic that he will for now, though, because I really want to love this trilogy.&&>didn't have the right people to help him fill in the details

The prequels had tons of details, good details at that. They are on GoT levels in terms of details and plot thickness, it's really surprising to me rewatching them far later in life; they were exceptionally dense for being blockbuster movies. Or just movies. There aren't many trilogies with that level of detail and complexity. And they even outshone the originals (in this respect). I recall simply not being able to follow it all on first viewing as a teen, which was rare.

While GRRM might make for grittier and, well, better storytelling, Lucas certainly tried to reach that level in his writing, and mostly succeeded, though it took until the third film for it to shine.

When you strip away young Anakin and Jar Jar, it's a really stunning sci-fi story he made, though poorly executed at times. I guess that's what happens when you start with the solid OT foundation and add decades of development and world building. But it feels like Azimov (probably not coincidental), rather than a sleek Dick or Clarke work.

I would say the issue wasn't with the storytelling but the directing, and a few too many kid-friendly executive decisions made for the first film.

ETA crap.&&And they went in without knowing it could become  trilogy. The ST was made knowing it was going to be 3 movies. &&He literally gave a TED talk where he said he likes stories that have mysteries, but he doesn't care about what the solution is.&&JJs the type of guy to invite the next director to the first day  of shooting and go “Inhave an amazing surprise, the answer to all your questions about the script and the story is... nothing! Absolutely nothing! Now YOU have the freedom to do whatever you want! You’re welcome.”&&Too young for the reverand mother I'd say. Her accent would be perfect for Shani though. &&As long as we get a sex scene with her, I say cast her in every fucking movie that’s being made. &&Oh yeah. Google it. It's a bit far off but it's going down. &&Part of me hopes it is, because we've had kind of a crummy lead up to IX as it is. Other than Rey-Ren's whole deal, everything is kinda empty, there's not too much of an overarching story other than Rey-Ren, which is relatively strong, and Rebels vs Empire again, and that's already pretty weak.

I'd rather an extra movie to clear things up and establish a more compelling story, even if it drags the series on, than a limp conclusion, but that's probably just me.&&Dune?&&Disney’s mistake was allowing each film to be helmed by a completely different director with no real set plan for overarching plot flow. 

Like the reason MCU works well overall is because they have Feige and his team that make sure everything maintains continuity and they don’t just bandy all over the place. &&The only reason it was good was because you didn't know what those things were, once you found out jj doesn't even know it loses its magic &&The mystery box is why this trilogy is subpar. JJ left a buncha loose threads that even he had no answer for and let somebody else sort it out. If he'd had some kinda vision beyond ANH rehash meets se1 of Lost, the series might be in better shape. Abrams is a huge part of the problem.&&> It was the people behind 8 who decides that rather than expand on all of that in a sequel is better to throw it all out.

It stands at the top of the mountain for me, followed by the Jason segal reboot (but not the awful sequel to that one).&&Shadowrun is cyberpunk fantasy dude, not sci fi. Or is cyberpunk part of sci fi? This is all too confusing &&The setting is sci-fi but the story certainly isn't. Not that it really matters.&&*space opera*&&What does this even mean&&It depends on your definition of sci-fi. Arguing on semantics is dumb.

From the wikipedia page for the subject : 
> Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a ""literature of ideas"". It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy. Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.

For me SW absolutely does not fit in that definition.

- It's never our technological innovations, in fact there's no innovation in that universe, just make bigger death stars and bigger star destroyers
- It's got supernatural (The Force), and only the supernatural as an explanation for anything remotely in need of an explanation, how does the Death Star work? In R.O it's basically mine some force crystals and stickem in there. If they try to explain something with some sort of science speak like ""midochlorians"" than it ruins the universe as a whole, suddenly it's not magic and it's quantifiable.
- The entire arc of the movies is based on WW2 and its politics, the rebel alliance vs the empire (Allies vs Nazi Germany+Japan)
- Entire planets have one village, the rest is a giant forest or desert. They used to be better with this in the original trilogy and the prequels but the new trilogy is AWFUL at it, so far WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SEMBLANCE OF A POPULATED PLANET and even if it's not sci-fi, they need to stop doing that becuase it's killing the usual scaling of the universe.

Anyway, I rambled, but it irks me when anyone wants to categorise SW as Sci-Fi when it's not.
&&I'm holding out hope for a standalone Obi-Wan film that's just straight Ronin.&&Yeah, I wish fantasy had more fusion stuff! Most of the time it's just looking at medieval Europe through a fantasy lense. I always wanted someone to make a fantasy series based off ancient Mayan or Aztec culture.&&I.E., the guys that actually do the grunt work necessary to *make the movie*. Having skilled personnel there is important, too!&&The line is actually a separation between variable cost and invariable cost, i.e. The number of shoot days/prep days the crew(below the line) works is subject to change and this creates a variable line item in the budget whereas a producer (above the line) will make the same during production regardless the number of shoot days 

Edit: to further clarify, below the line are on hourly rates.

Source: am below the line&&I doubt they wanted to remove the Leia and Luke moment towards the end, it was one of the best moments in the film so I'm glad they didn't.&&Almost certainly what happened was that they were *going* to do that, but then realized they had a scene with Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill, their very last scene in the entire franchise, and like hell were they gonna cut that. So flying space corpse it is. &&Let’s try to focus more on the Finn/Rose love story. Maybe we can get some of that sweet, sweet crossover appeal money like Titanic.

Screw Luke. Yeah the fans have waited 30yrs and granted we can only use him in one more movie, but let’s make sure he has a throwaway character.&&To be fair, they got Luke's astral projection from The Old Republic lore.

People in Star Wars just don't talk like that.&&> Meh I feel like the sequel trilogy thus tar at least feels like it takes place in the same universe as the OT. The prequels really didn't, they just had this sterile lifless feel to them.

In a way this is actually a problem. The prequels at least made the Star Wars Galaxy feel bigger and more diverse, showing a large array of cities, civilizations, and people living their lives in a big colorful galaxy. The sequels have not captured that feeling of newness and exploration. They feel very narrow.&&The prequel suffered from bad writing and directing, BUT despite its flaws, it was a fun movie to watch (Even Attack of the Clone, the worst in the entire series, fare better in the world building), it had many different aliens and set pieces to look at. The Clone battle was incredible. Anakin'subplot while cringy in some area, also had good moments.  

The problem with the prequel aside from bad writing and directing, was that it was also plagued by tell, not showing. Despite all that, I can watch the prequels so many time and not get bored with it. Yes, the Phantom Menace was awesome, I loved the Tatooine subplot and its setting. It made me feel like I was there with the crews, it made me ""feel"" the sweltering heat. The ambient sound of a busy market place was superb. 

The Last Jedi? It was a pretty looking movie that was incredibly dull with nothing going on. There was no world building at all. Cato Blight was minimal at best with not much to see. Jar Jar is an annoying character, but I didn't hate him at all, compare him with Rose, I HATE her so much. There is a difference in hating a well-developed asshole character to a poorly written character that is just one of the worst the cinema has ever seen and I feel bad for Kelly Maria because she was so excited to be in motherfucking Star Wars and they fucked it all up for her. )&&Stop being gross.&&NEXT!&&I agree. Preparation H does feel great, *on the whole*&&From eagle point of view it does look stupid that she ran in a straight line, but from her point of view running perpendicular or diagonal probably didn't cross her mind seeing as a fucking building was about to fall on her.&&You left out that the map guy got lost.

It's perfectly natural to get lost in the wonder of a new species (even though he did not present himself as that kinda guy). But the map guy gets lost?? You have one job. It wasn't even before the mapping was done. The caverns had been mapped for hours. No excuse for that kinda shit.

And I get there are supposed to be elements of horror, people are gonna get got, but that, along with the biologist losing his sense of caution, just felt lazy. &&I wanted to like it, but I felt that they didn't explain jack shit for a lot of it and unfortunately that kinda ruined my enjoyment. I was never bored watching it though, and thought it had the potential to be a really good movie. &&That scene with the biologist even makes a certain amount of sense when you factor in that the entire theme of the movie is how often humanity's reach exceeds our grasp, and how our hubris is our downfall.&&True, but ""The Prometheus School of Running Away From Things"" has a nice ring to it, don't you think?&&Nothing wrong with Covenant. The problem is that movie elitist hate anything that isn’t a masterpiece like Schindler’s List. &&Ever see a horror movie?&&They flat out tell you these people aren't the best and brightest.

And honestly, if I had to guess where that ship would fall after quick glance, perfectly rolling like a donut would be my last guess, I would've thought it'd fall straight over.  Running in the direction they did would've saved them if it'd fallen straight over.&&Affiliated with the Game of Thrones school of running.&&Not every scientist is perfectly rational and I'd imagine it takes a little less rationality to even go on an expedition like that.  Even loose cannons can get degrees.  That was his personality.  He took risks and wasn't always rational.  Maybe that's the best they could find who would actually go.

He was convinced that the planet had been terraformed for human-like people, so he took the chance.  Jonas Salk infected himself with Polio because he was convinced he had the cure.  That was arguably insane and not rational, too.  It worked though.

I've met some scientists that while brilliant, had much less common sense than you'd think.  The two don't always go hand in hand.  If that makes the movie less real to you, then okay.  It makes it more real to me though.  Having a full team of perfect scientists who do everything perfectly just isn't realistic to me.&&Hah, yeah the writing could be better in some places. Still so much to love about them other than some mediocre writing though. &&It's a good B movie, the previous attempt by Universal to kick off their Monsters Cinematic Universe (MCU). The lead does a great job with a mediocre script and direction.&&My favorite Dracula movie. 9/10 for me&&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.&&Not particularly, that subreddit is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. &&I know what you mean but reading that sentence at face value is funny&&>You need to look up his filmography  

Damn, that's just fucking ridiculous.&&Don't the Oscars always screw people over? Main reason I don't watch it.&&As much as I like drive and Gosling's acting, that movie is not at all his showcase. Refn directed a great fucking movie that gosling was merely a part of. 

The fundamental element that makes that movie work is gosling never trying to be an action hero. He did his job the way refn designed the film and never took away from the effect. 

Watch it again. Most of the big set pieces or important scenes don't have gosling chewing scenery or conveying great depth or pontificating. Its complacency or purpose. 

He knows where he is, where he wants to be and how to get there. He doesn't make a big deal out of anything. But on the flip side he doesn't dramaticize anything he does. He speaks softly and carries a big stick but only out of context. There is no chest beating in either the directing or the acting. 

I love that damn movie. But it's not really a big deal when it comes to Gosling's acting. &&For example, The Believer (2001).&&I forgot about The Nice Guys, I really enjoyed that one as well!&&How do you like my car big boy?&&It was The Nice Guys, then?&&> because I really want to love this trilogy.

:( me too, theyre making it really hard&&You'll be disappointed.  There never was a plan.  What plots did exist were half-complete, and most of those were utterly tossed in the garbage during TLJ.  Ep 9 essentially has nothing to work with.  Might as well be a standalone story.&&I don't know how salvageable it is anymore. JJ made an entertaining if derivative TFA, and Rian Johnson just totally fucking retconned it. It's rare that a sequel actually invalidates and makes worse its predecessor.&&That's the interesting thing about the prequels vs the sequels. They have opposite problems.

The prequels had a fundamentally good, interesting, moving story, with a ton of creativity and detail, but they were executed abysmally. The CG was distracting, the editing was flat, the dialogue was stiff, and the acting was beyond wooden.

The sequels are extremely slick movies - they're snappy, fun, beautiful, and well acted. But the story is a hot mess that makes no sense, doesn't seem to be going anywhere, and is obnoxiously derivative of the original trilogy.&&And yet it doesn't feel like it at all. 

Force Awakens and Last Jedi felt like they were made completely separate from each other. &&[deleted]&&I am about finish with book 2 so am very hype. Thanks! &&> Rebels vs Empire

I'm sure they can come up with more synonyms a la ""Resistance vs New Order""&&Yeah, he said his Dune is gonna be Star Wars for adults &&Absolutely, the tone shift between 7 and 8 is way off.&&The problem was not JJ not knowing. It was the fact that lucasfilm didn’t want JJ to decide that stuff. They wanted those to be open ended so that Rian Johnson could choose to do whatever he wanted. Lucasfilm wanted to have no overall plan for the trilogy and that’s what they did.&&> once you found out jj doesn't even know it loses its magic

[That sounds familiar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Lost_main_title.svg/1200px-Lost_main_title.svg.png).&&Which is sometimes the best story writing. When you leave nothing to the imagination it loses that special appeal. It's the reason why a lot of science fiction sequels fail to live up to the originals. When you answer too many questions you leave nothing for the audience to speculate about.


&&I'm pretty sure JJ had ideas as to where his version of the story would go. Not really his fault if Lucasfilm let Rian throw it all out for shock value.  &&No the fault is in Lucasfilm for not planning it beforehand and let each director do what they want. It's likely that JJ had ideas for those mysteries but Johnson just threw them away. It would not surprise me if Episode IX establishes that Rey's parents are not nobodies and Kylo lied for example. Or that we get a Snoke backstory and the Knights of Ren there. All big mysteries set up in TFA that TLJ decides to discard completely.&&Sci-fi in the streets, fantasy in the sheets. &&The based prequels were sci-fi - clone armies, magic powers explained by chemical imbalances, lots of political argument, experimental frog castoffs&&That just struck a cord in my heart. You're right, and I'd gold you if I could. &&The grunt work is pretty easy. That's why it's grunt work. Most credit goes to the designers, editors, directors, etc.

Credit goes to grunts for sure, but let's not kid ourselves.&&Someone else also pointed this out. It was one of the few genuinely good moments, so I can see why they kept it. &&If you watch the film closely you'll notice that the only reason for the space Leia scene was to explain how Finn gets the tracker to Rey. That's the only plot relevant consequence of that event is that she drops the tracker and Finn picks it up. 

&&That scene with them together is actually one of the finer points of the movie. I did enjoy it, but it feels incredibly disjointed with the film as a whole. &&They gave him perhaps the best death for a Jedi master.&&Or literally any force power since every power has to be used for the first time at some point. &&The force lightning came from a character who was alluded to being extremely powerful and menacing. Cracking out Force lightning emphasized how powerful he was in comparison to Luke and Vader. Leia, on the other hand, went from having hints of being force sensitive to pulling herself through the vacuum’s of space, randomly. It just felt forced.&&Its so dense, every single image has so many things going on.&&Mystery boxes!&&I used to agree with that when I first saw TFA however after re-watching the originals, I picked up that a lot of the dialogue came across as how normal people from earth in the 70’s would talk if they were put in space. (*how are you? Boring conversation anyways*, *walking carpet*, *don’t get cocky*, etc)


Looking back on it, its kind of similar to how the new movies’ dialogue felt like how people from today would talk and act if they were put in space. (*who talks first?*, *did you see that, did you see that!?*, *thats not how the force works!*, Finn’s head motions, etc) The OT even had “damn” and “hell”, words I at first I cringed at in TFA but then realized were actually used in the OT.



For some reason it was instilled in my brain that the prequel’s old-timey, Shakespeare-esque sounding dialogue was the norm for Star Wars, which is why TFA threw me off so much. (*So love has blinded you?*, *you were my brother Anakin*, M’Lady* etc.)

So my head canon is that since the prequels took place in the distant past, the dialogue came across more medieval, which is why OT has some modern sounding dialogue and mannerisms, and the ST with even MORE modern sounding dialogue and mannerisms. 

EDIT: Included some examples of dialogue to help showcase my point&&Yeah I'll give you that, the dialogue was too fourth wall light. I want to get lost in my fantasy, not reminded that I'm watching a movie. &&It was very apparent that it was a film made in 2015.

""Who talks first? You talk first? I talk first?""

""What's this? *motions head* Why are you doing all this? *motions head more*""&&> People in Star Wars just don't talk like that.

So the way people talk in our galaxy can change after 40 years, but it's not allowed to change in the Star Wars galaxy over the same time period?&&Here on Reddit, we are *all* language innovators. Sophisticated, lingo-coordinators, rather.

Cunning linguists, some might quip.&&Which is exactly why I don’t consider that criticism of the movie to be a valid reason to hate it. At least for me.
Want to bitch about the story opening thirty thousand different things like the mural that is never explained, or the mutiny on the ship by the engineers? Sure. That was a dick move that comes off as a shameless attempt to force sequels (I’m not entirely sure it wasn’t). 

The way I look at it is that if you’re bitching about the sauce on your pizza being too red, it’s not the pizza you have a problem with. It’s just nit-picking details to fight over.&&I liked that. Me and my friends have watched it many times together and alone and come back and had discussions about new things we’ve learned or changed our opinion on. 

It’s way more interesting than if they had just told us everything imo. That’s a problem I have with a lot of modern sci-fi &&See, I liked some of the more abstract stuff in Prometheus, felt like enough was implied to make sense, and appreciated taking the series in more of a conceptual sci-fi direction rather than horror.

I think Alien: Covenant was an overall more fun ride, but felt like characters acted more stupidly in it than they ever did in Prometheus.  I mean, seriously, none of the problems in Covenant would have occurred if the colonists had just worn helmets on, you know, an undiscovered alien planet to begin with.  At least in Prometheus, they had the sense to check the air for breathability and toxins before they took their helmets off.

My main problem with Prometheus is that the monster(s)/black goo just didn’t have the same sense of clear yet surprising evolution as the original xenomorph in Alien.  I mean, I got the biological weapon aspect and it’s unpredictability, but it also just gave the writers free reign to make up other weird shit to happen.

Both movies have their problems.  I guess I just enjoyed Prometheus for trying something new, rather than Covenant which felt like a rehash of the old Alien movies with more idiotic characters.&&I was perfectly fine with Prometheus asking a lot of questions with no answers given, I really disliked than Alien Covenant answered practically none of those questions.  For all it's flaws, Prometheus filled me with a huge sense of wonder and it was really frustrating to see that wonder get crushed into a by the books Alien movie.&&Do you feel like Alien (1979) explained everything to you? 

It’s actually OK for things to be enigmatic. Trust me on this. &&It was a really good movie. It had the potential to be a great one. &&As someone who'd never seen an Aliens movie, I enjoyed Prometheus and Covenant.&&This might be a random question, but where is the line between not being bored and being entertained throughout a movie? I’m asking because I’ve *disliked* maybe three or four movies in my life (I’m 34), and it’s because they bored me in one or more ways. 

If they’re constantly having jokes that don’t land or cringe-worthy interactions or characters you simply can’t and won’t have any interest in... then it bores me. But I mean shit if you’re entertained, isn’t it a good movie? They can’t all be your favorite right?

Do you watch movies like you’re reviewing them beforehand? I’m genuinely curious in case I’m being unclear. &&They planned to make it a trilogy, but did a really bad job communicating that to the audience. I liked it because to me it was clear that we've just seen part one of a larger story, but apparently I'm not [Bill Dauterive](https://youtu.be/8tOJW_2cHgo?t=306).&&How about the fact that they take the effort to map out the entire tunnel system with drones and then immediately after doing that two people get lost. Then they can’t rescue them because of a storm that came out of nowhere that they didn’t anticipate but then they immediately know that it will be gone by the morning. 

Movies are better when the characters aren’t idiots and the script is good. I don’t know what else to tell you. Monsters outsmarting clever people is more terrifying than monsters outsmarting bumbling fools &&Hello there!&&It's treason, then &&No one's arguing who's showcase it was. The point is that it was Ryan Gosling's most iconic role up to that point in his career. At least, it was the one that was big enough to show everyone he was more than just a lady's man, since his two biggest roles before that were The Notebook and Crazy, Stupid, Love. 

Plus you really can't say he didn't do much, there were some intense scenes that he sold the hell out of. And with what little he was given to do, he did fantastically. He was clearly more than just himself during the movie, he was the character. 

You really can't say the film isn't a big deal for Gosling. It was a big deal for both Refn and Gosling. Hell, if it wasn't for those two teaming up it's possible we might not have gotten Gosling in Blade Runner: 2049. &&That's a bingo.&&Don't love what doesn't deserve to be loved I guess&&> What plots did exist were half-complete, and most of those were utterly tossed in the garbage during TLJ.

The two biggest complaints I've seen so far in regards to ""thrown out plotlines"" is Rey's parentage and Snoke's origin.

But TLJ did resolve Rey's parentage. It wasn't thrown out. An answer was given, but the answer wasn't what people wanted to hear, so they yell ""plot hole"" at the top of their lungs, despite it not being one. Just because it didn't confirm someone's theory, doesn't mean it's a bad resolution to the plot thread.

I'll agree that even a single line about Snoke's origin would be nice, if just to explain his place in the story between ROTJ and TFA, but no matter how you would turn it, he's still just the Emperor 2.0, and I'm happy he was offed in the second movie, so we can have a more unpredictable story in IX.&&Eh, she's gorgeous but too water fat. I mean that in the same sense as in the book. Fremen should be lean, tough, and sinewy.&&I'm jealous you get to experience it all for the first time.&&I've got some right here:

Terrorists vs Brave Men and Women&&Which will be interesting because Dune is nigh unfilmable&&I liked the Last Jedi as a movie, for the most part. That being said, I think it was kind of a bad sequel to the Force Awakens. TLJ feels like the sequel film to the version of the Force Awakens Johnson wishes he made. &&Which is retarded. Look at all the post-TFA speculation discussions. Lots of people theorised about what was going to happen. Then Rian shit all over everything and set up... what, exactly?

9 has to start from scratch, because there's nothing left to resolve. It's going to suck because there's no overarching plot to pull together.&&Which is one of my big gripes with with prequels. Sure, everyone talks about midichlorians but the way the force is showed is seriously disappointing. Force is basically reduced to generic superhero abilities, while in OT it's showed as something which extent and potential can't be measured and has no limits except for strength of one who wields it. Basically magic. I am glad we are back to that.&&Midiclorians are microscopic lifeforms not chemicals.&&Editors are the unsung heroes of filmmaking. The movie is made in the edit room. 

You could have all the best VFX, acting, directing and sound effects in your film but if editing sucks, your movie ends up sucking as well.&&Yeah but they lost so much just for that one moment. The whole space Leia is dumb, and took a lot of flak, and now they have to get rid of Leia offscreen somehow. It's a tiny gain compared to all the idiocy that came out of it. &&>  I did enjoy it, but it feels incredibly disjointed with the film as a whole.

Isn't that how most of the movie feels? Like, the parts that are good are fucking amazing- all of the salt planet, Luke, Leia, Kylo Ren, etc. There's several ""peak Star Wars"" moments. But then there's this other kind of bad movie that exists in the same space. It's *so* inconsistent. &&I mean JJ boxed Rian into a corner with Luke. Something really, really bad had to happen for him to run away from everyone.

Now one thing that I think would have made that scene better would have been if Luke was really there and they actually had a saber fight with Luke kicking his ass, but pulling an Obi-Wan, to let the rest escape.

For some reason, Rian really wanted that ""Tattoine"" scene...&&Easy: intro it in a non-pivotal context. When Obi-Wan first uses the mind trick, it’s not a big deal because they probably could have run off or fought those stormtroopers anyway. Blindsight is introduced in Luke’s training sequence.

The lightning is kind of a twist, but I’d argue it’s not really pivotal when first shown. It doesn’t matter that much (at first) that it’s lightning vs. a lightsaber; either could torture Luke.  Though the particulars matter a little later when it disables Vader’s suit.&&Fuck you, Rick Berman!&&Its gonna be great&&GOON-GAN&&>

Oh jeez you just reminded me of the people that come into my restaurant and order the salmon then return it because it's ""too fishy""; for one, it's a fucking *fish*, and secondly it's on the fishier side of fish flavors which is still a redundantly stupid thing to complain about.&&It's the CinemaSins style of ""movie criticism"" and it's pretty much destroying the way people view films, in my opinion. &&That's kinda what I really liked.

But that’s just what I think.&&To be fair Covenant kind of shit the bed by actually trying to be an Alien film.

Even if it wasn't always handle brillantly he has a more depth as a character than the rest of the protagonist (Rey hero because she can, Finn stormtrooper who rebeled because he has a bit of moral, Poe a Pilot who crack Joke...).

I'm really wondering how they will handle Leia though, the only survivor of the old cast but don't have an actress to play her.

Incredibles 2 - Olympics Sneak Peek,60282,7xnroa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBpdL9hSac4,3897,1518665708.0,,"I wonder if Mirage will make an appearance in this movie. Would be cool if she did. I wonder what happened to her after she helped Bob and his family off the island. &&New Dash voice is pretty good especially from such a young actor&&I hope Spencer Fox (the original voice of Dash) gets a cameo, just like Alexander Gould (the original voice of Nemo) got a cameo in Finding Dory.&&It's always weird and interesting seeing CG characters we know so well being updated for 2018. You really notice how far animation has come. &&**I DID MY WAITING. 14 YEARS OF IT.﻿**&&So what are the odds that exec becomes a bad guy &&One of my favorite parts of the first one was how accurate the family interactions were. This one looks just as good with that stuff. &&Wow this movie is picking up literally RIGHT after the last one.

I honestly can't wait to own this DVD, splice the two movies together, and just watch the entire 4 hours in one sitting.&&Thank God, it's finally the real one.&&THAT WAS SO TOTALLY WICKED!&&Is that Bob Odenkirk I hear?&&My god, that smack Jack Jack gives Bob is beyond charming.&&""MATH. IS. MATH!""

Man, a lot to unpack in this teaser, but I am most excited to see some witty parents/kids banter. Dash's ""It defines who I am"" bit got a hearty chuckle out of me.&&Incredible&&Looks great. I just hope the family isn't split apart the entire movie again. I really want to see them working together and definitely not for Bob to be sidelined. &&I was iffy on the trailer until the “math” bit. That’s that old INCREDIBLES charm I missed!&&Love how Frozone and Mr. Incredible have spent years teaming up to fight crime together, but are just not prepared whatsoever to team up and babysit.&&Does anyone remember the bonus short ""The Adventures of Mr Incredible"" where you can hear Mr Incredible and Frozone giving a commentary on it. I miss when Disney and Pixar made extra and bonus features like that. Hope Disney finds a way with their streaming service to bring stuff like that back.&&I love the attention to detail on the hair and clothing.&&We'll fuck my ass, Frozone looks like he's gonna have way more to do with the plot this time! Also, they've been making a big deal about how this movie is supposed to focus more on Helen while Bob's shenanigans is the B Plot, but I didn't really get that feeling? Maybe it's just this trailer but idk, kinda seems like it'll still focus more on Bob than Helen. 


Edit: It's Valentine's Day bitches, so that typo is staying. &&14 years... I’ve waited 14 years for this. That music is so nostalgic and just makes me feel like a kid again! I just can’t wait till June! This movie is gonna be so much fun!&&Shadman is going to have a field day tomorrow and for the next couple months leading up to the sequel's release. Expect to see a new surge of Mrs Incredible art for a while folks.&&Didn't know Bob Odenkirk was in this, looked it up and so is Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmantraut)!&&The animation looks BEAUTIFUL!&&I love how it looks like this will be Helen reliving her glory days while he is basically a stay at home mom, since the first one was more about his mid life crisis and her supporting him. I can't fucking wait&&This looks like it's gonna be as witty and relatable as the last one, as much as a sequel can be. You can tell the subtle difference between voice actors in the last one and this one for dash but they pretty much got it spot on! Mann I'm gonna be in the theater so early for good seats lol&&ELASTIGIRL LOOKING #THICCCCCCCCC&&#FUCKING FINALLY

What the fuck took you so long Disney.

Anyway, I'm very excited for this film... Hopefully it turns out better than Finding Dory. &&The Incredibles is the greatest superhero movie of all time. Shouldn't be hard to follow up &&I'm very here for Edna as the villain. That robe is hiding secrets. &&I hope they don't oversaturate Jack-Jack in the movie and make him more annoying than cute. &&When I heard they were reversing the roles of Mr. and Mrs. Incredible I was worried it would be like Finding Dory or Cars 2 where Marlin and McQueen were cast off to the side. Relieved to see it looks like Bob and Helen will still have equal footing like they did in the first, they're both such interesting characters and sacrificing one for the other would totally hurt the movie.&&I'm going to really miss Mirage :(&&I really hope this movie isn't just a daddy day care trope. &&Soo, it's the first movie except reversed from the looks of it.&&So it's just Mr. Mom but with super powers? &&Babies on sugar cookies. The only thing that can defeat an Mr. Incredible.&&YEAH BABY! FIRE!&&This disappoints me, to be honest. The ending of the first one had them finally fighting together as a superhero family. It kinda just feels forced to do the ""oh, now the roles are reversed! The dad has to be the stay at home parent while the mom goes out and does the work!"" It's a cliche story reversal now. It's uninteresting and really disappointing that such an original company is resorting to it. I get the point and it's heartfelt but man, I was expecting a lot better and a genuine continuation not what seems to be basically a restart. &&I really want Violet to get some more screentime this go around. I felt that she was the weakest of the 4 and didn't ""Wow!"" me as much as Dash,Helen, or Bob did. Even in this trailer she takes a major backseat again.&&Ok I'll be the one to say something negative.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting but Mr. Incredible being a stay-at-home dad wasn't it.  I'm sure there will be a couple laughs like the math bit but if the major story is going to be the entire family struggling with not being superheroes while Elastigirl is out having fun I think that's a disappointing plot.

I mean if that's really what the main story is going to be it's almost like the first movie didn't even happen and we're back at square one again.

EDIT:  I would like to make clear that my issue with the “stay-at-Home dad” thing I mentioned had nothing to do with gender roles (which some people have replied with) and more to do with the fact that  “pretending to be a normal family” is exactly where the first one starts out.  We’ve already seen this.  And I get that “secret identities” are going to be a part of any superhero story but making it the dominant plot point again feels lazy to me.&&the plot doesn't look as exciting as I'd expected&&A couple of things I noticed.

1.) My god has the animation improved since the first movie.

2.) That superhero publicist is definitely the bad guy. This premise was the exact same as the one that Bob Chipman pitched in his video imagining the Fantastic Four in the MCU. I swear, it's like Disney saw it and ran with it. &&Mrs Incredible lookin exxxtra thicc as always &&Unfortunately her voice actor passed a way a couple years ago&&She died in '14 I think. I don't know the whole medical terminology but I think she may have drank to much alcohol. 

Edit: cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol. Caused gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiac arrest and several other things. &&[deleted]&&I have to admit. For a cartoon character she was pretty sexy tbh&&Oh wow, I didn't even think about that. The kid that played him originally has grown up now lol&&I still find it weird they cast a child voice actor for Dash, but went with a woman for Violet. But then again, a lot of voice acting is done by women if the characters are boys.&&What character did Alexander Gould voice in Finding Dory?&&Does Violet have the same voice?&&I lived a town over from him and went to the same college as him. Talented guy. I hope he gets a cameo too!! He’s in a band now called Charly Bliss. &&Wait..... that wasn’t the original Nemo?!? I just assumed it was a woman doing that voice and I didn’t notice for a second that it was someone different!!! Same with dash... they sound exactly the same to me!!!

Edit: grammar&&Going from Toy Story to Toy Story 3 is a wild ride for sure&&Yeah but I also think the animation has underwent a small change to appear more comic book styled. Correct me if I’m wrong&&Dash looks *muscular*

Like, woah&&This movie is going to be as much as a nostalgia trip for me as much as it's an academic study related to my major. I was just a kid when the first one came out, and now I'm at the age where I'm going for 3D animation in college. &&Tangentially related: Digital Foundry recently did a video about the graphics in Kingdom Hearts 3, which features a Toy Story level/world, and compares KH3 with each of the Toy Story movies. You can really appreciate how far Pixar grew over the years and how, until compared side by side, you most likely wouldn't have noticed the subtle differences.

https://youtu.be/tkDadVrBr1Y
&&I like how they make that thing reverse on Monsters University, they look more simplistic and with less detail than the first one because the characters were younger&&Too late! *Fourteen years too late.*

Just kidding. I'm so pumped&&All jokes aside, that was the best acted scene of that entire series.  &&This guy Azkabans.&&The time we've spent waiting for this movie is the same that Buddy spent plotting his revenge on Bob.&&Has it really been 14 years!? Wtf I remember watching it in theaters &&**AND NO HAND ME DOWN COWBOY DOLL IS GONNA MESS IT UP FOR ME NOW!!**&&I doubt it, that's the same plot as the first movie.

The villain has to be someone unexpected.

And hopefully unrelated to Syndrome.

And hopefully an actual super.&&The exec is named Winston Deavor, and his sister(not in the trailer) is named Evelyn Deavor. 

Evelyn Devor.

Hold on lemme get my tinfoil hat


&&Played by Bob Odenkirk&&I audibly chuckled when Jack-Jack woke Bob up by flicking his face. Little things like that can really make this sequel work.&&WHY WOULD THEY CHANGE MATH?&&Oh man, just remembering them arguing directions brings a smile to my face.&&I've yelled ""Math is math"" to my kids in a pretty much exact situation ...&&The math homework hit too close to home as a brother that sometimes helps his younger siblings&&If anything, the Incredibles has the best dialogue compared to most Disney animated movies. &&The math thing had me cackling. Lots of flashbacks to me and dad at the kitchen table working on my math at 10 PM.&&It would be interesting due to the sudden massive animation improvement once the first one ends. &&*sigh* I guess the Underminer video game isn't canon anymore &&Holy shit, it never even occurred to me we'll be able to do that. Fuck yeah. &&Idk, I feel like the 14 year jump in animation might be a bit jarring at first.&&Why not get it on VHS too while you're at it!&&We get there when we get there!&&That kid *needs* to be in this one, and say something like, ""FINALLY!"" or something.&&Yes!

Edit: All I said was yes!&&I recognized his voice instantly. On a side note, when the hell is Better Call Saul Season 4 airing?&&Jonathan Banks is in this movie to.&&It'd be funny to have Saul Goodman as the family lawyer who gets them out of trouble whenever they are blamed for property damage.&&That's what I was hoping the sequel would keep. Don't get me wrong: I still need the action and comedy, but the charm is the most memorable part of the movie.&&As a parent who's had to deal with some horrible new methods for teaching math, I really sympathized with Bob there.&&That hit home with me so hard! &&The family humor looks good, but I'm concerned the overall plot looks too much like a re-hash of the original. Also I still feel like aging everyone could have introduced funnier/more interesting family situations&&Never heard that one before.&&Oh, ho ho! You sly dog!&&Helen's melons&&Indeed&&Say that again&&""That was totally wicked!""&&It's clearly gonna be mamma is out on her own whilst daddy looks after home and then mamma gets into trouble and they need to go save her but since he cant get a sitter baby comes along. &&My favourite things about the incredibles movie was that they made family so important even with powers - like how violet and dash work together to make that super fast zorb ball. I hope we see more of that!&&I get the feeling there's gonna be some elastigirl/Ms Incredible though process going in, with her ditching elastigirl for Ms Incredible at the end after an epiphany of sorts.&&Done *properly*...&&I sympathize with him. Most of my previous math teachers deducted score for solving a question with a method that they hadn't taught yet. &&The movie feels like its going in a interesting direction. Kind of like the reverse of the previous movie.&&A super hero movie about....people. I enjoy the Marvel movies but it's funny that Pixar has more human and relatable stories.&&*Common Core*&&""We meet agai— AH""&&Is it really babysitting when it's his own kid?&&I was going to call out the writing for the old ""dad can't take care of the kid"" trope but it's Jack-Jack; anyone would be a mess watching that baby.&&I died at the end when Jack-Jack turns into that demon thing and Frozone freaks out. &&It's the toughest job in the world.&&I know its a kids movie but isnt that like one of the biggest cliches ever?

Dumb old dad cant even handle taking care of his own kid

I guess the twist is that its a super kid so whatever Ill give it a chance.&&Sleep-deprived Bob is best Bob&&Why’s everybody got lady lips?&&All of the extras on the Incredibles DVD were crazy good, but that one was the best. The kids love Mr. Skipperdoo.&&DID YOU OKAY THE RABBIT!?!?&&I'LL CRUSH YOU MR. INCREDIBLE&&They even did bloopers for Toy Story 1 and 2! Those were legit hilarious. &&Disney are basically the experts in hair physics at this point. Tangled, monsters inc, and (by association) warcraft&&It's half the story. I'm sure other trailers will show more of her story, once it's been fleshed out more.

Or we won't get any sneak peaks into her story, which I also will kinda like, adds some suspense to the movie.&&I think them more focusing on the Bob/Jack-Jack stuff isn't emblematic of their importance to the film, just that it is customary that trailers for kids films, especially the first trailer, focus on the cutesy/fun stuff that kids really like. For instance The first trailer for Frozen was a 1 minute short of Sven trying to eat Olaf's carrot nose, which is not representative of the final film at all. In fact Frozen is a perfect example of how trailers for kids films evolve. First trailer is the cutesy/merchandise stuff, Second was more about the Anna and Hans adventure with the Ice/Elsa aspect seeming more like a macguffin, and then the third trailer sold the hell out of Elsa and the music (i.e. the stuff that makes frozen interesting).  I believe the strategy is basically:

 a) first hook the kids, they are your core audience, advertise it so that they'll beg their parents to see it 

b) next trailer provide basic set-up, remind kids of funny stuff

 c) Sell it for the adults, make it look interesting to them, after all they are the ones buying the tickets. &&Hoping they finally show his wife

She better be a fox since she's ""the only greatest good he will ever gonna get""&&I bet Helen's plot is a lot more spoiler-ey and they covered for that by concentrating on the Mr. Mom stuff. &&Look man, I wanna see the movie too. But can we both see it without fucking your ass? &&>shadman

FYI&&Get ready for thousands of pics of Helen mounting that bike &&The amount of upvotes this comments are quite  surprising but not unexpected&&**NOOOOOOOOOO**&&The Incestibles Part 3 incoming&&> The animation looks ~~BEAUTIFUL~~ INCREDIBLE!

FTFY&&I think that's their direciton. It seems like they're switching roles in this film. Incredibles was about Mr. Incredible trying to relive his glory days while Elastigirl stayed home with the kids. This time, Mr Incredible is staying home, especially with the baby, while his wife goes out and relives her glory days.

I can't wait. This looks great!&&You mean stay at home dad&&a stay at home dad is a thing. I'm not sure why you felt you had to change the gender...&&the beauty of modern technology &&Those thigh highs got me like mmmmmmm&&Elastigirl? More like ElastiMILF amirite? &&To be fair this was on Brad bird. He didn't want to do a sequel until he had a good story. Disney honored that&&Finding Dory was great though.&&I think it was fair to cast Marlin to the side, he isn't particularly interesting. He was just the main character in the first because his kid was kidnapped, so it would make zero sense for him to be the main character in a story where Nemo isn't lost


But yes, so happy to see Helen and Bob have equal footing like the first one&&The difference is Dory and Mater were never suitable main characters. They were the quirky comic relief side characters, were only made the main characters later because they were popular. Helen is an actual character that can have an actual arc. I have more hope for this movie than I had for finding dory and cars 2 combined.&&Kachew!&&This got me worried a lil bit. I wanted to see a movie with the family acting together. BUT we only watched a teaser, I hope the plot will be more than that. &&I REALLY hope that the story does more than just basically redoing the story of the first movie just with Elastagirl instead of Mr. Incredible. A bunch of red flags went off while I was watching that screamed overused tropes/twists. Such as the Tycoon who is ""totally pro supers and has absolutely no ulterior motives"" and the bit where Helen is saying she's loving the job, which is totally not foreshadowing/dramatic irony for when we discover the true, evil intentions. These are tropes that, if they don't pull off serious misdirects/red herrings, will make me lose interest while watching FAST. That being said, I'm gonna go into it with as few preconceived notions as possible, so I do just really hope that the 1:30 trailer we just saw was the first hour-hour and a half of the movie.&&Agreed. Almost looks like it could end up as the same movie with mr and mrs incredible switching roles.&&I think that the major issue is that they mentioned that being a 'superhero' is still technically illegal, so they cannot all be out super-ing. Maybe that's what Helen is out there changing?&&Well to spoil a bunch of action that would be in the later acts (if there is, and I do expect it) would be contrary to a teaser trailer, right?

Besides, even *if* the basic story goes back to a similar one of the original, they have the added dynamic of playing with/against lessons the characters would have learned in the first movie. &&I'm with you. This just wasn't what I was expecting and that could be a good thing. But from what I'm seeing, I'm not sold. Like you said there will be some nice comedy but something just seems to be missing. However, this is just a teaser and they are definitely holding back some plot so I'm going to keep my hopes up&&I'll bet you they're'nt showing any of the actual plot.&&Aw, bummer! R.I.P&&WHAT? &&Oh, for real? That's awful...&&damn that ruined my night. &&[\*Ahem*](https://youtu.be/zCtdQFkrbhg?t=1m50s)&&Yeah that’s something that always annoys me in movies. For instance in Wonder Woman she has no problem slaughtering countless Germans, but once she has doctor poison cornered, suddenly it’s all about mercy and not succumbing to the dark side. Any time a main enemy is spared after many grunts are murdered (despite doing far less damage and not necessarily even acting by free will), it pisses me off.&&It's a call back to the Bond girls and evil princesses turned good by the heroic protagonist. You see it all the time in Buck Rodgers, Flash Gordon, Batman, Superman, etc. The sidekick villain girl always comes around.&&Violet sounds the exact same too, is she the same voice actress? &&The original voice actor for Dash, Spencer Fox, is currently lead guitarist in the band Charly Bliss.&&omg, its hard to wrap my head around.&&Is it really that surprising? Children and women have higher-pitched voices, unlike men. It makes sense that Violet was played by an adult over a girl because if both accomplish the job, why wouldn't you pick the actor with more experience and reliability? Dash was played by a boy in the original film who has presumably grown up and lost his boyish voice. &&One of the people in the truck near the end of the movie.&&He was a truck driver. &&One of the truck drivers who get hijacked by the octupus&&Yup, the voice actress was in her 30s at the time which is why they kept her, Dash was a child and is now an adult and can't play the voice anymore.&&yep! The voice actress is an adult, so her voice didn't change much. Plus she kind of just sounds like that.&&Yes. Her voice actress was already an adult when they made the last one, so she has the same voice as then&&Sarah Vowell is the same.  She is also an author who narrates audiobooks about history and they are hysterical.  Plus she gets her famous friends to do voices in them.  Like in “Lafayette in the Somewhat United States” Nick Offerman is George Washington and Patton Oswalt is Thomas Jefferson.&&If you ever watch them back to back, watch the grass.    
In Toy Story it's pretty much a flat painted surface.   
In Toy Story 2 it looks like modern video game grass.  
And in Toy Story 3 it looks 100% real.&&Yeah. A Bug's Life looks pretty dated too.

Though from Finding Nemo onwards, everything still looks mostly perfect.&&When I first saw 3 back in 2010, I noticed Buzz's head and neck looked more purple than usual. Which stood out the most compared to the other characters.&&I noticed that too, it looked a bit more angular, particularly on the noses.&&They have “sharper edges” if you get what I mean?&&Dash looks especially different from everyone else. &&they did let him join the track team in the end of the first movie so maybe he's just getting more muscle from being allowed to actually run, at least a little fast. not too much. &&I already see the theaters packed with adults. I’m so pumped&&Of course, because it's Gary Oldman. &&I don't know man, the sequence of Snape's memories where you see him breaking down over lily's death. That shit makes me tear up every time, goddamn Alan Rickman was a fantastic actor.&&/r/unexpectedhogwarts&&The Meta level is over 9000.&&Coincidence? **I THINK NOT**&&It's gonna be the new character, Voyd.  She looks too 'good' and her description says she's a huge Elastigirl fan, and with the new movie focusing more on Elastigirl, I'm guessing she'll be bad.&&For me, it was Bob's five o'clock shadow and his bloodshot eyes. I LOVED that little touch.

Ugh this looks so good.&&As a dad of two boys I can say I have fallen asleep reading a book to them more than once and at least one of them is still awake. This movie looks like its going to fun for the kids and the parents. 

Pixar has done it again!&&I connect with this on an emotional level.&&Just imagine that the budget went up significantly halfway through.&&I still remember the day I first got the deluxe 2-dvd set for Incredibles 1. It featured some of the other supers and their abilities, it was amazing.

 And of course Jack-jack attack special. I watched that on repeat.&&Just tune down the resolution on the second one. Or watch both on a really shitty TV. Boom, problem solved&&Kind of like [Rogue One and A New Hope](https://vimeo.com/209263699) connected together.&&I LOVED THAT GAME&&Such a great villain name &&I spent SO MANY HOURS on that game... my best bud as frozone, me as mr. Incredible... Glad to see someone else played it and remembers it fondly &&
All of that lore right out the window&&If Star Wars fans can go Rogue One -> A New Hope, I think we'll manage.

Edit: Movie titles are hard.&&His voice is so distinct, one of my favorite actors by far!&&Not announced but speculation sounds like September&&He's taking over for Bud Luckey who played the FBI agent in the first film as well as the short 'Jack Jack Attack'. I just rewatched the latter and Jonathan Banks will be virtually indistinguishable from Luckey. He's and excellent choice to replace him. &&There was a comedian that had a bit where his kids started to realize they were better at math than he was, so they constantly brought him their homework, and his response was 

"". . . since when did they start adding letters to it?""&&Why does my kid add backwards?  They taught her how to count by subtraction and it takes twice as long as doing it normal.&&The new methods are actually much better then the old methods. People just don’t like change. &&> some horrible new methods for teaching math

You not understanding it doesn't make it horrible.&&We didn’t get to spend enough time with watching them interact as a family, outside the fighting for their lives bit, imo. Now that they’ve gotten a taste of being superheros as a family, I think it’s going to lead to a lot of interesting situations. I’m excited to see how a baby Jack Jack with powers wreaks havoc in their lives and how Violet grows into her new confidence. All that would’ve been lost if they were aged. Plus, this isn’t the whole story, there’re multiple supporting characters this spot doesn’t even show so there’s no way to tell if it’s similar to the first or not. It’s looks good so far. &&I don’t really agree that this looks too similar to the first. &&*Ice* of you to drop by!&&This comment is too late... 15 minutes too late...&&You caught me monologuing! &&I'm your #1 fan!&&There you are&&Thats like the first movie but its the mom instead of the dad&&*twitch*

God dammit. I can't critique this sneak peek.

It's everything I've hoped fore.&&/r/IncrediblesMemes&&That reminds me of how Scout's teacher gets pissed at her for already knowing how to read, in To Kill a Mockingbird. Enrages me every time I read that part.&&My parents have been in the education system for a long time and [Bob's rant about the school system resonated with them quite a bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7c1HDUHlJo) when they saw the first movie.

Dudes always get hurt about that, ""Why is the dad so unprepared?!"" Because society was set up to make men the breadwinners while women stayed home.

This is the precise point of feminism. Men don't HAVE to go to work, women don't HAVE to stay home. It's the darndest thing. ""HEY, LADIES! WHAT IS THIS? MEN CAN TAKE CARE OF KIDS AND BE DADS TOO.""  Yeah, they can. You created your own trope. If society wasn't so geared toward hyper masculinity and the idea that men can't be something, this trope wouldn't exist.&&I loved it more when Bob is just dealing with the Jack-Jack just crawling all over him groaning 'Don't bite Daddy!'. 

He seen this before. &&Some may say it's *incredibly* tough&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hitc8haEu_g
&&They made me a white guy!&&NO I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RABBIT. &&As an adult I now realize that those ""bloopers"" were actually even MORE effort and animation time spent, to make something they didn't have to include at all. That's pretty amazing. &&[deleted]&&...none of those three things came out of the same animation house.&&[deleted]&&How you gonna leave out Brave. That was like the one good thing about that movie&&Honestly this was enough for me. I wish more trailers were like this ""sneak peak"".

We can't ever see who she is, we will only be disappointed. &&Maybe she's a super too, and her power is invisibility. She wasn't off camera at all, she was actually standing right in front of him.&&Glad to see some people share my opinions on this matter.&&Just feel good about it. You know you want to. Just like we all want to. &&At last, a long needed break from the Overwatch. I love me some elastigirl ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Elastagirl is also my first Milf.

But I thought the end of the first movie was about seeing the family as a solid team! A single unit! 

I don't wanna watch the same movie I did 14 years ago only this time the husband and wife switch roles...Only for the finale to be the family grouping up yet again for the final showdown..

Idk. Seems a little lack-luster to me. &&My coworker once told me he was going to be “Mr Mom” and babysitting his kid one night. And I was just like...you mean “Dad?”&&Boooooooo&&Good thing Disney owns this property, otherwise we might have gotten a Zach Snyder sequel.&&Kudos to them because story is like 90% of what makes an animated sequel good.

An octopus driving a car just didn't sit right with me.

One of the last things I saw her in was in Modern Family when she played Gloria's mother.&&W. T. F.&&I was a bit miffed with the Germans in Wonder Woman, it really felt like they wanted them to be Nazi Germans but they were afraid people would complain and compare it to the first Captain America movie.&&Most superhero movies get around this point by implying that the heroes are just beating up people and not actually killing them. It does require suspension of disbelief but not at that high of a level. Obviously superhero/action hero movie biology works differently, because in real life, if you knock someone out and they don't regain consciousness in a few minutes, you're looking at concussion and brain damage.&&... what? The entire point of her character arc was learning that simply killing bad people doesn't stop evil in the world. Also, Dr. Poison was unarmed and helpless at the moment. That scene is incredibly intentional and necessary for her character arc and the main plot...&&Now, I never bothered watching Wonder Woman, so I don’t know if this specific example applies, but generally there’s also an accepted difference between killing someone in the heat of battle vs during one-on-one-ish combat, where once the person is down you’ve won. 

In battle, every enemy you don’t eliminate can kill you while you’re dealing with the others. If you fight your way through the front lines of enemy soldiers while avoiding killing, you’re defeating the purpose of fighting them. They’ll stand right back up and keep fighting and killing your allies, whose lives should be a little more important to you. Or worse, turn around and shoot you in the back. When you’re in direct confrontation with the big boss who controls everything, once he’s beaten he can order a stand-down, sparing way more lives. 

Again, I don’t know if that rationale works for WW since I didn’t watch it, but I would assume it’s something similar. &&Yeah but she was already an adult when she voiced Violet&&Oh wow, that's neat. Spotify recommended them to me a few months ago and I've been a fan ever since. &&Wooo Charly Bliss! I love those guys!&&I fucking love charly bliss, I’ve seen them live a couple times around Cleveland and they were great. At the first show their lead singer was jumping around and banged her head on something at the end of the set, was holding an ice pack to her head while she talked to fans afterword. Really cool people.&&Put it this way. Shrek came out nearly 17 years ago

Edit: 17 years exact as of April 22nd&&I think it's more surprising that it's Sarah Vowell, who is... an American history essayist. Not really an actress except for this one role. Definitely not much in the way of acting ""experience!""

Apparently the producers just really liked a *This American Life* segment she had narrated.

(She's great in the role!)&&Good example of a woman voicing a kid is Bart Simpson I mean for years I thought they used a male actor. I only found out after watching the Simpsons cast on that Inside the Actors Studio that Bart's voice actor was a woman which surprised me.

It's already British character acting gold before Timothy Spall turns up.&&I do agree, but going from reading that chapter to seeing it on screen doesn't do it justice.

Rickman did an amazing Snape, but the way the scene was shot, so rapidly, made it lose some of the emotionality that the words in the book portrayed.&&Super hero stalker has been done already.&&But again that is the exact same plot as the first movie.

And teaching them how to actually *understand* how the math works rather than the rote repetition that was prevalent in years past.

It actually creates a better environment later, with less need for re-education of basics in advanced levels, as well as making it easier to grasp more complex math later.

For example, I was a whiz at every level of math through Algebra. When I first hit geometry, I fucking struggled. Went from an A student to a D student. Finally, it clicked and I went right back to A's again. The problems I was having was connecting the application of algebra to geometry. I could solve the problems, but I didn't know how to generate the right algorithms to solve them.

The ""new"" math actually helps solve that by teaching a deeper understanding of the math itself. &&The new methods are more in line with what I do in my head. I don't add numbers vertically like I would on paper, I split them up into easy to add chunks, which is ultimately better that teaching how numbers can be manipulated. The problem is conveying that formally on paper. &&Yea the first one was about the dad secretly being a superhero after retiring and ultimately bringing the whole family in right (it’s been a good long while since I’ve seen it)? This one seems like it’s about the mom getting the spotlight while dad actually tries to take care of the kids, with us seeing how he handles being a parent. &&1 Parent goes off to fight while other stays with kids till they all unite and fight enemy together. &&Wednesday is bowling night!&&/r/IncrediblesMemes &&Wouldn't surprise me since this is post-Toy Story 3 Pixar.&&I love the mileage they draw from Elastigirl's powers.

Those are the ones that some of us dads lose our cool over.

That's a shit way to go&&The movie plays during WW1, before Nazis were a thing.&&And the fact they spoke English even though in the rest of the movie you had people talking French with subtitles and other languages spoken...&&Exactly, she was on a battlefield with uniformed soldiers. They opened fire on her. She is not murdering them, they are viable targets.&&And Sarah Vowell has always sounded like that. Great author too.&&Shrek is almost legal.&&Fuck.&&Lily Tomlin was going to voice Edna, but said that Brad Bird's voice for her was perfect as is. He's not normally a voice actor either so the movie is pretty unique that way.&&> Sarah Vowell

plus she was already an grown up when she voiced Violet in the first movie, so I don't think they ever even worried about having to re cast her.

Another great young girl actor is Katie Leigh, who's in her 50s by now, but her voice has allowed her to play teenagers and children for decades now. &&I mean, she had lots of radio experience so it's not like they just picked a random author. But yeah, TAL was probably it.&&Funny you mention that, when Sid appears in Toy Story 3 they brought back his voice actor just to have him rock out for a few seconds on screen.&&Kind of related; the anime Full Metal Alchemist did something similar.  

In the original anime, they veered off the manga’s path, but in Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, they remade the entire series according to the manga, using almost the same cast.

Problem was, the kid voicing Alphonse, the younger brother, hit puberty.  They recast the voice actor, but had Alphonse’s OG voice actor cameo by playing their dad in flashbacks.&&In the movie. He picked dory and the octopus, I believe. &&Looks identical too! &&To be fair, the original Dash didn't have that distinct a kid's voice, in fact few children do, which is why recasting them isn't exactly a struggle.  It's why the Charlie Brown Peanuts character all sound the same-ish even though they've been using real kids since the 60s.&&You have probably now just ruined it for me. 

Will report back over the weekend after watching 1-3 again with the kids..&&Idk about toning down but I know they had to wait a few years to make it after coming up with the story because John Lassiter was nowhere close to satisfied with the current state of the tech. The idea was ahead of its time but when they finally got a serious handle on things-well, you know what happened. &&That's kind of true. I don't think the art style was ever going to be photo-realistic. But what happened is they went to the animators with a top-down video of fish swimming in the ocean and basically said, ""Make this."" The animators came back with a CGI version that looked so similar they couldn't figure out which was the original. From there they started working with the animators to make it more ""cartoony"".

I watched the special features on that DVD several times while on a road trip where it was the only movie we thought to bring. I can't believe that was almost 15 years ago!&&I'll be 36 in May, I'll be seeing this on opening weekend, almost definitely stoned.

I saw that movie so long ago it never clicked.&&I’m Wonder Woman, some kid kept saying “Professor Lupin is the bad guy?” at the very end and it was annoying because until that moment in my head I kept wondering why I recognized Thewlis and couldn’t place him. &&I was always fond of Dumbledore's ""You disgust me"" line from the books&&A lot of things got lost in translation for the adaptation. For example, Harry goes from always (literally the entire series) saying Voldemort all the way until Deathly Hallows Part 2 or towards the end of Part 1. They never explain that Voldemort's name is taboo and saying it alerts Death Eaters and Snatches to the location of the person who said his name. It's the whole reason the Snatchers found them and why there's was a lot of focus on Mr. Lovegood when he says Voldemort after the tale of the 3 brothers. &&Yeah, but it seems too obvious to have the businessman be the bad guy.  And there weren't really any other big actors announced, so unless they reveal that theres another character we know nothing about, I'm placing my bets on Void&&> But again that is the exact same plot as the first movie.

Yeah, i mean... THREE death stars? Preposterous!&&gibberish?&&Except in actuality it was a 14-year-long buffer&&I just got a satisfaction/relief boner. I can imagine how good that feels.&&Triangle...good.....house....good.....campfire......waaaaaaaaaaah&&I suspect that he may have been messing with his kids and/or audience.&&It’s a joke, from a guy who gets paid to tell them for a living.

Say it is 567 + 423

I do 500 +400

60 + 20

7 + 3

So 900 + 80 + 10.&&Wut &&Right, so I have multiple questions.&&A lot of data-driven thought went into constructing this most recent generation's curricula.   
  
Quick case study:  
I learned math from Russian kids' math textbooks. When I went to school at the turn of the 21st century, I found that the way that I did math differed from a lot of the kids there (although I was also better at it). Looking at this common core baby back bullshit these days, I find that a lot of it actually matches up to what I learned as a kid, and it's actually a better way to build a fundamental understanding of math that you can build on later.&&What people don’t think about is that with computers everywhere we no longer need to do math quickly. Outside of single digits there is no reason to do the math ourselves so the “quicker” methods are pointless to learn because kids won’t need to do them. So instead of learning how to do math we are teaching them how to understand math and let the computers do the actual math.&&You need more upvotes. As a teacher this is the most frustrating point to get across to people. We are teaching concepts not just using acronyms to help kids remember steps with nothing to concrete to apply them to. The reason it’s hard for parents to do the math problems is because they don’t remember the concepts either and are trying to reply on memory of drill and kill methods they can’t recall. &&This is exactly right. &&God, that would have helped me so much. I always have trouble with *learning through repetition* instead of *learning though understanding*, which gave me a ton of problems with math even though I probably spent the most time on it to prepare for tests etc in college. &&I honestly feel like people that have a lot of natural intuition at math understand the methods, even if they were taught the memorization stuff when they were a kid. These kids are getting shortcuts (good thing) to developing mathematical intuition, even if they aren't naturally drawn to that. Seems like a great thing to me....&&As opposed to both going off to fight, or neither going off to fight? I mean that's one of like three options, it's not exactly a crime for that specific part to be similar, it can easily be executed in a way that isn't similar at all even if they end up doing that because it's such a general similarity.&&HOW HAVE YOU SEEN IT ALREADY!?!????
 /s&&What if we *actually did* what our wives thought we were doing?&&Tell Honey I said hi. &&Yes she has the power of elasticity and *thiccness*. Elastigirl can get it.&&Well the first movie was all about Bob going out and being Mr. Incredible again. Elastigirl was stuck being the housewife for the first movie, until she caught on and saved Bob from Syndrome's lair.

The second movie looks like it's going to flip those roles (under different circumstances of course) with Bob being the stay-at-home dad and Elastigirl having her hero time.&&And so did people on the Internet. Especially a certain artist who really loves Mrs Incredible. 


( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Public education is failing if they can't teach you.

Handled.&&There's obvious and intentional ambiguity with the time period though. They have 60s style cars and clothing, but have computers. It's left to be basically whenever the writers need it to be. That being said, I don't think we'll suddenly see iPhones or anything. &&not dramatic enough.

Hoo boy.&&He repeated same words&&why did you say that name?&&WHYDIDYOUSAYTHATNAME&&Say that to Syndrome’s broken neck!&&They changed it, but I don't think they had to rush (as much as they apparently did). They were writing it in 2013 when Blackfish came out, but Finding Dory was released in 2016. There was plenty of time to do a proper re-write. &&Damn really? I feel like people have known about Seaworld's shittiness long before blackfish&&That's why she quit, duh&&Edna smoked. &&Disney doesn’t ever show anyone in the act of smoking. In Saving Mr. Banks, they wanted to show that Walt Disney was a heavy smoker, but didn’t want to break their rule so they only had shots of Tom Hanks putting out cigarettes&&A parachute not opening... that's a way to die. Getting caught in the gears of a combine... having your nuts bit off by a Laplander, that's the way I wanna go!&&Same shit killed one of my childhood friends his first semester of college.&&That's kind of the point, though. They *wanted* to use nazis because they were evil and did scientific experiments and used experimental technology and all that. But they didn't want the Captain America comparisons so they changed them to WWI Germans, who weren't nazis and weren't even close to the level of nazis. But they still played them like nazis.&&Or that one of our main heroes infiltrated the party and his big plan was to speak English with a German accent? And it was only foiled because the super smart female villain was upset that he thought Wonder Woman was hot? 

Anyway, I have SO many gripes with that movie...&&They should have done it the 'Allo 'Allo way. I still think that is the best way of showing multiple languages in an English speaking film&&I wonder if Mirage will make an appearance in this movie. Would be cool if she did. I wonder what happened to her after she helped Bob and his family off the island.&&Sir put the DVD down&&Ah I know her from *Adventures in Odyssey*. Great memories from listening to that show!&&English or Japanese?

Basically they were pretty far along on the water tech and they sent the animation and tech crew a bunch of real life water test footage as a sample. They returned later with two nearly identical footage reels. It was decided that they should probably stylize the water a little bit.&&34 checking in. I’ll be right there with ya friend. &&That he doesn't have **all** the Oscars just shows the game is rigged.&&Gary Oldman actually learnt to become an animagus for his scenes. When you see him transforming it's actually him.&&Richard Harris would have been AMAZING in the last few HP movies.&&from the trailer it seems like Common Core is the bad guy. I'm guessing The Underminer finds him deep below the  earth's crust&&I think obviously the businessman is going to be an antagonist  come the latter parts of the film. Not the villain though. He seems too slick and focused on ""image"" to not be. He'll probably start pushing Helen towards more tasks that will separate herself from the family to try and bump up the ""Elastagirl"" image. This'll be the films ""Break into Three's"" moment where Bob's A Story of trying to be a stay at home dad crosses with Helen's B Story. Thus bringing us to strengthen the theme of family and that they're stronger together than separate. &&Void seems like a villain name anyways&&I'm firmly of the opinion that it's impossible to misspell jiberesh.

it's funny.

reddit says they love data-driven stuff. It's the cure to the world's problems.

but when it's applied to stuff that's different to what they did then it's an issue.

While at the same time not undersatnding why old people resist change.&&Even with computers, I frequently find myself interpolating logarithms in my head in order to estimate the expected result. Depending on how lucky I get with the numbers that I am operating on, I can often give you results within about ±10% of the correct answer.

Sometimes, that's good enough and I don't even need to ask the computer. But even if I need the precise answer, it's incredibly useful in order to double-check that I didn't make mistakes anywhere else. Being able to sanity check computations is become increasingly more important when using computers.

Of course, I think that confirms your point. The only reason I can do this so easily and quickly is because I actually understand the math. So, I can rearrange my problem in a way that it becomes easy to compute or at least estimate.&&That definitely plays a role. There's an absolutely *huge* emphasis on mental math techniques. A lot of the complaints about the Common Core math is that it's ""harder"" because the complainers are only focusing on the problems and not *what* they're teaching.

&&InB4 the guy who hires Elastigirl is the bad guy and pulls the same shit from the first movie because he was in love with her in middle school/high school and she doesn't remember him because of a name change and he was a fatty.  &&Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?&&[deleted]&&>mentioning shad on my good Christian reddit

Sort of like the sad bit Christopher Lee did for the Hobbit where he was sat and the film crew had to come to his hospice to do his scene.&&Actually you and u/taylordangertorres are both right. Common Core is the main enemy, but Voyd is the crisis. As a full time dad, Mr Incredible gets neglected by the busy Elastigirl, who loses focus on her family. Voyd, being a huge fangirl, leaps at the opportunity to ""fill the Voyd"" with her presence, causing Mr Incredible and Elastigirl to nearly split. The family have to reunite and all embrace their super powers to defeat Common Core.&&Math. Is.

We're the replacement old people!&&I do think he might be the bad guy, I kind of hope they go that direction anyway as that introduces a lot of great potential conflict, but I guarantee that won't be the reason he's bad. And if I'm right and that's not the reason he's bad, then the villain will be a complete change from Syndrome and not at all similar other than the fact they're villains. &&I wonder if there's gonna be an explosion of Elastigirl animations after the movie. Finally a break from Overwatch!&&>an

Indicating that there is but one. You foolish fool.&&[deleted]&&That's kind of the point. Wonder Woman thinks she's fighting for the right side just because she talked to them first and they said so.

See [Lone Star](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001615/?ref_=tt_cl_t4)&&Another cool fact: you can watch both of them play D&D tonight! 

#shamelesscriticalroleplug&&Can’t even tell they removed his moustache. &&Plus, the non-realistic characters in the realistic sea would look too cartoony and you'd be getting into the uncanny valley.&&that's cause Michael Gambon never read the books, actually refused to read them.

&&Agreed, obviously you can't predict your actor is going to die, but if Gambon had played Dumbledore since movie one, I think he'd have substantially less criticism as there'd have been no jarring change.&&It is now cannon&&I'm fairly certain that isn't supposed to be Common Core in the trailer.

I saw it in a theater entirely full with adults--and the reaction to that moment was what movie making was once--a long time ago--all about: Audible surprise, delight, awe and even a measure of enlightenment. I am hugely and disproportionately proud that my miniscule contribution (if any) early early in the project's development led to a ""thank you"" in the credits. Amazing how much they got ""right.""

[Source](http://ruhlman.com/2007/07/kitchen-rats/)&&I had tears in my eyes watching that scene in the movie when the Critic tastes the Ratatouille and it reminds him how his mom used to cook. That flashback part is pretty phenomenal.&&In my opinion, this film has not only some of Pixar's best writing and characters, but easily their best score. With it's incredibly melodic and motivic music, every single track is memorable.&&Ratatouille and The Incredibles are two of my favourite films of all time, animated or otherwise. And my choice between the two keeps changing depending on which one I've seen more recently.

Brad Bird is a friggin' genius.&&They nailed what it's like in a French kitchen apparently&&Ratatouille is one of my all-time favorite movies period. The film is unlike anything in Pixar's filmography.

The cinematography is dark and warm and enticing. The score is delightful and probably Michael Giacchino's best work (and that is saying something).  

Anton Ego is one of my favorite villains. Wonderful design. Resonant performance. He's SO EVIL, he killed a man using only his words. Terrific.

The steaks are lowered but also infinitely personal. This is a movie that doesn't end with a car chase or punching a villain, it ends with cinematically proving the sentimental and nostalgic nature of food and art itself.

From the premise, to the look, and the sound of the world, this movie is absolutely delightful from start to finish and I'll never understand why it isn't beloved the way Coco or Inside Out have been.&&Definitely my favorite Pixar movie.  Just showed it to my 2 year old daughter who’s name is Remy and she was amazed.  Much more enjoyable watching this with the kids instead of Peppa Pig.&&I had a pet rat,  and a good 30% of the time I told someone,  they yelled this movie title in delight. &&Ratatouille is my favorite Pixar/Disney film&&Ratatouille reminds me so much of the time I spent working in kitchens. 

I had this dude who was constantly on top of me, telling me what to do and how to cook, and eventually I got him fired when I proved he was stealing tips. 

I too was taught how to cook by a rat. &&Anton Ego getting hit with that wave of nostalgia is so goddamn perfect. It completely encapsulates that instantaneous and unexpected feeling of being transported back to a great time in your past by something as simple as eating vegetables and sauce. 

The whole movie is a joy to watch, but that scene ranks among Pixar's very best ever. &&I blame Ratatouille for my love for cooking now. I saw it when I was 9 and apparently I liked it so much that I asked a for a cookbook for my birthday a couple weeks later.&&People always remember the moment Anton Ego tastes the ratatouille and has a flashback. But one thing I found telling about Anton Ego is his reaction *before*: the moment the ratatouille is brought to him. The disgraced chef, skinner, who asked to receive whatever Ego was having, scoffs at the sight of ratatouille and thinks it must be a joke. But Ego does not scoff, he is not insulted. He takes out his pen, and prepares to write notes on what he tastes. Just like any other dish.

Anton Ego does not judge the ratatouille on its history as a cheap, or 'peasant' dish. Earlier he had rolled his eyes at what had become of Chef Boyardee. Not because the Boyardee brand was inexpensive, but because the quality of the food had degenerated and the taste of it had become far inferior to what it used to be. 

Anton Ego isn't just a tough critic: he actually *cares* about food.&&I once killed a man...WITH *THIS* THUMB!&&One of my best ""feel good"" movie ever, up there with Jurassic Park&&Everyone is saying in this thread how Ratatouille is underrated?!

Go to any Pixar fan page or any animated studios history website and you will see Pixar's big three being discussed endlessly. 

It's always Toy Story, Wall-e, and Ratatouille.

Everytime &&To me, Coco is the most Ratatouilleish film Pixar has made since in terms of art, homage and culture.&&Also, I just really love ""Le festin"" by Camille

was a really fitting song to this wonderful film :)

Probably my favorite Pixar/Disney film too&&I haven't seen it yet.  Wtf is wrong with me.&&A lot off topic but: I named my son Remy just before this movie was released thinking it was a safe name....but then...a RAT. The character named Remy is a RAT.

Edit: I forgot to mention I love this movie.&&I don't think it's really an ""allegory"" of art and class so much as it is *explicitly* about art and class.&&2007 will forever be only three years ago in my books. It feels so recent. Yet in 2007, 1999 felt like a lifetime ago. Now more time has passed since 2007.

Fuck, I'm old. &&He would also destroy Stuart Little in a fight inside the first round.&&Ratatouille is the best Pixar film dont @ me&&My favorite Pixar film. Of course there are so many that I've enjoyed (Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles and on and on...) but this film really resonated with me as a film, not simply an animated film. The Ego speech at the end, the score, the depiction of the kitchen and its inner workings, the detail in the food (I hate Ratatouille as a dish and the ""Confit Byaldi"" in this film makes my mouth water). It's a celebration of all things art, and all artists. I even named my dog Remy after this film. Watching it drives me to create, not only in the kitchen--but everywhere I can in life. Also drives me nuts that more people didn't appreciate it for what it was at the time, although I think that's more due to Pixar's high bar than anything. 

Until recently was one of the few animated films that elicited such an emotional response from me--Kubo and the Two Strings being another that I loved. Be sure to check that out if you haven't yet.&&I feel a little sad about this because the direction Disney took Pixar.  We are to going to get such gripping animated films like we did in that golden run that gave us this, Up and Wall-e.&&Ratatoing followed suit.&&I like the movie as a kid. Saw it as a fun kid's movie.
 
But now as an adult, after reading this article and remembering the movie. Just reminded me how amazing pixar can be. &&As a sound mixer this movie has the best sound  of all the Pixar movies in my opinion &&Fair play it is fucking good &&I've seen this movie probably thirty times, it's my favorite animated film.&&Hi all, this is Leigh Monson, the author of this article. I just wanted to say that I was dumbstruck, blindsided, and blown away by the response to this Reddit post. I'm really proud of what I wrote here and I'm so happy you all liked it.

Wife and I are watching Ratatouille when I hear a snap in the garage. 
I had recently put out rat traps.  So being hopeful I went to the garage and open the door only to find that yes indeed a rat had tripped the trap.
However, the metal bar that is supposed to break it's neck missed and ended up ripping the face off of the poor bastard.  He is still alive and blood it pouring out and bubbling with ever breath.
I run to grab a big dowel to finish him off and end his suffering.
When I got back the rat was gone but there was a rather obvious trail of blood to the corner of the room.  Find him trying to walk through a wall (he can't see as his eyes have been ripped apart).  I line up my break your neck shot and swing.  Of course he moves and I end up breaking his back by his back legs.
Now he is screaming and thrashing, blood flying everywhere.  I start beating the he'll out of him hoping to end his misery.
After what felt like forever the poor rat dies in a giant mess of blood, fur, and offal.  Somberly I clean it all up and dispose of the corpse.
Walk into the house and calmly sit down to finish this delightful film about a cute rat that is a wonderful cook.
I felt awful.&&It's my favorite of the Pixar movies.  It feels the least ""Pixar-like"", which is a good thing.&&I was among the first people to ever see the movie because I was on a disney cruise ship in europe. Such a fun night. Same with Lilo and Stitch way back in the day. &&Ratatoullie is one of those movies that won't receive the praise it truly deserves until loooong after it came out.&&I hate Ratatouille, it was messed up.

A very hard-working second in line chef inherits a restaurant when the ownner dies. He has lot of ideas to make it more proffitable.

Despite this , a clumsy noob with no idea asks for a job and the chef agrees to hire him. Obviously the noob eventually fucks up and the chef has to fire him.

Then it is discovered that the noob is the son of the late ex-owner, inheriting the restaurant. And what's the first thing he does? He fires the chef. He fires the same chef that has worked hard for years with his father and who gave him an opportunity when he had no idea, but he doesn't care and he fires him.

Obviously the fucking noob is a clown who doesn't care about anything and he ends having the restaurant closed by sanitary reasons.&&I'd never seen [that trailer for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=1yKqLNnxGZw) before. It's great.&&My favorite movie of all time. It’s just breathtaking &&Scanning the comments, I can tell this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but... I actually hated this movie when it came out.

It was the hair thing that really broke the reality of the film for me. A rat, pulling on the hair of a kid, is able to control his hands? That was just too far-fetched for me to accept and made the rest of film difficult to watch.

Yes, I understand that there's a certain suspension of disbelief required for an animated film (it's the story of a talking rat, for crying out loud!) but I just got too wrapped up in how pulling on handfuls of hair could essentially turn a kid into a marionette.

And it's been a while since I watched it, but I don't remember the kid actually learning anything. He accepted all the praise, all the while not having any clue what he did because he was just a vehicle for the rat to cook. Maybe I'm wrong; I watched it once when it came out and I haven't seen it since.

The massive amounts of praise for this movie in these comments has finally encouraged me to watch it again. If so many people love this film, there's obviously something I missed in my first watch through.  Hopefully I can suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy the story this time around.&&>In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations, the new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source. To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau’s famous motto: Anyone can cook. But I realize, only now do I truly understand what he meant. Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere. It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau’s, who is, in this critic’s opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. I will be returning to Gusteau’s soon, hungry for more.

&&Holy Fuck. This is long. I didn’t mean to write all this, strap in. 

I need to preface this. I’m a cook. I’m studying to be a chef. I love my job. I like finding new burns on my arms I don’t remember getting. I enjoy knowing that in any given room I walk into I’m probably one of the few who has ever had to tape his fingertips back on in the middle of a double (on Mother’s Day, no less)  and was tough enough to shrug it off. I like working in often grimy environments, doing grimy jobs, with grimy people. This industry is a good fit for me. So, as much as I LOVE this film and others like it; a word of caution. It is heavily romanticized; and while there’s little to nothing I can point to and say “that’s wrong” with the film, the portrayal still isn’t entirely “right”. Ratatouille correctly displays a certain perspective on this life of ours, that anyone with a genuine love for the kitchen and all her sadistic, seductive charms will instantly identify with. Just don’t kid yourself into believing that’s *all* we do. Anyways. 

 I watched this in the Theatre with my Grandmother when I was little. I can distinctly remember being enamored with the world of the kitchen. Psychotic, violent, loving, artistic, brutal, unforgiving, and familial. It intimidated and enchanted me in equal measures. I felt like I had been let in on a great secret; hidden in plain sight was this chaotic, hectic world where men and women sustained  a pseudo-bohemian lifestyle making *art*. Something that I, having been raised in an environment very much stuck in the 50’s in regards to it’s perspective on “The Workin’ Man” found breathtaking. I was simultaneously enamored with the concept and entirely confident I would never have an opportunity to be apart of it. 

Years later, out of High School, I took a job as a server in my friend’s restaurant. His family owned a little cafe near the community college, nothing especially impressive when compared to it’s peers, but it was nice. Cozy. One day, the owner (my friend’s mother) pulls the both of us aside. Aside from herself, she had only one steady cook on staff. We’ll call him J. J, she explained, was a very lovely man. He was caring, kind, and *wanted* desperately to make it in the industry . . . The only problem was, he was an abysmal cook. So she made a very simple proposal. She was going to have to let J go, and one of us would have to move to BOH (back-of-house, for the unaware). My friend was taking more college credits than I was at the time (and was also fully aware of his mother’s Napoleonic tendencies) so the job fell to me. 

Initially, I was awful. I knew nothing about cooking, hardly five minutes would go by without me having to ask for clarification in some simple task. *”How should I arrange the Bacon on the Sheet-tray?”* *” How should I hold the knife?” *”Does this sausage look burnt to you?”* It most certainly was, by the way).  But, through a combination of desperation on my part and manipulation on hers, I stuck with it; eventually becoming what I believed to be a vital and important part of the business. It took around two years for things to sour between us. 

Now, the family I had worked for had always displayed intensely dysfunctional behavior. Screaming matches in front of their children was a common, even expected, occurrence; perhaps worthy of a passing glance and sigh if it was a real mean one. I was constantly under scrutiny for every life decision I made, from my non-existent relationship to god, to my occasional use of Marijuana ( which she once comically insisted to me would leave me permanently impaired; citing a brief interaction she had with some stoner when she was in college that “couldn’t remember his own name”. She encouraged me to smoke cigarettes instead, and I finally dropped *that habit* earlier this year), even to the fact that I went to counseling and took Prozac for my depression. I was often provoked to the point of tears, and once to an attempted suicide attempt. I attempted to carve out my forearm with a box-knife, in the wake of a bad lunch rush. When I failed to do so, because we never changed the damned things and it was fuller than a butter knife, I burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that lasted a little over an hour. Shaking, with tears streaming down my face, I asked them to please call me an ambulance. I needed help. Instead of this, they pulled my friend out of class to talk me down while I smoked a pack of American Spirits, curled up in the fetal position against a milk-crate out back; rocking myself gently back and forth.

That should have been the line in the sand, but I was heavily indoctrinated by this point. My parents divorced when I was so young, I had no idea what a functional family unit looked or behaved like. I just assumed they did all of these horrible things because they loved me as some sort of adopted son (a comparison they actively encouraged). I just assumed this was what normal looked like. I stayed with them even after, and likely would still be there making mediocre omelets and paninis were it not for a record-breaking Ice storm. 

My friend had recently moved into the city with his girlfriend, they had an apartment lot all to themselves near Main Street. There was a storm in the forecast, the family had already decided they would be closed the following day. So he invited me to come and see their place downtown, hit up a bar and crash at their apartment. I accepted, and later that evening I found myself sitting in a red-leather booth downing a large amount of Rum, talking to a group of strangers. One of them, it turns out, brewed his own Meade. I thought this was fascinating and asked him to walk me through the process, which he very graciously consented to. In my inebriated and grateful state, I thought it was entirely unfair for me not to return the favor, so I offered him a Biscuit recipe in return. The restaurant’s biscuit recipe. My friend, who was siting at the table with us, said nothing at the time. Later however, he pulled me aside and explained that was entirely unacceptable. It wasn’t my recipe to give out. On this point, of course, he was and remains correct. I will not dispute that fact, nor did I then. I apologized profusely and bought him and his girlfriend breakfast the next day, as an apology. We spent most of *that* day together as well, exploring the city and enjoying each other’s company. 

When I next went into work, I noticed we had an extra hand on deck. Odd, but not without precedent. They liked to recruit local high-school kids into the “family”. I thought little of it. Took a brief inventory, made a plan for prep that day, and asked my boss what she’d like for me to start on. She only said a few words to me, saying I could relax and get some coffee for the moment. It was the last thing she ever said to me. Her husband did the actual firing. He didn’t mince words. I wasn’t welcome there any longer. Please leave, and don’t come back. My friend, facing away and sweeping the hallway, said nothing. 

The only parallel in my life, to being cast out of their lives, is being woken by my mother to say goodbye before she left me and my little sister when we were children. Watching her drive away in the early morning light on a crisp Spring day, just as the birds began to sing, I was filled with an unimaginable grief. My throat swelled shut, and a great weight set itself deep within my chest. A lethargic, hopeless shuffle back into a house with a grandmother that wanted nothing to do with me, a father that was being kept from me (despite his best efforts), and a mom that didn’t think I was worth the effort to stay around for. 

But, that had been nearly a decade ago at this point. I knew the shape and weight of it, the all too familiar sense of impotent devastation. It had beaten me, when I was still a child. That would not happen again. I got another job, in another restaurant. I was a Darden Wage-Slave, microwaving bags of macaroni and breading butterfly shrimp on the fly. But I never resigned myself to it. I worked my ass off, injured myself countless different ways and paid it no mind. I worked every holiday. I cleared the dish pot in between bumps. I broke down the coolers, deep-cleaned them, and put them back together. I hauled hundreds upon *hundreds* of pounds of fry oil out of the building. I descended upon smart-nothing and lazy servers like a fucking grizzly bear, once pinning one up against the wall by his collar. I made a name for myself as the only white guy that could hack it on that line. In my free time I studied and practiced. I would get off of twelve hour shifts, waking home at one in the morning, and *cook* something just so I hated myself a little less. 

And then, earlier this year, I made the jump to fine dining. Looking around at my peers, I see all the same characters the worked the line at Gusteau’s. There is the same commitment and adoration for the craft; and the same military-esque chain of command in place. I love it. I go home most nights still thinking about my work, about potential improvements on my technique. On stupid mistakes I made that I’ll mentally berate myself for. On the myriad of different flavor combinations, plating aesthetics, and potential specials to plow through the Burrata cheese our distributor didn’t deliver until three days to it’s expiration date. And, most excitedly, thinking about the culinary program I finally will have a chance to go through later this year. 

TL;DR: Ratatouille is one of my favorite movies. Also I love cooking, even though the industry is a hell of a lot meaner that Hollywood would like you to believe.  &&What exactly do the burns on the hands mean?&&Love me some bourdain&&Ego's epiphany/flash back scene is hands down the best emotion-translated-to-visual that i have ever seen. &&Man I don't normally think of him as having a distinctive voice, but I read that entirely as Anthony Bourdain in my head&&Thanks for posting this.

I still remember the shock when i first saw those scenes. Very simple details make the most impact. &&For the lazy…
https://youtu.be/kuyUKdJccgM

This scenes never fails to give me goosebumps no matter how many times I see it.
The scene is full of emotions that are difficult to describe or portray. You have the critic in a state of hate with the intent to destroy. But in an instant is transported to a state of both vulnerability and love. Peace.

Skinner’s “traditional” portrayal is still amazing, but is eclipsed in comparison. He is simply torn between his hate for the protagonist, whom he wants to see fail, and the joy of the food that is probably taking him to a state of bliss very similar to the critic’s.

And the piece de resistance… that speech. &&Folks think his mom is the old lady from the first scene because of how the houses match up &&Did you notice how his complexion changed from grey to a more healthy reddish-pinkish tone?&&Fun fact: The producer of the film interned for two days in Thomas Keller's (aka the best American chef alive) restaurant in order to better understand French cooking. Keller was the food consultant on the film, and he said that that style of ratatouille is how he would serve the dish if the most famous food critic in the world walked through the door.&&Marcel Proust.&&Me too. It was one of the first movies I watched in full after my mom died. I’d seen the movie before but forgot about that scene and it hit me hard when I remembered it was coming up, and cried so hard when it arrived.&&Dude.  Sometimes, I FFW through that part because it's just so... personal.  I mean, Mom's specialty home cooked meal as a cure for everything really resonates with most people.  That part just hits me.  And I can't be crying while watching an animated movie, can I?

And now, I want some of my mom's fried rice...&&> That flashback part is pretty phenomenal.

... and then *Up* is released.&&Le Festine will be played at my wedding, such a beautiful song &&Really goes well with the kitchen environment and Paris.&&I'd like to respectfully disagree, I think Up was a fabulous movie with a great score too!&&Michael Giacchino! He composed Le Festine too. He also composed most of Coco's score too, except the songs (those were composed by the same couple who composed the songs for Frozen) &&Michael Giacchino man. I bought the Medal of Honor: Frontline soundtrack years ago, and it's been a joy to see how many places he's popped up.&&He indeed is. The Incredibles, Iron Giant, Ratatouille, MI: Ghost Protocol. All 4 seriously impressive films.&&Just recently rewatched the Incredibles. When it came out I was still in college. Just a kid. It was a fun romp. 

Now I'm approaching 40, married, with a kid. I cannot help but identify with Bob and tear up during the ""I'm not strong enough"" scene. &&To be fair, originally this film was conceived by Jon Pinkava who also was originally directing it.  Things happened and Brad took over, but I wanted to at least mention this particular project isn't his brainchild.  &&Definitely agreed, and they've aged so well too. I can watch em any day&&> Brad Bird is a friggin' genius.

Just *imagine* what we could have gotten if they'd put him in charge of the Star Wars sequel trilogy like they originally wanted to instead of what we *did* get.&&I love the atmosphere the film creates. You really want to be a part of the kitchen despite the harsh environment. Also, the animated shots of Paris are gorgeous and do well to express the beauty of that city.&&i toured pixar and they apparently do INTENSE research for their movies. the employees shadowed at chez panisse for a week, working in the kitchen, and it sounds like they probably went to france to interview and shadow restaurants there as well. &&Full of rats and a health inspector tied up in the storage room?&&> The steaks are lowered but also infinitely personal

i see what you did there.&&> he killed a man using only his words. Terrific.

That's actually a reference to a real life french chef who killed himself when he lost his 3 Michelin star, from 3 to 2. He more or less told it in an interview that if it would ever happen, he wouldn't be able to handle it.

I don't see how this could be just a coincidence. &&Couldnt have said it better. Ratatouille is in my top 3 animated movies. Certainly a masterpiece. I see it being enjoyed by people 50 years from now.&&I agree that Ratatouille is by far one of Pixar's best works. I think the reason it hasn't been ""beloved"" as much as Coco or Inside Out could be because of who it's catered to. Coco has the huge audience of Mexican culture who saw the film and amazed at how beautiful and accurate it was. Inside Out was extremely relatable to everyone as a child, and especially anyone who has gone through depression.

Ratatouille was a beautiful film that anyone can enjoy and appreciate, but I think it really resonates more with chef's or fine artists more than the average person.&&Dark and warm and enticing. Those are the words I was looking for. The look and feel of Ratatouille is cozy, in a way not often seen, and certainly not seen in the rest of Pixars films. &&I feel Ratatouille suffered from being followed by WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3, the latter two are of the few animated movies to be nominated for Best Picture.&&I dunno about Coco; that might just be recency bias. Inside out is probably beloved because more people empathize with it's themes as its literally things that have gone on in all our heads.&&Oh my god, that fucking bitch peppa pig. The fucking pig version of caillou. Fuck both of those shows. If I had a kid they would be banned from watching either of these shows. I wouldn't want my kids acting like that.&&Pixar saved my ass as a father.

Make sure you pick up the Pixar Shorts collection too, for when you don't have time for a full movie. My kids love them.&&Haha, my ex gf had two pet rats, and for one Halloween she dressed up as a chef and carried the black one around with her all day!&&Mine too. Its all round an excellent film.&&That and Wall-E are both astonishingly good films, animated or not, and should have been considered for Best Pictures, especially considering what they were up against:

Wall-E: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Frost/Nixon, Milk, The Reader and Slumdog Millionaire

Ratatouille: Atonement, Juno, Michael Clayton, No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood.

Don’t think either deserved to win, but both should have been nominated. &&It's my favorite film, period.&&And for me, the incredibles. Who's is Pixar's best asset between Pete Docter or Brad Bird?&&Top two for me. Favorite Pixar but tied with the Hunchback of Notre Dam for Disney.

He makes *the* ratatouille!&&My granddaughter is now 8 and this has been her favorite movie for years. She loves cooking. &&If he doesn't love it, he doesn't swallow&&and then - the dropping of the pen.&&It really is. Mine top 3 are this, Pirates 1 & Forrest Gump.&&I would almost agree with you if it wasn't for the whole ""park collapses and a lot of people die"" part. But I do get what you mean, the parts where everything goes right and there's just so much wonder are intoxicating. Honestly, I would pay money to see a JP movie where just... nothing happens. The park works as intended, and you get to follow a family as they explore the park and see the dinos in all their majesty.&&How is Jurassic park a feel good movie? &&Yeah seriously. Personally I'm torn over wall-e. The first part on earth is a masterpiece, absolutely one of the greatest achievements of any movie I'd argue. But once they leave it suddenly becomes much more mediocre imo&&As you said, it's not underrated with Pixar fans, but with the mainstream general audience.&&Yeah, I get that, but if you go to Disney World, there's almost no sign of Ratatouille at all. The only thing I've ever seen is a cook book and some kitchenware at a Disney Springs store.&&It’s definitely underrated. Sure, it has fans (including me), but from what I’ve seen most people rank it below The Incredibles, WALL-E, Finding Nemo, and at least one of the Toy Story films. And it definitely has less mainstream appeal.&&It’s not as serious and mature as Ratatouille though. &&I just wish they didn't tac on a villain at the end. The movie could stand on it's own without the typical Disney villain. The Pixar/Disney movies become too predictable and follow the same blueprint. Should take note from movies like Ratatouille, Studio Ghibli, Etc.&&Wtf is wrong with you&&I envy you so hard right now!!  I’ve always lamented my inability to see a movie for the first time twice, and to have the experience of watching Ratatouille for the first time still ahead of you, well, it kind of makes me sad and jealous.&&Everything!  

But really, I've seen that film more times than any other film probably.&&I love rats, and it’s a nice name that generally doesn’t bring a rat to mind. &&Remy is a PORNSTAR&&I totally agree. And that doesn't take anything away from the film, it's still one of my favorites ever. But yeah, it's not really an allegory at all. &&Author of this article either doesn't know what an allegory is or just likes using fancy-sounding vocabulary in order to sound sophisticated

Maybe both actually&&You are correct - It is certainly the plot and not subtext or allegory. &&I feel like last year was 2010, but think the 1980s were 20 years ago.&&10 years?! But I watched this in college and got high several times..oh crap&&Its gonna be the 22nd century and you are still living in the early 2000s.&&Well yeah, Remy is a street rat. He's got some mad skills with a knife too&&@ u/T0mSellecksMoustache&&What does “dont @ me” mean?&&My three favorite Disney/Pixar films. I can't imagine anything being created that will top that trifecta. What they did without using words in the beginning of Up and throughout Wall-e is nothing short of genius. &&> The direction Disney took Pixar

.... shame we got great movies like ""Coco""?&&But don't you want to watch Toy Story 10?&&Generally I agree with this, but as other comments have pointed out, Coco was very similar to Ratatouille in style and was just as great of a movie if not even better imo. Despite movies like Cars 3 and Monsters U (neither of which were bad BTW, they just weren’t anything special), Pixar still knocks it out of the park occasionally.&&""Inside out""came out after the merger right? I think it holds its own in the list you gave. &&If them creating a sequel or two gives us a coco and up every couple of years, then sign me up. The sequels make a ton of money and that keeps these creative people employed for as long as they have stories. &&His review is brilliant and heartwarming.

>The movie’s grand climax, and the source of its title, is the preparation of a rustic dish made of common vegetables — a dish made with ardor and inspiration and placed, as it happens, before a critic.

>And what, faced with such a ratatouille, is a critic supposed to say? Sometimes the best response is the simplest. Sometimes ""thank you"" is enough.&&jesus, dude&&So, no sequel then.&&Jesus Christ &&wat&&That line- ""the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful that our criticism designating it so"" really resonated with me.

It's much easier to pick flaws in the work of others than to make something of value ourselves.
I wonder if any film critic made/wrote a movie that was generally well-loved. &&The scene before that where he is transported back to his youth by the smells and tastes... that always gets me.&&One of the best art criticism essays ever. And kids got to hear it. Pixar is unbelievable, needs to be said. Those people sitting around in one meeting and sketching so many of those movies, is insane&&Omg that gave me chills. I hear his voice so clearly in my head&&I owe my love of cooking (and the impetus to learn how to do so) to this movie and this dialogue. 

Am I the best cook? No. Not even professionally trained. I'm more of a ""hobbyist chef"", if such a thing were to exist. However, the movie convinced me to get out of my comfort zone of microwave meals and boxed dinners. It showed me that improvising can save a failed recipe, or forge a new one altogether. With this knowledge, it quashed the fear of failure that lurked in my heart at the precipice of the unknown.

Years after the movie, I am still trying new techniques and concepts. Not necessarily molecular gastronomy, but rather an independent pursuit and honing of skills those who are classically/traditionally trained possess. And now, I do it not alone, but with the person I've declared to spend the rest of my life with. Through baby steps we are ever learning and sharing our knowledge with loved ones through family gatherings, social events, and hosted dinner parties. Who knows where this path will lead, whether we keep it as a hidden gem of a talent only those who know us get to experience, or if we continue our expansion and attempt to pursue a livelihood doing what is slowly becoming natural to us.

And all of this, I owe to a movie about a rat and the bastard son of a chef in Paris.&&:')&&He talks about one of the best distinctions in talent. It’s not that everybody can have talent, but talent can come from anywhere. You don’t need a pedigree to be talented. But you never know your talents unless you try them out. Don’t disregard potential talent because it doesn’t look like the talented people you have become accustomed to. Be open to talent. You may be pleasantly surprised. 

If you’ve ever been suddenly struck by some form of art but never expected it, whether a piece for music from a genre you hipster-hated, food from a cuisine you disregard as wierd, a painting or sculpture from some art style you think is pretentious, or a movie from a genre you think is dull, then you understand where Anton Ego is coming from. &&The whole scene gives me such Frisson: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyUKdJccgM&&Ok, I'm having goosebumps reading this, literally, chicken skin man... I forgot how awesome this movie is, and now that I'm getting more and more onto that world (cooking, not movies, lol) I think I deserve a re-watch... &&Oh god, that was Peter O'Toole? I didn't even know.

What a wonderful actor he was. Always hated how he went 0/8 for academy awards.&&Holy shit, that was O'Toole. I always thought the monologue was delivered so goddamn well. Thought it was gonna be the peak of that voice actors career.&&Pixar movies turning Adult for a moment are their best moments. &&The other side of that coin are the deleted scenes from cars. Really dark.&&I honestly thought it was a little bit more of an adult movie than a kid movie. it's been a while since I have seen it, and i'm sure there are little kids out there that like it, but compared to movies lik Toy Story, bugs Life, Incredibles, the intended audience felt much more adult like. &&Ratatouille was an adult movie that kids could enjoy, not the other way around. If it weren't Disney/Pixar doing it, it would have clearly been seen as Kafkaesque surrealism.&&Most Pixar movies have a scene that does that to me. The door opening in Monsters Inc., the cowgirl's song in Toy Story 2, the beginning of Up.

Oddly, Inside Out didn't have that for me, though you'd think a movie about emotions would push your button at some point.&&He may be a dick, but he's a very likable dick. &&There is a comic book out now called ""Hungry Ghosts"" that you should also check out. Totally different, and might not be up your alley, but he's involved in a ton of diverse projects and it's one of those examples!&&I have often thought of him as the American Jeremy Clarkson.&&Big Night is effing amazing. Just rewatched it for the first time since the 90s. It's timeless.

That scene at the end where Tucci makes the omelette in real time. No dialogue.

Chef is also really good. It just makes me laugh that Favreau decided one day, ""I'm gonna make a movie, and do you know who my love interests are gonna be? Sophia Vergara and Scarlett Johansson.""&&I see you guys are sleeping on good burger.&&Gonna leave out the cinematic masterpiece that is The Slammin Salmon? &&loved chef! Jon did a really awesome job with that movie. was also cool seeing all my austin spots too!&&I love Big Night! I try to let people know what an amazing movie that is. Tony Shalhoub can do no wrong. &&I loved Ratatouille and absolutely hated Chef. To me Chef felt like someone read Kitchen Confidential and a bunch of similar books and made a movie on what they think it was like. It never felt genuine. That along with the cheesy ""Dad has no clue about so social media but it turns out his 11 year old kid is the key to business success"" plot really turned me off. Then they capped it off with the completely unrealistic happy ending that you would expect from a shitty made for tv movie on a family channel.  
Yeah they got some of the stuff about chef's lives right but for me that isn't an excuse for the rest of the movie.&&Holy shit, props to you man. Life handed you the most rotten lemons and you made something good outta it. I would legit love to see your story as a book or a movie(any kinda media really).&&This was beautiful&&Do you cut onions for a living?&&Just what happens when you work in a kitchen long enough.&&Cooks are covered in burns and scars. You work with fire and knives you get burnt and cut. &&There's a specific site on the forearm where most people who work in kitchens eventually get burned. It happens when you reach far back into the oven and then bump your arm into the top of it while pulling something out.&&just seasoned chefs. its more of a /moviedetails or whatever that sub was, kinda thing.&&Monster Inc. was my least favorite movie as a kid because of those ugly looking characters but watched it an year or two ago along with Monster University and realised how mind blowing it was.&&or the first 5 minutes of Up. I was bawling &&I fully expect to cry at some point during a Pixar movie and that's half the reason I see them. Not many movies connect with the audience emotionally like they consistently do.&&Dude, Monsters Inc made me cry so hard when I saw it as a kid. That stupid flute music still makes my eyes water a bit whenever I hear it.&&Yeah that too. Toy story series is legendary. I, being a grown-up, never felt much attachment to even the Lion King but toy story hit me right at the nerves.&&> Andy gives Woody to the girl

...&&When I saw Toy Story 3 I was about to go to college and it was amazing. We grew up alongside Andy &&I remember seeing Toy Story 3 in the theater, it was packed with mostly adults and teens. The people that grew up with the franchise.
At that moment all you heard was sniffling and sobbing. I think probably 80% of the audience was crying or puffy eyed walking out of the theater.&&Yes to both of these.  One that surprised me with how hard it his me was in Finding Nemo when Dory says, ""I look at you and...I'm home.""&&I think I’m really hungry and it’s making me emotional because I started crying as soon as that scene started. &&Yeah read about it and I think that might be true.&&It was played at my wedding! We used it as our ""exit"" song after the ceremony and before the reception (held on the same site.)&&The singer of that song voiced Collette in the French version&&> Festin

Glad to see I am not the only fan here of that song !&&Give Amelie a shot if you like the French/Paris vibes :) it is subtitled, and French- but damn it, if it doesn't portray that beautifully romantic city so well.&&Both of these movies, as well as the Incredibles, had the same man as the composer!&&Not to mention Batteries Not Included.

Tomorrowland was sort of a stinker, though.
&&I love him&&^^^except ^^^Tomorrowland&&He also worked on King of the Hill, Rugrats, The Critic and peak Simpsons before moving to film. He has one of the best CVs in Hollywood, the quality of his work is underrated. &&[deleted]&&> When it came out I was still in college. [...] Now I'm approaching 40, married, with a kid.

...fuck, really? Wow. Now I feel old.&&He was rumored for a Jurassic World film too, I think.&&The scene where Remy's in Alfredo's apartment for the first time and they pan to the view of the Eiffel Tower, man...&&Being in a kitchen is no joke. You have to have passion for it.

If you don't, it is incredibly stressful and masochistic.&&I recommend to read ""Creativity, Inc."". 
The guy (Ed Catmull) had a dream to make movie on the computer. So he worked hard toward that goal,  invented a bunch of stuff needed for that (just look it up), and finally got his ""Toy Story"". But that's only half of the story, because when you achieve a goal you were strivin for for 20 years, what's next? 
&&It's rare in this medium to see a pun so well-done.&&[Bernard Loiseau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Loiseau)&&What are the other two in the top three? Ratatouille is one of my favourite movies too, I make sure to see it at least once a year&&I found the opposite - Inside Out seemed to try too hard, and didn't really resonate with me. Ratatouille on the other hand is just damn near perfect.

Haven't seen Coco yet.&&It’s all those amber tones and rest of the films gorgeous color work, coupled with the charming music. It’s just a really pleasant film to take in. &&Cozy and comforting like the food they create every day.&&and Wall-E formed the 1-2 punch (with The Dark Knight) to expand the Best Picture category into 10 films&&Same way that Tangled was followed by Frozen. I thought Tangled did everything right, and was set to be one of the best ever. Then Frozen happened. 

So it goes I guess.&&Don't forget Up! That first scene must be the most iconic of any Pixar film.&&I watched Coco VERY recently, and I can honestly say it shot up instantly to my top 3 Pixar movies. Ratatouille is still my number 1, but Wall-E has some tight competition with Coco at this point for the number 2 spot.

It's not a recency thing for me, it's a strong bond to my family, who is very spread out or not as close anymore. It's about making sure to be close to them. It's about music. It's about just so much. I have only cried at 3 movies before I watched Coco, and now (annoyingly) that number is 4. The movie is charming and heartwarming in all the right ways, and fully deserves the praise it receives. &&Both watch Peppa Pig.  You don’t find Peppa Pig, Peppa finds you.  Like a child version of The Ring.  The ducational Peppa games are pretty good though. Lots of sorting and same/different type games.  Great for 2-3 year olds.&&if only r/RatatouilleMemes were as popular as r/incrediblesmemes

&&Unfortunately the awards basically have a total disinterest in animated features compared to live action&&To their credit, they do get best picture nominations every once in a while. I think UP got nominated most recently. &&Same!&&I'd give the edge to Pete simply because I feel he's been a part of more exceptional projects for Pixar.&&When the film came out when I was 8 it actually made me want to eat at a nice restaurant in Paris and when I turned  18 I had the chance to go to Paris and I was so amazed that every restaurant or bistro or cafe I went to was so good no matter how busy it was. Thank you Ratatouille! &&Chef Steps did a great one too where they tried out a few variations. https://youtu.be/iCMGPRiDXQg&&I like how his typewriter looks like a skull.&&Pirates...of the Caribbean? Or the other Pirates?&&Yeah, a nice tour in a jeep where everything goes great would be fun to watch.  I'd also like to see the whole lab tour, we never got to see all of it because the scientists managed to run it and go look at the eggs.&&Hard to explain, maybe it's just me, it's just a movie I can watch often and it makes me feel good. It's a good combinaison of alternating tense moments, and moments of being happy. &&Its got two big themes: the environmental one and the sociological one. The latter half of the movie is exploring their social system, and then the ability for the individuals to change that system. It's a story where the antagonist is not a person, but a system: the ship itself. The issue you might have is that the two messages seem segregated and thus they don't spend enough time on one or the other. To me though, the environmental message is inseparable from the sociological one. The problem is caused by a social system, and the people that make up that system change it to then solve the environmental problem. &&The first part is really great in discussing what is trash, what is valueble, ect.  But then for the middle of the movie that kind of theme feels forgotten and we dont see it return till the very end&&I feel this way about Up, too. The opening of the movie is one of the most poignant, emotional and beautiful sequences ever put to film, a true glimpse of cinematic genius. And then, the rest of it is ok.&&I agree. 

Wall-E contains some of the greatest aesthetic heights Pixar has ever ascended to, but it's also narratively uneven, and the latter 2/3's of the movie gets bogged down by mediocre storytelling.

The Incredibles, Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, and maybe a couple others, feel exuberant all the way through, never ceasing to be thoroughly engaging. &&Just got back from Disneyland Paris last week, they have a whole mini Paris section with a Ratatouille ride (very good) and Bistro Chez Remy, a real restaurant. You have to book days in advance. All the seats are corks or cork cages, the parasols are cocktail umbrellas, and the tables are tin lids. &&The concepts in Coco are just as mature (death, family, forgiveness), it just manages to present them in a more kid friendly way throughout. The stakes in Coco are way higher then they ever are in Ratatouille.&&Wtf is wrong with him&&I appreciate that. He's a pretty chill kid as well. &&And the 90s are 10 years ago, of course.&&I'm 20 years old but I feel like I shouldn't be this old yet, when I hear someone thinking about the 80s I'm like ''yeah that was like 20 years ago, long before I was born''. 

It almost feels like I sped up my life like on the movie click.&&I think Stuart is a mouse, not a rat&&[r/2mad4madlads](https://www.reddit.com/r/2mad4madlads/)&&fuk&&I think it's saying ""don't reply to me,"" as in, ""don't argue with me."" Since to argue with someone on Twitter/insta, you have to @ them. &&A twitter meme. Basically, ""don't reply to/argue with me"".&&I’ve always read it as “Don’t come at me”

I believe this might have originated on twitter or some other social media that has handles. Usually when replying to someone you would have to put @ in front of the username. So when replying to something it’s usually

@username “comment”

So it usually means “don’t try to argue with me”&&It's Twitter-speak for ""fight me"" &&I mean, The Incredibles has to be up there too. &&And Inside Out&&Until the Toy Story sequels stop outperforming their predecessor, I'm not sure that's a good joke/criticism, heh.&&As if Toy Story 3 wasn't the best of all three movies.&&No I don't. I'm waiting for Toy Story 387 instead, thank you very much.&&If it's just as good as the other three I'll watch any toy story movie&&It is a Pixar movie but does not have some of the feelings and characteristics that most Pixar movies do.  And, possibly coinciding with that observation, I think it is the best Pixar movie.  &&The line ""Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere"" is the line that stuck with me. I haven't seen Ratatouille in years, but that quote occasionally pops into my head.&&>  I wonder if any film critic made/wrote a movie that was generally well-loved. 

Roger Ebert wrote Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, which wasn't super well received, but does have something of a cult following.&&A lot of the big directors of the French New Wave were former critics, including Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. &&Birdman did this wonderfully :) art for the sake of art- or art for the sake of others people's admiration? You can never please everybody, but as long as you stay true to yourself, you're on the right path!&&It becomes easier over time, as the critic dwells more and more on the negative and allow themselves to become jaded or numb to it. I see it all the time in internet critics who earn notoriety for being bombastic or hyperbolic in their negative criticism, only to steadily lose credibility as they either burnout on their own bile-spewing or their capacity to appreciate or even notice positive aspects of content diminishes. &&Gary Whitta was a PC Gamer writer. Wrote Book of Eli and Rouge One. Many, many Videogame writers and creators came from the critic circles. It make sense that rarely the 1% critics cross over as they have firmly established careers but being a critic as a stepping stone to art and using that time to really learn the intricacies of the craft and learn how to separate opinion from quality-among other skills- isn’t that unusual. Source: was my career path, watched my colleagues spread all over entertainment. &&IDK, I feel like too many people ignore the fact that criticism is its own sort of pursuit that combines different skills, namely writing and analytical ones. There's all sorts of different types of criticism. You've got generic populist reviews, really lengthy and in-depth scholarly and academic criticism, short, punchy reviews from critics like Pauline Kael, Ebert style reviews that straddle a middle ground, etc, etc. Some people even consider it its own art form.

The whole ""critics don't make anything they just hate"" is just an empty platitude meant to make the GP feel better about themselves IMO. And in the film, Anton spells out his epiphany in the form of a review. It's actually kind of interesting. He sort of discredits his own position in a way that validates its worth at the same time. &&The dropping of the pen is to me one of thw best pixar movie scenes&&*After all this time?*  
*Alwa-*  
Woops wrong movie&&Just saw Coco a few days ago. I was blown away by multiple parts of the movie. Pixar has always been amazing, and I hope they continue to consistently make good movies &&In The Incredibles, when Helen tells the kids it's not like a Saturday morning cartoon, it really set a mood 
&&And most of them have that moment at least once, but some really shine in this regard. Some of their movies made really brave decisions when it came to the depth and execution of the characters and plot development - Ratatouille for taking such a ridiculous concept and making it work, Up for tackling a heavy subjects like death and aging, Wall-E for having a main character who barely talks, and Inside Out for well... the whole film. 

Seriously, who goes to make a film, sits down and says ""let's make a children's film set from the perspective of the inside of a kid's head, and make it about how growing up is both hard but ultimately good, with the moral of the film being that it's ok to be sad."" ...and then freaking makes that film, and it's awesome. I've never seen another filmmaker try to do anything nearly that challenging, much less do it so well. They take concepts that adults have a hard time explaining and break it down so kids can understand it and relate to it.

Ironically, one of the least brave stories they've done IMO is *Brave*.&&Just watched Coco where Hector sings a  booby song and shares a shot of tequila with the old dying guy. Spot on.&&I didn't see them, what were they?&&May I introduce you to our Lord and Savior Bing Bong, who died for our sins?&&lmao you like dicks&&I don't know much about him but he always came off friendly to me, how is he a dick?&&His whole style is just so interesting.&&He is a dick in the same way every asshole who worked in a kitchen his/her whole life is a dick. It’s a very specific kind of dickishness that is combined with a dash of wit and charm.  

I’ve worked in a ton of restaurants and the head cook (or chef depending on the place) is always a dick. But they’re good dicks. 

I imagine it’s the same kind of attitude that arises in the military, although I’ve never been in the service. It’s the hard edged guy with a sharp tongue and attitude who has your fucking back and you don’t really know it until you need to know. 

It’s also a very no nonsense attitude. &&His take on the MeToo movement has been inspiring. &&That’s a perfectly succinct description of the genius that is AB. &&I think I’m out of the loop. Why is Anthony Bourdain a dick? &&I think he has the clout to be. He can be a dick but he seems super genuine.&&I've rolled with him in BJJ before. Tough guy. Really, really nice and humble though. Introduced himself as Tony. Didn't turn down any rolls or put any conditions on rolling with him (which a lot of celebrities do). Took time after training to take pictures with whoever wanted them. I've met celebrities of a way lesser degree that were 1000x a dick as him.&&""I get to eat cubanos, hang out with Robert Downey Jr. and kiss Sofia Vergara and Scar Jo and there's *no one that can tell me I can't!*""&&To be fair, he already worked with RDJ and Scarjo in Iron Man..&&Who is Guy.... Meatdrapes? What kind of name is that?&&I'm actually ashamed to say ive never seen that industry movie. I liked super troopers and beer fest but HATED Club Dread. Should I give Slammn Salmon a try?&&And the companion piece, Waiting? &&The movie was just so happy and easygoing I kept expecting the bottom to fall out. Nope. Just a nice, fun, thoroughly enjoyable movie.&&Binging with Babish, on YouTube, just did an ode to this movie's chocolate lava cake scene.&&Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossolini and Mark Anthony as the quite dishy/prep also!&&I enjoyed exactly *because* it was so light. There was no villain, no particularly major conflicts, no attempt to shoe horn in heady drama. It was just a fun, easy going, food loving road trip film that you don't have to think too much about and I absolutely appreciated it for that. Also the sound track was boss. &&The happy ending didn't feel terribly unrealistic to me. Which part did you not buy? The journey to get there (mainly the kid / social media bit which you covered) was obviously BS, but the idea that a world class chef could get beaten down by a boss who basically wants his restaurant to be a corporate gig going back to his roots and gaining success again doesn't seem too far fetched to me.

Plenty of great chefs have had some huge whiffs on their road to success. &&Looks to me like it's technically more about directing (Jon Favreau, the main character and the director) than it is about actually being a chef. It draws parallels without being a direct allegory and is more about the creative process and industries than it is about 'chef life'. It does make the setting feel as nice as possible, and one of the major points was the importance of balancing life-work and how good content doesn't mean good reception since, like you said, the kid's marketing made all the difference.

Really not a bad film, but a bad film if you want a 'restaurant life' film. Ratatouille is better for that.&&Thanks man. It’s not a glamorous life, but it makes me happy :)  &&I see, that is a pretty nice detail that I'd never even consider.&&I have SO many scars. A stranger once asked me (gently) if I tried to commit suicide about a particularly nasty burn across the inside of my wrist.

He got the looks and all the hoes&&Same thing for the Nightmare Before Christmas here. I always found it just way too creepy, and the way the characters moved was unsettling for me. I ended up watching it on tv about 2 years ago or something and it's now one of my favorite movies.&&It's actually a genius script when you think about it, You fully accept a WILD premise 2 and a half minuets into a film that there is another dimension full of monsters that power their own society through children's screams in a high risk facility. you get all that information very clearly and accept it. That is freegin difficult, i don't think i could explain peter freegin pan in under 2 minutes. this was brought to my attention by a podcast... We'll See you in Hell or Harmontown, i don't remember which but it really stuck in my head&&> because of those ugly looking characters

I witnessed some kids being frightened by the movie live as well, so that's a reasonable reaction. 

Personally really enjoy that movie.&&I feel like University deserves more credit. It tackled a subject that people don't just actively ignore, but detest. The idea that not anyone can be anything they want even with an insane amount of dedication and hardwork. But that they can still achieve greatness if only it means adjusting to the cards they've been dealt.&&Oh my god, no one expected it to start like that. &&The Adventure Book scene towards the end always gets me to this day. The music, the expression on Carl's face, all of it is just magical and beautiful and tragic at the same time. I've seen that scene many times and it's still one that leaves me congested and dehydrated when it's done. &&If you didn't at least tear up you're either a middle schooler or a psychopath. No exceptions. &&I first watched it with my daughter, who was the spitting image of Boo, with the pigtails and all. Him losing her door had already softened me up pretty good. Then getting that last piece - man.&&I literally went to university the year three came out. 

I was a fucking mess at the end.&&Phrasing! Are we still doing phrasing?&&( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Likewise. The scene of him explaining all the toys as he passed them on made me cry so goddamn hard. As a kid I had a Woody and Buzz and some others from the film, so it really cut deep. &&This is why Reddit is so fun&&Mind if I steal your guys idea. I’ve watched ratatouille a million times and never thought the soundtrack was on Apple Music. Le Festine is amazing&&Will do. Paris is such a dreamy place.&&I second this! It was an outstanding movie!&&And he's doing Incredibles 2.&&Michael Giacchino also did Lost :) &&I think that was mostly script issues though. Plus it was a little weird with the George clone robot romance thing. &&Dang I thought I was the only person to ever remember Batteries Not Included. I loved it as a kid. &&I thoroughly enjoyed Tomorrowland, there are far too few original movies being made these days.&&Haven't seen it since it came out. All I can remember was something like [they found out the whole Tomorrowland was a fake simulation](#spoiler) and I remember losing all interest in the movie after that. But going back to wikipedia and reading through the plot I can't even make any sense of it. Was it seriously that much of a mess?&&I'm still gonna blame Lindelof for that one. The overall direction was fine I thought. He got good performances out of the characters.

Oh but the script.&&I don’t think he’s underrated at all. &&My wife cannot watch the opening scene. I don't know of any other movie that destroys you before the title card even comes up.&&Exactly man. Also the shot of Paris when Remy first discovers he is in Paris.&&That scene also had one of my favorite soundtracks of all time by Michael Giacchino. Ratatouille had the perfect staff to create magic.&&You killed the joke, burning it to a crisp. &&As someone who has cooked their entire working life, nothing is more saddening than losing a colleague to suicide or death by over dose.

I know the industry attracts a certain ""type"" but in this day and age, where there are SO MANY great and talented chefs in the world, we need to learn to accept our defeats and learn from them.

I just left a very French restaurant after only a month because the mentality was ""one bad yelp review could ruin us"", among other things. We can't let reviews scare us and turn food into a joyless, stressful task.

We should not want to die over food.&&Ah, thanks, I couldn't remember his name -_-. Shame on me.&&Holy cow, it says here that he killed himself after newspapers reported hints that he MIGHT lose a star. I can’t imagine that man’s passion for his restaurant.&&For me, Pixar's top 5 are Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., Up and Wall-E. 

I know I'm going to upset a lot of the Toy Story folks by this. (They're great too)

Edit: and Finding Nemo. I just love Pixar.&&Hunchback of Notre Dame and toss up between Mulan and Toy Story 3.&&And then of course the Oscars went back to snubbing Pixar just a few years later. Inside Out was a way better movie than Spotlight in my opinion, and Coco was better than almost every nominee this year (I’d only put Phantom Thread above it).&&I think that apart from the songs (and even *that* is arguable), Tangled is better than Frozen.

Source: Am Frozen fan.&&The scene towards the end where he's going through the scrap book in my opinion was one of the most powerful scenes from Pixar.  Him going beyond the ""Stuff I'm Going to Do"" for the first time to realize Ellie had filled it out.  Carl realizes he didn't fail her by not keeping his promise but rather that their life together was an adventure in it's own right that she cherished because she was able to share it with him.

&&I leave it up to you to guess which one is the feel good one.&&It's not two themes, though. It's a single theme: the abandonment of responsibility. We abandon the earth because we don't want to be responsible for it. We abandon care of our own bodies because we don't want to be responsible for it. We abandon true social interaction because we don't want to be truly responsible or accountable. We abandon learning, questioning, and even our own direction to automation. The first half of Wall-E? It was a message for its time, and it remains relevant. The second half of the movie? I promise you, that message was merely ahead of its time. &&As a Mexican far from my relatives (lived in NY all my life) can confirm. To us, celebration of passed loved ones is as important as the celebration of life itself. I was never prepared to deal with recent deaths in the family, but Coco taught me the importance of remembering.

""Recuérdame"" had me crying for days. R.I.P. Grandma.&&I have yet to see Coco, so I can't compare the two. But I actually liked how the stakes were not nearly as high in Ratatouille as other films like The Incredibles. Having really high stakes sometimes feel like a lazy way to build tension, whereas in Ratatouille, it was so much more personal. There didn't need to be lives on the line, because you were so invested in the main characters, the finale was as important to you as it was to them.&&Fair enough, but it’s also more humourous and fast-paced. &&Wtf is wrong with *us*&&When Gambit comes out, Remy will be way cooler. &&As they always will be. Lol&&For sure, love The Incredibles. Can't wait for the second one and more Edna Mode. &&This was my favorite Pixar movie. Mostly because I saw it with my daughter and it caused a lot of good conversation about emotion and how all of them are valid and important. For a while she would tell me “sadness is in control” or “Anger is pushing my buttons”. It was great and will be forever grateful to that film for started an important dialogue that has continued about the importance of all emotions. &&Finding Dory is pretty great too. &&And is true for writing too...  like Pixar.

I feel the original article mislabeled it.  It's not allegory, but myth.  Myth can be applied to many different situations, people, places and times; and allegory is much more specific.   Pixar's films work because they are timeless.  They are their own little mythology - that transcends time and space and taps into deep seated facets of human emotion and society.

&&I always thought criticss wrote hogwash and were full of themselves until I started reading Roger Ebert. While he may have been full of himself sometimes, he still was the most amazing critic I have ever seen.&&I also received a PM reminding me of Chris Stuckmann's BvS script, if that counts.&&Godard, Truffaut, and Eisenstein— three of the greatest directors ever—were film critics. &&Oscar Wilde was a critic before he wrote *The Picture of Dorian Gray* &&[removed]&&[deleted]&&He's not saying ""critics just hate"".   He's saying it's easy to forget that in the grand scheme of things, a negative critique of a bad piece of art is probably less meaningful than a bad piece of art.&&Good criticism is indeed an art form. I particularly like criticism in the style of the *New Yorker* where a work (or set of works) as used as a springboard to talk about culture more generally.
  
And though it's not universally loved I'd argue that the  [in]famous Red Letter *Phantom Menace* review eclipsed the film it was reviewing and is the better, more meaningful creative work. &&And her piloting that plane being targeted. Apparently her radio comments are pretty accurate to what you'd say in that situation.&&The scene with her piloting the plane is the definition of adult fears. It's something I doubt any child would really understand beyond ""DANGEROUS SITUATION, LET'S SEE HOW OUR HEROES EMERGE SAFELY!""

Meanwhile, says the mother:

>Abort! Abort! There are children aboard, say again, *there are children aboard!*

It's genuinely horrifying.

&&Syndrome as a villain gets too real sometimes&&When Bob comes home and gets into an argument with Helen really hit home for me. It's a family movie, and families aren't always happy. It reminded me of the few times just before my parents' divorce where they yelled at each other late at night when they thought the kids were asleep. &&I KNOW WHAT I SAID! LISTEN TO WHAT I AM SAYING NOW!&&I know it makes for a better movie, but I would've loved to see the kids actually scared. Dash slips into his place as a hero right away, but I don't see Violet handling the situation that well. &&For me, it's when Bob thinks they've been killed in the plane crash, and he's just silently weeping.&&Brave is definitely one of their weakest films, it’s basically “I’m a rebellious teenager, oh no I made Mom a bear, oops, sorry about that whole bear thing I’ll grow up now.”&&Have you seen this?

One is where lightning gets lost and makes his way into a junkyard of abandoned cars. The really disturbing one, starting at 5:37, is a different version of the scene where he paves the road. In the deleted version, instead of just hooking him up to a paver, they secretly transplant his engine into a paver. Then they put mater's engine in Lightning's body. He goes on to the race instead of lightning, while treating him like a prisoner. &&So gay&&/r/suddenlygay &&dick is love&&Me too thanks&&He isn't, I've never seen him be anything but respectable and kind. Maybe it's just his demeanor that causes people to think of him as douchy. I think he's particularly self deprecating, definitely not a dick.&&I don't think he's exactly a dick. I'm a fan of his shows. He *can* be very frank and crude and opinionated, and he's kinda got a ""bad boy"" persona as opposed to some other ""family friendly celebrity chef"" types, so perhaps that's where it comes from.   

But, notably in his shows Parts Unknown/No Reservations, he is always extremely and genuinely grateful and invested in the people, the culture, the customs, the history of the places he visits. And in his writing/commentaries he always seems very thoughtful.  

Maybe you can make a caricature of him out to be a ""dick"" but to me it doesn't fit the whole picture.&&I love the way he writes too.

I would put it on par with Beerfest for my personal tastes,  with super troopers still at the top. &&I definitely would love more movies where things just keep getting better. &&Chef completely threw me off because I've been ingrained to know that if things are going well halfway through the movie, catastrophe is coming soon after.

I also really like A Bug's Life. I know I'm probably the only person to care much about it, but it was one of the first movies I owned in VHS and I loved it.&&Notre Dame is my favourite animated movie soundtrack. Overall, there are other movies I like better when adding in everything else (characters, writing, animation quality)...but musically? Notre dame is the winner.&&Tangled is so much better.&&It's a shame disney fucked him so bad on the marketing of John Carter. That movie is way better than so many other movies of that kind and it got absolutely buried because they didn't sell it right.&&The other Pirates, then.&&Through a lens of individualism, yeah you could see it that way. However, that's not what the film was trying to portray really. Yes, they had gotten fat, immobile, left the earth, etc. But they didn't do this just because people were ""bad"" or ""evil"", they did it because of the system they had, and the system the ship's AI continued. It was only once people took charge of the situation, and altered the course of where they were going, did things change. It's a very a optimistic story about the ability to change how a system works for the better.&&I heard an interview with the writers of the music for Coco where they mentioned that people would play ""Recuérdame"" at funerals; it's such a beautiful and healing song&&Coco may be one of my favorite movies. I'm super white and all, but it struck such a cord with me for the same reason. I've only ever really had one grandparent (mom's parents were forever-absent and my dad's father passed away early in his 50's). The one grandparent that was around, my grandma, was around for everything in my life. She really declined in health while I was 1000+ miles away in grad school. I flew in to say good bye while she was mostly unconscious and she passed away a couple hours later.

I wish my family did more for remembering our past generations. My fiancee and I will have our own new traditions though for this. I'll make sure our children know where they come from.

Anyway, I better go figure out where these damned chopped onions are.&&I'd say the stakes in Coco are very personal to the main character and his family. Nothing like a ""save the world"" type scenario. &&For the love of all that is good in this world, go see Coco. Ratatouille and Coco can't be compared as they're like apples and oranges. They're both amazing though.

Coco is beautiful and moving.&&Roger Ebert taught me that a great critic isn't someone who you always agree with, but someone who explains why they liked or disliked something so well that you can understand it even if you disagree with it, and by doing so they teach you about how to appreciate the medium and have your own opinions about it. His reviews taught me how to watch and enjoy films in a much deeper way, and for that I'm very grateful. &&Yeah, Ebert is probably the critic I respect the most out of any of them, past or present.

It's seems being stuck in production forever did not help it, just like the Good Dinosaur.

Brave had a very Disney feel to it overall, despite the director insisting it would be a powerful social statement. Merida not wanting to marry one of the guys was selfish from the perspective of her parents and obvious from her perspective, considering how dopey her options were. As much as it pains me to say this, The Princess Diaries 2 did a better job of that plot than Brave did. The real story was about Merida's relationship with her mother, but it ended up being muddied up by all of the trivial subplots.&&Zootopia (which is Disney, not Pixar) was really disturbing in its early stages too. [The original premise was that all predators are legally required to wear a ""tame collar"" that shocks them when they feel strong emotions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkJGLCleFmI) The collars didn't actually make Zootopia safer, they just made the prey ""feel better.""

I mean, how do you define ""mainstream"" anymore? A kid playing video games and cussing endlessly can and does get millions of followers. How is that no longer ""mainstream"" if there are literally millions of people consuming this content?

It's simultaneously glorious and terrifying in it's implications. The amazing part is anyone and everyone has a chance to exhibit their talent, and barring a few factors, they all have a relatively even chance of getting noticed.

The terrifying part is that this is leading to the absolute opposite of what you're saying. Now that nothing is mainstream anymore, content is getting more and more compartmentalised.

For example, as a kid, I would get to hear a variety of music on the radio because in the place I lived (ie. Not the US or Europe), radio Top 40 lists were a very interesting potpurri of pop, rock/metal, R&B, and local music. Fewer sources to get stuff, so the sources themselves used to cater to a wider audience to ensure there was something for everyone.

Now, however, I can find dozens or more sources providing non-stop music only for the genre(s) I like. As a result, the type of music I listen to has shrink over the years. Where a kid my mix tapes would have at least 2-3 songs outside my genres of preference, I now have a playlist that's literally 1000s of times larger, but much narrower in terms of variety.

This is leading us to a point where ""give it a chance""  is a dying concept because...why do you need to? This, in turn, is making us far less tolerant of things outside our tastes because it promotes a circle jerk mentality.&&I've always been if the opinion that if you love some thing, truly love something, you should be able to pick out it'a flaws.

Example: physics essentially requires accepting that there is one external, observable objective truth, and to do physics properly requires setting aside personal desires for how the world *should* be, and after careful observations and meticulously verifying that what you observed is correct, accept the truth of what the data shows.

Physicists then tend to naively ignore the last part when discussing non-physics subjects, not realising that they do not have enough knowledge to do a complete and proper reasoning about the matter, and wrongfully conclude that they can in fact explain everything objectively better. Some also manage to find the mere thought of subjectivity having any validity offensive, and don't see the irony of how that is a very subjective, emotional response and how much they apparently value that emotion as correct.

after the passing of elvis in the 1970s, rock critic, lester bangs, concluded his obituary pretty incredibly, basically addressing what you write about (pinpointing elvis' death as the start of it). here's a [link](http://elvis-collectors.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=57626), and here's how it ends:

Literally, every time this man moved any part of his body the slightest centimeter, tens or tens of thousands of people went berserk. Not Sinatra, not Jagger, not the Beatles, nobody you can come up with ever elicited such hysteria among so many. And this after a decade and a half of crappy records, of making a point of not trying.  

>If love truly is going out of fashion forever, which I do not believe, then along with our nurtured indifference to each other will be an even more contemptuous indifference to each others' objects of reverence.

I will say good-bye to you.**&&> How is that no longer ""mainstream"" if there are literally millions of people consuming this content?

Because it doesnt enter the collective consciousness like it did during the era when we only had three TV channels and so everyone came into work/school the next day saying 'OMG, who shot J.R.???'

Very few come into work/school the next day to say 'OMG did you see that move Xx_PlayedYoMoMMa_xX pulled off last night?'

A few million followers is not 'mainstream', 100 million households tuning into the MASH finale is mainstream.&&I understand where you are coming from but I have to say I have the opposite experience. It’s because of this new media I’ve been able to access and consume music and television I never would have considered before.   

With pandora music, I get the “radio like” experience which so far has shown me music outside my traditional favorites. And when I look for new stuff, I tend to go to Apple Music’s main page and browse what’s hot at the moment or what’s on their charts. I’ve found some great stuff that way that past me wouldn’t have considered.   

And same with TV. With YouTube & social media/reddit, I have discovered clips of shows I hadn’t heard of, like Mr. Robot and Black Mirror, which led me to go find them to watch. We now have a million choices for tv watching so that can be overwhelming, but I love that we have such variety out there that I can find things outside my usual tv.   

I think our consumption of modern media is only as limited as we allow it to be. If you find yourself trapped in a small niche area, it’s really easy to go out and find other things to consume instead.&&Eh. I disagree. I find so much more diverse music through Spotify than I ever could with Apple Music. And I love Spotify for that. It might be up to the consumer to avoid compartmentalization. Actually, no. It definitely is up to the consumer to do so. &&When you truly love something the flaws become just another source of entertainment, like The Star Wars Prequels.&&The Incredibles is one of the darkest Pixar movies, and it's why it's one of my favorites.&&I think adult media is doing a great work of depicting depressing-as-hell scenarios by itself, between Black Mirror, Game of Thrones and the like.

But the celebrity chef and host of CNN’s Parts Unknown was hesitant to give himself too much credit when The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah brought up the “painful” issue during their interview Wednesday night.

“I came out of a brutal, oppressive business that was historically unfriendly to women,” Bourdain said, speaking about the restaurant industry, which has been rocked by its own sexual-misconduct scandals in recent months. “I knew a lot of women, it turned out, who had stories about their experiences—about people I knew—who did not feel I was the sort of person they could confide in.”

It was only because of his relationship with Argento that women began opening up to him about those experiences. “I started speaking about it out of a sense of real rage,” he explained. “I’d like to say that I was only enlightened in some way or I’m an activist or virtuous, but in fact, I have to be honest with myself. I met one extraordinary woman with an extraordinary and painful story, who introduced me to a lot of other women with extraordinary stories and suddenly it was personal.”

“To the extent that I ever woke up, that certainly had an effect,” he added. “So I think, like a lot of men, I’m reexamining my life,” Bourdain said, noting that he wrote what he now thinks of as “the meathead bible for restaurant employees and chefs” in his breakthrough memoir, Kitchen Confidential. “I look back, like hopefully a lot of men in that industry and think — not necessarily ‘what did I do or not do?’ — but ‘what did I see and what did I let slide? What did I not notice?’”

Among the chefs accused of sexual misconduct in recent weeks was Mario Batali, a man who Bourdain considered, and may still consider, a friend.

“Look, no matter how much I admire someone or respected their work,” he told Noah, “I’m pretty much Ming the Merciless on this issue right now. I’m not in a forgiving state of mind. I mean, that shit ain’t OK.” &&AB = Antonio Brown for me&&Overhead is the worst for it. Gotta love a good heater to the inside of the elbow. &&Paris reminded me of Toronto, or Manhatten.

However, when Andy gets the Buzz Lightyear toy he is now a bit older and [knows the correct way to orient the ""N""](http://henrycenter.tiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/toy-story-name-on-boot.jpg).&&Meaning Deadpool has had his own action figure for a longer period of time. When he first got it, if he was 'younger' he would misspell it. But when he would get older and get the Cable figurine, he would write the correct 'E.' Basically two great jokes in one frame that most people won't pay attention to. I'm excited :)

Edit: lol 3 people responded with a detailed explanation in the same 30 seconds. Good guy Reddit &&I think he meant the first toy has the ""E"" in WADE backwards while the other does not, suggesting that he wrote his name on the first toy when he was younger and didn't know the alphabet as well. This is possible, but I think it's more likely just a continuation of they Toy Story reference, where the main character, Andy, writes his name on the bottom of his favorite cowboy toy's boot. In the movie, Andy spelled his name with a backwards ""N"", an image that has come to be strongly associated with the movie. See [here](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/answers/691000/691762_1277335473881.57res_500_275.jpg)&&I didn't like it in the first movie either; Wade needs to look way more fucked up.  But I figure that's one of those things the studio will absolutely not budge on.  They're not going to cast Ryan Reynolds just to make him look like a living anus when he isn't wearing a full mask.

Of all the things that could go wrong with a Deadpool movie, this is one that I'm totally willing to just shrug off, though.&&Well, what's important is that it came. :}&&Stallone has his own skeletons. But staying with the guy that groped Terry is a overt shitty move.&&Who should Goggins play in the MCU?&&Cletus Kassidy aka carnage &&> but fucking Terry Crews

. . . you grackle.&&For me it was because the TV spots were stupid and did a horrible job advertising the show.  It just did NOT look funny.  Halfway into season 2 I decided to give the pilot a shot for the hell of it and I caught up in a few days.  It's an excellent show. &&Gina comes so close to breaking the fourth wall as it is. This duo would be perfect.&&Boyle with his costume on backwards.&&Bridge was my first thought, but yeah he's pretty obscure. (edit: as /u/JoshSidekick points out, so was Negasonic Teenage Warhead. If they used her, the sky is the limit. ) I was really big into the X-force comics as a kid, but otherwise I wouldn't expect anyone to know who he is. (George Washington Bridge is a hilarious name though. You just KNOW deadpool would give him shit about it.)

Only reason I doubt it's forge (aside from the lack of cybernetic leg) is that Forge is definitely a Native American. Recasting a traditionally white character as black is one thing, but one of the few native american super heroes being recast might be a bit on the wrong side of controversial. 

edit: Or maybe Hammer? I almost forgot about him, but he was actually part of six-pack, too. &&> Looks like Domino, Negasonic, Deadpool, Shatterstar, and Terry Crews (lol)

That's the twist.

\- them, probably &&[deleted]&&They are trying to get more R-rated superhero movies like Venom made. We shall see if those movies can capture what Deadpool can. But the writing and character is what makes Deadpool great, not the R-rating.&&Let's also not forget that Logan followed suit with an R-rating and generated almost as much as Deadpool.

He manages to find a new lust for being a do-gooder, a sparkly Hello Kitty backpack, all while earning the coveted coffee mug title of World's Best 4th Wall Breaking Superhero.

The mustache remark got me good!&&Also kind of worked for Sean Astin. But only kind of.

Lol, I just imagined Samwise as Cable.&&He follows it up with ""I've got the stones you're looking for..."" before teabagging him. That's pretty clearly a reference to Infinity Stones, thus a reference to Thanos. &&Yeah it could be that too, my brain went straight to infinity war but your explanation actually makes more sense now that I think of it&&Thought he was gonna say ""in the movie.""&&No, you're correct. Cable is significantly larger than Deadpool in the comic, and in real life Ryan is like 4 inches taller than Josh, so it's definitely a jab at fans that make big deals about size differences. 

Though I do agree that having Wolverine bigger than Sabertooth, or Venom not significantly larger than Spider-man are huge mistakes, as their relationship is based in large part on their respective size differences.&&Oh ha, I didn't really get that. Now I do.

Only the ""N"" is the correct orientation.&&Just because there is no context to this, Terry was groped by Adam Venit and has opened a lawsuit. He has been getting a lot of backlash from mainly other famous people.

What basically happened is Venit went up to Terry and grabbed his penis and testicles with the grip of a WW2 Veteran's handshake shortly after making some disgusting mouth movements at Terry (think drunk guy at a bar tongue licking the air at a girl). Terry filed a report with the police and opened a lawsuit against the agency company that Venit works for (they suspended him without pay for one month upon receiving the lawsuit). Now one of the producers (Avi Lerner) of The Expendables has threatened to remove Terry from the cast of The Expendables 4 if he doesn't drop the lawsuit against Venit's employing company. (Venit is Sylvester Stallone's agent, AKA the main/top paid actor in all of The Expendable's movies)

Terry then tweeted exactly what is happening, putting Lerner on blast publicly for his threat to remove him from the movie. 

I gotta say, Terry was already one of my favorite actors from back in the days of Everybody Hates Chris, but with B99 and just him not selling out like a lot of current famous people, I would say he is my favorite living actor.&&Venus Van Dam.&&Carnage&&Goggins is in Antman and the Wasp&&Sonny Burch in Ant-Man and the Wasp

Just as he reaches front and center of the frame he slips on what appears to be a human spinal column with brain still attached, falling cartoonishly. As he stands up and irritatedly wipes a gobbet of flesh from his eye David Harbour slides into the scene beside him in a fresh white suit. 

Before he can say anything Deadpool puts a finger over his lips, smearing blood, and says 'No Dave, it's not a  fucking tide ad.'&&You're in a tide ad.&&Oh god please no.&&Place I go to did it for a StarWars film. They ended up opening a second theater and put the overflow there and comped our meals. &&Agreed. Certain characters like Deadpool, Wolverine, Hulk, Punisher, and Venom would do well perhaps better with an R rating. Maybe an X-Men spinoff where a group of mutant powers are uncontrolable and cause extreme body dysmorphia where the Villian is themselves could work as an R-rated movie.

But yes using R-rate tag on Captain America or Spider-Man wouldn't help and could potentially hurt the franchise.&&That's actually hilarious.

Not apparently. It's totally is haha&&I still think they probably are just being courteous because of the issue. Not many situations where you'll check all 300 people in a theater for their tickets. Just easier to open that other theater, and they probably just continued to sell tickets for it since they opened it. 

For midnight showings that were Harry Potter or star wars levels of packed, we created lines and checked tickets before they went in.

He had a mustache for his character in Mission Impossible 6 which was currently being filmed - During that time, Justice League needed to do some reshoots and Henry was unable to shave it off due to contractual agreements and (still) filming MI6.

Just like the scam of a movie finding Gunther. &&Kung-Fury was good (until he went back in time at least) but I don't see how they could stretch it out to full feature length without the premise wearing thin.&&I didn't even know they were making a feature film.

The first short was mostly enjoyable but some of the gags were a little limp and/or could have had their timings tweaked (I tend to attribute this to the fact that the people in charge of production don't use English as their first language).  Said short could have ended up being feature-length if the Kickstarter had reached a crazy goal.  I shudder to imagine trying to pad 80 minutes with a limited number of gags spread very thin.

My worry is that they've used up most of their best ideas, not to mention the novelty of what they were trying to achieve, and there won't be enough new material to fill out a real movie at this point.  No VCR gags this time, either.&&Honestly, I think I got more enjoyment out of the Kung Fury trailer and the music video than I did the short film.

(Let's call it the ""Wayne's World 2"" misstep.) 
 Especially with the attention their project will be getting after snagging major celebrities.  But maybe I'm being naive.&&I expect it to pick up right where the short left off or sometime after it. They left it open ended and said they would finish the story.&&Part of the weird feeling of Kung Fury (especially on the original trailer) is a high reliance on CG, largely due to budget and location. Despite being set in Miami it was made in Sweden (hence the on-location outdoor viking lands), and they needed a lot of CG to flesh out scenes - they only could afford one police uniform so they assembled the police station from multiple green-screen shots, the masked Nazi armies are one guy duplicated a ton of times, and so forth.

The heavy VHS filter and the cartoon-y slapstick helps mitigate the fake feeling, but I'm not sure how the feature film will feel as a result. Presumably they'll drop the filter and the effects will be stronger?&&> My worry about the full-length Kung Fury is less about recycled jokes and more about over-production ruining the satire.

The only answer to this is to make a legitimately engaging movie that just happens to be satirical.  The opposite of the approach used in the short.  I think we'll just have to trust that those in charge recognize that this is how it has to be.&&I'm hoping it goes more Black Dynamite.

*whos there?*

Knock-les!&&A lot of Swedish comedy is timed that way. We find it funny and yes, it is normally on purpose. &&If the short had been pure brilliance from front to back, I would've been tempted to make the same conclusion.  Eh.  They can probably afford a good editor for the sequel.  Really just a question of whether they're shooting for something that looks cinematic or just a longer iteration of what they already created.&&I've seen people draw that conclusion before.  It's not completely implausible, but as I told another fellow, it would be easier to accept if the short was a directorial/comedic success from start to finish.  Too many things seemed to miss a beat, in ways that are highly characteristic of the language barrier.&&You HOFF-ta remember the Hoff!! &&A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. &&Exactly... &&[deleted]&&Well I helped back it so that means you love me too.

༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ PLS Disney ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ&&I love Star Wars, but how much Star Wars is too much?&&Lucasfilm/Disney are now giving people full trilogies for a continuous and pre-planned story to be told. This is exciting.&&Sweet. Now I can rest easy. I was kind of worried that every single movie in the next decade might not be a star wars or super hero reboot/sequel.&&It never ends.&&Disney is doing the very thing that I feared they'd do, which is over-saturate the crap out of Star Wars to the point that it's no longer special.  &&I'm so very tired.&&I'm hoping this doesn't mean they are doing away with standalone movies. It would be nice to have a singular Star Wars film that feels like a complete story with a finite ending.&&I've got a bad feeling about this. &&They honestly aren't good writers so kind of a disappointing announcement&&lol who created Game of Thrones again?&&*VaderNOOOOOO.gif*&&Star Wars is getting to be like your ""fun uncle."" Sure, he seems really cool when your young, and he's a lot of fun to hang around with, but as time goes on he never really changes and just gets older without ever doing anything new with his life.&&Yikes, I rather not have them anywhere near Star Wars if they can't heavily rely on expanded universe for their story lines. They did do a great job adapting A Song of Ice and Fire into Game of Thrones but when they ran out of source material they just couldn't produce a high quality TV-show anymore. All their original content/ideas were/are utterly rubbish. I can't think of a single thing that they've changed in Game of Thrones that I like.. or well.. Tywin was better in the show than in the books. 

I wouldn't credit either Benioff or Weiss for the success that Game of Thrones have had. Most of the shows popularity comes from the first couple of seasons where they could rely on George RR Martin's storytelling and after that the quality of the show has drastically worsen. I wouldn't even say that ""David and Dan are some of the best storytellers working today, [they] command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology"". Benioff has written two original full-length movie scripts; one was kinda mixed (Stay  from 2005) and one was utterly garbage (X-men origins: Wolverine from 2009). Weiss hasn't done anything by himself but has just tagged along with Benioff. 

TL;DR: I'm not excited about D&D creating Star Wars movies.&&It's a race to see how many franchises can be rebooted and/or beaten to death before someone is forced to have an original thought.&&Those are weird ways to spell George R R Martin. &&The thing that made the Star Wars movies so relevant in the last 20 years was the limited aspect of it, at least in the realm of cinema. Pumping films every year will decrease the ""event"" factor of the franchise, although it will still bring a shitload of money.&&Not looking forward to it considering after they ran out of material from the books Game of Thrones writing got terrible real fast.&&[deleted]&&These guys aren't the greatest writers, they are great adapters. If it wasn't for George RR Martin, they're typical old school soap opera tv writers.&&>“David and Dan are some of the best storytellers working today,” said Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm. “Their command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push Star Wars in ways I find incredibly exciting.”

No they're not. Check their own written material (including seasons 05-06-07 of GoT, which were not based on any original material mostly), their ""command of complex character"" is fool's gold. One of them wrote X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the other is no better.

They are good at adpating great material, they're terrible at making up their own.&&""But wait, what does this mean for D&D's much anticipated HBO American slavery drama?"" said No One. &&Keep in mind that they didn't write the majority of Game of Thrones and that their direction past the books so far hasn't been great. &&Stop&&Ok this is getting ridiculous&&I quite like the new films, but i'm really starting to feel Star Wars fatigue tbh. By the time these films come out I may have lost interest. &&Interesting. I'm not sure how I feel about that.&&Please no&&I don't have much faith in this considering every time GoT went off script from the books the episodes were pretty awful. &&Please do something new, not star wars&&Well shit. &&Questionable move in my opinion. I'm definitely in the minority when I think they're less talented than Game of Thrones would make you think. Once they ran out of GRRM's coattails to ride, the show took a serious nosedive in quality. It's filled with more and more shitty CGI battles and less actual plot. You get characters like Roose Bolton replaced by lolsorandumXD Ramsey at the tip of a hat because the show survives on shock murder scenes for your coworkers to talk about at the water cooler. People love that shit, so it's still super popular, but I think they've made way more questionable decisions post-books than successful ones. Granted, I also hold up some of people's favorite episodes as some of the worst. Hardholme for example is a massive waste of an episode. Even beyond the shitty World War Z fluid zombie physics they chose, you have an episode clearly designed to pump up Jon as a shining hero to cheer for in a show where that is antagonistic to that theme, and you get a fight scene which accomplishes little if anything beyond wasting a lot of time. But people also think it's one of the best, so I fully admit I'm in the minority here.

D.B. Weiss doesn't have any other noteworthy credit to his name.

David Benioff has a writer's credit for The Kite Runner, but also wrote the universally praised^(/s) X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Troy.

That's not a lot really a lot to go on, more one hit wonder (GoT) than a pattern of success. And definitely not something that shows they grasp short form story telling like movies compared to a single tv episode. All the things that allowed GoT to be an interesting slow burn for plots like the Red Wedding or the season 1 finale are things that don't play into the strengths of movies.&&You know those Christmas cookies you love so much? You get sick of them when you have them everyday.

If you want them and don't feel like you need them to the point you disrupt the rest of your life to get them. Then good for you.

If you feel like you need them, then you my friend are addicted to christmas cookies.&&[deleted]&&This actually isn't very exciting to me. From what I remember of the show, all the worst parts were the moments these two wrote/changed from the books. They weren't all bad, but they were the worst parts of the show in general. They also did a lot of really poor things in regards to adaptation from original work on GOT either deliberately or because they didn't see what was actually happening (eg. rape of Dany in Episode 1).

I think at best we're going to get something ""okay"" from them. But far from the quality we have seen with shows like Clone Wars or Rebels, or even the new films. &&FUCKING STOP!!&&So Star Wars will become one of those ""only the first three are worth watching"" franchises... ah&&Disney seems determined to run Star Wars into the ground in the next 10-15 years through oversaturation. &&Eh...eh. &&What happened where I'm no longer excited by new Star Wars movies?&&dude fuckin stop making star wars&&STAR WARS 2049

no really. Star Wars will outlive us all.

The first few seasons were fantastic because they just took someone else's story. The last few where they were on their own was just not good. 

It was really only saved by excellent direction and cinematography. &&In fact since they've gotten control of said characters and plots, they've managed to dilute them. I'm sure George was happy to let them meander off on their weird story lines to get to the end of the story whilst he's wondering how in gods name he actually finishes it himself.&&>command of complex characters

It was immediately apparent when they started writing their own material instead of adapting GRRM's work - the show became garbage script-wise.

Having said that... maybe they'll be tasked with making a Thrawn trilogy based on Timothy Zahn's work? Now *that* they're good at.&&I'm not.  When the books ran dry then the show became predictable and formulaic.  It went from something great to just another TV show, albeit one when a high budget.

Though he was also a writer on X-Men Origns, for all we know he ruined Deadpool.&&At least one of them was a writer on Xmen Origins: Wolverine.&&These are the best Star Wars books I've read. Also Timothy Zhan wrote another one called survivors quest I think? It was as good as the thrawn trilogy albeit a single stand alone book. &&Thats exactly what Star Wars is now anyway&&Agreed&&Definitely. GOT SS 1-4 was an immediate 10/10 without question. Then the drop off got worse with each season and really showed they have no idea of characterisation or storytelling and just go for spectacle.&&I didn't even read the books and I could tell.

I think it was the end of season 4 that I noticed how predictable aspects of the show were getting and I dropped it then.

I haven't been watching anything since so I can't really say that it got worse or anything but your comment is perfect.

It was just so easy to tell what was source material and what was being added by the shows writers. It killed any interest I had left in the show.&&So it will be like all the Star wars movies coming out now&&Remember in the first season when they didn't even show two major battles, because the drama between the characters was so good, and they couldn't afford it?&&oh god that is too much &&No where does it say ""trilogy"", it said they're making a new ""series"" of films.&&Seriously needs to be re-canonized&&[deleted]&&I'm burned out already. TFA was fun but uninspired. R1 was a mediocre action film daubed in fan service. TLJ was decent but left me wanting no more. The Battlefront games were middling cash grabs. Solo looks like an obvious bad idea. And we have, what - eight films to go? Christ. It's a limited universe; good vs evil, spaceships and lightsabers. &&It’s the same with super hero movies though. As soon as you get tired of it, somewhere a little boy turns ten and just can wait to see Spider-Man and Thor in action... 

It’s like a never ending audience factory. 

Maybe you will stop watching enventually, but by then you aren’t their demo anymore.&&I think that’s fine. The issue is really that they didn’t write a complete story or at least set any boundaries before they started. A rough outline would have gone a long way. (This is coming from someone who likes both ST films).&&That was my biggest issue.  Both the ST movies were ""good"", but TLJ didn't really seem to flow from what TFA did, other than the parts they *had* to follow because it wouldn't make sense otherwise.
&&Yeah, the two new sequels felt so separate from each other that I wonder why they didn't write a script for the movies first than make them. &&This was my biggest issue. We know Lucas didn't do well in the Prequels, but god damnet it told a congruent story and held the same theme and elements throughout. Something 7 and 8 didn't do. I'm stoked for these two to do a trilogy. &&Yeah, my faith in their ability to make good *original* material is pretty limited.  They did an excellent job adapting Game of Thrones... until they ran out of stuff to adapt, and then the series plunged in quality *dramatically*.

I mean, Benioff's biggest hits have been Troy (The Illiad), The Kite Runner (book of the same name), Brothers (a Danish film), Game of Thrones (a series of novels)...  Weiss has done, basically nothing on his own.


These two dudes basically just made the right pitch to the right people after stumbling across George R R Martin's novels when Martin's agent contacted them.  

These two getting attached to Star Wars isn't exciting in the slightest.

I read all the books years ago. r/asoiaf was my homepage for years. It was my favorite thing. I dreamed of the day TWOW's release date would be announced. That was 5-6 years ago. I've given up. Even when (if) the release date is announced, I won't be as excited because the show has already outpaced it and destroyed some of the reveals I was looking forward to. 

The show has also become a complete self-righteous joke. 2 years between seasons? For 6 episodes? To wrap up a story that has way too many plot points and characters to be wrapped up in 6 episodes? After the biggest downturn in quality since Heroes season 1? &&I firmly believe he will not finish them. He's almost 70 and morbidly obese.

I think the alternative history concept is very intriguing and if handled with tact it could be a great reflection piece on our actual current society. I think Handmaid's Tale is considered a pretty solid feminist book/tv series and it plays with this exaggerated patriarchal society that has eerie similarities to the real world.

The reason KOTOR is brilliant is that the narrative is built for an interactive experience, not a passive one.  The twist(go play these games if you haven't and if you don't know what the twist is DON'T LOOK IT UP) hits like a vibro axe because it happens to ypou, not another character.  Whatching it unfold would not elicit the same response.&&Keep them FAR away from KotoR. &&> Granted, they executed some badass original action scenes (Hardhome, Loot Train, Battle of the Bastards) so I’ll give them credit for being talented producers and setting up large scale entertainment. 

Did they direct those? It seems like the showrunners/writers would have the least influence in battle scenes, and fight choreographers/directors/actors would take more of a role in dictating quality of the final outcome.&&Best thing they have ever written for the show was the conversation between Rob and Cersei about their marriage. &&Battle of the Bastards was the most cringeworthy hollywood-style battle though, and the others were also not great (though not as bad). Sure they all looked very impressive on screen, but if you sacrifice even 1% of your brain from taking in the visuals to thinking about it, they just don't make sense.

""What's this, people are trying to surround us? Let's just stand where we are and gawp!""

""We've got them surrounded, let's close in *very slowly and rhythmically*""

""They're crushing us very slowly and predictably, let's not bother using getting our sodding GIANT to squish them with a bit of tree or anything though"".

They need someone on the writing team whose job it is to just constantly ask, ""but why doesn't...""

It's really disheartening to see people calling these movies 'masterpieces', is that how far the film industry has fallen?&&It doesn’t have to be limited. Say what you want about Lucas but his prequels didn’t need much space ships or a single Death Star plot to be entertaining and a treasured part of many (certainly my age group’s) childhood. 

Problem is that Disney are churning these out at an alarming pace and are playing it safe/defaulting to good vs evil and spaceships to create the feeling that’s all Star Wars is. 

Just play the KOTOR games to see more can be done but it’ll still get stale if it’s 1 movie per year for a decade &&[deleted]&&It was a huge shock to me that they didn't have an outline planned out for the new trilogy. That seems like a basic concept if you are planning a trilogy.

The main things JJ “asked” in TFA is who are Rey’s parents and what’s the deal with Snoke stealing away Kylo Ren.

The prequels had heart.&&I mean, George Lucas always intended the Skywalker Saga to be like one big movie essentially. It's sort of weird to have your seventh through ninth chapter have very little to do with the first six and be ""transitional"" when it's supposed to be continuing that story, nor do VII and VIII make any attempt to explain to us how things got so fucked up after the OT. It's disjointed at best. &&this is the key. Lucas was the visionary. The new trilogy had no vision.&&Yeah but he clearly made some things up as he went, like making Leia and Luke siblings. &&Also, who cares about the answer? The only question I cared about was ""where is Luke?"" And that got answered by the end.  &&One thing I don't understand, how is it that we have this MASSIVE galaxy, hundreds, thousands of planets.

I was hoping Luke would go full Paul atreidas Dune Messiah in the last movie and restore actual balance to the force but that seems unlikely now. &&That was the myth he propagated. A close look at the films - even without knowledge of how they were put together, but without a doubt once you read about how that happened - reveals that there wasn't much of a plan, and they just improvised from film to film. Darth Vader wasn't planned to be Luke's father, Leia wasn't planned to be Luke's sister - so latter films had to either ignore or awkwardly explain away things established in only the previous film.

EDIT: That doesn't in my mind make the films any less brilliant. Loads of masterpieces are extemporised, part by part. Breaking Bad didn't plan their future seasons in advance, they just did one at a time. Loads of execs have hired writers to craft detailed plans for five films in their new 'universe' without bothering to get even the first one right, see Sony with Spiderman and Universal with the Dark Universe. &&>this is the key. Lucas was the visionary. The new trilogy had no vision.

Hmm, agree/disagree there.

Darth Vader's theme (the Imperial March) [doesn't show up until ESB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8). In ANH, the Empire is represented by two pieces of music, [one of which is associated with stormtroopers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oo9GN--eoGk) and the other is [a short sting associated with the Death Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5MZYxY-QY). This is just one example of how peripheral Darth Vader was in the first Star Wars: in a film score built entirely from motifs, Darth Vader doesn't have one, and both John Williams and George Lucas saw no problem with it. Another example of Vader's lack of importance is Leia's line about Tarkin ""holding Vader's leash"" and his conflict with the other Imperial officers. Vader's relationship to Anakin, and Leia's relationship to Luke, were both almost certainly made up during the scripts of ESB and ROTJ respectively. It all worked out OK though.

IMO the problem is not vision, but that CONTENT has replaced STORY. 

People gave TFA and R1 a pass because they loved seeing ""SW Content"" in a modern movie. They ripped TLJ a new one, and Solo will suffer the same fate, because the spell has worn off. These new movies have nothing to offer but endless recycling of the content of Star Wars and people are starting to recognize it. 

What is the new trilogy about? No one knows. It sure doesn't have anything to do with ""continuing the Skywalker Saga"" or anything like that despite the inclusion of old characters. TFA teased us that this was all tying into the Skywalker Saga somehow but TLJ said nope, Snoke is nobody, Rey is nobody, Kylo *might as well* be nobody. And all for what? The new movies undo the great ending of ROTJ just to give us more ""Rebels vs Empire"" mush, which people turned out to hate. Poe Dameron, Admiral Holdo, Captain Phasma, Jyn Erso: these are all TERRIBLE characters that exist in a kayfabe universe constructed purposefully to monetize stormtroopers, X-Wings and Star Destroyers.

Centering everything around the content has turned the story into a bizarrely bad mess, in many ways worse than Lucas could have possibly executed it. Both Lucas and Hamill have commented negatively in a way that, if you read between the lines, the criticism is that story is no longer motivating these movies. In Luke's case that is literal. Luke has to be whatever he needs to be to make the rest of the movie conform to a New Rebs, New Emps format. **The #1 sleight of hand that Force Awakens pulled**, is that it never showed the inevitable consequence of the rebooted universe it setup. Which is: if the Empire rises again, *that means Luke is a fucking failure.* TLJ had to show Luke in all his sad failureness and that was the biggest source of fan backlash to the movie.  JJ Abrams handed Rian Johnson a bag of dogshit and said ""make the best of this.""

To state it as brutally as possible, there is no in-universe reason, not one, to make more movies in this galaxy. No reason has been presented in 3 movies so far and now they're making, by my count, 1+1+3+3 more. Star Wars has become a cannibalized victim of its own recognizability.&&It might even be that there was a vision cause JJ clearly set up 7 that way.  The problem is that the director swap didn’t have one overseer and took such a new direction that you realize it wasn’t that there was no vision but rather multiple ones and that’s what hurt it.&&They will be paid for their lack of vision! &&Or that the empire, which was defeated decades ago, still somehow has a million more resources than the ""rebels"" who are the fucking actual government now?&&Yeah I’m not a fan of that either. Scale is extremely poorly defined in the sequels.  Small, small-feeling universe, but “oh hey here’s a new planet we made up for the Star Tours ride sequence.”&&[deleted]&&IS THAT HOW YOU SPEAK TO YOUR SENATE??&&BOW YOU SITHS!&&GODS HE WAS FORGETFUL THEN!&&> When The Last Jedi ended, my interest in the new Star Wars trilogy kind of fizzled because I realized it was just going to go where Star Wars had been before.

When TLJ ended for me I remember looking at my family and all of us looking confused.  My first (and still now) thought was well they've killed off everyone except the one actor who actually died... Finn has no story now... There's no more FO... No Snoke backstory... I honestly have no real interest in watching the sequel / finale.  I could have been handed a ticket to see Episode 9 right then and there and I'd have said nah.&&Yeah, doesn't it just make all of Luke and Leia's sacrifices in the OT for nothing now?&&While true, it doesn't change the fact that the new trilogy clearly has no singular vision--or, at the very least, a steadfast visionary. Disney knew going into this that this would be a three-movie deal, so they *really* should've planned a rough outline for three movies following Rey, Kylo, and whoever else they wanted to feature.&&Yeah I don't get why everyone's so resistant to this idea. From movie to movie, the revelations and lore and everything is just very inconsistent. It's not *technically* inconsistent, but you look at what the obvious tone and intent is in ANH and they went a different direction in the other movies.

What I mean by that is, *technically* there's nothing that said Luke and Leia **weren't** siblings in ANH, but that clearly wasn't the plan when they made that movie. (There are many other such instances, though none as blatant)&&> I think the core problem of Disney Wars is that everything they do is centered around the content. They paid untold billions for the rights to stormtroopers, therefore stormtroopers have to somehow be in the movie.

Huh, I've never thought about it as content vs. story. Thanks.&&I would say that Uncle Owen knew something was wrong with Luke's father; ""Aunt Beru: He has too much of his father in him. Uncle Owen: That's what I'm afraid of."" 

Also, the look that Obi Wan gets when explaining Anakins death as if he knows that Luke wouldn't accept the truth that his father turned against the Jedi order and overthrew the republic as Vader.

There was foreshadowing, just not a lot and very vague.

Leia was 100% not his sister originally though.&&> JJ Abrams handed Rian Johnson a bag of dogshit and said ""make the best of this.""

Overwhelmingly agree with your overarching point, except this bit. Aside from playing it safe with the SW tropes, I feel that JJ did a very efficient job of establishing new characters with tantalizing story arcs ahead of them as per all the conventions of good story telling, and handed Rian a nice package to build on - gave him a solid start but didn't box him in.

Rian's response? ""LOL thanks, I'm going to take a massive shit on all of that and kill it off without any resolution. Now here's *my* characters!""&&",2018-02-06 15:31:55

Maybe with Tobey McGuire singing and dancing.

&&That logo is very late '90s.&&Tom Hardy with something covering his face 5&&This movie needs to be awesome. No pressure&&Is it possible that this movie will actually be good? Pretty solid cast, but I can't let go of the feeling that Sony will find a way to make this terrible.&&Solo trailer yesterday. Deadpool 2 trailer today. Venom trailer tomorrow. WHATS NEXT? AQUAMAN TRAILER BY FRIDAY???&&Looks sort of like a bra. &&I'd let Tom Hardy grease me up with butter and play 10 pin bowling with me&&Tom Hardy continues to accept big roles that conceal his face. Looking forward to this and it might be fun if it's a little darker than other MCU films.&&[deleted]&&Anything with Tom Hardy deserves a chance in my book. &&Please let this be decent. 

Edit: spelling&&That's a big poster.&&I remember being so excited to see venom in Spider-Man 3. It was going to be amazing to see one of my favorite super villains in a high budget blockbuster film.

I walked in to the theatre with unbridled excitement, and left with a sinking feeling of disappointment.
&&No matter how good or bad the film may be.. i will still see it just because i have a man crush on tom hardy &&Yup. That's Tom Hardy alright. &&I don't understand why more people aren't baffled by this movies existence.

Sony attempted to make a Marc Webb cinematic universe (already a bad idea bc of the lack of recognizable Spidey characters) which failed, so they gave the rights back to Marvel. Now, with Spider-Man *already a featured part of the MCU*, they're doing ANOTHER universe, the FOURTH Spider-Man series so far. Except, they can't actually use Spider-Man, they have to put the focus on a character that's only been in one other movie (which they also fucked up) and spoil any chance of seeing him in the MCU. Sony is pulling the most unbelievably desperate shit these days&&If you squint your eyes the text looks like his mouth&&Why does the lettering look so weird. Looks like title letters from Frozen or something.&&Hardy is the sole reason I am excited for this.
If his Bane didn't meet his shitty fate in TDKR he was on par with Ledger's Joker for me.

Such an imposing threatening presence he had through the entire movie, pity the character was butchered.&&I can't say I'm optimistic really- Sony have already managed to mess up Spider Man twice, and I will always maintain that Amazing Spiderman 2 is one of my most hated films. Tom Hardy is great, and Venom is a great character, I'm just sceptical as to if they can pull it off.&&I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. I hope they didn't fuck it up. &&This is dope.&&I’m mostly annoyed that Hardy is being wasted in a Sony movie, which means he likely won’t enter the Marvel universe...

I’m also annoyed that Marvel wasted Mads Mikkelsen on a one-off villain role...&&I just need the symbiote full venom to be as muscular and scary af from the comics. The spiderman 3 version severely messed up in that regard among MANY other things...&&The poster itself is pretty boring imo but I'm looking forward to the trailer dropping tomorrow. Honestly, there's just way too many places this movie could go wrong, though.

Firstly, I have absolutely zero faith in Sony/Columbia Pictures when it comes to Spider-Man movies after TASM. Secondly, this movie is written by some of the writers who wrote **Fifty Shades of Grey, The Dark Tower and the Fifth Wave**. I really hope they don't fuck this up but I have no reason to believe that they won't... :/&&jizz eyes: the movie&&That’s a pretty neat poster. Hopefully it’ll be good, and Tom Hardy seems perfect for the role.&&I'm kind of wary. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock? They usually get a tough guy like Eric Forman to play him.&&HNNGGGGG&&Oooo! Silver-embossed logo! How 90's.&&Boobs. &&It feels cheap that they just mirrored the images.&&It's kind of odd that they just mirrored the same eye shape instead of creating a different one, especially since it's amorphous goo that wouldn't have a repeated pattern like this.&&Enough to get me excited for the trailer tomorrow I guess&&Please be good please be good please be good&&[deleted]&&I can see why people would be worried about Fleischer as director and Sony’s history, but Homecoming was okay and the guy that directed that was known for a killer clown movie. At least with Fleischer we know he’s made one good movie. But my money is on Tom Hardy. He bailed on playing Rick Flagg with Suicide Squad and I don’t think he would’ve signed on with Venom unless he was impressed with what they had in mind. Here’s hoping it works out.&&Looks like cum&&This was a good Venom short film right here. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7YDYL6oECjU   Hopefully they top this.&&I’m still confused about the status of this film. Is it part of the MCU or not? There are people saying Tom Holland’s Peter Parker will be in it. &&Looks like a bra&&Can someone please explain how this somehow wont be connected to Spiderman? This looks like marvels Catwoman&&There goes Sony jumping the gun again. Look at the way black panther was introduced. Or how FUCKING SPIDER-MAN WAS. 

This is literally coming out of nowhere. Spider-Man isn’t even established enough for there to be an anti-hero version of him out there. The venom symbiote isn’t established AT ALL. How do they hope to have a good lead in to carnage when they don’t even have one for Venom. 

I’m super ok with this movie happening in the future, but come on. They better make the IW post credit be Peter picking up the symbiote in space. 

Fuck this has got me heated. &&I bet they show 1 shot of Venom in costume at the very end of the trailer 



Edit: fuck you sony &&I hope it's just the Eddie Brock scene with Topher Grace in church. &&Is that surprisingly early? Why do I feel like I was just reading about people being added to the cast like a month ago and we already have a trailer? Is my timeline off?&&Darkness literally molded him in this one. &&If someone wants to connect those dots I'd love to read the fanfic.&&Venom, Batman, Dunkirk, Mad Max, technically Inception, any others?&&For you!&&Anyone else only giving this a shot because of Tom hardy?&&Even when he is [at home.](http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/06/tom-hardy-quoting-bane-lines-dog-video-/)&&*Now dig on this*&&I don't think I can handle that even as a prank.&&/r/raimimemes&&Deadpool 2 will snatch that karma first.&&Reminds me of Spawn’s Poster&&Like Venom. &&In a good way I think&&That logo is a bra&&And 'Venom' looks like it was done in Word Art&&The _TOM HARDY_ in the middle of poster really bugs me. &&Wait 5?&&The only reason his face is covered so often is because he can communicate so well with his eyes. I remember reading that's why Chris Nolan chose him to be the pilot in Dunkirk. &&Yeah I mean I know Tom Hardy can be threatening but can he be as threatening as Topher Grace? /s&&Let's hope for the best. Venom's my fave villain, next to Doctor Doom (which they really need to give a solo movie as well)&&I hope it’s really great and this sparks a bunch of solo-villain based films... we don’t always need the good-guy hero type to balance a film. &&[deleted]&&Always look at the Director, Screenwriters, and , if possible, the editor.

The answer is that it is stacked against them.

The director is [Ruben Fleischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruben_Fleischer). He has directed, in terms of movies, Zombieland and Gangster Squad. The later of which was not well received. His other directing credits are on TV.

The screenplay is written by three people.  [Scott Rosbenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rosenberg) is the first. His credits are iffy. He seems like a capable writer but his experience in COMIC BOOK writing is lacking.

The second writer is [Kelly Marcel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Marcel).  Her credits are for Saving Mr Banks. This is fine...but not a comic book movie. Her other notworthy credit? Fifty Shades of Grey.

The last writer credit is for [Jeff Pinkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Pinkne)]. He seems like a capable writer, having many credits on Fringe. But, lest look at his film and comic book related works. It is not encouraging. He wrote the Amazing spider man 2, which was not well received. His other writing works for movies do not lead me to believe he would be a good choice for Venom.

Given Sony is the company making this, and that the people behind the scenes seem to lack experience in making a comic book movie...I would be surprised if this movie was any good, but everyone is welcome to hope.


Now, to make a comparison, we should look at Wonder Woman. It was PRODUCED by Zack Snyder. Producers are important to production, make no mistake, but I always look at them after the aforementioned roles. 

WW was Directed by Patty Jenkins. Her credits were not in the comic book area, and really Monster was her prized work. Still, she seemed more than competent at directing, especially directing strong female actresses. However, the two writers were [Allan Heinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Heinberg) and [Jason Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Fuchs). Snyder also had a writing credit on WW. Two of these writers (Snyder and Heinberg) had experience in working with comic books. Heinberg himself had WW credits under his belt following Infinite Crisis.

Lastly, the editor for WW was [Martin Walsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Walsh_(film_editor)) His credits aided in making WW a solid movie. Why do I feel this way? Because he edited V for Vendetta. Now, his other credits are great, but I happen to think his style in V showed how good he was at piecing together a comic book movie.

WW looked like it had a CHANCE to be great. The people that were involved COULD make a good movie, and they damn sure did. Venom, on the other hand, I do not feel even has those ingredients to begin with.

They've always been thinking about starting their own cinematic universe, and they're desperate for it. That's why Amy Pascal made those stupid remarks during her interview (claiming that it's MCU). Then she proceeded to clarify that it's not MCU, but part of the Marvel universe. Confusing, eh? She's doing it to latch onto the success of Marvel Studios and to trick the general audience into watching it. They're not just desperate. They're also petty and shady as fuck. All they think about is how to manipulate the MCU's success into their favor. It's just bad business ethics all around. They're already making money from the deal with Marvel (they get EVERYTHING), but they want more. They're like that one shitty friend that wants to use your name/recognition to sell their own products (without consent) after you helped them open up shop.&&Unless the unbelievable happened and in return for letting marvel use Spider-Man they secretly made a deal with Disney to let them cast Todd Holland in the Venom movie.

Just picture Lucas, watching the completely edited version for the first time, leaning back in his chair and thinking ""I've done it.  I've finally fixed this movie.""  And then grinning to himself in satisfaction.&&I actually kind of like that scene. My interpretation is that the reason the scene feels like a really awkward and cringey person's idea of how a ""cool"" / ""alpha"" man should act is because it is: Peter Parker is an awkward and cringey particle physicist, and when Venom infects him and causes him to act selfishly ""cool"", we instead get his personal and inaccurate picture of what that means. So it's a good insight into Peter's character.&&Don’t you speak down on raimi’s name like that&&*Emo hair flip*&&and the Blade porn remake.&&Spawn and Blade don't exist, Black Panther is the first black lead male superhero movie ever...

""finger banging"" means... something else... and the chicks would definitely look at him with more than disgust in that case.&&>  finger banging chicks 


I... Uh... Must have missed this.

&&I will take that over Eddie Brock being some kinda Suicide Squad. &&The main problem I had with suicide Squad is that at the end they acted like heroes. They were only there to lower their sentences, why would they keep fighting after Rick Flag said they could leave?&&I agree, but I do feel Kevin Spacey in House of Cards plays a great version of a ‘true villain,’ not only does the audience relate to him, they often times find themselves actually rooting for him. &&Where does Walter White fall in here? Pretty sure he was a villain that the audience rooted for right? &&True, it's less a question of ""if"" we'll see the character again and more a question of ""when."" For instance, I have no doubt we will see another Fantastic 4 movie again, but now it'll just be much later than it would have of the Fant4stic movie had worked out. (Of course with that franchise, it could still be another meh movie to keep the rights but that's beside the point). &&I agree, disney doesmt need to own everything, but i just would like all the super heroes that marvel has to exist in the same universe as the others. Whether that be via ownership or partnership on the project.   &&Rebooted on a Wednesday.&&[deleted]&&So...&&You’re a big guy.&&It's not MCU, it's only a sony universe film.

Classy.&&That would be a bit dumb. The movie is called Venom and the main protagonist is Tom Hardy, a name it doesn't need to rely on anyone to get hype. 

Puting Holland's Spider-Man on the first trailer would be rushed, at least they could do it on the final trailer like Civil War did with Spider-Man or X-Men: Apocalypse with Wolverine

Also having Holland pumping up there should be kept as a secret &&God I really hope that this isn't part of the MCU. I don't trust Sony with it at all. &&I'd prefer cut to black and then ""WE ARE VENOM!"".&&Maybe spoilers wasn't the right word but they put the scene where Tony saves Spidey's ass on the ferry in the second trailer. That would've been a nice surprise to see in theaters.&&I would have preferred not to know that he's giving up his suit as a plot point in the movie.  It was a pretty key moment.  &&Lets give them props for not spoiling the *real* major plot twist. &&I definitely felt like the Homecoming trailers spoiled most of the movie. The only surprise was Vulture-related.&&coming this fall&&>GOD IS NOT A CONTRACT KILLER EDDIE YOU FUCKER

-Buddha&&It's supposed to get across how vengeful Brock is. It's a pretty big leap to go from guy ""mad about losing his job"" to ""guy willing to kidnap his rival's girlfriend and challenge him to a public fight to the death.""

I think him asking for God to kill someone rather than going to commit suicide makes more sense in highlighting how truly angry Brock was; he wasn't as much down on himself as he was looking for someone to lash out at.&&I think that's the point. Movie Brock was a sleaze who used Peter as a scapegoat&&Catholics don't generally allow committing suicide, either.&&Well I mean most religious people also wouldn’t immediately go to a criminal fugitive to entice him into murdering a dude who got him fired after getting some black angry goop on them. Peter got the same goop on him and all it made him do was some sick pelvic thrusts&&*Now dig on this.*&&I'm gonna put some pizza time in your eye&&/u/Samui_Oppai, you are such a boy scout. When are you gonna give a guy a break?&&eh i think its moreso no one expected this to happen and they announced it and finished shooting within a couple of months. Typically with comic properties, they announce the film years in advance. Shazam was announced and theorized like 3 years ago and it won't come out till 2019. MCU phases are announced years in advance.

Ppl put this in the same boat as like Gambit, and while that one is stuck in developmental hell, this one is already done and coming out later this year despite it first being announced like Summer of 2017 right&&For you.&&They're alternative timeline Hardy Cinematic Universe. Pilot/Max are the same person just at different points in life. Venom and Bane are his twin grandsons in the non-nuclear war timeline.

Once the war ended Dunkirk Pilot moved to Down Under and became a police officer. Sometime during the early days of the Cold War nuclear apocalypse happened and he became Mad Max.

The non-nuclear timeline has his daughter move to the US and mother the twins who become Bane and Venom.&&they are the lonely parents.

in the end it turns out it's a star wars crossover and they are all clones from kamino. or something.&&And what about the Yiddish mask he wears in Peaky Blinders? &&Can't wait for season 2&&[mmm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ_RVjHu2AU)&&What a fucking war-crime of a scene. &&I don’t know why we were surprised when episode I was horrible. There was so much foreshadowing. I haven’t seen this version since it came out. Thanks for reminding me why The Despecialized Editions are so great. &&This is what is so frustrating as a fan of the OT. I get that an artist might want to tweak their art at some point in the future; after all, your skill set typical continues to grow and you may feel you can do some things better today than you could in the past. You may want to fix things you weren't satisfied with, and now have the ability to do so. However, once you have already put a piece of art out into the world, it is no longer your sole property. It belongs to the collective. 

Maybe this scene was what ROTJ was missing for Lucas. Maybe he always wanted blinking Ewoks, but they were too expensive or time consuming to make at the time for the number of costumes they had, and they needed that money elsewhere in the budget. Maybe GL always thought R2 should be hidden behind some rocks, but they were unable to legally move rocks in the area to create the scene he envisioned because they were shooting in some national park.  Maybe he really wanted Greedo to shoot first, but he simply forgot to film it that way. If he's happy with his final cut, then I'm happy for him. I simply don't want his final cut, as it isn't what I grew up on, and being forced to buy only his updated vision is truly insulting to the people who loved the original works.

To be fair, not every change is bad. Audio fixes, color corrections, a few updated visual cues, some of these actually do enhance the films. Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to turn off some of the features like a filter for our phone cameras, so unless your perfect version is the same as GL's, you won't find a new copy anytime soon.&&I seriously didn’t remember that shit. I know we’ve never met. We probably never will. I do hate you though. For posting that so I would end up seeing it again. I hate you for this.

Take your upvote.&&Every now and then i forget about it, but your post just reminded me how pissed off i am that you cant buy the originals on Blu Ray&&I fucking knew it was going to be Jedi Rocks &&[deleted]&&The scene before that (him walking down the street) actually does that perfectly.  He's doing these cringy, douchy moves, thinking he's impressing every lady he walks past, and every single one is mortified.

Then they decide, ""you know, that might have been too subtle, lets take this shit to the club, quadruple down on it, and not have the audience reaction match what we're going for at all.""

Cut out the club scene and the movie becomes less terrible.&&Isn't confident Peter Parker basically how Spiderman acts?&&I agree but that scene is so terrible to watch regardless. I think of Toby McGuire's internal dialog when he was walking down the street with cameras fixed on him, an entire production team intensely focused on what he's doing and he has to do that purposefully terrible dance and sell it. *Shudder*.



&&Just because it works in-universe doesn't necessarily mean it works as a scene. It's just plain hard to watch.&&I think the very personal hatred for Spider-Man 3 is, in many ways, quite unfounded, and I always come back to this scene because of that belief. The corniness and silliness that people complain about was always there; William Dafoe sometimes taking it a little far in the first film (Sleep, hah!), and then the Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head montage from Spider-Man 2. I think the awkward dancing sequence is a perfectly justified sequence in the context of this very silly, very aware film franchise. It has a Sam Raimi vibe to it, and I don't mean that as an insult: I see the scene as genuinely funny.&&That makes sense but it's still painful to watch and goes on a little too long.&&Ah yes, of course. bLaid&&My favorite entry in the MCU&&Inception. I believe he has a bag over his head at one point and plays a different character in the dreams. And in The Revenant he has a great big bushy beard. &&Large beard and Hasidic Jew hat in Peaky Blinders. *Nailed it.*&&He had a gnarly mustache in Revenant, would be my best guess.&&No, the giant cloud at the end of Green Lantern.

Or the one at the end of Hulk. 


Why the hell did 2000's superhero films think clouds were good villains?&&Excuse you, the Emperor was not a cloud. &&Doom also tends to steal vast amounts of cosmic power when the story needs to up the stakes. So he can be as big of a threat as the writers need him to be. On top of that he's like an evil version of Dr. Strange and Iron Man combined at his lowest power levels.&&I wants Mads to play Doom&&Yup&&Literally his whole shtick when he became venom was to kill the guilty, save the innocent. Now, I AM talking original venom, no new reboots, I'm not sure how he is portrayed there.

Just take a look at this, THIS is OG Venom.

The movie should've been about shitty people taking down an even shittier person (ex. Joker).&&[deleted]&&Yeah, it's absurd how far off the mark Suicide Squad was, even just fundamentally. They're bad guys put together to do a bad thing (i.e. something superheroes wouldn't do), but the movie was about them stopping the typical giant garbage beam in the middle of a city. They tried to muddy it up by having the guys behind the squad be responsible for the crisis or whatever, but in the end it was just a team of bad guys tackling a typical superhero problem.

The Justice League episode with the them (which was basically a heist story about breaking into the Justice League satellite) is a way better Suicide Squad movie. &&>why would they keep fighting after Rick Flag said they could leave?

They roll over you, dump millions of gallons of water on you, your home, your job, your girl, your entire life, and what do you do? You don't do SHIT. You take it, sometimes you don't even look up. You run from the rain, you even spend MONEY on tools to AVOID the rain, like gutters, umbrellas, rain boots, etc.

Face it, you can't do shit to clouds and they will fuck you up if they choose to. Don't act like that isn't the makings of an excellent villain. 

You're just so used to it that you don't even think about it anymore. Hmmph.&&Fuuuuuuck.  Mads Mikkelsen as Doom would be most excellent&&He was already the villain in Dr. Strange&&Mads would be amazing, but i want MF DOOM to play him just for the sheer absurdity of having a very obscure rapper whos career has been based around the character.&&Mads getting the role of the villain (and a lame, forgettable one, at that) in Dr. Strange vs being Dr. Doom.

Angela Bassett being some random person in Black Panther vs Being Storm.

Thats twice now (that i can think of) where someone was cast in a marvel movie for one character, but looks/sounds/acts far more like another character.

It really, REALLY disappoints me. Like, Kevin Sorbo levels of disappointment.&&Yeah, but his definition of ""innocent"" was pretty shaky and sometimes situational. Like, if he was trying to keep some other villain from busting out of jail, I feel like he'd totally save a guard's life. But I've definitely read an issue where he busted out of jail and decided the guards were not innocent. That kind of subjective situational morality is one of the things I really find interesting about him.&&Okay, this is a joke right?&&Just imagine how much weirder that scene would be without the music&&> particularly due to how machiavellian their schemes are.

I think those examples also work because they're portrayed by such talented actors. Though that style does lend to actors like that, since delivery is usually fairly subtle, so I guess they're entwined.&&[deleted]&&You want him to *hit* you with his *stick*?&&One more time please...&&The ultimate edition of BvS ended up being probably my favorite movie of the year. That being said, I am a DC fanboy at heart and the cinematic cut was a mess so your criticism is probably pretty fair at face value.

&&I don't think anything from the late 90s/early 00s aged well. That era was the era where everyone was using CGI, but it wasn't *quite* good enough to actually look good.

I think the cutoff where we really started getting good CGI was the first Iron Man. That looked really good. But that decade or so before that is not going to age well.&&Unfortunately he already has a role in the MCU. But goddamn would he be good, he played an intelligent villain so well in Hannibal.&&And Josh Brolin is Thanos and Cable. Mads as Doom is totally doable.&&Low key, he'd just send in a DOOM bot to play the role while he stayed at home.

*Grammar&&Oh, to begin with for sure. He gets better and better as he goes on and grows as a character, fairly quickly.

But he is never a villain. Maybe he could be considered one when he first forms, but he certainly isn't evil, especially not for long.

Though I would totally be fine with it if Mads was Doom. I could look past the characters having the same actor especialy since his doctor strange character had some sfx around his eyes and stuff. 

&&those arent in the same universe, not yet&&I think that's exactly it. Typically the best Antagonists, are the ones that are interesting. The standard method is by humanizing them. (Sometimes you can go the other way and dehumanize them so much it's interesting, but I think that's less common.)

I don't see why it would be much different when the protagonist is the villain.

**Are there any plans for a sequel?**

Yes, a sequel is expected to be released in late 2018. It is rumored to pick up right where the original left off and the plot will involve the characters continuing their walk around the garden (whether they will complete it has yet to be determined). As of now all of the original actors have expressed interest in reprising their respective roles. The expected runtime is 5 seconds, over twice as long as the original.&&Just looked it up. Filmed up in Roundhay, Leeds. I'm from Leeds, live like 15 minutes away from Roundhay. Pretty neat!&&You can see how hard they're trying to show their movements and make full use of the technology. &&A little bit of CGI would liven up this scene.&&Now we know the first director's first direction: ""everyone just kinda walk around...""&&This is the beginning of a contra dance move! It's more closely related to english country dancing than square dancing, but it's a style still alive and well in Appalachia. It's fascinating to me that the moves have remained relatively unchanged for 130 years!

 You can see and approximation of what the rest of it would look like at about 14:20 in this video https://youtu.be/lNatvaD9YKM though there are of course small variations and flourishes that are common.&&Was not expecting that twist there at the end.&&All of those ppl are now dead&&This link: 
https://mysendoff.com/2011/06/the-roundhay-garden-scene-murders/
describes how 3 people died shortly after this film was made, including the man who created it. This article strongly hints that it may have had something to do with patent wars with Thomas Edison.&&[Please enjoy responsibly.](https://youtu.be/ewmicldxhSE) &&I'm fascinated by that woman's dress. I don't think I've seen anyone move in one like that. For her, I guess it was just clothes. &&The reviews are fantastic:

>Oh my God! It's Attack of the 80's all over again... the 1880's!! This smashing blockbuster was not only the absolute first of its time, it stands well on its own as an epic mystery story. The questions this movie raises are plenty: 

>1) Who is the woman in the funny hat? Why does she turn away from the camera? Is there some dark secret she is desperately trying to hide? 

>2) Why is the man to the left so eager to leave? Afraid that the camera will make evidence of a murder eternal?

>OK, so maybe two questions may not count as plenty in today's plot twist-jaded audience, but still it is quite an amazing feat for a two seconds long film to leave you feeling both dazed and confused, left wanting for more, yet afraid of what horrible truths you might find and wondering if the truth can really live up to your imagination.

>Roundhay Garden Scene is a masterwork, right up there with ""Leeds Bridge"" and ""Train Pulling Into Bombay Station"". Recommended for all ages! 10/10

Or:

>While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I feel Le Prince made a mistake by trying to set this up as a comedy of manners. It would have worked much better as a melodrama. The garden scene, so dear to the Victorians, only re-enforces the drab faux-drollery that passed for humor amongst a certain subset of the time. It's effectively a cinematic variant of the opera comique"" (without the sound, of course) in the sense that it aggressively pursues the goal of glamour over substance, and achieving neither to any great satisfaction. This is especially evident during the denouement because we are operating under the impression that the sequence of events is inconsequential -- a very real danger in comedies of manners. So I can only give it a 9.25 score because the vision was insufficiently realized.

And:

>There is nothing wrong with this very short short film. The reason it's flawless is because it has a runtime of like 2 seconds. Exactly 2 seconds. But hey, at least you won't be bored while you are watching it. This short film rightfully deserves itself a 10/10 for it's quality and because it is one of the first short films/films ever made that helped the movie industry get started. It's definitely worth a watch. 

>If you are busy doing something and you think that you won't have time to watch it, trust me. It will be over before you know it.

A person who was born right after the American revolution, during the French revolution, and during the heyday of Mozart... that person has been captured on film. We have video of a person who possibly had interactions with people alive in the 1600s. That's really incredible.

&&Actually one of the women in the film died only 10 days after this was shot! The director vanished only 2 years later in 1890.&&That is actually very crazy to think about someone born in 1860 or 1870 could live to 1970!!!!! Two completely different worlds&&It had quite the aftermath, actually:

>Only ten days after filming, Sarah Whitley died at the age of 72 and was buried at the nearby St. John’s Church. Two years later, just before patenting his invention, Louis Le Prince, the director of the scene and inventor of the video camera mysteriously vanished in a train between Dijon and Paris. He was supposed to head to the USA for a public viewing of the camera and movies, but of course was unable to make it there. Several theories have been devised as to where he and his luggage ended up, including suicide, as he was on the verge of bankruptcy. Other theories say that his family pressured him to disappear due to his bankruptcy and possible homosexuality. One of the most likely theories is that he was murdered as part of the patent wars that he was in with Thomas Edison.

>Several years later, his brother Adolphe was in New York to testify against Edison in these patent disputes, and was discovered dead while duck hunting. Suicide was presumed, however this very well could have been part of the dispute with Thomas Edison.""

edit: what year is this&&Lindsey is one of the best video essayists.  Also, this may sound inflammatory, but one of my favorite feminists too.  She knows how to put things the exact perfect way that she's not kowtowing to the really toxic people out there, but still doesn't make you feel like a moron or make herself seem like an elitist for not viewing media the Perfect Feminist Approved Way.  Her defense of Twilight as an unfair target by feminists and a bit sexist in itself is a perfect example of this.&&I love Lindsey!!&&I felt bad for the writer.

Things like it pushed off answering the question of how the hell did the universe go from Empire on the descent to Empire has more and better superweapons than it ever had before or the whole hyperramming thing, like why didn't we see that tactic in the Clone Wars? It did do some things right, the lightsaber fights are awesome because they are fast paced and feel like they are trying to kill each other, not have a dance off like the Prequels or some geriatric baton touching like the OT. The lack of diversity is fucking annoying too, humans are boring. Rose's character was annoying and I don't think she served a purpose. I think the casino arc could've been cool if they had emphasized that Fin and Po's fuckery and messed up Holdo's plan and made them look guilty about it, however as is it just felt like they needed something for Finn to do and didn't think that they could make compelling scenes with him waiting out the Empire 2.0. I personally feel that Disney is too reliant on the Empire being incompetent with glass cannon super weapons, like imagine how much more threatening the Empire 2.0 would've been if they were being chased by a few competently commanded Imperial class star destroyers because they weren't a huge threat to the Empire, just a minor threat to be mopped up. How Phasma has been handled is abysmal, she helps destroy the Deathstar 2.0, presumably dies on it, shows up alive with no explanation and then goes down without a fight. I think they are taking the Force side of things in a good direction, I think Disney might be setting up for a rebuttal of the Light=Good Dark=Evil dichotomy that has gone on throughout most of Star Wars and that'll be cool. Kylo's betrayal of Snoke was awesome, but I think that the story of the Empire 2.0 will be incomplete without Snoke's story so I hope they tell it somehow in the next movie. I liked how the didn't make Rey a Skywalker, her being a nobody is much more compelling for me personally. In short there is a lot that falls short of being compelling and not a lot that makes up for it for me.&&There were a lot of things people didn't like about it, including Mark Hamill. People didn't like how Luke hated the Jedi Order, it seemed really unfitting and it wasn't easy to ignore since it was a lot of his arc.

 The casino arc was weird and unfitting, and the whole film's arc of ""running out of fuel"" seemed quite boring. 

There was also the random Rose - Finn kiss that came out of nowhere. 

These are a few of the criticisms people had, overall it was a fun action movie, but people wanted it to be a classic part of the star wars universe, and were let down. &&How long will it take YouTubers to be considered proper actors?&&Maybe then my life will have meaning. &&No you fucking weeb

It sounds a lot like another gaslighting campaign misrepresenting the movement and it wouldn't be the first. When people portray feminism as anything other than civil rights *for everyone*, they're discussing some outlying movement that doesn't speak for the concern of the central movement. &&I love Lucy.&&No one needs to see this.

You could have just left it at ""Chris Farley""&&I would totally watch that movie you just described.&&I already know about it starting as fanfiction. IMO the two are not equally bad. Twilight is badly written fluff for teenage girls who want to indulge in their fantasies. Some of them are extremely textbook: being saved by a cute boy from a gangrape (yes this is real and extremely common), being at the center of a love triangle, eternal youth, being saved, carried, having great importance in some grand scheme, living a life wholly more interesting and eventful than that of your peers. I find that relatively harmless. 

50 shades on the other hand is a disgusting peephole into this (somehow even more) shallow relationship where the two parties are completely incompatible and the bdsm is manipulative and abusive, not at all how it should be done in the real world. I detest these stories not because they’re twilight erotica, but because they’re BAD twilight erotica, and the fact that the author made millions when there is fanfiction and erotica out there that’s fantastically written, makes my stomach turn.&&doh&&Haven't seen that review (since I haven't watched the movie), but I've always been enthusiastic about her.

Kevin Smith in hospital recovering from a heart attack earlier today.,48979,80biy5,https://twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith/status/968038297200091136,2042,1519633469.0,,"Here is the full post he made on instagram . 

> thatkevinsmith I was trying to do a killer standup special this evening but I might’ve gone too far. After the first show, I felt kinda nauseous. I threw up a little but it didn’t seem to help. Then I started sweating buckets and my chest felt heavy. Turns out I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life at the #glendale hospital told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (also known as “the Widow-Maker” because when it goes, you’re a goner). If I hadn’t canceled the second show to go to the hospital, the Doc said I would’ve died tonight. For now, I’m still above ground! But this is what I learned about myself during this crisis: death was always the thing I was most terrified of in life. When the time came, I never imagined I’d ever be able to die with dignity - I assumed I’d die screaming, like my Dad (who lost his life to a massive heart attack). But even as they cut into my groin to slip a stent into the lethal Widow-Maker, I was filled with a sense of calm. I’ve had a great life: loved by parents who raised me to become the individual I am. I’ve had a weird, wonderful career in all sorts of media, amazing friends, the best wife in the world and an incredible daughter who made me a Dad. But as I stared into the infinite, I realized I was relatively content. Yes, I’d miss life as it moved on without me - and I was bummed we weren’t gonna get to make #jayandsilentbobreboot before I shuffled loose the mortal coil. But generally speaking, I was okay with the end, if this was gonna be it. I’ve gotten to do so many cool things and I’ve had so many adventures - how could I be shitty about finally paying the tab. But the good folks at the Glendale hospital had other plans and the expertise to mend me. Total strangers saved my life tonight (as well as my friends @jordanmonsanto & @iamemilydawn, who called the ambulance). This is all a part of my mythology now and I’m sure I’ll be facing some lifestyle changes (maybe it’s time to go Vegan). But the point of this post is to tell you that I faced my greatest fear tonight... and it wasn’t as bad as I’ve always imagined it’d be. I don’t want my life to end but if it ends, I can’t complain. It was such a gift. #KevinSmith

Get well soon /u/ThatKevinSmith&&Jeez. And he'd lost all that weight recently too. Figured he was all good.&&[removed]&&Take a listen to him talk about his Dad on the Joe Rogan Podcast, who died because of a heart attack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEruc61DnE&&Im glad he is ok and recovering. &&Oh no that's horrible! Hope for a smooth recovery for him and his family!!&&I'd be very upset if Kevin passed away. Genuinely love the guy.&&Man, he did his Black Panther review just the other day and seemed totally fine. All energetic and buzzing with enthusiasm, just like always. Scary as hell to think that there was just this time bomb in his chest. I really hope he gets better. He's one of the nicest and most genuine entertainers you will ever meet. I watch his podcast sometimes just to dig on the optimism. It's in somewhat short supply of late. Hope he can get some well deserved rest and recovery.&&It was described as a ""massive heart attack"" I hope he actually recovers well. I am a big fan and want to continue to see his work.&&I had this exact same thing happen in 2009. I was fine up until I started feeling weak and then heart burn, then shortness of breath, then the dreaded ""Impending Sense Of Doom"". I knew EXACTLY what it was the moment my left arm went numb. I immediately called 911 and they had me in an ambulance, on the way to the hospital (10 min away) and gave me nitroglycerin. Mid-sentence I ""coded"" and was shocked back to life 10 times. Learned about burn marks from that. [HERE THEY ARE](https://i.imgur.com/esLt8WS.jpg)

Woke up intubated and confused, but within 12 hours was standing and visiting with family.

Doctors said I had a 99% blockage of my ~~left ventricle~~ LAD (thanks /u/whitebarrywhite). [HERE WAS HIS DRAWING](https://i.imgur.com/ZVT4I6Q.jpg). Widow Maker is a bitch.

&&I am a nurse who works in a (not THE) cardiac cath lab. I see this kind of stuff all the time... and it can happen to ANYONE.

You smoke? STOP - It is easily one of the worst things for your arteries. They state ""lung cancer""  is the end all from it. FALSE. You will have heart disease.

Diabetic? Get that shit under control. When we take a look at your arteries we can tell how poorly your A1C has been controlled.

Mom, dad, grandma and grandpa have a heart attack or have had CABG? You better go to the doctor even if you are in the best shape in the world. Family history is the card that will haunt you forever.

Have high blood pressure and do not feel like taking your medications? Well do, because surprise, we are able to tell by how your arteries look as well.

There are many other comorbities that you can google, but smoking, diabetes, and taking your medications are something that YOU can control now.
&&I read this in the middle of the night after my kid woke me up and it hit me in two ways:

1. He's such a positive ball of energy every time I see him that I realized if I woke up tomorrow and read that he had passed, it would have hit me as hard as Robin Williams. I'm not ready to live in a world without Kev Smith.

2. I couldnt help but think how his wife and daughter would have been devastated, especially Harley. Say what you want about Kevin and his movies, but he's a damn good Dad.

Makes me want to take a hard look at my own health, for my kid's sake.

Get well soon, Kev.&&Wow, he's actually a pretty handsome guy. Haven't seen a photo of him a while, he's looking really great. Happy that he avoided disaster here.&&Get well soon /u/ThatKevinSmith
&&As one could guess from my Username, he is my favorite wrtier/director.  I hope him all the best and a recovery so fast even Barry Allen would be jealous. &&As a nurse, all I could think of is

Even if he has lost a lot of weight (and good on him too!) goes to show it has longer-term effects on your health. I hope he has a speedy recovery and not too much left ventricular damage after the big infarct.&&Jeez, a lot of times these cases don't even make it to the hospital. Kevin is beyond lucky, hopefully his recovery goes well&&I'm so glad he's ok. Kevin's podcasts with all of his humour, optimism and enthusiasm for life have got me through some pretty rough times over the years. He comes across as one of the most genuinely lovely and humble guys and he's got so much left to contribute to the entertainment industry. Best wishes for a speedy recovery Kev! &&The wife and I were at that second show when the stage crew came out to say that it was cancelled.  At the time they weren't sure if it was some kind of food poisoning or what but that it was definitely an ambulance call.  We heard it pull up as we left the theater.  The audience wanted to let /u/ThatKevinSmith know that no one was remotely upset that the performance got cancelled and simply wanted to send nothing but well wishes his way.  We all sincerely hope for a speedy recovery!&&I'm in the hospital right now! I thought I was a dead man Friday night. Lost a ton of blood, and I truly thought I wasn't going to make it, and I dunno I wasn't scared I just accepted the inevitable. 

Told my my wife and son as I was carried out of my house I loved them and that everything was going to be ok.

I'm 37 and apparently I now have diverticulosis. 
&&Was listening to the newest Hollywood Babble On and saw this on Twitter. Clerks was a big movie in my early years and I have enjoyed a lot of his stuff over the years. 

I told my wife the other day how much I'm personally looking forward to Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. 

I hope he has a successful recovery cause the man has been a big part of my life. Just seems like a good grateful guy. Really loves his fans. &&Fucking hell. I'm glad he's ok. Get well soon.&&This guy is my icon. Beyond happy that he was able to make it to the hospital. &&Kevin may not be the greatest filmmaker, by his own admission. But he is very inspirational to me and such a steady stream of optimism. He seems like a great guy and I'm very happy he made it through this okay. Gonna go watch Red State now to celebrate his recovery. &&If you haven't already.

Give one of his various podcasts a whirl. he's one of my favorite human beings, and his unwavering positivity is infectious.&&Kevin Smith also lost a bunch of weight, sucks to think even if you are trying to do the right thing, life can still fuck you up at any time. &&[deleted]&&:(&&Heart disease, the silent (Bob) killer. Get well soon broseph!&&Road to recovery podcast in 3...2...&&Hoping for a speedy recovery&&Hope he stays with us a long time. Kevin Smith is a solid dude. I'd have been really shocked and depressed to hear he kicked the bucket so suddenly.&&It's crazy aye. He ain't done living just yet though. So glad he made it out alive. I hope he really takes the time to recover and set things at his own pace.

No way will I speculate how or why but the dude is a workhorse. I just hope he makes a full recovery.&&The guy genuinely has made me laugh on SModcast I have lost count. Hope the guy recovers and bounces back stronger than ever.&&I love Kevin and I hope he gets better fast.   But everyone (and I’m including myself) we need to stop waiting for a “wake-up call” to get healthy.  We know what we could be doing better.  Do it today.  &&This is definitely one of the ones that would hit me like a brick wall. People rag on his career path over the last 15 years or so (especially around these parts) but his movies always felt so relateable. He waved his nerd flag proudly since the beginning. Needless to say, I am extremely happy he is okay.&&I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Smith's work, but he is the living breathing example that total dweebs can really make something of themselves. Like, he literally named his daughter Harley Quinn after the batman character. I'm glad he survived, and felt a sense of wholesome lessons gained from his experience. Hope he has good luck with is recovery, and adapts well with how his life will have to change after this.&&For those wondering, above 98% blockage has <1% survival rate. &&Man, anyone who's read his book knows that his dad died of a heart attack. I bet this has been a serious eye-opener for him. Glad he's still with us.&&I hope someone spray paints 'i assure we are open' on his chest when he's having open heart surgery. &&Protip: swap to Controversial if you want to know which shitty people you can safely ignore going forward. &&TIL Stan Lee almost outlived Kevin Smith.&&https://imgur.com/a/QdOkG&&HE WAS SAVED BY DOCTOR WHO?!?!?!&&My dad survived the Widow-Maker too!  He was in pretty bad shape for almost 2 full years though, then he got a heart transplant.&&Wow, a speedy recovery for Kevin! For insight into the widowmaker, check out ""The Widowmaker"" documentary. It's an eye opener. Also sometimes it doesn't matter how healthy you are, Bob Harper, trainer from The Biggest Loser, had the same type of heart attack.&&Heart attacks are something i never really understood the severity of. My dad suffered a minor heart attack and was admitted to hospital on Friday. Its so scary. Hard to wrap my head around the fact that had he not visited the doctor because of a lingering chest pain he might not be still here.

Don't take chest pain, night sweats or nausea for granted. Take care of yourself and look out for others.
I'm happy to say he's doing just fine, and its good to hear Smith is getting the treatment he needs. Not everyone can be as lucky. 

A huge thanks has to go to the medical staff who work tirelessly to keep the people we love here with us just that bit longer.

Here's to a speedy recovery.&&I'm not a big fan of his movies, but I am a big fan of Kevin Smith the person. It's a reminder for me to start taking better care of my own health. &&PA Student here. Literally JUST did my autopsy rotation and we had a body where the COD was occlusion of the LAD/""Widow Maker"". Medical Examiner told us the guy was only 80% occluded and it was enough to take his life. This is no joke and if he's serious about it being 100% occluded, we're all really lucky we didn't lose our beloved Comic Book Man. All good vibes out to Kevin Smith and his family!&&#SaveSilentBob&&I am just extremely not prepared for Kevin Smith to die. A lot of other people could kick the bucket and I would be sad, but Kevin Smith is probably one of the very few I would sob over. His podcasts and his network of podcasts (Tell 'em Steve Dave especially) have literally been some of the only things to make me laugh in absolutely rough and dark times and I'm just not prepared to have a world without his spirit.

Also Jersey Girl is great and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.&&Kevin is genuinely the one hero I've had in life. Truly an amazing human being. &&It was mentioned earlier, but I wanted to reiterate what an awesome friend Kevin Smith is.

If you haven't read *My Boring-Ass Life* read the chapter on Jason Mewes. He has also remained close with his high school buds, putting them in films, producing films for them, putting them in business. I guess during the filming of Mallrats, the studio people were giving him shit for having Walt and Bryan in the movie. He just shrugged it off and said, ""They're in the movie. That's it."" That always stuck with me.

He's a wonderful person and I wish him a speedy recovery. &&Isn’t this Silent Bob!?&&It's official. Kevin Smith can't take a picture without making big bug eyes.&&Let that be a lesson, guys. A lot of guys tough it out on whatever it is, refusing to go to the doctor.  I once knew a guy who wasn't feeling the best, so HE TOOK A BUS to the hospital.  He died of the massive heart attack he was having before he ever got there.&&This is more chilling when you remember the talk he gave about his dad having a massive heart attack and dying in great pain. 

I'm glad he decided to go to the hospital right away. He also looks like he's lost a lot of weight, gauging by that picture he posted. &&Is that the guy from the comic book show?&&My father has 7 stents, I'm still at 0, fortunately. I hope he gets well and lose some weight. Dead serious here.&&Glad he's ok. Good thing he lost all the weight a year or so ago, otherwise I feel like this would have been a different outcome. &&Honestly one of the nicest people in Hollywood that just enjoys film and TV. The guy has Firefly levels of cult following and can talk on any film related subject for hours (the guy has a 50 min piece on writing the script for the Superman Lives film with the greatest punchline I've ever seen). During the Harvey Weinstein scandal he pledged to donate all future royalties from his Miramax films to charity (that focus solely on women in cinema).

Wishing him all future health and get Jay and Silent Bob Reboot off the ground&&I often get told I look like Kevin Smith. I really need to lose some weight. I don't have a family history of heart attacks so that's good but I don't want to be the one that starts that history either.&&I saw his tweet this morninng and my heart skipped a beat. I just bought tickets to see him next month and thought it's gotta be my fault.  

Kevin is one of the good guys in the industry.  Down to earth, honest and a genuinely nice guy.

Hope he recovers fully and stays around for many years to come.&&Thankfully he went to the hospital and had great doctors to save his life. Good luck to him on his lifestyle changes, I hope he can stick with it and get healthy. I can somewhat relate to the near death experience. I had a brain aneurysm rupture and remember the absolute sense of calm I felt and there wasn't any fear of dying or what came after. Not to be corny, but after my experience I no longer doubt that there is a higher power or an afterlife.&&Yeah I really wasnt ready for Kevin Smith to die,  so I have been feeling super weird since I woke up and saw this.&&I'm very relieved he's okay, but every time I see his face I just see Silent Bob. In my head, he doesn't even have a voice outside of those movies even if I've seen him speak. &&I just got dumped by my summer love when I went to see chasing amy to clear my head. That movie really touch me at that time...and made me a Kevin Smith fan. So glad he is still with us and thanks for all the  flicks that made me laugh :)&&I put in a good comment, wishing him a good recovery, and then a bunch of people started downvoting me! Why? Why are people so freaking mean?!&&He cut out all sugar years ago and has lost a bunch of weight. I'd be so pissed if I were him. He could've been eating ice cream this whole time!

I'm glad he's okay though. I had no idea that nausea and sweating were symptoms of a heart attack. If he was home, he probably would've just assumed he had the flu and tried to sleep it off.&&The universe spared him so he could see Avengers: Infinity War.&&Any one ready to start shedding the pounds is welcome to check out /r/loseit.&&Dear Kevin

I am writing to you to let you know that I am not ready to receive you yet because, you dumb ass you have not finished telling your story, you still have work to do, the world still needs your humour and your humanity. So sorry buddy see you when I see you.

Regards

God.

PS. I haven't forgotten about Dogma, but we'll cross that bridge at a later stage.&&I have differing opinions on his later films and what he has become but I still reguarly listen, read & watch Kevin Smith's shit and consider him one of my personal icons who I will never sat a truly bad word about.

The fact that I almost had to write RIP Kevin Smith is a terrifying and truly disturbing thought.&&Hope he gets well soon&&Kev, my man.

Get better, feel better and don’t forget that we all love you.

We are all so glad that you found this when you did!&&Did they stent? &&r/nononoyes&&Fuck man, I always thought Jay would be the first one to go! (Edit: JK)&&Kevin Smith dies now and I give up.  I'm getting pretty much all of my motivation from him and Patton Oswalt right now.&&Man, I am really glad he made it through this. I love Kevin Smith's movies, especially Clerks and Dogma. His movies were a big part of my teenage years.

In my adult life, I feel like I almost know the guy. I listen to many of his podcasts, in particular Hollywood Babylon and Fatman on Batman. He talks very openly about his life (almost too openly. I know more things than I should about his asshole, for instance.)  He comes across as this kind person who genuinely loves movies, comic books, and all this geeky stuff that I love. He is truly appreciative that he gets work in all this great stuff that he is a fan of. 

I hope he gets well soon and keeps making what he makes because I am a big fan.&&Ya know, I've never really been a fan of any Kevin Smith movies that I've seen. Actually, I've flat out disliked them. 

That said, he seems like one of the nicest, most thoughtful and generally humble dudes I've seen, and I love listening to interviews with him and so forth. For someone who's work I generally don't like, I'd actually still call myself a Kevin Smith fan to an extent. Kevin Smith the person. &&Now he's lost the weight I can't help but think he looks a little bit like a budget robert downey jr&&The good news is that because it was caught, his chances of heart attack going forward are virtually nil because the appropriate measures will be taken and he will be monitored indefinitely.&&He has always seemed like a cool dude, I hope he does well on his road to recovery.&&Get well, Fat Kev. &&All the best to Kev Smith!!!

&&man, that would suck if he passed away. I've never been a giant fan of his movies, save for Dogma and Chasing Amy, which are brilliant for their own reasons, but i've recently discovered his movie reviews a la FatmanonBatman and his opinions are truthful, honest, and full of excitment (for the good and bad parts of the movie). 

Hes definitely a dude that you can have a beer with and have a good deep conversation with with no BS&&Damn, what a shame.&&I heard about this on my midnight shift a few hours ago. I'm a huge Kevin Smith fan.  Only saw part of his quote and his picture on twitter.  Reading his whole quote has me almost in tears.
Had the privilege of meeting him last summer and got my picture taken with him.  What an incredible guy.  I went to shake his hand and he gave me a hug instead and said bring it in here.  All the best Kevin, I hope you pull through this with flying colours.  I was scared for you man. &&This hit me hard. Kevin Smith has been a big influence in my movie-loving life and I appreciate how he forged his own way and built his own brand by lots of hard work.&&God damn! Dogma was the reason I went to film school!

Get better Kev&&My father had a 90% blockage in the same place back in 2011. He had a triple bypass at 58. It's a really scary thing, and I'm glad Kevin got treated and survived to tell the tale. &&Get well soon Kev&&Get well Kev. &&Kevin I hope you the best and I'm glad they saved you. If you died before clerks 3/jay and silent bob reboot was done I'd have to go down to hell myself to bring you back to finish it. Best wishes.&&He has the same face on in every. single. picture.

I’m convinced he’ll have that same look on his face even at his own funeral&&We don't need another comic to die young. Kevin Smith is probably the nicest person I'll ever meet and the world would be a lesser place without him, it's bad enough that we have to make do without Ralphie May who died of a heart condition a few months ago.&&I believe the following hospital bill will kill him for sure.&&ITT people giving advice like they are doctors

See your own doctor. Don't listen to randos on the internet. &&I’m very fond of Kevin Smith, I’m so glad he’s ok and not at all surprised he had something incredible to say about the experience. &&Holy shit, I love KS. I hope he gets better and stays that way!&&That's frightening. Kevin Smith is one of the guys that inspired me to get into film school. &&ATTN: JEFF ANDERSON

please agree to be randall one last time. He is arguable my favorite character in any movie ever. You are the only one that can do it. If Kevin dies we won't have his glorious writing any more. Please, your fans request it.

I may someday meet Jason lee, and because of you 2, I will happily call him picklefucker.&&Survive you independent contracting nerf herder.&&If he was still 300+ pounds there's no way he would have survived. 
&&skinny kevin smith incoming&&Holy shit. That’s the worst possible kind. He’s severely lucky to be alive.&&I hope he recovers soon.  ♡&&As upsetting as this is, it's clear from the many Reddit threads that people love Kevin Smith. As someone who loves Kevin Smith, this makes me happy.&&I know this will most likely get buried, but Kevin, if you're reading this, please don't die!

Meeting you is on my bucket list.&&And on the plus side; we'll get a cracking good podcast out of this! &&And he still makes that fucking face&&If you live most your life unhealthy then it will take its toll on your body no matter how much weight you lose at a later age. Cut down on processed meats, sugars, alcohol, smoking etc.&&Why does he have such a cult status? 

I am really not trying to be mean, I'm just genuinely curious.
I've seen most of his older movies (pre Cop-out), and some of them are great. But in the end not that special **IMO**.

Clerks is fucking great tho.

Hope he gets well!&&Man he's gonna die with that stupid fucking look on his face. &&From what I have heard of Kevin Smith, he seems like a good guy.  I wish him well.  It does feel weird though, to upvote a post about him having a heart attack.  I will think about it as upvoting a post about him surviving a heart attack.&&So many doctors and nutritionist in comments today &&One of the most interesting guy ever in any convention.  Just wish he'll pay more attention to his weight, I swear.. every time I see him in a new 'special' - he looks like he's gained another 50KG.

I am actually surprise it's taken this long for him to have a heart attack - really glad he is ok though..

If you have not done so, listen to his youtube talk on when he was commissioned to write the script for Superman - HILARIOUS!&&Hope he can make those sequels now.&&Here's hoping for a speedy recovery...&&Thank fuck that you're still alive, mister Kevin Smith. &&He seems like a wound up guy. In a good way. But I've heard him on radio interviews where he talks uninterrupted for 10 minutes straight.&&Man, that headline almost gave ME a heartattack...  
I know Kevin Smith is too good for this world but it's also way too soon to lose him like that!&&Hoping for a great recovery!&&get better you tubby bitch&&Can lack of sleep cause you a heart attack? I'm scared&&Shit that's crazy. He's not one of those guys I really thought of as having to worry about passing away soon, but this just goes to show it can be pretty much anybody.&&love your movies K-Smith, stay strong! &&He looks like a dude that got woke,,&&Glad he's still alive and hope he can do something to reduce the re-occurrence of any future problems. Dude always seems like a good guy.&&Wow. That's actually a really beautiful sentiment.&&This is the guy who officiated my wedding. 

He had inspired me in so many ways to go above and beyond being just another retail jockey.

He made me want to become a film maker when I was in high school, and has never downed any dream. 

After meeting him the first time, I immediately went home and started a podcast because he told me to do it. That soon shifted to a youtube/twitch show that I loved doing, even if no one watched. I also joined some other friends in making a band, and took up painting as a hobby as well, because in Kevin's words you only get one life so why not spend it trying to accomplish everything you ever wanted?

I ended up doing more in the past 10 years because of this man's words than I had ever done at the behest of my teachers or family.

He has been nothing but positive to his fans, always telling them to go out and do the things they want to do that will bring them joy.

The guys was so upset about the Weinstein stuff that he pledged to give his own residuals from those movies away because he felt it was dirty money, even though he had nothing to do with those things himself.

He is a loving husband, an amazing father, and the truest friend anyone could ever ask for. He stood by Jason on his road to recovery, paying for everything along the way.

He is the only celebrity I've ever met who is who he is, and now I'm laying here in bed, in tears that someone I barely know, yet somehow also know very well, may leave this world before his time.

You may be at peace with paying the tab Kev, but it ain't fuckin closing time yet.&&Holy shit that hits me close to home. At 29 I had a 100% blockage of my LAD and almost died. I had to be defibulated 8 times, one of which I was awake for. That description of the nausea and the sweating just hit me with a flashback. I remember it felt like a fist was trying to force its way up my esophagus. After a heart attack (and this is true, look it up) you become ultra emotional. I would just cry for no perceived reason. I remember them going in my groin with the stent. I’m so glad Kevin is ok. He’s a good dude. &&I can't imagine the day when I'll have to face my own mortality.&&> After the first show, I felt kinda nauseous. I threw up a little but it didn’t seem to help. Then I started sweating buckets and my chest felt heavy. 

The scariest part of heart attacks to me is that sometimes the symptoms aren't the ""chest grabbing, massive pain"" that are normally portrayed. I always expected that you'd know that you were having a heart attack, but half the time it's described so mildly that it sounds like the flu. I mean, I had most of those last night (woke up at 3AM, heart racing, mildly nauseous, a little short of breath) and I'm pretty sure that was just whatever I ate for dinner or a nightmare or something along those lines. &&Good grief, this man has his head screwed on.

I'm a fan of the bloke, but never been a super fan or anything.  But this is some impressive perspective.

Hope he gets well soon.&&What an interesting post, specially as he's Catholic. 

I for one wish dude well. He honestly seems like a good guy.&&As someone who has had a near death experience, it's haunting how uniform the experience is.

It's first concerning, then terrifying, then it's all ok. Not your preference, but it's ok. If you're not a sociopath, you mostly just think about how sad other people will be when you die, but even that's ok. Everyone goes at some point, and you quickly get used to the idea that this is how you go. It stops being scary. It just is.&&Say what you will about the man, dude has a way with words.&&He has a great attitude, that's for sure.  Hopefully, he can get on a healthy path now.  Seems like a really cool guy.&&Would going vegan really help with his recovery?&&I can recommend the going vegan!&&>But the good folks at the Glendale hospital had other plans and the expertise to mend me.

Thank you, Kevin, for not saying ""God had other plans.""&&What the hell, I like Kevin Smith now. &&Wow, this guy should write something!&&Not going to lie, I read that entirely in Kevin's accent. His speech pattern makes it into his writing&&A couple of facts on heart disease:

**1)** [Heart disease is the #1 cause of death in western civilization](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index2.html).  This often gets said, but consider the implications here.  Most people you know, among all the (non-natural) causes of possible death, are most likely to ultimately succumb to heart disease.  I only point this out to emphasize the seriousness and pervasiveness of the disease, and to encourage people to make lifestyle changes accordingly.

**2)** Heart disease is a *lifetime* disease, and likely begins *in utero*, i.e. in your mother's womb, due to her potentially poor lifestyle and eating habits.  [Anatomic changes in the heart due to heart disease are significant enough to commonly show up when children are only ~5-8 years old](https://www.clersite.org/bogalusaheartstudy/).  The idea here being that heart disease isn't something that only happens once you're already older and out of shape, it's something that was already happening through, quite literally, your entire lifespan, even before you were born.

Kevin Smith might well have lost a bunch of weight, but that doesn't erase the decades of damage he may have done to himself prior.  In the same way that quitting smoking after 30 years doesn't mean you won't get lung cancer.

**Edit**: just for a quick disclaimer because I don't want to be misunderstood, it's **obviously good** that Kevin Smith lost a bunch of weight through what I'm assuming are healthy lifestyle changes.  I'm just pointing out that doing so isn't a guarantee for perfect health, or make him heart attack proof.  We can't go back in time, so the next best thing is to alter our course towards a healthier lifestyle as soon as possible.  That is *always* the right decision, no matter how long you've had these unhealthy habits.&&that's the shitty thing about your arteries and stuff like cholesterol, once the damage is done it's done, you can lose weight but the plaque stays put, has to be fixed with futhur intervention, medications or diet modifications&&Damage to his heart was already done.&&Sadly it's during times of change for ones body that people are most vulnerable to heart attacks. Any change is stressful to the body. Either way glad to hear he seems to be recovering. &&Look up Jim Fixx.&&Id start by talking to your doctor - about any potential symptoms you might have or might have experienced, any other diseases, your family history, diet, etc. Basic physical exam, blood pressure, etc.




Then get blood tests for total amount of cholesterol in your system, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerols. That would be the bare minimum to know if cholesterol itself should be of any concern to you at all. Then you can add and combine it with related Lipoproteins for better accuracy.




Mineral and vitamin levels should be evaluated as well. From minerals mainly calcium, total and active, that can be as harmful as cholesterol and similarly build up in various places. Then potassium to see if your heart has enough fuel, along with magnesium to support it, which could contribute to other issues. Sodium is important too. As for vitamins, B12 is good to know with various levels of iron for oxygen and you can throw in vitamin D also that works in tandem with the aforementioned calcium - and isnt just for bones.




After this you should have a relatively good, although still fairly basic, idea how you're doing.




If you want to go all out with the blood tests, get some inflammation and heart markers done too. CRP is a start for general inflammation, higher levels (for example during illness) increase risk slightly, with hsCRP being more sensitive to heart itself. But a lot more useful and specific would be getting BNP levels as it shows basically how much the muscle is damaged. It also costs more though just like Troponin. 




Knowing how your kidneys are doing, which affect the heart too, would be ideal for a complete image. For that get creatinine, urea and acid levels, theres also a thing called Cystatin C which is like a crystal ball, and urine analysis with ultrasound. If your kidneys are fine then less stuff to potentially worry about.




Then visit a cardiologist. Get a EKG and heart ultrasound. Thats what they usually start with and its usually enough to know with certain certainty if youre ok. Modern ultrasound is pretty smart. If they find something peculiar theyll go from there. Theres a stress test EKG, internal ultrasound and other less comfortable stuff like going inside the heart/arteries directly (through hand or groin) to get be 100% sure and potentially correct any damage. Chest X-ray, which is basic, will show you if your heart is enlarged and how your lungs are looking. Should your blood levels be off you might also go for a CT scan targeting that area for calcium and other stuff. Theres even MRI.




If you get all of the above actually done and nothing is found then its quite unlikely for you to die from a heart attack anytime soon. Of course you never know and a lot of stress on its own can over time be deadly for anyone, but you should at least sleep better at night knowing that the tests havent found anything troubling. Having good results wont magically save you, you should try to live in a healthy manner regardless, but are a good start.&&[deleted]&&talk to your primary care physician about risk factors. for example, your age, gender, BMI, history of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol. You can find a doctor that can risk stratify you using the ascvd algorithm. (current internal medicine intern)&&A heart cath. That's what he is talking about in his post. They put a catheter in either through your groin or wrist and inject dye. The dye will make the arteries going to your heart light up (or not) and that's how they determine if you have a blockage. If it isn't 100% blocked they can put a stent in. If it is they most likely have to do a bypass. For your carotid arteries in your neck you can have am ultrasound and they can clean those out if they aren't 100% blocked. &&Being overweight, however, is one of the worst things you can do to your body. It takes years to recover from it, I think in terms of heart and blood vessel damage it takes 5-10 years to get back to whatever your body's ""normal"" would be.&&Obviously your health is most important, but keep in mind that any heart related tests will probably cause your life insurance rates to skyrocket if you have any. &&My dad just recently had to have a bypass done. The guy runs a lot, works out, eats only the healthiest food. While he was recovering his sister who kept more of the family records came forward and mentioned his grandfather and his father both died suddenly from heart attacks.

I'm fucked.&&This was the first thing I thought about. Absolutely horrible. Gives me shivers.&&I know, dude's only 47.&&It sucks when you listen to someone weekly on like a podcast or something and then they die.

That's the fucking crazy thing about death though, one minute you're fine and the next you aren't.

My mom has an elderly friend whose sister died during a 15 minute car ride between a restaurant and their home. Just sitting in the passenger seat after a nice meal and then just passed. &&Just watched that yesterday, dude had me on the edge of my seat when he did that shaving segment. 

I hope he gets well soon, I need him to keep reminding Bernadin -during their podcast- to ""Lift that fucken mic up"" so we can hear him lol.&&That's one of the worst things about two of our most common causes of death, heart attack and stroke... they often have zero warning signs because you can operate normally on a 99% blockage, but it's 100% where the heart simply fails and you go into cardiac arrest or have a stroke. It's the lucky few who get symptoms far enough in advance that avoid sudden death or incapacitation.&&[deleted]&&This is a really neat story BUT WHY DO YOU YELL WHEN YOU LINK PICTURES&&As an added note-- I had a second chance, so I have lived my life doing everything I wanted to do.

I am blessed. I still have more I want to do, too.&&I have this incredibly surreal and trippy opposite experience. I had felt off for a year or so, gradually becoming less fit and thinking ""huh.. age"". I began an aggressive cardio regime to get in shape and was seeing benefits but still had chest pain on activity. I eventually pushed and pushed with my doctor, failed a stress test, failed a CT Angio and had an Angio done. Every. Step. Of. The. Way, I was told that I was too young (36), that there is nothing to worry about, that the risk of the test was more than the benefit until I came out of the drug haze from the Angiogram and the Surgeon said 99% blockage of the LAD. Apparently I should have died at any moment multiple times over the past year, but I had some bizarre mini-artery operating as a bypass. No one knows how it got there, why it was there (birth defect apparently), but it was why I would feel shitty, but not have a heart attack on activity, because this little guy could support some of the load. The Cardiologist on call that day argued with me that I had a heart attack using all my documentation to the point where they looked at security footage of me walking in (and thankfully out) of the hospital just to confirm that I didn't arrive by ambulance. I feel lucky, but it is like living in the plot of Final Destination sometimes as people repeatedly tell me how 99% LAD blockage means I very likely should not be here, and it's so difficult/bizarre to go through a ""life-changing"" experience but with nothing life-changing (I showed up at 10am, out by 4pm, walking both ways). It's like being the only survivor of a plane crash but having missed the entire thing because you fell asleep. &&I quit smoking around Christmas after 14 or 15 years and last time I went to the doctor my blood pressure was normal for the first time since I was a kid.

Out of curiosity, let's say someone is obese, has a partial artery blockage, and then fixes their diet and gets in shape. Will that blockage go away with time, or will they forever be at elevated risk? Asking because I've also lost a ton of weight over the past few years.&&Good point about the smoking. 

He lost a ton of weight but he still smokes a shit ton of weed.  Kev needs to knock it off and stay on that road of healthy living. &&For some reason I read this as “Get well soon, you” and it adds a sassy edge to the well wishes&&Yep. Me too. 

I'm about as healthy as Kevin Smith but 17 years his junior so I'm hoping I can stop my artery blockage before I fuck myself. 

This one scared me. I'm starting today. No more fucking excuses. &&I'm so sorry to heart that, but really glad you got treated. Do you have risk factors though? Seems like the blockage at your age was quite extensive for your age. &&A friend of mine, fit and non-smoker/drinker felt poor and tests showed he had 90% blockages. He's stented as well.  Don't make assumptions on your health.&&My dad had one of these heart attacks and survived. It was really bizarre because he is an athlete (road cyclist), eats super healthy and has never been overweight in his life. It turns out our family just has hereditary high cholesterol. The only reason he is still here today is because he actually had the heart attack while he was riding his bike and just passed out suddenly on the road. 

Because he is so fit the doctor initially thought it was from dehydration but luckily he had a hunch that something else was wrong and sent him in for additional tests, where they found a 95% blockage of his LAD artery. He had a stent put in, got on statins and is back to 100% healthy. Unfortunately, being thin and healthy doesn't make you totally immune to these heart attacks, get your cholesterol levels checked every once and a while, folks!&&Unfortunately, 100% LAD stenosis is definitely going to have some ventricular damage. Even with just a small infarct region, cardiac function can be hit relatively hard, though the smaller the region, the better. Hopefully, this doesn't result in further complications down the line.&&in a row?!
(couldn't help but make the clerks reference)&&Glad you pulled through!&&Not-so Fatman on Batman, coming soon (hopefully).&&His kid wrote a film he wound up making, didn’t she?&&Damn, this dude is a luck repository.&&Stan Lee will outlive all of us &&Man, than's good! Nailed the expression.&&Hmm, I guess you'll have to ask him if he saw anyone brandishing a Sonic screwdriver while he was there.&&Gary Shandling, same thing--delayed going to the doctor, dead the next day&&He lost a lot of weight after cutting out sugar about 3 years ago and has been relatively slim since. I know he hasn't historically had the healthiest of lifestyles but, given his recent changes, I was even more shocked that he's had a heart attack.&&He's a director, but yeah those are his friends.&&Perhaps that's why he was able to survive through that. &&Yes he posted about getting a stent in his left coronary artery (widow maker) they went through his femoral artery&&SAG insurance is pretty decent from what I hear.&&Aside from his movies, it's his personality.

He does a good job of telling really interesting stories and letting us in to the life of an independent director. In his podcasts he's usually quite open about himself. It just makes him incredibly likable.&&He gets a lot of cred from GenX for Clerks and to a lesser extent Chasing Amy. He came from nowhere New Jersey and struck it big in Hollywood outside the studio system. I think those are the biggest reasons for his cult status. He's not a groundbreaking film maker in any way but he did it his way and he's an excellent raconteur.&&It won't cause it but it can feed inflammation which feeds heart attacks. Get your nightly sleep!&&*I’ve gotten to do so many cool things and I’ve had so many adventures - how could I be shitty about finally paying the tab.*

I hope to be able to say that one day&&I thought so too. It's a good way to look at life and the end.  

Glad he's ok!&&He's a great writer.&&Been there, done that, got the scars.  It's strange that in rehab after mine (6 stents to open the blockage) so many of the people I met said the same thing.  Once you realize you are about to die you get calm, I was telling my wife about life insurance and other financial details for her and the kids as I was having the heart attack waiting for the ambulance, all I could think about was her and the kids and how they would be okay because of insurance.

Give him a few days and he will start thinking about himself and getting well and how it is going to impact his life, we all seemed to go through the same thing, one of the biggest problems after a heart attack is depression.&&I say get well soon to most sick people &&> This is the guy who officiated my wedding.

That's a story I want to hear. &&I know who you are!&&> You may be at peace with paying the tab Kev, but it ain't fuckin closing time yet.

Well put!&&""Nausea. Fist in esphagus."" Fuck. Guess I add heart attack to the list of things I would ignore thinking it's just normal gerd/crohn's shit.&&Why was your lad 100% occluded at 29? That is not normal at all. Lipid gene defects or something? &&Damn dude. Was it a lifestyle thing that caused that?&&""The only thing you really have to do in life is die.""&&That's why I really hope I die from a meteor crashing into my house while I'm sleeping at night. I'll have no idea, and it's a badass way to go that will make worldwide headlines for 10 minutes.&&Shortness of breath could be a thing. Can be related to a lot of benign things but it definitely isn't normal to have it randomly in the night. If you haven't been to the doc in a while maybe a good idea to get checked and get some blood work done. Some people have minor heart attacks for a while and it goes undiagnosed until they have the big one.&&Sounds like a panic attack. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling very nauseated, heart racing, shaking, out of breath, flop sweat, impending doom. It eventually faded after 15 minutes or so. Went to the doctor later that day, positive I had some sort of heart thing, because how can someone have a panic attack when they're asleep? My doctor assured me it's not only possible but pretty common. Panic attacks and heart attacks share so many of the same symptoms.&&When my uncle had a heard attack he didn't know it until almost 8 hours later at my sister's wedding. His jaw was aching and he started feeling weak. Ambulance showed up and ran some tests and found out he had a significant heart attack earlier in the day. He ended up needing a double bypass. &&Didn't he lose like 85 Pounds, or did he gain it back?  not as fat as he used to be. &&As someone who has battled depression (still do, but I used to too), I've always assumed that when I died, I'd be thinking about all of the people who I let down, all the people who would pity me, and people who would've been better off had I not been born. It's nice to think that this won't be the case.&&Note to self: become sociopath.&&The hastags still makes me cringe a little. Not sure if i'll ever get over those things. Maybe i'm getting old.&&[deleted]&&Whether or not it helps with his recovery itself is one question, but plant-based foods don’t contain cholesterol, and they are beneficial from a point of cardiovascular health. It doesn’t mean it’s automatic, but it’s a great starting point. &&Regardless of whether vegan or vegetarian is some great benificial change, people who go that route pay closer attention to their diet. That by itself likely makes a difference. &&Well it's been proven in clinical studies that it can actually [reverse heart disease](https://www.mdedge.com/jfponline/article/83345/cardiology/way-reverse-cad). That was done on a whole plant foods only diet though so no oils or anything like that. 

That's not to say it will definitely work for him but if I were in his position I'd be looking at every option I have to make sure this doesn't happen again.&&Yes, the reports are in on both accounts, meat raises your risk of heart attack and a vegan diet is preventative.  &&a healthy vegan diet can completely reverse atherosclerotic plaques&&Check out Dr esselstyn's work. A healthy vegan diet can -- literally -- make you heart attack proof. In one study he took all post-heart-attack people who were on death's door and I think they lived an average of a decade longer and never had any more heart pain or heart attacks except for the one guy who quit and went back to ""normal"" food. &&Prior to my cardiac incident I was eating red meat 3x a day.  After I switched my diet to mostly chicken/turkey and red meat only once a couple of days.  My doctor said my cholesterol levels dropped from ""dangerous"" to ""safe"" in the span of just a few months.

As others have said studies have shown a vegan diet does help quite a bit, but don't let the idea of such a radical change scare you off from doing anything to help, just a few simple changes can make a huge difference.&&Increased vegetable and fiber intake is always good for reducing LDL cholesterol. No meat also means less saturated fat. Meat isn't inherently bad, especially if you choose lean cuts most of the time, but most westerners eat a very large amount of it. A lot more than what their bodies really need.

For example, a 180 lb. person needs about 65 grams of protein a day if you use a basic formula. Two standard servings (about 3 oz) of lean meat a day, a little low fat dairy, and a serving of beans or nuts here and there, will get you that amount pretty easily over the course of a day.&&I hope he also starts exercising. But yeah, he needs some time off from meat and shit. &&It's hard not to like Kevin Smith, the person.  Easy to dislike his work, but if you watch any of his interviews or listen to his podcast, the guy is nothing if not genuine.  We're talking about a dude that tears up when talking about how much he loves his daughter and just life in general.  It's all the more impressive when you consider that he's spent the bulk of his career being called a fat hack.&&Go watch his speech about being asked to shoot a documentary for Prince and you will like him even more.&&Thank you for your honesty. &&thank you for the panic attack :)&&[Found footage of shlevon comforting his son](https://youtu.be/Wp9sN2bzPVs)&&**Jim Fixx** is a classic example of this problem .. he was an obese smoker most of his life and got whipped into shape for his last 10 years and promptly died of a heart attack .. you cannot escape the damage you have done to the internal lumen of your vasculature which starts from birth   
.. if your mom was a smoker or obese she does additional damage as well which also carries down genetically from your grandparents who can also contribute to the damage  
EX. if grandpa had a heart attack and mom was a smoker and you are obese you need to watch out  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Fixx  

.. if you are going on any drastic diet and over 30 you **NEED TO GET CHECKUPS** at the very least one .. from a doctor because this is really stressful on your vascular system especially your coronary arteries  

.. if I think about this only one of my grandfathers had a heart attack around his mid 60s but he lived through a hellish war and after he came home he never exercised he smoked drank beer every other day and ate the most animal fat laden heart clogging food every week .. steaks and gravy made from beef tallow .. so he probably was not genetically predisposed to heart attack .. he brought it on himself  
.. two others died from cancer their late 60s due to being lifelong chain smokers due to the promotion of cigarettes during WW2 I wish I could sue Philip Morris for killing them a decade early
.. the last one who lived to be 75 died of complications from Alzheimers which eroded her health since she could no longer take care of herself
.. both my parents are healthy although a little overweight .. one has cancer but it was very minor and caught quickly using MRI which means that it is way more likely for me to get cancer than heart disease  
.. **IN OTHER WORDS** .. it is very important to look into your past

.. here is a good video on LAD stenting which is what happened to Kevin at the hospital
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9AqBd4RExk

I wonder if Kevin had an angiogram anytime before this to warn him ahead of time&&The lesson from your post is to get yourself checked out, just as a matter of course, especially if your lifestyle and eating habits aren't the greatest. It's better safe than sorry, and there are plenty of tests that can show whether you have dangerously high coronary blockages.&&> We can't go back in time, so the next best thing is to alter our course towards a healthier lifestyle as soon as possible.

Alternatively, the ""Ancient Chinese Proverb""^TM (could be, but usually they are just pithy statements):

>The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&&> In the same way that quitting smoking after 30 years doesn't mean you won't get lung cancer.

And to add to the disclaimer, one's lung cancer risk still drops like a rock after one stops smoking. &&I'm a firm believer that modern heart, cardiovascular and blood pressure medications are one of the main reasons we live longer in the West.

Both of my parents would have been dead a decade ago along with a good friend of mine, if it wasn't for constantly evolving meds.&&There is a book written by a former heart surgeon Caldwell Esselstyn called Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease that would say otherwise. &&Still not too late to lead a healthy life onwards from here. &&Am 38 and have lost over 100 lbs in the last year with another 100 to go... this was mildly unsettling. &&[deleted]&&He had a 100% blockage of his LAD artery, that was likely there regardless. If anything, not having all the extra stress on his heart might've saved his life. &&citation please. Don't go spreading this poppycock &&I've been having chest pains off and on for a couple years.  I told this to my doctor and he just said I'm too young to have heart problems and refused to do any tests. I've gone to another doctor and they just said I was panicking, also without doing any tests.  I don't really know how to get anyone to listen to me. &&Thanks for the detailed answer here. I would just like to point out that, even with insurance, you’re looking at EASILY $10,000 of medical debt in the US with all described.

For those of us that don’t have thousands to spend, would something like a routine cholesterol check be enough to give you an idea of how you’re doing and if you should be concerned??&&EKG is ineffective sometimes--My brother's EKG was fine and he was having a heart attack&&Thank you so much for this. I had chest pains last year (23 years old) and went to a doctor about my concerns. They did an EKG and said everything seemed fine. Eventually the pain seemed to subside but it's recently come back and I'm concerned again but if I went to the doctor I didn't know what I should ask for until now. Again, thanks!!!&&Great post.  I wonder how proactive he was with visiting his PCP.  I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 21.  Before that I couldn't care less about my health outside of seeing my primary for my yearly physical.  My doctor said something that made me consider the bright side of things.  ""Most people in there 20's don't even see any type of doctor, this is forcing you to stay proactive about your health.""  Every year, because of my diabetes I have to have all of the above mentioned screenings (-the cardiologist) and it always reassures me that at least I am doing everything I can.&&Well...I can't afford an EKG, or seeing a doctor/specialists for all that. ;_; &&The gold standard for checking arteries is an angiogram. 

Stress tests are also not too bad. 

Edit: I was totally wrong about calcium scores.&&A lot of the tests aren’t normal unless they suspect something.  My da had to go out of his way years back to do a full heart work up because guys on his side of the family kept dying in their sleep of heart failure.  


My GP was less helpful since I had a decade of chain smoking, but my heart rate is fine and my BP is near hypotension levels.  Just that I should get it run before my 40s.&&47 dicks?!&&I got this bigtime when Ryan Davis with Giantbomb died. It was really hard to see the mailbag videos in their office with him gone. There was just this pervading emptiness left behind without him.&&Closest I've come to that happening is when one of the brothers on Car Talk passed away.

I never purposefully listened to that show once in my life but I'll be damned if I haven't listened to those two laugh for what must be hundreds of hours over the years since I was a kid.

It makes the world a bit darker place. :(&&The one that hit me the hardest was when Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb died back in 2013.

Now whenever I listen to the Bombcast, I get hit with a slight twinge of sadness when I notice the absence of his voice.&&Yeah he’s a celeb death I’m dreading. I’ve had him in my ears almost daily for almost a decade now. I started listening to Smodcast super close to the beginning and listen to just about everything else in the Smod network. &&Doesn’t sound like a bad way to go. After a meal with a friend. Seemingly peacefully.&&My mom died at the age of 51 of sudden cardiac death. She was completely fine, and was out with my dad and my brother after traveling to watch him pitch in a college baseball game. They were sitting at Pizza Hut, waiting on lunch when she just fell over and out of the booth. No clutching her chest, no mention of pain or dizziness or anything. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. There was even an ambulance and cop IN THE PARKING LOT and they couldn't save her.

Life is crazy, but death can be even crazier.&&Do you have the link to his podcast? &&The two of them really are a great team. Bernadin is the knowledgeable one, with good points to make and solid critiques. And Kevin is the entertaining one, who moves the podcast forward and engages the fans. Sometimes I'd wish he'd let discussion flow more naturally (I fuckin love it when Bernadin starts waxing poetic about Batman), but it's a minor critique and I get the feeling that Bernadin would start rambling if Kevin didn't remind him that the show is first and foremost supposed to be funny.&&“Can’t get a better ad for Dollar Shave Club.”&&[LOUD NOISES](https://i.imgur.com/EWFzV.gif)&&[EASIER TO CLICK](https://m.wikihow.com/Lose-Fat-Around-the-Fingers)&&The blockage ""may"" go away. Again, I am not a doctor. We do not fix a blockage unless it is 70% or greater. If someone has some mild to moderate blockage they are usually placed on statin therapy along with antiplatelet medication (low dos aspirin) along with other cardiac medications.

Generally someone would not have a cardiac cath unless they are having some type of symptoms. Chest pain, shortness of breath, heaviness, exercise intolerance. Even with those symptoms, most insurances will not pay for the procedure until you have some type of stress test / echo complete. IDEALLY all of this happens before your major heart attack :)

It is scary seeing younger and younger people coming in with heart disease; I am talking in their 30s. People just tend not to take care of themselves.&&He can always switch to edibles or vaping. I don't understand why any adult  would smoke weed anymore. For the cost of a few bowls you can quit filling your lungs with smoke and feeling like death when you run.

But yeah, I hope this gets him on a healthier track. We need our goofy comic nerd!&&""Get well soon, yous"" <--Jersey style&&I'm rooting for you!&&genetics generally trumps all 

sometimes you just get the short end of the stick and there isnt anything you can do about it &&> Unfortunately, being thin and healthy doesn't make you totally immune to these heart attacks, get your cholesterol levels checked every once and a while, folks!

This thread is full of posts about Kevin's weight and smoking--that shit is seriously damaging--but until your post the thread has totally failed to acknowledge what you just said: You can be active and living healthy all your life, but still unhealthy inside.

Almost anyone can ask around in their friends/family circle and come up with a story about someone who never smoked, drank, or was fat, yet had cardiac issues--it's more common than people think.

People need to go to the doctor, get an annual physical and blood work.

Insist on an ""A1C"" if you have any family history of diabetes too--Don't just assume the doctor will order it if it's needed, especially in the US, they often act like you don't need it and the fasting test is sufficient--but it isn't.  You don't have to be overweight or eating too much sugar to develop Type 2 and you can easily have chronically high blood sugar levels without any symptoms and with a normal fasting test.&&I know this is probably gonna get downvoted but if you have a family history of heart attacks the best way to keep your cholesterol down is to go vegan. Veganism makes your cholesterol levels plummet like crazy. My friend went vegan purely out of curiosity to see if it'd help him and his doctor was shocked by his results a month later. It's the best thing for cholesterol and blood pressure, and there's been studied showing the effectiveness of how it prevents heart attacks.&&You and me both. Now I'm just getting ready for them to stick a camera up my ass. &&IMDb is telling me she starred in Yoga Hosers, which he wrote and directed, but I'm not sure bout much else.&&Clerks *was* groundbreaking at the time. The idea that anyone anywhere with a camera could pick it up and make a movie that could make millions of dollars. Changed Sundance and indie filmmaking for decades.&&Then go out tomorrow and start racking up that tab. 

The thesis of Kevin’s experience is a lack of regret due to a life lived, if you go out and do one thing tomorrow (if it’s even to find that elusive dragon while gazing at the clouds) you’ll be able to say that one day, tomorrow and ever after.&&I can say it right now.  It was beautiful to read his post because it's exactly how I feel. I don't *want* to die anytime soon....but if it happens, I can look back on the life I've had and be content.

There's only one thing I fear about death......burning.  I'm a firefighter, and that's the one way I really hope I don't go out....burning.

I've only had two instances in my career where I thought I might not make it out...and really my only thought was ""If this is it, please make it quick"".&&Right? Helps to have a cool job though.



...I hate my job, and will die screaming.&&*I’ve wasted a lot of opportunities and fucked up pretty much every chance that I’ve ever had in life*

If it were me&&You don't have a choice, so you might as well say it.&&You know I was terrified of death most of my childhood. Like any child I wouldn't sleep MANY nights thinking about it. Until one night In my dreams I died. And as the life slipped out of me ( I know I know it's just a dream 😂) I was filled with an overwhelming calm and the fealing it was gonna be okay. Maybe it's a defense mechanism your brain has but it's what made me stop thinking about it.&&I imagine when you have a close brush with death like this you tend to think more carefully about life and death, as it seems much more real.&&Also a great speaker and storryteller. His University talks are awesome. &&[Our Wedding Ceremony](https://youtu.be/KGTqZ9uBL2k)

My wife and I are both major Kevin Smith fans, and it's something we bonded over quite a bit when we were first getting to know each other.

When Kevin came to Nashville to do a show I surprised her by buying tickets and proposing with Kevin's help.  I asked him if he could officiate the wedding when he came back around and he delightfully agreed.

About a year went by before he made it back, but soon enough it was that time. I reminded him about it and we were good to go, but the night of the show it slipped his mind.

I shot him a message afterwards and he felt so horrible about forgetting that he invited us and anyone we wanted to bring along to his hotel room to get married the next morning.

The next morning we head to the hotel he gave us the address for, then Kevin came down from the elevator and took us all the way up to the penthouse.  He said originally he had a regular room, but the hotel upgraded him and Mewes to the penthouse because Mewes had complained about something or other.

Anyway, so we get up to the top floor of this amazing suite.  The place is bigger than our whole apartment and you can see all of Nashville from the balcony. 

It was pretty early in the morning, so Kevin was quiet.  He didn't say much initially, but was extremely kind, asking us how our trip was, etc.   He was pretty soft spoken tbh.

We got my phone set up to record, as he did some director type moves, talked about the shot being static, the lighting not being great, etc, and joked about me being assistant director.


Then came time to do the actual ceremony.  Once the camera was going it was like a switch flipped and he turned on  that classic Kevin Smith charm.


We had the ceremony, then once it was finished we offered to take him out to lunch.  He explained that he was already running late for his flight, but if he had time he would have taken us out instead.  He packed up the last of his things, gave us hugs, offered us his weed since he couldn't take it on the plane, and tried to give us a huge bag of like 50 goo goo clusters because he didn't eat sugar anymore but the hotel gave them to him anyway.

We politely declined since we had also given up sugar. Then he handed us his room key.

""There's about 4 hours left of this room, it's yours until then, have fun you two"".


Then he headed out and left us to this crazy  luxurious room.&&Kevin Smith has been Ordained by the Universal Life Church so can perform marriage ceremonies. So if you attend one of his podcast showings (Hollywood Babble on or Jay and Silent Bob get old), send him an Email if they can fit you in and you dont mind getting married in front of 50 strangers and have it broadcast on his podcast he will marry you.

He does the vows to the Green Lantern Oath.&&The knowing is mutual!&&Sadly a great fraction of people with heart attack are sent home by doctors dismissing them as having GERD. It's good to know the various symptoms, and what's normal or abnormal for ya. 

edit: spelling mistake&&Those are ""at the time of"" symptoms.  What he (and may be you) was ignoring was the warning symptoms.  My dad had chest pains on a Tuesday (that we know of, he probably had more earlier), by that Thursday he was dead of a heart attack.

I started having chest pains with moderate exertion (walking up stairs) and learning from my dad's bad example went immediately to the doctor.  Turns out I had a 90% blockage, and ended up in emergency surgery to install a stent.

DO NOT IGNORE THESE WARNING SIGNS.  Pain is your body's signal ""something is wrong"".  It's not ""manly"" to pretend pain isn't happening, it's stupidity.  And if you do, well, then enjoy the pain you'll be causing your loved ones as they cry around your cold decomposing body at your funeral, and my opinion of the kind of idiot that causes that kind of pain to their loved ones is the same as of the kind of idiot that punches their loved ones in the face.&&Gastritis/mild crohns here. Panic attacks regularly when this shit happens.&&My father just had a valve replaced and his roommate on the floor was a 38 year old with a 100 percent occlusion. 

Similar story for him. Smoker since 17. Drinker. They found it by luck actually while doing another procedure. 

Take care of yourself, young people. You aren’t invincible. &&No clue. No one knows. 

I was a smoker and I drank a lot of whiskey. I also spent 4 years as an Italian chefs assistant and he cooked with ALOT of heavy cream and butter and I was allowed to eat whatever, whenever. I think that may have had something to do with it. I had also 2 years prior gone through a break up that put me into a state of near panic attack for a solid 6 months. I think that episode had a detrimental impact on my cardiovascular system. 

I’m suspicious that our modern diet of garbage and medicine is what is contributing to the lowered age of heart attack victims. &&I don't know if this is inspiring or terrifying &&Thanks for looking out for random internet strangers!

I’ve actually had some basic blood work recently (last month) along with a checkup for an unrelated issue. I also have yearly physicals (thanks, Obama), so I’ll make sure to mention it when I see him next month.

Honestly, I’ve had panic attacks in the past and this sort-of-but-not-really felt like the start of one, so I spent half an hour calming myself down (130/90, 110bpm to 120/80, 80 bpm), walking around, drinking water and then everything settled down so I could manage another couple hours of sleep. That’s why I’m thinking more along the lines of bad dinner or bad dream that I don’t remember. 

Still, waking up and seeing the description of your night in a “famous guy has a massive heart attack with these symptoms” story was a little surreal.&&I just mentioned in another comment that I had a panic attack before. I actually went to the ER right away for that first big one (housemate drove, not me) because I was sure I was dying (couldn’t catch my breath at all, adrenaline rushing, I could feel every heart beat). This was different, but I figured I’d give my normal calm down breathing methods a shot and ended up feeling normal-ish enough to fall back asleep for another two hours.

I had always assumed that there would have to be a stress trigger that would cause one of those or that I’d be obviously emotional, but nope. I was scared but reasonably composed at the ER and it was actually immediately after my huge source of stress was completed. Brains are just weird sometimes.&&> Didn't he lose like 85 Pounds, or did he gain it back? not as fat as he used to be.

Vegans can still eat Oreos and chips and olive oil, this style of eating is something else entirely but it is practically miraculous in fixing people's health. &&My father was diagnosed with end stage cardiac disease in June 2015.  He was down to two arteries that were harvested from his lower body twenty years ago.  He got a second opinion from a cardiologist who told him to go vegan and cut out oils.  My father has been diligent in his adherence to his diet and is doing better than he was before 2015, walking five miles a day.  &&I would be careful using phrases like ""heart attack proof""... If not for accuracy, for semantic reasons. I am a vegan who has seen the benefits, but that kind of talk gets us tossed into the ""fad diet"" category. Not to call that research fake, but the phrase ""heart attack proof"" is a bit dangerous to throw around. Especially when the argument is that it ""can"" make you heart attack proof, implying that many vegans may still have heart attacks... Which renders the phrase useless.&&> I hope he also starts exercising

He [lost a bunch of weight](https://www.dietsinreview.com/diet_column/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kevin-smith-before-and-after.jpg) in the past few years, so he's probably already exercising some already.&&Tears up about ~~his daughter and just life~~ literally anything.&&His podcast after Alan Rickman died was heartbreaking and wonderful. The guy really does have a certain lust for life and when he talks about things he is passionate for it comes through. &&> It's all the more impressive when you consider that he's spent the bulk of his career being called a fat hack.

Mostly by himself&&We’re all fat hacks just trying to make it, dammit!&&In rereading my post I could see how I'm coming across as a bit of a bummer.  Not my intention, honest.  I just think it's a really serious issue, and more optimistically, *highly* preventable (obviously genetics still factor in) through lifestyle modification, i.e. eating well, exercise, and controlling your weight/body composition.

Ascribing intent to biology is always dangerous, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say we're not *meant* to die of heart disease.  We just happen to live in a way so divorced from what our biology expects (proper nutrition, regular exercise) that it happens waaaay too often.&&[deleted]&&Are there people who aren't firm believers in the idea that improving medical standards and techniques have improved life expectancy? Is that a deniable notion?&&My dad had chronic plaque buildup due to genetics. (Both brothers have/had the same issues) His lifestyle of smoking and drinking certainly didn’t help, but even with having low cholesterol and being on blood thinners and having stents throughout, the arteries in his legs had closed up and hardened. He’d had his carotid scoped 6 years ago and they were wanting to do it again in November. Unfortunately, it all caught up to him in December and the third heart attack (that we knew of) killed him. The autopsy revealed he’d had multiple recently. 

Part of me thinks it kept him around longer that his first one happened at 38 because learning those issues were there, and the extent of them, gave them the opportunity to start treating them. Otherwise, he probably would have been gone 15 years ago when he had the second one. &&You can be healthy for the rest of your life!&&Agree 100%, but a lot of people don't seem to realize that you can't be 100 pounds overweight for 20 years, lose the weight and then pretend you were healthy your whole life.

Biology just doesn't work that way.&&[deleted]&&It's still worth it. 

I'm sure you know that deep down, but really, it's always worth it.&&It's also bullshit so don't worry. And good job dude. &&Worrying also causes heart attacks&&Get thin or die trying.&&Also Kevin is what? 50. And he smokes a heck of a lot of the green. &&Take that statement with a grain of salt &&A small peak in likelihood of having a heart attack followed by a greatly reduced risk of heart attack for the rest of your life is a much better option than having an already high, and ever increasing chance of having a heart attack for your entire life had you stayed overweight. Congratulations on getting healthy!&&Yup. Thin people recover MUCH quicker than fat people in pretty much any situation. I see it in the hospital constantly. &&I work on a telemetry observation floor and our patients are those who have chest pain but not usually have an active heart attack.  So we send them for a non stress test (where your walk on a treadmill then images are taking of your heart comparing rest to exercise) and wait for the results.  If a test shows abnormalities usually the next procedure is a heart cath.  If normal, they say chest pain is non cardiac.  I’d ask for a stress test,  they do these in an outpatient setting as well. &&That's really terrible. I think though, the keywords they watch out for - shortness of breath and chest pain upon exertion or exercise. If your symptoms get worse after physical activity, it's likely a heart problem and doctors would take that seriously. If you're young, not overweight, don't smoke, have normal lipid levels, you're likely not at increased risk and doctors are still not going to suspect atherosclerosis though. But they might think of congenital problems.  So yeah keyword is upon exertion. &&A lot of it may have to do with your insurance. If insurance sees no cause for the test, they might not pay for it. So if you really want it, just tell your doctor you’re willing to pay out of pocket (if you are or are even able - a heart ultrasound isn’t cheap [i had one myself because of family history]) and they probably won’t refuse it. 
But if you have a good doctor, just telling them you have chest pains and are concerned should be enough. 

I had a weird month about 3 years ago where I was petrified I had a blood clot in my leg. So random. I told my doctor and she said “I really don’t think anything is wrong with you, but I’ll send you for an ultrasound because if you’re telling me you are concerned, I’m not going to ignore it.” I was fine, like she said I would be, and insurance paid for it. &&They didn't check your blood for cholesterol or anything? Those are pretty standard. But if you're wondering why they didn't do more invasive testing: assuming your cholesterol is normal and you're a healthy young person, getting more tests isn't good medicine. as you do more and more tests, you are gonna end up with a false positive and can actually harm patients. &&Honestly stuff like that and blood sugars, blood pressure, weight etc would give you a pretty decent idea of how you're doing. And if you're not having any symptoms and are able to exercise without issues &&i'm getting a stress test some time soon, have had high cholestorol since i was 16 and kinda want to see what damage it might have done, i'm 27 now, don't want a heart attack anytime soon&&whats a stress test?&&Hey, try not to have any more heart attacks on your way to the parking lot!&&In a row?!&&Its not the same without him.&&Ouch, memories. Ryan's passing was the beginning of the end for me and Giantbomb. It's just not the same.&&""Hey everybody its Tuuuuueeesday..."" I'm right there with you buddy it hit me hard too.&&Http://www.smodcast.com

Also Http://www.youtube.com/kevinsmith&&Yeah, what prompted my weight loss journey was a car accident. I got rear-ended while I was looking over my shoulder to change lanes, and the seat belt caught me at a really bad angle. The State Trooper who showed up noticed me holding my chest on the side of the road and had me taken to a hospital thinking I was having a heart attack. They did a stress test there and all was good, but the doctor told me that normally he'd say I was too young to have heart issues, but given my weight and some societal trends he had to give me a lecture.

I was really, really obese. I still have a little bit to go, but I don't check any of the other boxes at the moment. Still, it's scary thinking that I may have done permanent damage to my body by being a lazy ass in my 20's.

It stands out to me for how ridiculous it is.&&>  Like any child I wouldn't sleep MANY nights thinking about it.

Erm, am I weird for never worrying about dying as a kid?&&Dude I've had a very similar dream in my teenage years and I think about it from time to time to give me peace. In the dream, I was in a park and I was shot 3 times in the chest. I fall on my back and an overwhelming sense of panic starts to come over me, then, complete calm. absolutely no pain. I know i am going to die in that moment and realize that if there is an after life I cant wait to experience it and if there is not, then I wont know the difference anyways and there absolutely nothing to worry about.

My friends and family that had heart attacks told me the main difference between knowing it was heart attack instead of heart burn is that they felt like they had the worst “charley horse” muscle like cramp in their chest, with agonizing stomach pain and hard to breathe.&&You only get one body.  Unfortunately most people don't realize this until 55. &&“No clue how I got a heart attack”

Goes on to describe smoking, unhealthy eating, lack of exercise. Literally the main three causes of heart attacks.&&Were you mostly sedentary or were you exercising at all during that period?&&Breakup stress did it. Every single heart/blood pressure issue I had went away with no diet or exercise change after my divorce.

Emotional stress is as deadly as a truck.

&&This fucking terrifies me. I'm only 23 and had what I thought was a heart attack, turned out to be a panic attack brought on by a fatigue related illness. I'm still suffering from with both extreme fatigue and panic disorder and struggle to do much at all. I've been virtually bed bound for over a year, whereas before I was a very active stage performer.

I'm trying so hard to fix it and get back to living, but my body freaks out every time I try to do the slightest bit of activity, and makes me suffer for it. Crazy, scary stuff. The hardest pill to swallow is that the medical consensus is that it's psychological, because the physical symptoms are real, but they are a result of PTSD and the fight or flight response.

I've moved back in with the parents, and I'm a week away from starting cardiovascular exercise therapy. I want to run again.

If anything is responsible for the position I'm in now, it's probably fast food and coffee, both of which I ate on the daily when I was well. Haven't had either since I got sick though.&&But seriously, if you and your pops both had heart attacks before 30, you should be getting a genetic work up for familial high cholesterol or triglycerides.

They check for specific changes to the signal that indicate damaged or dead tissue.&&Hey you get back here!&&And to yous.&&Some unsolicited advice from an internet stranger:

*Start small and slow. Going hard and fast at the beginning is how you get injured or burnt out. Know your limits and push them, but trying to burst past them will result in excessive pain and dissatisfaction. 

*Consult your doctor. This is a person whose whole job is to know how if your body is working right. You're going to get sore, but this is a person who will help you stay away from injuries. They also can help you track your long term progression with tests and other metrics. 

*Portion Control is your friend. Fad diets and ""cleanses"" are idiotic and generally unsustainable. Eat well, and eat slowly so your body can tell you it's full sooner. A nutritionist can be helpful, and perhaps your doctor can recommend one.

*Be willing to change your plan. If you don't like to run, try biking instead. If you don't like to bike, try Pilates. If you don't like Pilates, etc. etc. etc... The important thing is you do SOMETHING, and you'll do that something more often if you actually enjoy it.

*[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BVE1N2nPPQ) is the first episode in a YouTube series called 100 Days, where two middle aged men try to have a ""Healthy Mid-Life Crisis"" by eating healthier, exercising, and engaging in personal mental health activities like meditating. I highly recommend it. 

Good Luck. This will not be easy, but it is important.

It'd be easier if nobody else was depending on my income, to change that. Plus...I don't have career goals.

I want to be in a better place physically this time next year. Because what KS just went through is one of my biggest fears.&&It's amusing, but what he described is how a lot of 20 somethings live.

&&Damn, give the guy a break.&&Also

Which is pretty much the biggest modern health problem and well documented. So yeah I'm suspicious this might be the cause as well but Im really not sure.&&Yean, except butter isn't going to give you a heart attack.&&If he was 55 I'd agree, but he's 29.

Slow, steady weight loss from portion control and moderate exercise is the name of the game. Consult your doctor, talk to a nutritionist. Best of luck to you!&&Probably GERD then. GERD can mimic heart failure/attack pain but present with different symptoms. It gets worse when you lay down because the acid is travelling up the oesophagus easier (cause gravity).

I've always had okay habits but damn, I can't even eat a burger and fries anymore.&&Yeah, twenty-something here. I don't smoke, but most of my friends do. I drink a pretty good amount (like, not a troubling amount, but a few times a week). I also eat whatever I want whenever I want (trying to change this). I think I'm at a stage in my life where my metabolism isn't working as well as it used to. I work a desk job now, so I'm not burning calories like I used to either, so all of a sudden I'm starting to feel the effects of a midnight big mac or heavy drinking. I've never gotten hangovers before, but they're starting to become more common. 

Growing up is some scary shit.&&If he struggled with his weight for most of his life, it's less surprising. I'm in my late 20s, and all of my friends who struggled with weight through our childhood have been put on meds for their cardiovascular health. Several developed type 2 diabetes. One had bariatric surgery at the age of 27 - she was on 3 or 4 cardiac drugs and her diabetes was going to start requiring her to take insulin injections. Another friend with chronic obesity issues is 28 and just got a new doctor who immediately referred him to a weight loss specialist team due to rising risk of a major cardiac event. 

So maybe he/she has just also always struggled with weight.&&God works in mysterious ways.&&Sometimes you just need a slap in the face. Not nearly as serious as a heart attack, but I'm currently staring down three cavity fillings and a possible root canal despite my lifetime commitment to brushing/flossing/rinsing twice a day. Once I got over the ""how dare my teeth did this to me!"", I started thinking about all the sugary shit I eat, energy drinks I sip on over the course of a day, and the whole not going to the dentist for six years thing. I'm honestly surprised I've kept my teeth going this long with how much bullshit I put them through.&&Meh. It used to be super rare. Not particularly anymore, due to the rise of “Super Obesity”.

Super-obese people tend to have had heart attacks at a fairly decent rate by their mid-thirties. Super-obesity is also what people think of when they think of obesity. “Could stand to lose a little bit of weight” is actually obesity, “a bit pudgy” is morbidly obese, and anybody who the average person thinks of as fat is probably super-obese.&&They’re finding out it’s sugar. Sugar is in everything and your body doesn’t do well at processing it without a ton of fiber along with it. They even put corn syrup in wheat bread! Basically, insulin resistance is what the modern research is focusing on. It causes so many problems with our bodies.&&I like that he phrased it that way.&&Exactly, it's the carbs, sugar, and especially smoking.

Under you as you walk your ass back to work, you slacker!  No breaks in Life!&&I believe you mean Alex Murphy&&I remember one time my parents were just gone from the house without warning. I woke up and no one was home- searched the entire house. No note, no signs or clues. They were both dead, for sure, so I grabbed my stuffed dog and cried in my room for a long time. Then they walked through the door... apparently they had gone to Lowe’s and had even been working in the yard half the time I was crying. &&Born in the mid 70's,and I constantly worried about nuclear war.

It's good to know more people think the way I do :)&&You comment about hangovers really hits home for me. 35 & female, a mechanic by trade, so drinking is a skill I adopted early on. (And, lemme tell you - some of those dudes can *drink.*)

I never used to get hangovers no matter how much I drank, but now I'm starting to feel pretty fucked the morning after a heavy night. That fact alone is a strong motivator to change the habit, because I always told myself that if I started getting hangovers like most of my friends & coworkers get - and I, of course, laughed in the face of their misery - that I'd stop drinking.

I feel it's less that growing up is *scary*, and more that getting old just *sucks.*&&> I drink a pretty good amount (like, not a troubling amount, but a few times a week)

I'm always curious what people mean by this. I have a beer with dinner most nights. Does that count as drinking a few times a week? Or do you mean that your going out to the bar and having a few rounds a few times a week?

I used to do the latter a couple times a week way back in college, and I've always felt that was way more unhealthy than my current beer-with-dinner.&&I am in my forties and did same.  I started feeling it in my thirties. At forty I made a change.  I am in relatively good shape (6""2' 185 lbs).  I have found my key is to allow myself those moments to eat like shit but not make it a lifestyle so I eat like shit on the weekends and eat really good during the week.  I drink on the weekends, often to excess, but very little during the week and I do not drink during Lent.  Its all a balance. &&> Growing up is some scary shit.

Dilly, dilly. &&I definitely did not ever struggle with my weight. I was very thin most of my life. &&Thing is, people live in the now and don't look at the bigger picture.

I've always been obese; 24 stone at my biggest. I'm 40 in September.
My mother and father have both had quadrupole heart bypasses. Both type 2 diabetes.

I decided the other month that I need to do something now. In 2 months I've lost almost 2 stone from a change in diet and exercise. I joined a gym last week and went 4 times in the week. I'm now 20st 8lbs.

My point is that often people want the easy way out so they go for surgery. That is NOT the easy way out. Quite the opposite actually as they don't prepare you to change your lifestyle etc.

I know several people who had weight loss procedures is bands, sleeves and bypasses and each one reverted back to being obese because the root of the issue hadn't been addressed.

I'm confident that by May I'll be 18 stone.
My end goal is 15-16st&&Why he made cheese so delicious but deadly we'll never know.&&Sending thoughts and prayers his way to help figure out this mysterious ailment.&&Funny you should say that. The day before my event I was sitting in my backyard smoking a cigarette and I remember looking down at the cigarette and asking “how am I ever going to quit you”?

And the next day god answered that question. &&Well damn. I take good care of my teeth but haven't been to the dentist in a couple years. 

That sounds horrible. A root canal?

Ok, you've convinced me. I'll go to my dentist for a cleaning. Jesus. &&I lost 80 pounds and reversed my blood pressure and cholesterol problem. I eat butter and heavy cream a lot. This stupid fat myth has to die. Pasta, grains and sugar is what made me fat growing up.&&Yep. If they ever use stress as a measure for forced time off the world will change for the better overnight.

The world is fucked up mostly because of tired people who do not give a fuck.&&Typical Jewish grandmother stress level.&&Even if it’s not just to avoid a heart attack, but to improve your quality of life.

It’s amazing how much better life is when you feel fit and healthy. &&All aboard the fuck-fuck-fuck boat! Let's all go for a run later, yeah? &&[deleted]&&Maybe I'm wrong but I picture a 29 year old heart attack victim as someone who's obese, if not overweight. Unless their idea of overweight is 400lbs&&And he does whatever project he wants to do, even if they're bizarre little horror films that nobody but him and his kid like.&&Absolutely get the heart workup done, but GERD can present on the left side as well (and in the back). The laying down making it worse doesnt jive with angina or heart issues (usually resting makes it better), but don't trust me, trust a doctor (that being said, if it's GERD, you owe me a coke (that you then couldn't actually drink))&&Charlie Murphy...&&Oh yeah, I had days like that. Wake up on a Saturday morning, and instead of being out in the kitchen making breakfast or doing dishes, my mom's just gone. Look around for her, nothing. Car's not in the garage. Welp, obviously she went somewhere and died. Life's gonna change now. Oh wait, now she's back and she just went to get coffee. 

edit: I totally didn't mean for the part about my mom not being in the kitchen meaning she's dead to sound nearly as sexist as it came off. That's just where she normally was in the morning, so as a kid, her not being there meant something bad happened. Or at least that's what it meant in my head. &&>	mysterious ailment

I read that as mayonnaise ailment for some reason. Made me laugh both ways.&&Yeah dude. I've got an appointment with an endodontist tomorrow. The crazy thing is that I just decided to go to the dentist on a whim because they were running a special for a free custom whitening kit with a cleaning. No pain, no temperature sensitivity, nothing... I wouldn't have known until the infection killed the tooth, probably.

TLDR: GO TO THE DENTIST.&&What's it been.... eighteen years now since the last visit?&&The ""unhealthy"" dietary fat and cholesterol myth is perpetuated by the sugar industry, among others.&&I wish this wasn't such an elusive truth. I had to read it in a book to wake up to the realization that you stated above.

My Dr told me a few years ago ""if you get hungry late in the day, just eat a bowl of cheerios"". 

I'm glad to have finally learned what foods to avoid and hope more awareness spreads to defeat the myths of grains, carbs, and sugars.&&Was she of Ashkenazi descent? There have been studies done on groups of Ashkenazi Jewish people (many of whom smoked and didn't exercise) and there is a genetic factor that kept them going into their 90's and 100's. I can't remember off the top of my head what the gene was called.&&Lol, it be terrible if you were talking about a (just) girlfriend/wife. As a mom, it's generally where we are. You made me chuckle. &&If someone said your sexist for thinking that Fuck them. Your mom was making breakfast and cleaning became she loved her family. How annoying the internet can be sometimes. &&Is mayonnaise an ailment?&&Absolutely, plus the heavily subsidized corn industry as well&&Yeah the fact that Cheerios got associate with ""healthy heart"" eating is absurd and makes me angry as a doc myself. The diet education in this country is totally upside down &&Tenacious in its recessive form, cantankerous in its dominant form.&&Yup she was of Russian decent, but born in Poland. Her parents fled Russia at the turn of the century then left Poland during the late 1920's.  Unfortunately, neither parent survived the trip to the US and my grandmother and her sister were wards of the state upon arrival.

Someone Put a Statue of Jason Voorhees in a Minnesota Lake For Divers to Stumble Across,48776,8106ll,http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/268037/someone-put-statue-jason-voorhees-minnesota-lake-divers-stumble-across/,777,1519856356.0,,"Continue reading?

Step 1: Leak that someone has hidden a statue of you at the bottom of a lake.
  
Step 2: Hide yourself at the bottom of the lake.
  
Step 3: Curious divers come to see your statue and check you out nice and close.
  
Step 4: Aquatic murder party.
  
Step 5: Pawn looted scuba gear from unsuspecting victims. Profit!
  
&&That is fucked up haha. I know he isnt real but id be terrified all the same if I came across that.&&Nah, people see so many hockey masks in Minnesota that they're desensitized to that&&scientists are studying the lake to figure out why the e-coli  counts are off the charts!&&As a Boy Scout I went to Camp No Be Bo Sco in Northern New Jersey which is where they filmed the original. We heard tales and rumors of film equipment under the water of the lake.

The other rumor was specifically about Jason. The story that got passed around the different Troops at camp was they went through a couple of different ideas for the scene with the canoe at the end. One idea for some reason involved using a couple of dummies and they would all fly out of the water, like Jason did in the film. And those too were left at the bottom of the lake. 

We were all very worried about a hand brushing our feet as we swamp in that gross ass lake.&&What I love about this is most lake divers are new divers getting certified. 
If I was in a lake dive and floated up to this I might have died from shit in my suit. 
I have a thing for Voorhees and even dressed up as him for Halloween.  Scared trick or treaters. https://i.imgur.com/imvn5NW.jpg &&Guarantee the person who found this was involved. &&Purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minne...  -oh hell no!&&[Here's a direct link to the video in case anybody else is having trouble with the website.](https://youtu.be/jdIrgkcnIrw)&&There are geniuses, and there are geniuses.

The article doesn't load that damned part.  

I live in MN and would like to know&&The movie takes place in new jersey. We have lakes near summer camps here why don't we have one.&&Personally, I would prefer to have my first heart attack on land, but that's just me.&&Yeah, well, the original dummy that flipped the canoe in the original film is allegedly still in the lake. 

Source: have worked at the camp many years, knew a guy who claims to have been one of the people launching the dummy, have worn Annie's backpack as a hat (unrelated but I love getting to say that)&&For some reason my brain read this as James Van Der Beek, and now I'm really dissapointed there isn't a statue of Dawson at the bottom of a Minnesotan lake for someone to stumble across.&&Now imagine it being animatronic and its arm would swing whenever something moved close to it&&OR it could be PR for an upcoming movie&&I like the idea of this statue idea going viral and then all of the sudden there's one at the bottom of every lake until someday, long after we're all gone, aliens will come and discover it and it will become the greatest WTF ever, and Jason becomes their Jesus.&&Website is ded.:( Too much reddit love.&&Minnesota here, we actually have a Crystal Lake. This statue had better be at the bottom of that particular lake and not just some other lake. Anything worth doing is worth doing right.&&And yet no one has found my Pelican Brief at the bottom of Pelican Lake, MN. &&Now I am tempted to do the same thing with a statue of the creature from the Black Lagoon.&&If I was diving there and saw a body at the bottom of a lake, I would probably call the police. &&What if that's not a statue, but a corpse made to look like Jason Voorhees?&&If i happened across this statue, i'd probably nope the fuck out of the entire continent&&Best part would have been if after the members leaked it to Media, the statue was not where they led the divers to. &&Isn't that massively dangerous?

We have, like, 10,000 of them.&&Does anyone else perk up when they see the name of their state?&&*CHCH, AHAH*&&It'd be great to read the article... but opening the fucking website is impossible and possible cancer on mobile.&&You told the world!?!?

Good luck!&&I read that as ""drivers"" instead of ""divers"" and I was wondering what in the hell is going on in Minnesota?&&It's like a video game easter egg but irl.&&Ha, i know the guy that did that, ive dove with him.&&I skimmed this as ""Jason Momoa"" and thought someone was trying to be cheeky with Aquaman. Now I have read it properly and am scared. &&at least people don’t know if you peed your pants underwater &&Thing is its a real body just nobody checks cuz it jason&&I bet some people have shit their wetsuit after swimming up to this. &&Weird, I saw another driver in my rearview dressed like Jason yesterday evening&&These are my coworkers videos! He may be fake but I think my butt would still be a little puckered&&I would rather it be a statue of Gerard Way &&U/Daymanx/ Fighter of the night—man&&I can imagine the police department already has a standard reply to people saying they found dead body in the lake.&&That's awesome&&The scariest part of that first video was noticing the diver behind the statue&&That is diabolical.

Site won't load for me, reddit hug of death, etc...&&That feeling of being the 10k thumb up... or is that just me.  &&I’d probably freak the hell out &&Well fuck now I don't ever want to go to Minnesota and swim. &&Fix it! &&I used to go to camp NoBeBosCo which is where they filmed the first Friday the 13tb movie. Someone had an inflatable Jason doll they kept in the water and would send it out while the scouts did the mile swim. Scared the shit out of some kids. &&**fuck that.**&&fuck that...

It’s crap like a freaking JASON statue at the bottom of a dark muddy body of water that keeps me from EVER taking up diving! &&That is awesome&&This is awesome, I spent 3 weeks this year studying and animating Jason Voorhees and this statue is top-notch.&&Whelp, that’s bad ass.

Now someone should put a good guy doll in some old abandoned toy factory.&&If it is not in Jersey, it doesn't count.&&Why is this coming out now? No one is diving here just yet. Someone must want that sweet, sweet karma.&&This is a great idea. Too bad it'll eventually crumble away in the next few years.&&This is a major deal for future lifeforms that come to study our civilization. Finding it would be like a wrench of idolicism and violence creating confusion from any other hockey knowledge.

Very exciting.&&Seems like putting it at the top of the lake would have made it easier to find rather than the bottom of it &&That'll turn a dry suit in to wet suit real quick.&&whoever did this is a legend &&I just shat myself and I'm nowhere near a lake.

The theater management offered a life insurance policy just in case you died of fright.

They rigged certain theater seats with electric buzzers. The filmmaker, William Castle, talked independent theaters into letting him shock the audience’s butts.

I don’t remember the specifics and do not want to give the copy cat much attention- but someone in another state decided to make a bigger one. Why? Probably for attention. But we like to take pride in having the original unnecessary big ball of twine! It is quite impressive tbh, and just the fact that someone did it and then it was appreciated is so Minnesotan to me. I love going out to Darwin to marvel at the HUGE BALL OF TWINE encased in a glass gazebo, and then jot my name down in the notebook in the mailbox and read the places people have come from to see it... and a few Weird Al references of course.

Nothing cooler than looking down from a boat and seeing fish 20 feet below you.&&I got my open water cert there a decade ago. The group that does certifications puts a bunch of wacky stuff down there for fun and because the lake isn't a phenominal dive spot. I don't remember it being very clear, just absolutely frigid in April.

Edit: Nevermind, I'm a liar who got certified at another MN lake with a bunch of wacky shit at the bottom.&&Apparently the lake is very popular with divers so they put it somewhere where it would be found quickly.&&You really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and tell lies? &&I invented frisbee.  It was after a long day of uppers and a short night of downers. Waking up with a terrible hangover and my alarm blaring pure pain straight into my skull. I threw the plate that held the remnants of my late night snack towards the alarm. And just at that moment my roommate walked in to shut of my alarm. Milliseconds before his hand reached the snooze button,  my plate flew into his hand. 


He ended up with two broken fingers, but I saw potential.  &&Name checks out&&Username checks out&&It's a popular dive spot, so it would've been found pretty quickly either way.&&except for the people who have underwater heart attacks&&/r/outside&&[deleted]&&I loved Jason X, it wasn't til way after I realized it was basically ""Jason vs Random Syfy People"" but yeah.

He was too agile it seemed for me and he was a kidnapper too which was weird! &&You wouldn't call the police if someone was murdered? &&*but what if he was in a horror movie?????*&&After examining many hours of video evidence, I have come to the conclusion that these kind of frightening appearances are often not seen from far away, but seemingly appear out of nowhere most of the times. This is true even when it concerns inanimate objects. &&I’ve been diving for years. Multiple certs, night dives, deep dives, and a couple of wreck dives. Never had a problem getting frightened by anything underwater but I guarantee you if I saw this from anything less than 100 feet out (and lakes typically have way less viz than that) I would shit my pants and get bent ascending. &&You're telling me that if you were in deep, dark water and you suddenly came across that you wouldn't freak out? &&There was a bust of Lenin just off Balaclava, Ukraine in the Black Sea.  There were a number of these before people even started doing ""art"" installations as is now popular.&&It's really ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" in varying speeds, because the composer used the words ""kill"" and ""mommy"" from Pamela's ""kill her, mommy"" line in the first movie. He just accented those two parts and used an echo effect. In the first movie it's easier to tell it's ""kikiki mamama"" but it seemed to get more and more ""ch ch ch ah ah ah"" as the series went on.

In Part 5, when they teased Tommy becoming the new killer, they recorded it as ""ki ki ki ta ta ta"" for ""Tommy"" instead of ""mommy.""&&Wow! Thanks! This is really great stuff. &&Hitting the button counts as a page load for the ads.

That being said they should just use lazy-loading so the assets load ""on scroll"" rather than all at once, or having a button.

First, they don't (or aren't supposed to) load the entirety of the page until you click. Text for SEO might load, but not images and such. Cuts gotten on bandwidth and saves costs.

Secondly it shows whether you showed up and read, or just skimmed and left. That allows better engagement with the audience and also indicates to advertiser's that you're a human and not a bot, which can make the ads worth a bit more.&&Supposedly it's so that if a reader gets bored after the first few paragraphs of an article, they reach the related articles section and potentially stay on the site ~~rather than returning to Reddit~~.

Heath Ledger Had Planned to Return as the Joker,44673,7uml7u,http://www.slashfilm.com/heath-ledger-joker-return/,2971,1517523778.0,,"I just rewatched Nolan’s trilogy last weekend while battling the flu. I kept thinking how great it would’ve been to have Joker in TDKR. I once read someone’s concept of Joker being the Hannibal lecter character with Batman interviewing him in Arkham trying to figure out Bane. I need that movie. &&I'm pretty sure that this was obvious. The movie intentionally left open the Joker.&&I always thought it would have been interesting to see Joker's chaos philosophy going head to head with Talia and Bane's plans in the third film, with Bats in the middle trying to stop the all out insane war that would result.&&If I had an ""alternate timeline"" movie I could watch, it would absolutely be the *Dark Knight Rises* with Heath Ledger's Joker in it.&&A reminder about what happens to people with plans:

""The mob has plans, the cops have plans, Gordon’s got plans. You know, they’re schemers. Schemers trying to control their worlds. I’m not a schemer. I try to show the schemers how, pathetic, their attempts to control things really are.""&&This is like finding out the hot girl from school had a crush on you years later when you're married with a family. &&Just re-watched TDK in it's entirety for the first time since I saw it in theatres. Ledger deserves every bit of praise, what a damn performance.

Mob guy: ""Think you can just walk in here and steal from us?""
Mr. J ""Yeah"" 

One of just so many little moments where he IS the joker.&&I guess it's time to re-watch the whole trilogy then..&&It was a rollercoster first he was cast and we were all like this guy is the joker wtf. Then the first the photos started surfacing and eventually the trailers dropped once again everyone went what the fuck. Then he died not too long before the release and it was the biggest wtf of all .

Say what you will but you gotta respect Nolan. 

He preserved Ledgers memory by not replacing him.

He denies it but he surely had plans for a 3rd movie with the joker especially when you consider he setup the joker in batman begins and how the joker wasnt given a definitive end he probably wasnt making it up as he went along.

Sure the dark knight rises isnt perfect but its a damn good film and an end to a outstanding trilogy. How many people managed to accomplish such a feat Copolla couldn't, Raimi couldnt, Matrix couldnt. I dont count marvel as that is its own thing. Only other trilogies that delivered till the end I can think of are LotR and the original star wars. These movies will be and deserve to be celebrated for a long time.&&Probably the best individual performance in a film that I can recall. Not a massive movie buff--I'm a huge fan, but not a critic by any means--but Ledger was dynamite. It's the one that immediately comes to mind if you asked me who has the most memorable individual performance. &&This should be obvious to anyone who has seen The Dark Knight. &&I read this as ""Heath Ledger Plans to Return as the Joker"" and got excited, then confused, then sad&&While I enjoy Marvel movies more as they're consistently entertaining than I do DC which is *very* hit and miss, Dark Knight and specifically Heath's performance, cemented it as my favorite comic book movie. &&Damn!

But his performance will always be remembered as one of the all time greats in the greatest superhero movie of all time. &&You just know that his Career was going to take off. He was going to be a leading man in countless movies and maybe even get himself a Star. He deserved so much better than to get what he got.&&I did not know that. Damn I would have loved to see him as joker again.&&The titanic planned to make port too.&&The Dark Knight to me was one of the greatest films ever made. Just to show he can Batman rolls to Hong Kong with a sick capture scene to bring a criminal to justice, and that's not even probably one of the top 5 scenes from the movie.&&I thought it was already quite well known that the Joker was intended to be the 'judge' in Rises, and was replaced with Crane?

Or is that just an urban legend?&&This hurts. Badly. I will now drink and cry.&&This is a clickbaity article. It is just his sister rejecting the idea that playing The Joker pushed Ledger to the edge. I am sure Ledger would have returned if asked but there was no plans for the third film or his return. Nolan was focused on Inception after The Dark Knight wrapped and didn't start writing Rises until after Ledger died. &&I thought I read somewhere that the Joker was intended to have a big part in the final movie.&&Ledger vs letto ledger wins&&Maybe he still plans on returning. For all we know his religion allows him to reincarnate.&&Maybe he still can..... /r/deepfakes&&I’m sure he planned a lot of shit&&[removed]&&Curious as to whether BANE would still have been part of TDKR. & if so, the dynamic w/ Heath's Joker would be very interesting. &&I would've loved a killing joke movie with health ledger in it. That would've been amazing&&Probably planned on waking up the  extra day too&&That sounds incredible. A long Joker monologue of him pushing Bat's buttons whilst still giving him valuable information about how to take Bane down. It'd be a perfect way to continue to develop their relationship of always being at odds with one another, but Joker wanting to be Batman's ""big bad"".&&That’s actually awesome &&>I once read someone’s concept of Joker being the Hannibal lecter character with Batman interviewing him in Arkham trying to figure out Bane.

That is amazing. Someone needs to make a comic about that or something.&&Bane and the Joker are polar opposites.  Bane and Talia have a well orchestrated plan that's taken decades of prep work. The Joker is all about introducing chaos into the world. &&[deleted]&&""me and you, we're destined to do this forever""'&&Scarecrow got to be in all 3. Why wouldn't the Joker be back? I agree this isn't surprising.

Man, I remember back in 2008 how no one could believe that was Ledger under the makeup. His talk, his walk, the eyes, everything seemed different. He really threw everything into that character. You didn't have to like the movie to appreciate that level of acting and had he not passed I think he still would have won the awards he received for the role.&&The 3rd movie should have been based on Arkham Asylum. Joker takes over the prison from the inside and Batman has to go in and face all the villains he put away over the years. That graphic novel is a great look at the idea that Batman is/was always as insane as all his foes. That is the movie I wanted.&&Argh - I wish I didn't read this, this is the movie I wish Rises was (and probably would have been).&&When I first saw The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, I wasn't aware that Heath Ledger had died so I fully expected to see him in it.

My imagination after seeing the trailer was that The Joker would side with Batman because destroying Gotham isn't what he wants at all. Gotham is a cesspool of criminal activity and he'd never want to destroy that. Plus Bane and Talia believe they are the 'good guys' going in line with the League of Shadows code of conduct, the Joker loved the fact he was the bad guy. It really would've been great to see something like that.&&The story would've needed major changes to include The Joker along with Talia and Bane. I wonder if Nolan would have made more than three if Ledger had lived.&&I really don't want this comment to spur a discussion on the sequel trilogy, but with that being said imagine what Return of the Jedi could've been had Spielberg been allowed to direct and Gary Kurtz stayed on as a producer.

EDIT: What have I done?&&Yeah I always thought that if ledger came back we'd probably see Nolan's version of Harley and maybe jgl take a crowbar for his troubles...&&I would’ve like to have seen Darren Aronofsky’s Wolverine movie&&See mine is the Smokey and the Bandit sequel where Jackie Gleeson played both Smokey ***and*** the Bandit!!!&&*whispers* imagine how different a movie suicide squad would have been with heath ledger’s joker in it&&Suicide Squad with Ledgers Joker, Harleen's actual origin, and a servicable plot.&&Yeah. I honestly hated *Rises*, which maybe be an unpopular opinion. Reminded me a bit too much of Spiderman 3 with how much was going on. &&You had plans and look where that got you &&Yeah but Joker is the king of plans, that little speech was just more planning/manipulating.&&And that hot girl also died.&&Apparently the original plan was for the third movie to center around Joker's trial. Would have loved to see that.&&I heard that Alan Rickman (along with everyone else) was planning to do Galaxy Quest 2 when he died. This is just that all over again.&&Hey Jimmy Fallon!&&[In case anyone needs an example of that](https://youtu.be/qtsNbxgPngA)&&[deleted]&&re-watch as in like the 50th time&&https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/51ce61e2e4b0d911b44a47f7/1372482090162/&&Trilogies are a real challenge, it's either good or bad, and if you can get a good last movie then you are a goddamn great filmmaker&&I'm sure the ""judge"" of that scene in TDKR was going to be the Joker. It ended being Crane because there was no other option.&&Toy Story.&&> It was a rollercoster first he was cast and we were all like this guy is the joker wtf

This! I remember this as well. Everybody hated him. [Here are some examples](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VzH6twbXfKo/U5Qs5uz6ErI/AAAAAAAAC5Y/SW3sN8u2mIU/s1600/Heath+Ledger+Casting+Joker+Batman.png)&&[deleted]&&DC had higher highs and lower lows than than MCU&&hit and miss and miss and miss and miss and miss and miss and miss and miss and hit and...&&There are dozens of superhero movies at this point and Leger's Joker is **by far**the best villian. I can't even think of one that comes close.&&He was already a household name years before TDK. Such a damn shame. I just can't think of any contemporary actors that match up to him in terms of acting ability, diversity of roles, and overall fearlessness. &&Oh shit, did Ledger not get a star? Huh. Do they ever grant them posthumously?&&I don't really know why this is surprising to people 10 years later. They ended it really open ended for him to come back, especially with his ""you and I are destined to do this forever"" line, and it's also well documented that the third movie was supposed to be about his trial. &&I think a version of the third film that featured the joker was never fully realised so I don't think it's as simple as ""Crane replaced him"". It probably was completely different.&&Urban legend, nothing more. The third Batman movie would have been COMPLETELY different, if Heath Ledger didn't die.&&The script hadn't been written, but it's very possible that things had been discussed prior to the death.  I always thought of Crane's appearance as a 'If Heath was alive, that would be him' and I kinda just always assumed that's how Nolan wanted us to take it.  

I don't think it was recast or rewritten, I've always just assumed it was a nod - of sorts.&&Yeah, such is slashfilm. I used to really enjoy their articles, and they might still be good, but I unbookmarked the website because of the manipulative titles.&&Letto’s Joker looks like someone who was a fan of Heath Ledgers joker. Lol&&I'm not sure if you like video games, but the Arkham series does just this. You can get all three under $50 total and I promise you, you won't leave your house for a weekend. 

Mark Hamil does the Jokers voice in all three and it is some of the best voice acting out there. And that includes movies&&It's kind of what I worry about it movies about batman. You'd need a terrific joker and multiple movies to really establish him as the ""big bad"" or ultimate adversary to Batman. Like how should DC every approach that and attempt to top Heath ledgers' Joker? I don't know, I'm probably just rambling but I mean, if he'd gotten multiple movies to show his Joker, it would have been great. &&Then at the end Bane is defeated but the Joker escapes somehow? &&The Long Halloween, but they use Calendar Man &&But the joker does do a lot of careful planning to cause that chaos, regardless of what he says. You can't just blow up a hospital on a whim. Everything he does is planned out to a tee&&Scarecrow was still used in TDKR. Joker probably would have been in a similar role, or perhaps even assisted in the police getting released, because, y'know, fuck Bane if he thinks that *he's* the one who's going to kill the bat.&&""Why so serioussss"" was the biggest ""meme"" back then. It was all everyone said in high school when that came out. There was even a huge facebook event where kids taking AP tests would draw a huge joker smile with huge letters that said ""why so serious"". (Any markings with slashes were omitted from scoring so it only fucks with the graders).&&I recall the main talking point when DKR came out was that it was inferior largely due to the complete revamp necessary to write the Joker out of it. &&Best live action joker ever. Mark Hamill is the best animated Joker &&You just couldn't let me go could you?&&They probably didn’t originally intend for that part to make me cry, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t loosen the waterworks a little. &&That choked me up when i saw it in the theater.&&This line really sold me the idea of him being an entity. Something deep down in Batman knew he was right, they need eachother, and Batman will never kill him and the Joker will never succeed in killing him&&That made me so sad when I watched the movie. I just winced, realizing that they'd obviously planned for Heath to come back. &&I think it's one of the best examples of acting ever, period. I'm not a huge Batman fan or anything, but it was just plain ridiculous how great it was. It was like 1% Ledger and 99% a character. He blew past Bale and Hardy, two of the best actors around. That says so much&&I always felt like the Joker was meant to be doing what Scarecrow does in Rises. Probably a slightly expanded version but basically that as a cameo felt right.&&> the idea that Batman is/was always as insane as all his foes

Batman is perfectly sane. Its just that he likes to dress up and pretend to be a billionaire named Bruce Wayne sometimes.&&I think that point is hammered home enough in TDK.&&You can't really fault Rises for what it was. I still enjoyed it immensely, but things had to change. &&Thing is, if Joker had been in it my gut says Bane is a henchman (more so the  he was) and no Talia. Also I think it turns out Joker was affiliated with the league of shadows instead. It would explain his abilities and desire for chaos.&&Hmm. I think joker did want to destroy it. But he wanted to break it's soul first. I don't think he REALLY was a criminal at all. I think he was an anarchist / terrorist who used crime as a means to an end.&&I mean the story went through major changes to cut out the Joker and fit Talia and Bane. Maybe not major because nothing was written but Nolan is on record as saying his plan for 3 was with The Joker.&&I guarantee David Lynch's Return of the Jedi would've given me nightmares as a kid.&&I’ve heard David Lynch was wanted to direct ROTJ. Could you imagine? I would have LOVED to see what Lynch would do with the property, he’s one of my favourite directors. &&Was this a serious thing?  I've not heard this specifically before.&&Like what ant man could have been with Edgar Wright&&Would've been crazy, I definitely feel that RotJ is among the weakest 3 Star Wars movies&&Think of a day where we could access ""alternate"" timelines and universes, and then access all sorts of different versions of movies/TV shows/songs/books where the creators made different decisions or had lived/died instead. Companies in the pop culture business would make a ton of money just milking that for all it's worth.

And then Reddit and message boards would have even more never-ending conversations...&&There was some great fan art of Brittany Murphy as Harley Quinn that 100% sold me. That and Neil Patrick Harris as the riddler.&&I don't think it would've been that different. The whole movie sucked. Leto was like, the 30th worst thing. Even Ledger couldn't have saved that.&&I don't think its unpopular at all.  I think it probably gets more criticism than it deserves at times but it was a very flawed movie.  I think it didn't get the full thought process after getting derailed by the death of Heath.&&that movie had plot holes so big not even Bane could climb out of them&&And you know your family would have turned out better if you went with her&&Also she was planning on returning as the Joker&&and she was loaded&&And she wanted a three some&& Bye bye, Miss chair model lady&&I imagine it would’ve been Joker in the courtroom while a bunch of crazy shit happens around Gotham and Batman has to use his detective skills (finally) in order to find out whether Joker is behind it all or not. Goddamnit, man. I wish you hadn’t told me this. &&Do you mean in Scarecrow’s court? &&Wonder if they’d reveal his name. Though most likely he’d plead insanity as a John Doe and end up in Arkham. &&> I heard that Alan Rickman (along with everyone else) was planning to do Galaxy Quest 2 when he died.

Amazon was going to do a movie before he died. Now they've decided they're going to do a [TV series instead](https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/18/galaxy-quest-amazon-tv-series-back-on/)&&According to Sam Rockwell it was Tim Allen that shut it down because he was busy with Last Man Standing. 

And then yeah, Rickman passed.&&That interview was so awkwardly fun &&This whole thread has been pushing me towards it but you reminding me of the subtle brilliance baked into how he delivered that tiny throwaway line is my breaking point. Rewatching.&&One of my favourite wee bits is when he gatecrashes the party Wayne hosts for dent and he picks up the champagne throws out the contents and drinks an empty glass. Dunno why but that always sticks with me &&This is painful to look at now. &&Wow. This is actually motivating. So many people counted him out and had zero respect for his acting ability. They were proven very wrong. 

Lol at “ I was hoping Johnny Depp got the role” &&I'll admit. I was wrong then too.&&Wow this is amazing, I was too young to care about who actors we're and didn't realize there was such resentment with this casting choice. But I sure as hell knew who Heath Ledger was when I walked out of that movie.&&Ah, classic fanboy cringe.

&&[deleted]&&Obese 50 year old Mark Hamil should do it because he sounds like him.&&[deleted]&&""I was hoping Johnny Depp would get the role""

You can go straight to hell sir. 

Also makes you realize how controversial brokeback mountain was at the time. &&I’d be willing to bet that every one of those people referring to him as a “gay cowboy” never actually saw Brokeback Mountain.&&""And now begins the fall of the Batman series""

...as if Batman Forever and Batman & Robin didn't exist. &&Lord of the Rings and Toy Story are the only ones I can think of that pulled that off. &&Hey, Cillian Murphy isn't a bad replacement&&I never thought about it, but you’re probably right. At least, it would have been a neat Easter egg.&&Wasn’t there a massive re-write after Ledger died? If I remember correctly, Nolan and his brother Johnathan scrapped much of the treatment they had outlined. While I like the idea of it being the Joker instead of the Scarecrow in that scene, I feel like Heath would’ve had a MUCH bigger role, if not be the sole villain role in the film.&&Add the Bourne trilogy, Captain America and the modern Planet of the Apes too.&&*""I won't kill you because you're just too much fun""*

Perfect&&Marvel is like a fast-food burger, you kinda always get the same shit with a few positive surprises every now and then. DC films are like homemade burgers by an unexperienced cook, sometimes it's complete trash but sometimes it's fucking gold. &&Not many higher highs, and a lot of lower lows. &&What's the second hit&&A star like a walk of fame star? Because that doesn’t mean anything. You just have to pay for it and they will put it in. &&Also, Christopher Nolan had openly said that they planned on having the Joker return for the third movie.&&Oh yeah, I just meant at script outlining point.&&Oh well, time to go and sit in the shower and dwell on things that will never be. (sniff)&&The most annoying part is the second most upvoted comment in this thread is a dude literally making up a plot and saying it is what Nolan had planned. &&Show me again, grandfather&&I mean, Joker is a fan of Joker. He has a car with his face on it, a helicopter with his face on it, and spent potentially millions of dollars on making fish have his face.

Leto got a lot of hate but his Joker looking like a Joker fan is absolutely in character.&&Obviously you top that with a Joker that’s shirtless half the time covered in tattoos!&&That's the tragedy of it I think. Ledger had this amazing Joker and now every Joker that follows is going to be held to his standard and compared to him. I wish we'd gotten more of him.&&I don't think the current DC run will ever get anything like that down. To really develop a long-running and deep relationship between two characters, that needs to be one of the focus points and it needs at least a few films built around it. This is not what the DCEU has set out to do, or even planned to do; it's a project centered around building a franchise - they don't have the time (or interest, I presume) to slow down and do some proper long-term character building. What matters is churning out sequel after sequel. It's in DC's current interest to build a franchise that can rival Marvel (which is not looking good at all), not to tell good and mostly self-contained stories. 

For this reason I'm waiting for the extended cinematic universe craze to blow over and DC be done with their attempt at a superhero ensemble franchise, because as long as that trend is around, we're pretty much devoid of character-focused films whose main point is not to set up multiple sequels.&&Yep, he needs to look like he's a maniac who will do anything spontaneous. Just like Batman needs to look scary (to the villians). It's their perception molding. &&I remember my teacher saying that doing that was an instant fail and that some students the previous year got in trouble for doing ""This is sparta"".&&It kinda goes makes sense with the grounded tone they carried throughout the movies. Think of the Joker like Charles Manson. Do you really think the justice system will allow a 1% chance of him escaping to wreak havoc again? No. I believe official canon says he was locked up in Arkham and was the only inmate there. Everyone else was locked in Black Gate and escaped when Bane attacked. Far as I know Arkham was untouched. When Batman ""died"" he probably committed suicide, no longer having any purpose in life. 

That said, a quick throwaway line about the Joker's status wouldn't have hurt. Maybe like Gordon asking if the Joker is still locked up and his cops reassuring him he is. Or Bane and his mercenaries are walking down the cellblocks of the most violent Gotham criminals. They pause in front of the Joker's (marked as ""Unknown""). One of his men moves to open it but Bane stops him, knowing full well the kind of chaos the Joker could bring to their operation, and moves on. &&He died about six months before TDK was even finished and released, and according to the Nolans, they didn't give much thought to the follow-up until after the movie had come out. Christopher Nolan went right into filming and doing Inception, which is probably when his brother and anyone else started seriously going into possible ""third movie"" ideas.

Now, they could be just saying things too and really meant to have him in a follow-up, and that would make sense considering Scarecrow even showed up for a brief scene in TDKR. I wouldn't doubt that having Joker re-emerge with the Arkham criminals could have been a perfect way of bringing him into the third movie somehow. But whether or not those plans were developed remain another question. And the Nolans have more or less said that they didn't give serious thoughts to the third film until long after Heath had passed on.&&I'm not sure that Reddit is prepared for such a controversial opinion&&He made the Joker look like some real-life pure evil spirit who just takes possession of actors, instead of them playing it. Kinda like the that eerie Joker entity in The Dark Knight II series, or the one in Batman Beyond. He just appears out of nowhere... He doesn't even need a backstory.&&For Batmans, we generally dont break them out to categories like that. Will Arnett is a distinct Batman in his own right and gets ranked with all the others. 

For Jokers its Ledger > Hamill > Nicholson > Romero >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Leto&&Cameron monogan from shameless is the live action version of the Arkham series joker. He's insanely good.&&**I WISH I KNEW HOW TO QUIT YOU**&&Around release time, Nolan said there was one part of the film that is super hard for him to watch because of Ledger's death, and I assume it's that line.&&It gutted me at the midnight show. 

Honestly, his death at the time didn't affect me any more or less than any other celebrity death. Sad, but I didn't really feel it.

But at that line, I realized four things simultaneously- that I had vastly underestimated his ability when he was alive, that I was watching an all time great performance, that this was likely the last scene in that performance, and that he would never have a chance to do it again.

It unexpectedly hit me pretty hard.&&And it was *Heath fucking Ledger.* He had done Brokeback Mountain at that point but plenty of people, myself included, still thought of him as barely being out of his teenage romcom stage in terms of his acting ability. That was the thing that was most impressive to me. Not only was he the best on screen Joker of all time, but his casting was totally left field. People were pissed about it until that first pic got released and then we were all like “...Oh.”&&It was so good that it felt awkward when Heath Ledger looked like Heath Ledger during the mayor assassination scene.&&Bruce Wayne is just the persona that is used for structural reform. It's just another aspect to fighting crime; Batman takes away the crime that's too late to prevent, Bruce Wayne prevents it from forming in the first place through social investment.&&Not particularly insane honestly&&True but it's not the typical ""one bad day"" storyline we are hoping to see.

Imagine a Batman film taking place during one, long, awful night like the Arkham graphic novel (also the games do that)&&Rises had to follow The Dark Knight. By comparison it's garbage. They could have put a Batman title card on Citizen Kane and people still would say ""eh... It wasn't the Dark Knight.""

Rises was really good. Not really really really good like the Dark Knight.

Edit: Is the concept of an analogy lost on a lot of you? I'm not saying Citizen Kane is any of the following: the best movie of all time, the worst movie of all time, comparable to the Dark Knight etc... Let me know if I'm missing anything here. The point was to make an analogy for how DK is a film that is received as so good that anything else following it would not be able to be held to that high of a standard. 

Citizen Kane and the Nolan Batman trilogy are not in the same ballpark. They're not even the same fucking sport.&&I love the last hour and a half of TDKR, the first half is meh. I get chills every time I watch Gordon figure out who Batman is.&&I really like the Joker [was in the military and had PTSD theory](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-awesome-theories-that-totally-change-famous-characters) though &&I thought I read somewhere that he was going to be the one presiding over the sentencing hearings instead of Crane&&> Hmm. I think joker did want to destroy it. But he wanted to break it's soul first. 

That’s more along the lines of Bane’s character motives rather than the Joker’s. As the joker says multiple times in his movie, he is an agent of chaos acting without a real motive or plan other than to incite chaos. One of his quotes in the move is something like “Do I really look like a guy with a plan? I’m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn’t know what to do if I caught it! I just do things.”&&Yeah. I really think his heart wasn't in it because of Ledger's death.&&Have it play out roughly the same. Bane and Talia want their plan to go ahead. Joker disagrees with the plan, doesn’t want them to ruin the fun. The disagreement turns into an all out war for Gotham. Batman has back broken by Bane in the midst of it all. Joker’s crew v Bane’s army.

It’d be fucking awesome seeing the Joker laughing whilst getting pummelled by Bane whilst stabbing his ankles or something vicious.&&Now, *that* is the alternate timeline I've always to see. Some lynchian depiction of Jedi dream sequences sound dope af.&&Palpatine kills Luke... Who comes back as an ultra-powerful Force entity that splits a boob-looking Death Star in two, and the whole Empire is wiped out.

Then a new sun rises. And all the Rebels have Force powers now. And some Polish guy is being heard from a gramophone.

Then Darth Vader is seen floating alone in deep space, and he says ""Blue Harvest"".

End credit.&&Heres a trailer of your nightmare

Everything else is perfect and even the Ewoks I don't mind.&&I like NPH, but I feel you know exactly who you’re going to get when he’s in a role. I don’t think he would’ve been a good fit for Nolan’s films. &&Something like [this] (https://heatona.deviantart.com/art/Crazy-for-You-311921766), and [this] (https://heatona.deviantart.com/art/You-Touch-Him-You-Die-208529863)?&&Oh man, I never imagined Brittany Murphy as Harley Quinn! She would have been PERFECT (I'm imagining her role in Sin City as a fine example of beautiful/crazy)!&&I think leto was the worst thing but his screen time was too small to really change anything. &&Ledger’s Joker would completely not fit in the DCEU, and I couldn’t see him with a Harley Quinn at all. So he wouldn’t help I.T all&&It would’ve been interesting, though. Imagine it:

“Let me help you with that”

*pushes a button; Slipknot’s head explodes*

“You all work for me now”&&I still enjoyed it, however it's fair to say that, as well as having *objective* flaws, it also suffered from the fact that it was following from the Dark Knight, and therefore was always going to suffer in comparison.&&It's definitely my least favorite of the three, but it still lands above every other Batman movie outside of Nolan's trilogy... well, except for Lego Batman.&&and bane was a big guy

did i do the reference gud&&What plot holes? How did Bruce get back into Gotham?

That was the book with The Mist in it.&&I imagine it also playing out a little like Silence of the Lambs, where either the Joker has set it all in motion or has some unique insight in to how to stop it, and Batman has several interrogation scenes in which they spar psychologically and ideologically....at least until Batman inevitably solves Gotham's problems with his bat fists.

I remember coming out of PoTC, thinking, ""I really wish the next Joker would have as much boldness and creativity as Depp just displayed"". I eventually got my wish, but I certainly never expected it out of Heath. &&Well, at least you admit it.  I don't keep up with movies before they're released, but I guarantee you I would have thought he was a bad casting choice had I known about it.  And I would have been very freaking wrong.&&Tbf I remember *everyone* being like wtf when he was cast. It was a role unlike any he had before, plus he was only really well known to a lot of people for brokeback mountain so was considered 'the gay actor' by many.&&Yup he certainly proved all of those people wrong.&&Crispin Glover was born for this role !!!&&Yeah, holy shit. I really forgot how much homophobia there was just 10 years ago.&&If James Cameron wrote and directed Terminator 3 than that would have been one as well.

They said the did it out of respect for Ledger, and I’m okay with that. &&The best follow-up for the joker was for bane to be moving through Arkham, releasing prisoners and reaches a cell, stops whoever was about to open it and says... 'No.  Not him.  Too unpredictable'.  The camera flows through the door window, around the prisoner to reveal Heath's joker.  Patiently sitting, waiting for his next moment. 

No matter how much of a badass bane was, no matter how toe to toe he could go against Batman, even Bane is scared of the Joker.  &&Could have been cool but honestly I never thought about what the joker was doing in TDKR until now.

I always figured that even if they had originally planned on bringing him back it wouldn’t be the next movie anyway. They would draw it out so that the hype would be huge when he finally came back. &&Ugh, your second scenario was the lazy plot direction the Gi Joe sequel took. &&So brave of him.&&Damaged. &&Broke my keyboard at the statement.&&While we are stating our controversial opinions I'd like to put it out there that water is wet. &&Why are people so insecure about having popular opinions?&&Moon is an underrated gem.&&That wasn't a boy lol.

That's weird... also his sister has been the woman Batman loved.&&That or the sequence with the Joker in a bodybag.&&WELL MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE A KNIGHTS TALE&&I remembered being ready to see cringe when Ledger's Joker would show up in trailers. Imagine my surprise when I was legit...like grossed out, creeped out, unsettled...what a fucking performance.&&I'll never be able to appreciate his casting enough, as I was 13 when the movie came out and that was the first time I had ever heard his name, much less seen him act. &&Yep. I had my doubts too when I heard his casting. But then I saw the 6 minute IMAX preview when I saw a different movie and I was hooked. So fucking good. 

Another actor that did rom coms and surprised the shit out of me with True Detective is Matthew Mconahay (spelling is wrong idgaf). &&I remember when I heard ledger was going to be the joker my first thought was ""you mean the guy from A Knight's Tale? Well this is gonna suck""&&I wasn't even supportive when the pic came out to be honest. I was like, ""oh god, eh got some teeny bopper trying to do an edgy Marilyn Manson thing. This sucks.""

Even the trailers didn't have me convinced. 

That first scene where he walks in to the mafia meeting and does the pencil trick... holy shit. I couldn't pick my jaw up off the floor for the rest of the time he was on screen.&&What’s this exact graphic novel called this sounds amazing. &&[deleted]&&My feelings exactly. It was such a tall order to follow TDK. Anything was going to seem subpar by comparison. But I fucking loved TDKR.&&I completely forgot that even happens&&Man I miss cracked, it kinda went downhill &&Makes sense. Went on to read the Jack Sparrow theory which wasn't bad either. The Joker sure seemed to have military experience, but we've seen the military guy turned bad guy before so leaving it out would be a good idea.

Thing is do they go ahead with a movie to explore Joker's roots? The mysterious past thing works so well letting the fans fill in their own theories. One of the silly things with Nicholson's Joker was his backstory. Leo DiCaprio was supposedly being considered for the role in a Joker movie. How did the Joker really get those scars? How is he always able to stay one or more steps ahead of Batman? What drove him mad? Perhaps leaving it a mystery is best.&&Could you imagine the outrage if you walked in to see TDKR and were dickteased with 2 minutes of Ledger Joker in a role that doesn't suit his character or have any explanation at all? It's perfect for Scarecrow. Leave it be.&&Yea I think I remember reading that too but it was more fanficy&&The Joker is a major bullshitter. Every time he tells people how he got his scars, it's a different story.&&Right he does say that.... after he denies kidnapping and killing Rachel. He was lying. That was the point of the scene, that you can't trust a single thing he says. Here's a little easter egg for you: when joker let's two face point a gun against his head. Watch his thumb, he's blocking the hammer. He had no intention of letting two face kill him.  Joker DOES have plans. Big ones. And he's always two steps ahead.&&Yeah this is kinda what I always pictured. The last act could have Batman actually having to team up with Joker cause Bane and his army were just too powerful. It would have been amazing, maybe even topping TDK&&You know who else they offered ROTJ too? David fucking Cronenberg. There are two incredible alternate timelines with batshit insane versions of ROTJ and I want to live there instead. &&what if Disney from the start gave Star Wars to Tarantino and gave him unlimited range &&Sheev delivering Man From Another Place dialogue is fucking haunting&&“THATS NOT HOW THE MOTHERFUCKIN FORCE WORKS!”&&This is hurts the most for me &&RotJ has my favourite space battle scenes, because it was a full on space battle. I enjoyed the force awakens and The Last Jedi, but I am tired of skirmishes. I want to see full on space battle worthy of a galaxy with million of planets. Not just 3 cruisers vs 5 star destroyers but thousands vs thousands. Rogue One at least ended with a great fight scene with more pilots then TFA and The Last Jedi, though the Resistance is supposed to be small. So I can't wait for 9 which can't come soon enough &&I don't know, gone girl showed me some depth there. &&I think another villan with an army of faceless drones (can't let the kids see blood) and a pile of garbage circling the sky was the worst part.&&I felt the first half of TDKR was more or less on par with the Dark Knight. It started hemorrhaging quality once Batman's back broke and the city was taken over by Bane. &&Lego Batman was so fucking good. 

Fuck the Academy. &&I do love the Dark Knight Rises for the epic quote.

**Catwoman: Come with me. Save yourself. You don't owe these people any more. You've given them everything.**

**Batman: Not everything. Not yet.**&&WITH NO SURVIVORS &&More like plot stupidity, but how does openly robbing the stock exchange work at all?

How does Batman arrive by crossing the ice that is so thin it's being used as a death sentence?

Why does Batman spend hours during a time critical crisis drawing a bat symbol of fire? And then still chooses to appear from the ice?!?&&For the record, there actually is a passage of time between him getting out of the pit and returning to Gotham. The movie just does an awful job of showing it.&&And you see him at your high school reunion and he tells you how he found it odd she shouted out your name longingly during sex.&&And it was the last name she said when she died. &&Had this happen to me, it is odd when I met the little kid. 

I have kids of my own, and didn't name any of them after myself. 

My mom's friends daughter, had a crush on me in highscool. One day after a four year FB hiatus, I got on for about two weeks. The last conversation I had was about how we are destined to be together and such. By the way, this is after nearly a decade of our own separate lives, not speaking. 

I said thanks for the namesake, but I think it is time to squash all those hopes. I was engaged to my most recent babymama and didn't want to be a part of the craziness. I've logged into FB once or twice since, I don't need anything from there on the reg.&&Please stop, you guys are hurting my heart.&&This is kind of what I had in mind, too. But I figured people probably wouldn’t go for Joker helping Batman in any way. &&I don't think I have ever had a longing for a movie that will never be like this. 
A proper Dark Tower is a close second but at least I have the books to fall back on. 
(I know there are tons of comics but there are no audiobooks and thats the only way I can enjoy the written word since work/adult/baby) &&The plot sound interesting but it's 26% on RT. Is it worth watching?&&https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DIhc0Q_UMAA0K2M.jpg&&Oh my god I forgot Alan Tudyck was in A Knights Tale and now I have to rewatch it!&&*johnny deep&&TBH Depp probably would make a great joker in his heyday despite all the hate. He needs a role he can disappear into like he did Jack Sparrow before Disney drained every dollar from the carcass of that character. &&Yeah, true. I just think it’s funny in hindsight but kid me would’ve probably rooted for Johnny Depp as joker. &&I was never upset by his casting, I was inquisitive, but not upset. Fanboys don't give a shit about most movies or watch things like Brokeback Mountain (which he got nominated for) so they had no goddamn clue about his acting ability. It was arbitrary, resentment filled hate in the same vein that Dicaprio had post-Titanic/pre-Departed.&&Usually what happens when you walk on water. &&There still is - they've just crawled back into their holes nowadays&&You wrote Terminator 3?&&BY ORDAH OF THE PEAKY FOOKIN BATMAN&&I absolutely love Cillian Murphy, but Batman wouldn't be a good match for him&&It's like an homage to the Adam West batman&&LMAO that’s hilarious &&Omfg thank god for Bale.&&That reminds me of Keaton &&I see it. He got them piercing eyes and pouty lips and you can't see much else through the batman mask. &&They were definitely talking about Wonder Woman, it was a huge hit. I absolutely loved it, I thought it was terrific and have it on the same level as the first Iron Man.&&Academy Award winning Suicide Squad.&&If anything the judge role would have made more sense for Two-Face. &&*Barf*&&And let's make him say ""Hunka hunka"" for good measure &&Oh man how did I forget that wonderful addition!&&I like the addition of metal teeth for the joker. You scrap with the bat and he'll break your teeth. &&I wonder if there are other examples of a character defined by an actor's performance to such an extent.

Edit: Thanks guys, for the examples.&&If we count voice acting then Hamill had by far the best Joker IMO. &&I dont know. Maybe we were just naive or something. I remember I loved Youtube poop. So uncultured.&&**MAH BOI**

Truly the foundations for stuff like SouceFilmMaker, Vines, etc.&&I miss 2008 in general :( &&I feel like it's difficult now to find a lot of the good ones from back then...&&Yeah, my AP Gov teacher was an AP grader. She said they loved that kind of stuff. As long as it was crossed out it was removed from consideration for grading. She also said they would write especially funny things students wrote on post-it notes and put them on the entry way to the room they graded.  

I personally wrote ""~~this is sparta~~"" in a few well timed sentences  and passed just fine.&&I’m confused on how that shows respect really. If I saw anything about the joker in that movie it would make me remember Ledger and how amazing of a job he did. I would think it was paying tribute and saying that you haven’t been forgotten. && I feel like “respect” is not recasting him or trying to CG him into the movie.

But a quick line acknowledging the Joker wouldn’t have been disrespectful.

It felt weird that the entirety of Gotham forgot about him and nobody mentioned him during the huge prison break and chaos.&&At risk of blowing holes in my own logic but wouldn’t Bane just kill him? I mean the Joker only survives because Batman has a no-kill policy. Bane’s ruthless and intelligent. Why leave a loose end, one particularly as dangerous and unpredictable as the Joker, alive to potentially muck up your plans? Killing the Joker would be the safest alternative. &&Being born and molded by darkness doesn't compare to being born and molded by chaos. Chaos fucks everything up.&&Fatality.&&Cause I’m all messed up&&Currently hitting my keyboard with my other keyboard in a furious rage.

^^I ^^secretly ^^agree ^^with ^^him ^^tho&&Water can’t be wet&&[Water isn’t wet! ](https://youtu.be/ugyqOSUlR2A) &&Because this (and other) stock standard Reddit opinions have been stated and re-stated 2635485975384 times. How many more times do you think it needs to be said?&&You mean the Chinese accountant? Didn't notice.&&Wow, I've seen TDK countless times and I never made that connection.&&I’m not seeing where he mentioned the accountant guy in the comment above yours. Was it edited? &&If they ever do a live-action adaptation of Batman Beyond, I want Conroy to play old grouchy Mr. Wayne. &&My husband and I met him at a con and he was telling us about how he was helping out in New York at a soup kitchen on 9/11 and people realized who he was so he started talking in the Batman voice. When he told us the story, he used the phrase, ""Holy fuck, it's Batman!!"" 
Hearing Batman say ""fuck"" was a pretty neat experience. &&The man IS batman&&Which bear is best?&&I did see him on a list at #3 Don't remember where though.&&[deleted]&&He just looks like an edgy teenage hot topic version of the joker. He has ""damaged"" tattoed on his forehead in cursive, like seriously?

Ledger's joker didnt need to tell you he was an insane person to be feared, his acting showed that.&&I feel like he could play a good Joker if the movie had a good writer.&&Apparently he hasn't watch suicide squad yet and they left out a ton of video footage of him. I think he got the short of the stick and don't feel he was able to show us the true Joker&&Dwight from The Office was a better Joker than Leto.&&Rainn Wilson was a better Joker than Leto&&He's pretty convincing. And his facial features remind me more of the comic book image of the joker than the other live actors.&&Im pretty sure that the Jake Gyllenhaal thing is nothing but rumours getting repeated. The DCEU has had so many rumours about casting or storylines that are never true. 

Like when Scott Eastwood was playing an undercover Dick Grayson in Suicide Squad. Or when Earths Green Lantern would appear in BvS played by Chris Pine. Or when Commissioner Gordan was dead. No wait hes retired. No wait hes still the Commish but he calls Batman Bruce. And hes Brian Cranston. No wait Brian Cranston is Brainiac. No, Lex Luthor. And he'll have his powersuit. Ok no but he'll go bald from krytonite radiation. Ok, its Jesse Eisenberg. But he'll make Bizarro Superman.&&I hadn't thought about that one before and that seems awful also.&&Technically it was a trash bag but your point still stands, very sad scene to watch in retrospect&&No joke, I fucking love that movie lol&&Instead Oscar winner Jared Leto was the cringe fest joker&&I think it's ""almost"" comparable to Efron, today.&&Hey that was a damn good movie. &&I had the same reaction to that pencil scene. Almost nothing shocks me in a movie, and that scene is the only one that had me say ""holy shit"" out loud in a theater. Not like, scared, but like ""wow did that just happen? this guy is great with this character""&&Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth&&Oh boy you're in for a treat. Weird thing is that the best part of it is the lettering on the dialogue!&&I feel the two Matrix movies really go deep into the lore of the universe, I don't understand why people hate them.&&It really has, hasn't it? I used to look forward to really interesting articles about theories like this and now it's just photoplasties everyday &&I miss crack too. But yeah, it really tends to make everything go downhill. &&I actually like they never went into his roots. But then again, his first ""Do you want to know how I got these scars?"" I was actually grumpy during that scene. I didn't want to know his history, and it being a little sob story was.... bleh...

Then the second one, a completely different story I think was EXACTLY the point that sold me that Joker.&&Eh he takes his hand off the hammer the rest of the scene though...&&Wow, the little details you never notice!&&Like it says in the comments of the gif /r/Stillwatch posted, he removes the fingier after that scene. So I don't think he plans ahead like you say.&&My heart&&Imagine a Cronenberg Jabba. His facial animations would have been freaky.&&But those universes might not have KOTOR 2 in them.

That's not a chance I'm willing to take.&&Take a seat motherfucker&&> Sheev

God I hate that.&&“THEN TELL THAT TO KANJI CLUB MOTHERFUCKER!” &&He isn't bad. You are just never immersed in his performance. He always sounds like Barney. And that takes you out of the movie sometimes.&&I don't think it's a question or not if he has range, as we can all agree he's very talented, but he does do a particular role well enough to be deemed a reliable asset in Hollywood--being a lead in a popular sitcom for 9 years can do that. Consistency in revenue and consumer positivity over a sustained period of time is worth its weight in gold.

I'd love to see him move further away from his roots and act more against his type, I thought an interesting example was Count Olaf, which he made genuinely sinister at times. Imagine NPH in a david lynch movie eating chocolate moose in the nude, while sitting on a cow in the countryside. &&To be honest, I don't think I could name a worst part, because the whole damn movie was a front to back disaster.

The best part was probably that the first half hour or so was so bombastically off-the-rails terrible that it was almost interesting to watch such a masterclass in bad filmmaking.&&i have an (unsubstantiated) theory that Nolan REALLY wanted to make a movie about a modern day french revolution in New York, and then when he had to make Rises he just basically adapted that idea into a batman framework

i think rises is two halves of a good movie, they just dont click together very well&&The ending with Gordon's eulogy from A tale of two cities was my favorite part though.&&My favorite quote is ""This isn't a caaarrrrrrrrrrr.""

It's just that in true Joker fashion, he was playing an angle.&&One of the best movies I've ever watched, [up until they ruined it in the last 5 minutes.](#spoiler)&&It is... Not sure why it's a 26%, deserves at least 65%&&First half is amazing, second half is good, last 5-10 minutes ruin the whole thing. Still worth a watch. &&So is Robert Baratheon, Vision, and Lydia from Breaking Bad.&&I feel like there’s only one response to forgetting Tudyck’s role in A Knight’s Tale: YOUR ENTRAILS WILL BE YOUR EXTRAILS! PAIN! LOTS OF PAIN!&&You mean crawled into the white house?&&The makeup was great though. &&Yeah there’s even an animated series episode where two face develops a third personality called the Judge&&In the comic that scene is based on (the Gotham: Cataclysm saga), it is Two-Face.&&Wouldn't have made sense based on him dying in the previous movie and them using his death as the basis for some of the events in the 3rd movie.&&But then the director says he didn’t think of the grill that way, and that this “fan theory” is really cool... He didn’t plan shit.&&Specially considering Batman probably ruined his teeth after Joker killed Robin.&&Hannibal Lecter maybe? Sean Connery with James Bond? Yeah I don't really know.&& In jest: Arnold as Mr. Freeze

In seriousness:  I tried to think of someone not in comics but maybe Hugh Jackman as Wolverine?&&I still like YTPs even though I rarely watch them (the ones without memes, I mean). I find that a lot of the funny short little edited videos that get passed around on social media and Vine are just successors to YTP. &&I miss not worrying about ageing :(&&Walrusguy, Deepercutt, Kroboproductions/Dikekike. Those were my guys back in the day. Just look for them. &&I would imagine Jokers strategy to fuck with Bat is crafted around the  nokill rule. He wouldn't play the same way with Bane.&&See, this is why I like *The Killing Joke*'s origin of the Joker.  He's not 'born in it' or 'molded by it'.  All it took to make the Joker is one bad day.  It makes a nice parrallel with Bruce Wayne becoming Batman.  We often look at serial killers and madmen and try to explain away their actions as a psychosis of some sort(his father beat him/ he was an orphan/ he's a 'paranoid schizophrenic'/...) but what makes the Joker so uniquely frightening and even perplexing to Batman is that there is no greater purpose or reason for his being.&&[removed]&&Man can't be hot&&Holy shit this is amazing&&But seriously, Johnny Cash made Hurt his own and it's really his song, even Trent Reznor said so.&&Yup lol he made him squeal alright.&&One chinese boi&&Yeah. He originally said something like, ""the joker even burned that pile of money with a little boy on top of it. That scene was dark.""

Why he edited it is beyond me.&&The Beyond batsuit is my favorite and I recently found a website with all of that show available for free and I was so excited &&[He tells the story here for anyone who wants to hear it](https://youtu.be/wThPHMGWZXg).

Also, *I Know That Voice* is an awesome documentary for anyone who enjoys animation and voice acting. Or is remotely interested in animation. Or has ever even watched a cartoon. Seriously, it's awesome.&&Correction, he is vengeance and the night as well. &&He even has Batman's chin. I'm somewhat surprised he never portrayed a live-action version of the character.&&I'm visualizing this. I like it.&&You've finally allowed me to articulate my thoughts on Leto's ""joker"". He really did come off like one of those wannabe joker gang members. Thank you, that shit was bugging since I watched that like a year and a half ago. &&Maybe he is. Batman has been in business for about 20 years in that cinematic world. &&Or pencilled him &&The real Joker would have used him in some elaborate scheme then left him high and dry to suffer a horrific fate worse than death.&&I honestly feel like the character design was what left the worst impression of Leto joker. If it was Leto dressed like we imagine the Joker to look I feel like a lot of people would have enjoyed his performance. &&I said it back when they released the first images of Leto-Joker: it looks like someone pretending to be The Joker, not the actual Joker. &&And a smile on his hand that he puts over his own mouth and laughs...I smell a timeless character study haha&&The Joker had less relevance in that movie than that fox had in Dora the Explorer.&&It's the Star Wars Prequels thing

Many of the actors from that could have been awesome playing those characters (and were at times), but had awful directing and dialogue (Hayden Christensen for example could have been good if the script, directing and plot were anything other than shite)&&If he had ANY part of that character design, then he doesn't deserve the role ever again.

The dude can act! Just not like a proper Joker.&&I read that, too. There was nothing good about the scenes they did use from him, and I can understand his point of view, but I can't see any of him as the joker to be palatable. He was just miscast. He was going for Neo-Jack Nicholson and what came out was Neon Pauly Shore.

Strongly recommend this as a read, if not just for the art direction alone.&&Because tonight, we dance &&The sequels are pretty out there in terms of ideas and structure, while the first is basically a perfect action movie the likes of Indiana Jones or Die Hard. I love them all, personally. &&It somewhat does. Maybe Revolution does more and I wish it went deeper, but Animatrix takes care of that. I wish that was integrated into the movies.&&I don’t hate them, but overall they just feel really rushed and clunky. Obviously I wouldn’t expect them to top the first one, but for me they never managed to capture any of the same feels that the first one had so much of. 

I also didn’t like how Morpheus was treated in the sequels. He was such a great and mysterious character who was one of the main reasons Neo realized his potential, and in the sequels he was just kind of...no one. I wish he had continued more prominent leadership role in the sequels, but they went the way of introducing other characters into the mix and sort of drown Morpheus out a bit. He still had an important role, don’t get me wrong, but it left a strange taste in my mouth.&&Yeah that site was the reason my grades tanked so hard my sophomore year of college, I’d just read articles all the time in class &&Only when you aren't doing it..&&Oh really?

It's the same as playing a song of lowering enemy stats.

I never thought to question it until just now. Anyways, how's Jenny doing?""&&Why did you say that name?&&I especially liked that part in Dark Knight where he mixes up Harvey's and Rachel's kidnap spots.  It seems like he knew batman had a thing for rachel and used that information to fuck shit up.&&Seems like that would have fucked up his duality obsession.&&Haha I believe it.

But I broke up with her to date another girl I liked who had just broken up with her bf. Amanda was a bitch and was more agressive so was pressuring me to cheat or break up with jenny and I went with it even though Jenny and I had something fantastic going. I was 16, confused, and amanda was sluttier.

Jenny was better for me and I was better for her. It likely would not have lasted into or past college anyways, but Jenny started hanging out with the wrong crowd, got into drugs, her stepdad was abusing her, she ended up leaving town to live with her dad and I think got kicked out of his house too and just had a miserable life. I feel like I could have saved her. I feel like we would have been good for each other and helped each other. She needed me as much as I needed her but I broke her heart over a fling. 

I feel like her descent into darkness was my fault. Amanda and I cheated on each other a few months later and the relationship lasted for another year carried on only by sex while I cheated with another 2 or 3 girls. I hated her and made a bunch of mistakes. 

I learned alot about what relationships should and shouldnt be and came out a better person after it all so I do not completely regret the experiences I had. But Jenny is the only girl I really regret ever hurting. &&Well, yea, he jumped off a fucking skyscraper to save her.

That said, a Transformers fan site's Twitter account claimed that the quote was taken out of context. This is apparently a full quote:

> Question: The recent announcement regarding the changes for the movies, changes for toyline plans, cancellation of the series?

> Answer: The points that Brian made about the reboot of the film franchise after Bumblebee? For sure, our team is working closely with Paramount and Machinima regarding the next chapter and the product lines associated with that. No decision is made independently from film partners, so we are part of this conversation on what’s next and when should we deliver the next thing. Our attention right now is to focus on Bumblebee [The Movie]. I think the film has come along great. We’ve seen a lot of footage, cuts, takes. Toyline looks fantastic. I think there is a lot of directions we could take, post that. There are toy concepts we are working on. Nothing stops us. You guys saw downstairs, right?  We have Cyberverse cranking. That’s coming out soon. We have Studio Series, we have Bumblebee film toyline, for Generations a new trilogy announced. Any shifts, we have to deal with it.  Either pause or  just charge head-on. This is one where we are going to collectively pause, sow for what’s the next best story is and then put a toyline around that. In no way that it distracts us.

Taking *Transformers 6* off the slate ties in with the idea that Hasbro and Paramount are going to 'pause' to consider their next move, but it doesn't confirm the 'reboot' that people have been talking about. &&At this point, it's just a 2 hour car commercial. &&I know it probably won't happen but I want the reboot to have wide steady shots of the robot battles instead of shaky cam jump cut randomness.  Also Optimus Prime's sword better come back, that was awesome.  &&Fast and transformious 6&&I'm offended that our society can handle 5 transformer movies, but not 2 modern tron movies. &&My experience with this movie series.

Transformers (2007): ""Huh, not bad. Not great either. Not sure why they threw all those tone-deaf racist and masturbation jokes into a movie designed to sell toys to 6 year olds.""

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen: ""Ohhh, so this is what happens when Michael Bay makes a movie without a script. What a huge mess.""

Transformers Dark of the Moon: ""It's better than the last one... but that's not saying much. Props to Bay for putting Alan Tudyk in it.""

Transformers Age of Extinction: ""Okay, is Bay seriously trolling us?""

Transformers The Last Knight: ""Yeah, I'm not paying to see that.""&&Time for a reboot. The Last Knight was a legit disappointment for the studio. Sure, $650m looks like a nice take but it's not good enough when the previous two movies crossed $1b. http://www.boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=transformers.htm&&Rebot or not giving the franchise to someone else would be interesting, if someone where to make a new Transformers move who would you hope it was?&&I’m a huge Transformers fan and it’s sad that there will most likely never be a good Transformers film&&Can we just have a transformers movie with no human dialogue, maybe 25 minutes of plot, and an hour and a half of giant robots fighting? 


Would it really be too much to ask?&&God just let it go, number 6? How about some original screenplays&&Even though I was big fan from the 80’s cartoons, I’ve never seen one of these movies.&&WE WANT VOLTRON&&They need to use this reboot as an opportunity to create a Hasbro Cinematic Universe.

Start with a Transformers movie.  In this new universe, Unicron and Cybertron are the same thing -- Unicron is a transformer that has managed to merge with Cybertron, becoming a planet sized intelligence.  The Autobots are a rogue group of Transformers lead by Optimus Prime who stole the All Spark and trapped Cybertron in Subspace in order to save the galaxy from Unicron's plans of galactic conquest.  The Decepticons are Unicron's Secret Police, lead by his lieutenant Megatron.  The Autobots escape to Earth, arriving in the Jurassic age (or whenever T-Rexes were around), then go into hibernation.  The Decepticons follow them -- Unicron needs the All Spark to escape Subspace -- but making the shift from Subspace to real space means the Decepticons arrive *millions* of years after the Autobots, who have been long buried in the badlands of Wyoming.

In this movie, Megatron will manage to gain control of the All Spark, reveal his intentions to use it to destroy Unicron and rule the world, and will then be defeated when his own lieutenant, STARSCREAM, betrays him and tries to get the All Spark for himself, giving Optimus the opening to save the day.

The military will naturally show up at some point in the movie, so use that opportunity to introduce Sgt. Conrad Hauser as the leader of a Special Forces strike team that gets slaughtered by the Decepticons.

Then in a post-credit scene, Hauser is being debriefed by his superiors and he tells them ""We aren't prepared for these kinds of threats. We need something different, an elite fighting force hand picked for missions far outside normal parameters.""  His superiors agree, and we see his commander holding a folder labeled ""Operation: GI JOE"" as they tell Hauser they want him to lead a new unit they are forming.  Hauser, of course, is DUKE's real name.

Next, a GI JOE movie.  COBRA has captured the ""corpse"" of a dead Decepticon and used it to create a weapon fabricator that can pump out jets, tanks, etc.  GI JOE has to stop COBRA from taking over a large portion of Eastern Europe or the like.

Then spin off a M.A.S.K. movie from GI JOE, with M.A.S.K. being a secret offshoot of the Joes program using technology developed from Transformers to create transforming vehicles, with V.E.N.OM. being a rogue COBRA cell.

Then you do huge event movie where the Transformers, GI Joes, and M.A.S.K. team-up to battle the combined forces of the Decepticons (now being lead by SHOCKWAVE, who followed slightly after Megatron in a second ship), COBRA and V.E.N.O.M., with COBRA and V.E.N.O.M. being manipulated by Shockwave into helping them create a Subspace Signal that will allow Unicron to shift Cybertron into Earth's orbit.&&They made FIVE of those movies???

It was boring.&&Beast Wars!&&Give us beast wars&&Is there a movie franchise that went from being so popular and fresh to so stale and bad like this one? The original with Shia Lebouf was no masterpiece, but I remember the CGI details of the Transformers themselves and battle scenes were great and a huge deal at the time.

I think they will reboot it guys! With an all-female transformers!&&I'd love to see what they do with the reboot, but please let them keep Peter Cullen, say what you want about the transformers movies but Peter Cullen was just as amazing as the voice of prime as he was way back in the day (although he did have to work with some shoddy dialogue)&&I had no idea there was already 5. &&It’s over.

They wanted to see how much of the same movie they each where and watched all 3 at the same time with three TV's next to each other. It was pretty hilarious/sad about just how much of the same movie it is, down to like a 5 minute window between them.&&That's why you must watch these movies with a group of friends when high.&&Doesn't matter, as long as there's an unbelievably geeky dude scoring a supermodel girlfriend who wears Daisy dukes 24/7.  At least that's what the producers think I guess..&&My son shows me a toy he got from a grandma, and informs me that it's a transformer.

""Oh yeah? What does it transform into?"" I asked.

I touched it, and his arms barely moved. His head barely moved. 

""Son, let me show you how transformers worked in my day. Check out this guy (we go to youtube to find a video). He was a *triple changer*... this toy was named astrotrain and changed from a robot... into a train.... AND into a space shuttle"".

What the fuck has happened to my Transformers?

Its head barely moved. What the fuck.
&&Also, Transfivers had a three hour runtime.  What movie needs to ever be that long?&&Yes and no. It certainly depends on if Bumblebee does well and if it does, Hasbro has stated that they would like to make more smaller budgeted films. Actually, the Cybertron Prequel movie is already in development within the current universe (though, I guess they could change that if they end up rebooting it). &&I would be all for it if they can get some good writing and a decent director. Sometimes I just want to watch giant robots fuck each other up, but would also like a decent storyline to follow. I know people are tired of these movies, but they could be a lot better, especially with the kind of budget they have to work with. &&If they reboot it and go for a Thor Ragnarok/Kung Fury esque hyper-colorful 80's inspired style, I would see it. &&I've wanted them to do this since the 2nd one... 

Michael Bay claimed that they did early tests to make the robots look like G1 and that it didn't work.

I don't believe this for a second, I still think it could work. They could update it, make it realistic and gritty, and not a clusterfuck of machine porn in slow motion across my screen.

I think they could do great stories with it, instead of all the transformers as ""robot #1, Robot #2, robot???"" In the first movie when (I think??) jazz died.. I was like ""wait, who was that?"" then I realised, I didn't give a shit.

I was a die hard Transformers fan in the 80s, collected a ton of the toys, watched every episode, collected the marvel comic, the Dreamwave comics, and a few of the IDW ones. These movies just sucked from the get go.

&&I hope so, all i want is a Transformer centric movie where humans are only minor side characters and the real meat is with the transformers&&You mean more fahking robot cahs? &&Reboot In Disguise&&I can only hope.

Also, in the second film, when Megatron is awakened and flies to Saturn, he sees Starscream and attacks him, saying that he bows to no one. Then, in the NEXT SCENE, Megatron greets the Fallen by KNEELING in front of him and says, ""Fallen, my master, etc etc etc.""

That's all I've got to say on that matter.&&[deleted]&&Was that the one with transformer heaven?

I almost choked laughing when I saw that.

Still dunno how I sat through that turd.&&That’s because they are written for Chinese audiences. Look up the box office of transformers movies in China. They are only still being made because of China. &&Oh it gets worse. 4 was so bad I promised myself never to watch 5. Then a boring day came and I did. Remember how it was a shock that aliens exist when they arrived in the first movie?

Well in 5, appearantly the knights of the round table of King Arthur were transformers, Bumblebee fought against the nazis, Galvatron is Megatron again, and it turns out Earth itself is Unicron who is sleeping dormant and we are living his body.

It's like Michael Bay really had enough of this shit after the 3rd ""I'll not return"" and just wants to break the toys so nobody can play after him either.&&That's why they were created in the '80s, to sell the toys... 

... but back then the toys changed into other shit, and it was awesome.

Most cartoons in the '80s was an attempt to sell toys - it was a great race to figure out how to do it best.

>up

Oh thank god.&&> Sometimes I just want to watch giant robots fuck each other up,

That's my sentiment with these films...until the most recent one. That was just too much of a clusterfuck that seemed to just disregard all the previous films&&Please do this. Original Transformers design. It could be amazing &&Honestly. Transformers was a product of the 80's. People love the 80's. Embrace the 80's.&&So, my kids know nothing about timelines.  They are too young to know when one movie is ""new"" and another movie is ""old"".  Everything just exists for them.  They were not very enthusiastic about the 2007 Transformers movie.  But they love the old Transformers cartoon from the 1986.

I realize the two of these are marketed to completely different demographics.  (I actually had to skip through a lot of the 2007 movie because it's obviously for teenagers).  But Hasbro is a toy company.  It would make so much more sense to reboot the series to be more targeted to younger kids.  And it wouldn't have to be ""childish"".  Transformers: The Movie had some pretty hardcore stuff in it.  Optimus Prime dies.  Star Scream is disintegrated.  There's a fairly complex plot and some heady action in there.&&[The 1986 Transformers Movie was pretty f'ing metal!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lo7JPLJUUU#t=1m30s)&&Whoever made those made those early tests must have sucked ass.

[Anyone who thinks Bayformers look better than this is out of their goddamn mind...](https://i.imgur.com/FN21trt.jpg)&&> a clusterfuck of machine porn in slow motion

This is quite possibly the most accurate and poetically succinct description of Bay's ""vision"" of Transformers.

And BTW I also 100% agree that the G1 Autobot look is completely doable in CG and Bay was probably bullshitting when he said the tests ""didn't work.""&&This x1000.  They didn’t even have a proper “More than meets the eye” intro song...come on! 

The original animated movie kicks the absolute shit out of Bay’s movies.&&YES! The first two felt like I'm watching something off /r/mechanical_gifs 

Trash can folding machine sped up and talking noises added&&I used to see their side in how the G1 designs wouldn't translate to screen.  But as anyone who has a Masterpiece figure would tell you, that argument's largely dead.


The thing I really despise about the Bayformers, is the amount of unnecessary visual noise on the robots. There are far too many lines and moving pieces, it's very distracting and plain ugly.&&Yeah I'm with ya. They definitely got carried away with how realistically detailed and precise they could make the Transformers. I remember in promotional material for 1 and 2, they kept on claiming that every part moves somewhere, it's not smoke and mirrors, and that their transformations make sense.   

Okay, cool. Devastator pretty much plateaued that by combining 5 Decepticons into one (and adding testicles ffs). Then they got strangely robo-gorey, and started mercilessly killing off Autobots (and Decepticons) we've known and loved for years in gruesome ways. Faces being ripped in half, decapitated, impaled, limbs ripped off.   

It just seemed like they became self aware of how shit the franchise had become after 2's failure and aimed for as much shock factor and mega eye-fuck CGI as possible. Despite bringing in a fucking planet into 3 and 5, it clearly has lost its monetary appeal now too.  

If they reboot, and not soft reboot, but rather clean-slate reboot, I hope they go back to G1 Transformers designs. [Like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8av8GlHBt4), but a bit more creative liberty in the design so it doesn't seem like a giant lego-man. But not as far as being a cluster-fuck mess of metal and spinning parts like they've all become.  

Not the best example since it's their Cybertron designs, but I feel like Optimus and co. in the Cybertron games was a very good mark. Simple, yet complex. Small details that can be appreciated, while still being able to make sense of the character. Just my two cents on it all.&&Just let idw write the script, keep humans out of the plot, base it on cybertron or the lost light, and give us some generations style bots. If there must be humans, make them headmasters. 

Ohand maybe some cool monsterbots. SkyLynx anyone?&&Agreed, I much prefer the fantastical elements that make it feel like some crazy epic saga of a strange alien species rather than just robots beating each other up&&Isn't that proven false by Pacific rim?  They looked a lot closer to G1&&The Last Knight was a whole new level of bad. It made me physically ill watching it. There weren't even any good fight scenes!

Edit: stupid autocorrect. Still better than TLK though!&&It's supposed to be a period film set in the 80s though, so it already would exist peripherally to the existing films.  

There shouldn't be much reason why they couldn't have it exist inside of a rebooted universe.&&Thank god. As someone [Reviewing transformers 5 every week](http://thehypetrain.podbean.com/) until the bumblebee movie comes out, I was terrified that I may have to force my friend to watch T5 every week until we *die*.  
  
So, for me, this is relieving news. &&> I think it's already too far to be canceled

Nah. Can just sell it to the Cloverfield franchise. They'll do some re-shoots and work it in some how.&&Instead of Michael bay we get Uwe Boll.&&To be fair the visuals weren't bad and some of the voice actors, such as the ones for Optimus and Megatron were good, it's just the directing and the script were shit and you can't overcome a shitty script and bad directing.&&That was the announcement last year, right?

Where'd those motorcycle chicks go? The red French car? The Wreckers? Why does Shockwave have two heads? 

Fuck Michael Bay.&&That’s some memory. I remember in the third one, an army of fighting robots wanted to enslave the human race, but not by being giant robots and smashing everything with no one being able to stop them because they’re giant robots. Also, the Autobots “leaving,” letting half the population die and then coming back because they said they had to let them THINK they left so they could be giant robots and smash the other giant robots. Also, Optimus Prime saves the day because Shia Lebouf (sp?) called Megatron a pussy, which led to him helping Optimus Prime and then Optimus killing him for a third time.&&Your first mistake was thinking someone wrote these movies.&&The plot of the third film is that there are a bunch of Decepticons that are trapped on Earth’s moon.

That’s like driving from California to New York. Running out of gas in front of your house/apartment/hotel/whatever and saying “Welp I guess I’m stuck here.”&&It was shit from the first one but in second one when Starscream missed opportunity to kill Megatron from behind and instead kept doing anything he told him without hesitation I said: *""Nope, no way, epic fail right there""*

I watched the second one, and between the jive-talking twins who get angry about losing a gold tooth (the ROBOT has a gold tooth!), and the fact that they throw Devastator out only to make a ""LOLMAO THE ROBOT HAS TESTICLES!!!"" joke, and couldn't do any more after that.&&He-man was a cash in for Conan the Barbarian but it turned out to be very M and not kid friendly (and merchandising friendly) so they replaced the heads of the already made toys with a generic blond hero face and got animators to make a kid friendly story about a prince/warrior who rode a green tiger.&&Sure. But as a movie that they're charging people money to go see, I expect more than a toy/car/beer commercial. Doesn't seem like the movies have ever managed to move past that.&&> Hasbro Cinematic Universe

So, a movie with Transformers, My Little Pony, Battleship, and Hungry Hungry Hippos?&&I'm tired of Bay-formers, as much as I respect the work put into those robots, I really wish their design was reigned in a little, in action they just look like tumbling trash heaps.&&What competition? I can only think of Aquaman. 

Either way, I think it's way too early to judge before the teaser drops, just because the new director and direction they may be taking. &&I think people are tired of bumble bee... He's such a shit boring character. &&Yes, I’d rather see Transformers in cartoon form . I feel these live movies haven’t done them justice. I’m still PO’ed about the crappy CG version of StarScream; along w/ many others! &&It will depend a lot on the marketing and word of mouth, IMO. 

If the trailers look like just another transformer movie, then yeah, it'll flop. 

If early reviews say that it's just another transformer movie, then yeah, it'll flop. 

But just remember Wonder Woman. Among the putrid mess that is The DCEU, a single genuinely good movie was made. Everything else in the DCEU was terrible and flopped... but they made one good one, and it made a **ton** of money. 

Bumblebee can be that movie. The director is the guy who did *Kubo and the Two Strings* (p.s. See that movie, it's amazing). Plus Bumblebee is back to being a beetle. This actually has potential. Time will tell. &&Maybe not. Bumblebee has a surprisingly good team behind it. Directed by Travis Knight of Laika, a new screenwriter (who admittedly hasn't written anything big or very good), and starring Hailee Steinfeld (whom I love)? I'm more interested in this than in any of the other Transformers movies.&&Nah, it's reportedly based on the movieverse. &&Unfortunate line break placement.&&Oh shit I thought I left out the word ""up"" for a second.  lol thanks for the laugh&&Absolutely. Bright colors, blocky robots... Even make it a period piece set in the 80's, with 80's sports cars, trucks, and music.

Okay, I'm going to give myself a heart attack imagining this sort of awesomeness. &&Bah-weep-graaaaagnah wheep nini bong&&Yes, can confirm. People are fond of the 80s.

The amazing disaster of a decision that it was also changed things for the GI Joe movie, where Duke was supposed to get killed.  You can clearly see him get stabbed in the heart, but then, off-screen at the end of the movie, somebody yells out ""Duke's going to be ok!""  Hasbro was just trying to avoid a similar disaster, but had already finished the artwork.  &&Watch Transformers Prime with them if you haven't yet (on Netflix). It is what the new movies should have really been.&&Those statues were designed by one of the movie's concept artists as a hybrid between the classic designs and the movieverse aesthetic.&&> Then they got strangely robo-gorey, and started mercilessly killing off Autobots (and Decepticons) we've known and loved for years in gruesome ways. Faces being ripped in half, decapitated, impaled, limbs ripped off. 

Oh totally. This is what really started to disturb me in these films. That scene where the Decepticons just brutally execute that nice Autobot scientist I was like, ""Holy Shit! If these were human this would be a straight up R-rated gore-fest. It just got so gratuitous too it just wasn't necessary - they can still punch each other and shoot each other just like Star Wars. By the third movie I'm sure they spent as much if not more special effects on exploding Transformers than actually *transforming* Transformers.

The beloved 1986 cartoon completely stepped up the violence over the original kids show and it was honestly as impactful as any show about outer-space robots battling ever needed.
&&I liked the first three so I thought I could like ANY Transformer movie.

https://i.imgur.com/EfaqOhA.gif&&Jesus H tap-dancing Christ.&&The voice actor for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) was the original from the older series/film. Not 100% on Megatron, but I digress. That helps immensely, having someone who understands what a character is supposed to sound like because they've done it helps determine dialogue.  

But of course, no amount of excellent VO work or 'splosions n' boobs will fix bad writing.&&The visuals were probably the worst part&&> To be fair the visuals weren't bad 


They're terrible.  They're all too messy, too busy, and have no substance. &&Bay had been saying ""this is my last one"" for years, since Transformers 3 IIRC. But after 5 flopped, it seems like Paramount is getting serious about resetting this series without Bay's influence.

Which might actually have some unfortunate casualties. The upcoming Bumblebee spinoff directed by Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) is a part of that timeline, and has a non-zero chance at being pretty good. But if Paramount is dead set on killing the franchise now, it's going to effectively be DOA.&&It's like your 90 year old Grandmother with Alzheimer's finally dying.

It was seeing John Turturro in a Sector 7 man thong.&&Excuse me, [but I think we all know what the *real* highlight of the series was.](http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-images/screen-captures/images/55893-1/Transformers+Revenge+of+The+Fallen_SC_1874.jpg)&&Hey, at least we now have Studio Series!&&China didn’t save the film this time. It only made $220 million there (a pretty big drop compared to predictions and the last film’s gross), and the response was pretty negative cause of the amount of Chinese product placement in the film.&&I'd like to see Joseph Kosinski get a shot (Tron: Legacy / Oblivion).&&Honestly, you're doing yourself a favor by not watching the last 2. I'm pretty excited for the Bumblebee movie though. There are so many good elements involved: VW Bug, the 80's, new director, etc.  &&Was anything as satisfying as when Optimus Prime rolled the fuck up and just started straight up running over Insecticons? It's like fuck you, I don't even need to transform, you just got beat by a truck.&&And the design of the characters I'd guess.&&But i want giant robots fighting each other in visually stimulating explosion filled scenes... 

I also want that to be NOTHING like the utter garbage that the first 5 transformers films have turned out to be.&&I swear the fourth one was a lobotomy on a DVD. I felt like I'd melted into my couch after watching it. &&Who would have thought they could make movies with explosions giant shape-shifting robots and _even more giant dinosaur robots_ so fucking boring?&&Age of extinction  was a least some what entertaining; actually nevermind. Irish guy was annoying. Transformium was a dumb idea and the way the manufactured transformers actually transformed was horrible. Mark whalberg wasn't horrible, but him being an inventor was hard to buy. The last knight on the other hand was a steaming pile of shit that hat no coherent plot. It felt like it was just jumping all over the place.&&Isn't that how middle managers behave in general.&&Maybe it was a poorly done joke. I think Kylo Ren has a similar scene in one of the Star Wars movies recently. &&Helicopter dude in movie 1 was Blackout, helicopter dude in movie 2 was a new character named Grindor. Robert Orci who wrote the movie admitted even he wasn’t sure if they were supposed to be the same character at first lol 

Edit: in both cases “character” is an extremely generous term &&Remember when 'Autobot Jolt', the Chevy Volt appeared out of NOWHERE to revive Optimus Prime? I laughed so hard in the theater, I couldn't believe the mess I was witnessing.&&You're going to hate his, but I can (sadly) explain all of that.

1. Helicopter dude in the first movie is Blackout. In the second movie, the helicopter dude is Grindor who happens to look like Blackout. Actually, the whole twins thing was present even in the original cartoon (ex. Bumblebee and Cliffjumper).

2. The Twins were supposed to show up in the third movie but were later scrapped due to their backlash. According to the novel adaptation, the Twins were supposed to sacrifice their lives to save Bumblebee when Sentinel Prime turned. 

3. Barricade's death in the third movie wasn't shown on screen, so they used that excuse to bring him back.

4. Those Decepticon are just clones (honestly, I'm making this part up).

5. Optimus can spontaneously heal himself somehow (again, making this up).

6. Well Megatron—yeah, I can no longer explain this one anymore.

7. Motorcycle triplets died in the desert battle.

8. The Ferrari, Dino, was supposed to die in the third him but Ferrari didn't want their character getting killed.

9. It's assumed the Wreckers died when the Bots were hunted down in AOE.

10. The humans modeled their own robots off of dead ones, and hence we got a two-headed Shockwave.

I hope this helped someone. &&Megatron is good for like 2 minutes and turns into a dinosaur after a discussion about Texas' laws concerning age of consent somewhere in there too &&But he puts a lot of hot chick's and sound effects in it. &&At this point, I would just watch Transformers for the explosions and shit&&Aw shit, I had forgotten about the motorcycles.&&He tried to mess with TMNT, and make them all into aliens... remember that?

[Here.](https://youtu.be/m9zW9_LL5xg?t=141)  He's even like ""No Optimus!""  It was strangely disturbing.&&Yeah I'm like 96% certain the Transformers scripts were generated by some algorithm &&In the first film, it establishes that the AutoBots can transform into space faring vehicles and propel themselves across the cosmos. That's how they arrived on Earth. When they introduced the Transformers having vehicles like the Ark, it felt kinda weird since the Transformers were pretty much walking, talking escape pods. &&> Him being an utter coward in the face of someone genuinely superior

Only if he had no choice though. Even when he met a *planet-sized* god-like monster robot, he stood (or rather, floated upright) in front of him and proclaimed ""I bow to no one!"".

Granted, he gave in when the planet wanted to eat him, but I think most would in that situation.&&I mean, he tried standing up to Unicron until Unicron effortlessly bitchslapped him. Even still, he tried to betray Unicron in the end. &&The problem is that the Fallen hasn't really been built up in any meaningful way yet in the story. If that's the case, the film is pretty much attempting to establish the Fallen as the Big Bad Guy© in a very, very lazy way.

*C O G N I T I V E D I S S O N A N C E*  
&&THIS. SO. MUCH. 

The tone and approach was so inappropriate for the Transformers franchise. &&I think the way Bay filmed his action in those films peaked with 'Dark of the Moon'. Filming in 3D really made him slow down and frame his set pieces a bit more coherently.&&And did you notice how pointless Wahlberg's medallion thing was? It was literally used in one scene and that's it.&&I think someone told the new writers, ""Dare to be stupid.""&&My problem with the recent movies is that they're hard for me to watch. I feel they tried to go so hyper realistic on the robots that it's just this convoluted mess. I don't need to see where each bolt went in the car, I just want to be able to tell where his arm stops.&&Dude, me too. The OG animated movie is untouchable. What the fuck is so wrong with that story that they couldn't do it? It's one of the best cartoon to movie storylines ever imho. &&> and decided to say ‘nah, EXPLOSIONS AND TITS!’ instead.

That's all I really want in life to tbh. &&And Judd Nelson as fucking Hot Rod!

Who, BTW, recieved zero justice from his appearance in the last movie. Holy shit what a disappointment! &&This is me. Additionally, I’ve paid to see each of them in the theater. My son is a big fan, and I have no illusions. I thought the first one was well-written and well-acted for a summer blockbuster, notwithstanding the grosser bits, and I loved Julie White’s delivery.

My son and I left the theater after seeing the fifth just _dazed_. It’s horrific as an artifact of cinema. I got the impression that Bay finally broke and said, “You think my movies are shit?! Well I’ll show _you_ shit.”

And so he did.&&In 1 there is a semblence of plot and structure, same with the 3. The rest of them is just pure mess.&&Have you watched ""The toys that made us"" on netflix? The episode about HE-man is hilarious, the ways the characters were designed was random as fuck.&&Don’t forget the Magic: The Gathering IP Hasbro owns&&> Hungry Hungry Hippos

I'm not sure what they've sold off the cinematic rights to, but they're totally a megacorp&&That sounds pretty lit honestly lol&&I never knew I needed a Hungry, Hungry Hippos origin film until now. &&I would pay to watch a battle between my little pony and the transformers with the hungry hungry hippos utilized as weaponry &&Bayformers just look too unnecessarily “human”, a transformer with metal beard biting a metal cigar?

Less slow-mo acrobatics and shaky cam.&&I just want it to be a better toy commercial. All the transformers media needs to do is show me cool toys to buy wrapped around a cheap plot.  
  
Not a pile of slinkies in a blender that can't decide what kinds of movie it wants to be. &&The Bumblebee movie is the first Transformers movie not to involve Michael Bay, so while we don't know if it'll be good, it very well might be different.&&Spider-verse, Alita: Battle Angel and Aquaman come out the same day, Mortal Engines a week prior, and Mary Poppins Returns 4 days later.

Just give me an art style where I can tell the characters apart. The Cybertron video games were probably the best Transformers will ever get in that sense.&&The DCEU wasn't a financial failure at that point though. BvS was a little underwhelming but Suicide Squad made wayyy more money than it ever should have. Really the only big flop was Justice League.

GIVE US WHAT WE WANT &&Pick up the Platinum Studios Transformers game if that's your thing. It's almost exactly what you described, and is probably pretty cheap now.&&I just used these as an example. Tons of artists have made realistic interpretations of G1 Transformers that look way better than Bayformers. My point is that Bay's old argument, that robots actually resembling Transformers wouldn't look right in a live-action film, is bullshit.&&Wait, even the second?&&So kind of like X Men First Class possibly? It could work. I'm excited to see someone other than Bay make a transformers film. He should have stopped at 3.&&I did learn a few things.  
1) I learned that when it was over, Tim said he'd be curious to see what else other people could ""do with the format""  
  
2) I learned that a podcast like this is a great way to help build/fortify a friendship and since my longest friend is my co-host, and we've been growing apart the last couple years, a project like this has really helped us bridge that gap and get back on the same page.  
  
Also, the movie is slowly driving us mad. So there's a lot of things going on here&&To get [AS HYPED AS POSSIBLE](http://thehypetrain.podbean.com/)&&At least they'd be amusingly terrible at that point instead of annoyingly terrible like we have now.&&Or a Christ that transforms into a religous artifact (a cross).&&Frank Welker, the original voice actor of Megatron in the 80s series, assumed the role of Megatron in the last two films. Before that it was Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in the Matrix series. Welker was also the original voice actor of Soundwave and reprised that role for a cameo in whatever film it was that Soundwave (he was a satellite orbiting Earth) first appeared. There's been a few others along the way. Welker has contributed to the series pretty much from the start but wasn't given the role of Megatron at the very beginning for some reason. The first in a long line of mistakes to come.

And I'll agree. The voice acting was good, even great in spots. The visuals were amazing at times. Everything else about the movies, especially the last 2 were pure garbage. The direction was terrible. The script was terrible. The plot made no sense and was full of holes. The pacing was awful. The acting was passable for the most part but cringey at its worst times. 

The first movie was fine for what it was. Actually enjoyable. But by the end of the first movie, it was clear that there was no rules in this universe: 

Bumblebee couldn't talk at the beginning but then inexplicably could talk at the end of the first movie only to inexplicably been unable to talk again when the second movie started. 

A fresh batch of Autobots and Decepticons magically show up for each new movie. No explanation about how they got there. Just floating around in space, I guess. 

Sceneries change with no logic or explanation. The aircraft museum in the second movie opens up to an expansive, dry field with tons of old airplanes. Despite the fact that its in fucking Washington DC. Seriously, Google Maps the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and see if you can find a giant, arid patch of land full of old airplanes in the middle of the National Mall. 

Dead transformers can come back to life with very little effort or very little explanation. Seriously, how many times does Megatron have to die or otherwise look like a bitch in this series. 

Then there was that time at the beginning of the 4th movie where they found Optimus Prime in an abandoned garage and he needed to get back to his Autobots so that they could fix him. A chase scene ensues and along the way Prime simply scans a new truck and all of the sudden he is completely restored. Like, what the hell. Why didn't he just do that in the first place. What did he need his Autobots for?

Michael Bay is a shitty director who makes shitty movies and mistakenly believes that the audience is dumber than him. At this point, I'm pretty sure he knows how bad he is and his goal with the visuals and the explosions is to try and distract the viewer from seeing how bad the movies are. It would probably have a chance to work if the story was at least logical and could be kept under 2 hours. Instead he gives us nearly 3 hour, poorly paced shitfests that make the flaws impossible to ignore. You're already exhausted from watching the atrocities but there is still a whole hour to go. You spend the entire last hour of the movie asking yourself ""what the fuck is going on here"" and ""when is this shit over with"".

And I'm a Transformers nerd who got a little teary-eyed the first time I heard Peter Cullen's voice in the first movie back in 2007.&&Megan Fox did hold my attention through the movies pretty well though&&Actually skipped the title to go straight to your comment and I also happen to like the FF movies.

Also, Sentinel betrayed Optimus, sided with Decepticons, and collaborated on a plan to occupy a human city and kill its occupants. He was too dangerous to keep alive.&&The editing is fucking weird too.

Evan Goldberg presents Hungry Hungry Hippos

Seth Rogen as Blue Hippo

Jonah Hill as Red Hippo

Danny McBride as Yellow Hippo

James Franco as Green Hippo

Aziz Ansari as the white food balls.&&I think if you do a Hungry Hungry Hippos movie, the hard part is conveying the bizarre mystery of encountering these creatures. I would set it in Egypt during the Final War of the Roman Republic. Roman soldiers are separated and lost on the Nile, and have to get down the river back to the Mediterranean through waters infested with an enormous population of hippos that have been fed Roman soldiers by Cleopatra's loyal followers. Panicked Romans who don't speak Egyptian, hiding from loyalists, sneaking through reeds thick with crocodiles and snakes, terrified that if they get back, maybe the wrong side won the war. The one soldier is committed to his loyalties and the other just wants to survive. They betray each other and then have to forgive each other if they want to survive.&&Power Rangers now also. &&*Every mainstream board game that is secretly terrible but is peddled to clueless consumers based on the power of nostalgia.

Board games have come a *long, long* way in the past 20 years or so.  &&And the amount of explosions and unnecessary sparks flying, oh god. &&So you're saying they need a different director?&&Nah, fuck that.  If Beast Wars can have great writing, then a movie with a million times the budget should be able to produce something at least above average.&&Ebert (or Roper can’t remember which) called the fight scenes like watching silverware roll down a hill.&&I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but I figured I could at least watch them for the fun action.

I lost all hope when the second movie spent like forty-five fucking minutes on Sam going to college and his mom eating a pot brownie and acting like it was ten hits of acid, and then he gets attacked by a cybertronian sex bot.

Haven't watched one since. So happy to see Bay's monstrosity die. I didn't need my childhood cartoon preserved in amber but I certainly didn't need this.

Most of the baddies just look like big metal chunks of scrap metal liquid melded together.  That and they have no personality just like the good guys.  Prime's act gets old like since forever and nobody really cares if he came back in that movie. &&Suicide Squad felt like a bunch of decent characters trapped in a terrible movie. It seemed as though they were looking out at me saying, ""This sucks, doesn't it?""&&OH man, the toy opportunities. Intersecting the nostalgic 30-somethings who now have disposable incomes AND their kids who will see this stuff for the first time? Hasbro would be idiots not to do this. In fact, now is the exact, perfect time for it, since 80's nostalgia is at a fever pitch and is about to start bleeding into 90's nostalgia as 90's kids start to get into more creative positions in movie and TV studios. &&Better or worse is subjective, but I quite like the movie design aesthetic. This is because the movies actually show the Transformers as the complex mechanical *aliens* that they are. Previous designs were too simple and too terrestrial, so they weren't believable as aliens.

The classic Marvel/Sunbow G1 designs were simple, boxy, man-in-a-suit designs that were meant to be animation-friendly. The problem is that they don't allow much freedom of movement - watch an episode of G1 and you'll see that there are instances of not only 'joint cheating', where joints move in impossible ways, but there are also supposedly solid metal pieces bending and twisting to allow the character to move or transform.&&One man. Alone! Betrayed by the country he loves!&&Yeah, the forest fight scene was great. I'm just a huge nerd for massive CGI and robots fighting idk.&&Second I think was alright, mostly because it had the pyramid fight scenes, the comic relief duo vs. some of the most complex cgi ever, and that one guy who turned into the Blackbird, pretty much my favorite vehicle ever.

It was stupid, but it was stupid fun.&&I'll peep the recap in the DSM-5.

Good luck to ye.&&Is it wrong to be hopeful regarding Michael Bay and Duke Nukem?

The only way I see it failing is if it isn't rated R. It's not about having nudity and language, it's about being true to the material and letting it be what it is. &&Tl;DR, We're ALL Transformers nerds who get a little teary-eyed when we hear Peter Cullen voicing Optimus Prime.

We spend more than half of the first movie following around a military team who accomplished absolutely nothing, the worst love story since twilights, pointless secret agent shenanigans, and the whole NSA/hacker thing. 

Hell, we have a scene where the kids are in custody, then freed by the autobots, then captured again, except this time with bumblebee. What was the point of that?

Funny thing, since the novel adaptation and the comic book adaptation spoiled a really critical plot point on Amazon, Bay called to stop making these adaptations. Now they are no longer being made. &&I agree. The second movie messed up the continuity so bad, I think they just gave up with the sequels. &&Yup, he was supposed to be Mirage.

That guy on those two islands stopped it""&&Too bad Shia Lebouf has already been in transformers because he would have been an interesting Jace in a crossover&&Are you trying to tell me a quote like ""I tap my entire Mana pool and send you to the graveyard"" or when the epic villain walks in and says ""I now summon my 5th (enter whatever creature)"" and everyone gasps at the broken rules of the tournament, wouldn't be epic? Stopped playing in college so I assume 4 is still max of any non land type.  &&SPOILER ALERT:

Nicol Bolas is about to destroy the entire plane and it seems like there is no hope for our heroes.

Chandra: ""But Scalding Tarn, I know you can pull out an Island or Mountain but who is going to pay the 1 life?""

Scalding Tarn: ""...I will.""

Chandra: ""No Scalding Tarn! You can't!""

Scalding Tarn: Begins to start turning sideways ""I've always loved you.""

Chandra: ""Scalding Tarn no!""

It is too late however. Scalding Tarn finishes his 90 degree turn and vanishes. A gigantic mountain then plops down from the sky crushing Nico Bolas. The day is saved.

Chandra: ""A mountain...for me. I'll never forget you Scalding Tarn.""

Roll credits.&&I like it. But I think with a good writer, the Brothers War could be a good series. &&I understand all of those words individually, but as a sentence they make no sense.
&&With Michael Cera acting as Squee the Goblin&&finally mtg references from when i played it&&""The Planeswalkers"", a Netflix Original.  

Basically, ""Sliders"" but with RPG tropes.&&*reaches for wallet*&&No, this is movie adaptation mistake #1. Don't take a property and make it primarily about random human characters. Gotta center it on the Hippos.

Hungry Hungry Hippos is about the chaos that ensues in nature when racial strife is allowed to reign with the unchecked power of hippo. It begins with a hippo of every color of the rainbow and a life of blissful diverse harmony, but when a famine hits, this harmony is crushed by the ravages of starvation and animalistic rage. They agree to settle their strife once and for all in an eating competition... to the death!

In the end, will only one hippo survive, a sad commentary on the failure of selfishness and ethnic strife, leading to loneliness and an inability to propagate the species altogether? Or will they see through their gluttonous contest that they are more alike than different and become a glorious rainbow of hippo once more?&&Insane premise. This could be great.&&From the start would have been nice. &&Well sure, but like, even the movie from the 80's was still a toy commercial at heart even it the flick still holds up.  
  
It's like they all got around a big table and went: ""You know what a movie about robots needs more of? **Human characters**""&&From someone who thinks Transformers 1 is a better robot flick than Pacific Rim, take it from me, don't see the latest one. It's probably the worst movie I have ever seen.

It's so bad that I was sitting there wondering who okayed that burning piece of trash movie.&&[deleted]&&> LeBeef

Yum.&&Out of morbid curiosity: How did they drop him, story wise? I stopped watching around the middle of Transformers 3.&&That is literally all DC characters they are all well cast but get crap. &&Voltron would be badass. Also, someone should make a GoBots movie lol.&&Sometimes I shout this while driving if me and a friend get elected to make the last-minute booze run. That movie was stupid but had so many memorable scenes and lines. &&Agent Simmons was an amazing character &&You must love Pacific Rim then! &&I can get down with that

Stupid fun is one of my favorite kinds of fun &&[deleted]&&Jetfire, tho wtf why did they make him a crotchety old man with robot dementia&&Didn't it also have the pointless assassin robot girlfriend?&&> It was stupid, but it was stupid fun.

Thats pretty much why I'm looking forward to Pacific Rim 2 more than any transformers movie at this point.

Its the dumbest awesome movie ever made! The awesomest dumb movie ever made!&&But that seems more like a natural fit though. &&Duke nukem was *made* to be a Michael Bay movie. &&Duke seems just action-packed and juvenile enough to be a good fit for Bay. It's the embodiment of everything he's built his career around, at least on paper. It'd probably at least be worth a watch if it ever comes to Netflix&&Hello!&&There are too many damn effects. There's one for everything, it's exhausting!&&Easy, Megatron = Pointy grey man

Starscream = Grey pizza slice

Grindor/Blackout = Grey helicopter man&&They turned Devastator into a bulldog. Fuck them. I want to see Devastator, Aerielbots, Omega Supreme. If Pacific Rim can do it... &&Because Michael Bay and his stupid juvenile sense of humour. &&yo okay so I’ve never walked out of a film before or since I saw this shit. It was so egregiously embarrassing and juvenile that I could not bear it &&E N E M Y 'S S C R O T U M&&When none of the vehicles had wrecking balls&&That is certainly how movies should be made yes. &&So Michael Bay took your hopes and dreams, ripped them apart, then took what you turned to and ripped that to shreds as well?

Jesus Christ man.&&They still managed to change things from the novel that made the film worse.  Most notably, Prime killing Megatron after the Decepticon leader saved him from Sentinel.  In the other adaptations I read before the movie, he accepts Megatron’s truce, as every other iteration of Optimus would have done.  Except movie Prime, who collects faces.&&I noticed they changed all the dino-bots names as well. 

Also that last sentence sounds like something you'd read on the Transformers Wiki &&Why the fuck would you let a car company have creative input on your film? Surely the right thing to do would just be say ""no thanks"" and use one of the countless other companies&&And tried to kill Sam twice and killed countless humans and tried to enslave humanity. 

You'd have to be especially retarded to broker a truce with that guy.&&I AM the senate!
&&I also could imagine that given the moons gravity and the bots strength, they could essentially leap off the moon in a way that would put them on course to meet earth. It may take them a bit but much faster than just waiting.&&You hand it over to Steven Spielberg and call it Ready Player One.&&It just sounds so terrible it might work!&&and GI Joe&&Then why did Paramount just announce a D&D movie for 2021?&&Ah, thanks! I just knew Hasbro had the rights to the game...and wasn't certain if that was even still true.&&[deleted]&&Oh god yes! I would give my left kidney for good Baldur's Gate movie.&&Depends a lot on the execution. There is a relative lack of true storylines that are canon in most DnD settings, for better or worse. Means more leeway for writers to make something interesting in an established universe, unless they wanted to cinematize something like the Time of Troubles.&&Omg, if we had a major epic fantasy cinematic universe that was good (I have to clarify that, since cinematic universes that aren't Marvel have so far suuuuuucked), that'd be so amazing. Imagine a whole generation of kids growing up thinking drow and bards and tieflings and changelings and shit were cool. 

It's like, growing up, I thought Ant Man was a joke character. There's Spider-man, and then there's also Ant Man lololol. I didn't know better, because I only knew superheroes from the 90s show, then the movies, and video games. Now I'm a teacher, and I saw a kid with a fucking Ant Man t-shirt the other day, and that blew my mind. There's a generation of kids that justifiably believe Ant Man is actually pretty kick-ass. God, if they did that for D&D, I'd be head over heels.&&""We have to travel to 3 islands and 2 forests in order for this to work!""&&Read The Artifacts Cycle, it really lets you feel the power of Planeswalkers and where they get their mana and how they use it. Urza is such a great flawed hero.&&Thank god he brought about 20 or so squirrels or we'd be screwed!&&Hit him with your crossbow Steve!&&Inb4 Sam Witwicky is a Planeshifter. &&The Brother's War would be epic, especially if it was treated in a mature way. My body is ready for compleation.&&Follow <the hero> and the crew of the <airship> through <location> while battling <enemy> and his <airship>. 

If I'm recalling right.&&But it’s directed by Uwe Boll.&&The worst part, they did. At the very end he says he wants ""to stay with the boy"", then in the next movie they act like that never happened.&&He simply doesn’t show up and the disappearance is never explained aside from the assumption of Bumblebee hiding from the government who’s hunting down all Cybertronians now.&&The problem with DC is you can do raw and gritty or you can have the supernatural alien super heroes. I feel like they need to keep Batman separate from the others and have felt this way sense I was a kid.&&Check the new Voltron series on Netflix, it's awesome. &&People like to shit on it but in retrospect it was very much a movie of its time. Like, it's the most 2008 movie I can think of. &&Say what you will, but John Turturro's delivery of, ""I am directly below... the enemy's scrotum."" was amazing. &&Never bring those up again.&&I'm not so sure. Superficially, yes but I've always though there was a bit more satire in the original DN than Michael Bay is capable of and partly why the 'recent' game was panned.&&Yeah, it has a plot you can summarize on a napkin corner with one of those huge sharpies and you won't need to write too small to make sure you get the whole thing legible, and it's 100% cool visuals and explosions.  The only hard part for Bay will be finding enough scenes from past movies to use in it rather than shooting new ones, that aren't too out of place.&&Worf deserves to be remembered for something. &&What do they call that...The fuckthishit Effect?&&I applaud Michael Bay's bold creative decision to have Autobots call the character of Puerto Rican descent 'shrimp taco'. As a Puerto Rican man, I found that it *really* endeared me to Skids and Mudflap.

Not sure why though. &&finally a movie for us Gamers™&&Shuddering thoughts of Indiana Jones.&&That book was literally nothing but pop culture references. &&Pork chop sandwiches!&&I have no Fucking clue.&&Yeah, I'm pretty sure Hasbro only has the board game and video game rights - the latter of which they got back from Atari and are partially loaning out to Perfect World. Apparently they gave the Drizzt and maybe the rest of the Forgotten Realms book rights up to a new publisher.&&There was a DnD movie, though I'm not surprised people have forgotten it.&&Because D&D isn't really a setting or even a single defined aesthetic, it's just a ruleset.

I'd watch a Dark Sun or Planescape movie in a heartbeat, but I'd be more in it for the specific setting than its association with the D&D franchise in general. 
&&There's just something about fantasy as a genre that seems to curse it to do badly on the big and small screens - LOTR/The Hobbit is the exception to this rule, but the movie and TV series graveyard is littered with the remains of Conan The Barbarian: DnD, Shannara, Sword of Truth, Dragonlance, Atlantis, Olympus, Earthsea... hell, even Warcrack: The Movie was considered not to have succeeded.

Even Game of Thrones; a wide swathe of its fans and praising critics love it because they don't think of it as 'fantasy' in spite of the dragons and wraiths and magic elements. 

Fantasy is expensive as hell to produce and, in spite of the success of your Urban Fantasy TV (True Blood, Bitten, Once Upon A Time, Grimm, Supernatural, Lucifer et al), High fantasy just doesn't seem to do as well. Producing a Dungeons & Dragons movie probably looks like throwing money into a fire in exchange for nothing but complaints from the fanbase about how they didn't get X right.

Which is a shame, because I too would love to see a well-done Eternal Championverse series.&&Ya the Brother’s War is pretty awesome Magic lore.&&We need Brother's War to be a movie. Just put Peter Jackson at the helm.&&Anyone have 12 squirrels?&&*slowly returns hand to side*&&Also

>When Bumblebee finally did speak in the first movie, he had a slightly British accent. However, in The Last Knight, it appears he in fact has an American accent. As of yet, no explanation for this discrepancy has been made.

So many inconsistencies. &&Bstman just needs to be more like what he is in the comics. The peak of human strength and endurance, martial artist, literally the world's best planner and thinker, a literal genius and detective. In the movies he just punches people, especially Batfleck.&&I will never forgive them for pissing on John Turturro. &&Yeah, but satire and continuity are not Bay's strong suits.&&I remember him for considering prune juice to be a warrior's drink..&&Getting his spine crushed by a flimsy looking barrel?&&Your reenactment was better than any 4 of the Transformer movies put together.&&Didn't they rename Slag too?

It... hasn't aged well.&&**Why was his lipstick blue?!**&&Thankfully Jeremy Irons chewed the scenery so hard he ate the entire film.&&I'd prefer one movie for each set in the cycle, with Guillermo del Toro at the helm instead of Jackson.&&But it comes with a free frogurt!&&",2018-02-20 18:44:06

Seems like Jackie Chan is more than happy to do it, but he and Chris can't seem to agree on a script. Jackie wants to do it as soon as possible because he's getting to that age where stunts are really hard. In fact, in both this interview and the one with Ellen, he said he wants to hang up the martial arts roles soon and try out dramatic acting/singing (no joke - he does sing rather well in the Ellen clip). I'm sure he loves doing the martial arts films, but his body is no longer agreeing with him in his 60s the same way it did in his 30s/40s&&> i read somewhere tucker was begging jackie chan to do rush hour 4 because he's broke and needs the cash badly.

Indiana didn't hear much of what she had said. His hearing hadn't been the same since the refrigerator incident. ""Ha?! What?! Speak again!"" He cried, trying to make it sound like it was her falut that he hadn't heard.

Marion sighed. ""I'm too old for this shit."" She mumbled.

Not that it mattered. Indiana had already fallen fast asleep.

I could watch it 100 more times and it will still be funny. I know almost every single word and I still laugh every time.&&I really don't want to burst your bubble, but this movie pretty much exists because of Chris Tucker's financial troubles. My expectations are low (but I want to be wrong).&&*Rush hour 2* had Zhang Ziyi and Rosalyn Sanchez. That's quality casting.&&I love RH3 just because of the whole ""Who's on first""-type scene.  Made the whole movie for me because I was dying laughing (I love the original Abbott and Costello skit).&&Do people dislike RH3?

I didn't like it when I first saw it, but recently watched it again a year or two ago and thought it was a lot better than I remembered.&&Rush hour 3 had the classic dojo scene though. Mi, and you. 😍&&What’s wrongs with 3? I loved that one.
Edit: 2 got a 52% on rotten tomatoes and 3 got a 18%. Wow I didn’t know it was so disliked. 2 was always my favorite anyways.&&Wasn't there a big name involved in the previous ones, one of the guys who is in some shit over the harassment claims in Hollywood? That's what put RH4 in a stall? &&I’ll be right back

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlDfEMzFyGo&&It played along with the credits, IIRC...&&Yeah but it's Jackie, he'd say it like that for the heck of it.&&My understanding is that his English is actually relatively poor to the point of needing large cards with his lines written out phonetically just off screen. &&Faizon Love said Chris wouldn’t do anything that wouldn’t top the rush hour movies and him holding out was his downfall &&Don't forget the special on Netflix. &&I think it was deliberate though. It's the reverse Nicolas Cage: Cage likes being in movies and money, so he takes a ton of parts. Tucker had some personal life stuff and decided to stop being in stuff unless he agreed with the movie. Just look at the discussion around the script: Tucker was the holdout.&&Weird Al is in scary good shape. Dude's really taken care of himself.&&what is it good for!&&I upvoted you, but you have to realize what generation is the main user of this site. I grew up with Rush Hour, I saw Lethal Weapon in college. &&Let's downvote this guy for having an opinion about movies on r/movies.&&What about lethal weapon 4? The best one!&&I liked the outtake where Tucker kept calling him Jackie, and Don Cheadle loses it and says, ""his name is Lee, goddammit!""

And you can tell from the actual scene that Tucker never got it right.  They edited it so it would fit.&&Jackie always okay!&&GAFILKAFISH&&RH is an entire blooper. I remember Jackie Chan saying in an interview that Tucker is never sticking to the lines, he only follow the main plot and do improvisation.

He probably exaggerated, but it would explain why the laugh always seems legit even if we all know they did the scene an hundred times.&&It’s like the only thing I remember of they entire film now &&CRAAAAAZY ASS BITCH as they jump out the window in the second one is my fav &&I don’t know what it is, but I’m not sure I’ve ever laughed harder at a movie ever in my life.

[ Dont mess with the IRS!](http://sadmoment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-IRS-Scares-The-Joker-More-Then-Batman.jpg) &&Say it again!&&All Jackie Chan movies have incredible outtakes.

My family has been watching his movies for as long as I can remember and the outtakes are always amazing.&&What do you mean?&&Didn't Tucker also get $20 million for Rush Hour 3? It must be tough convincing the studios to make Rush Hour sequels when one half of the comedic duo is an out of work actor holding out for an exorbitant amount of money. &&Well it's true.&&Uh, Bryan “I keep James MacAvoy’s Hair in a Safe” Singer?&&Uh, Brian “I like my pool parties with 13 year olds” Singer&&I'd be ok with a Rush Hour/21 Jump Street crossover film. &&Damn that's a great call. I watched it again the other night and it still has me laughing hard, not a lot of comedies can do that after the first or second watch.&&*salivates* &&Only if they want Christmas involved. &&He attempted suicide. 

http://people.com/archive/cover-story-owen-wilson-what-happened-vol-68-no-11/&&That brings back memories hah. He definitely can sing. He said he learned English listening to American songs like Elvis and even Willie Nelson. They sing at a nice pace, and he could rewind the cassette tapes and keep learning *and* enjoy the music. He tried learning English with TV but they talked too fast and he couldn't repeat things he missed at the time (before DVR)

I also forgot to explain that when he mentioned his desire for doing more singing, he told Ellen he wants to do movie musicals (not just singing for records, which he has already done). He sits there inspired by Les Miserables, La La Land and others musicals and would not mind trying that out. He amusingly said, ""Hollywood, I'm open to other things other than fighting movies. I'm getting old and can't do stunts forever."" Unfortunately 98% of the offers Jackie gets today are still martial arts related films where he has to be a bodyguard or kick gangsters' butts.

So, yes, someone out there, give Jackie Chan a chance at something else. Sci-fi, musicals, drama - something where he doesn't have to always karate chop, flip and twirl a pole around. Jackie even said his Karate Kid role was to ""throw out a wink/message"" to producers that he can do some quiet dramatic acting (and he did do a good job there).&&Is it 神话？ Please be 神话&&Ahh the auto generated English subtitles are hilarious in that video &&Did this too.

He can't risk himself in a series that's more known for comedy dialogue than comedy action.

They gotta end the series on a high note and Chan healthy.&&Yeah, Jackie's been done with his stunts for a long time. He has said he is too old to keep doing what he used to, and it wouldn't look good anymore.

He's one of the world's most successful film actors, directors and producers. I have nothing but admiration for him. His English is far better than my Chinese.

And probably in his films, the dialogue is written in Chinglish sometimes.

But I thought I got it about right. I could hear it in my head, you know?&&He also got paid and probably is doing fine.

Nvm he blew all his money&&Which was awful. I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes.&&It's his concerts. 

Saw him just a few years ago, and his show is legitimately one of the more exhausting things I've ever seen a human do. He had more energy for 3+ hours than any other live performance I've ever seen.

EDIT:  It’s Garbo save your time.  Should’ve spent my 2 hrs sleeping.","The ultimate way of not screening for critics -  Immediately release after announcement.&&People have been hoping Netflix would pull off something like this for years and they finally did it in a big way.&&The only marketing they had was one 30 second trailer and then they release it the very same day. 

That's hype as fuck. &&It was really fun to watch /r/cloververse over the last hour. I can only imagine the shit storm that’s gonna happen 90 minutes after the game.&&I really hope this pays off because that’s a hell of a move by Netflix. I’m so excited to watch this, and hopefully it ends up being pretty good. 

Funny enough, my entire living room gasped when Netflix popped up at the bottom, getting the biggest reaction of the night (moreso than Solo). &&I’m surprised it’s actually a direct sequel/prequel and not loosely connected. Either way I’m extremely excited 

Edit: also I’m going to guess that the crashing satellite from the end of OG Cloverfield is related to this movie some how&&This is one of those things Netflix can do that further separates it from traditional studios (in a good way imo). What a way to capitalize on trailer hype. First time we get any information on a (pretty much) AAA movie beyond a few sentence summary and we get to watch the full thing tonight, what a world we’re living in. Did we ever even get a confirmation that Netflix was releasing a Cloverfield movie before this or were they just rumors? I don’t even care, I’m so incredibly excited to get home and watch this movie. I did not at all expect it to be directly related to the first movie.&&I'm from europe, it's the middle of the night and I have never seen a second of american football in my life. Can someone please tell me how long the game is? There is no way im going to sleep before seeing this movie.&&I have class tomorrow and loads of H/W so obviously I am go to watch this tonight&&I’m so hyped and happy. Netflix could be making history here.&&Is this the same movie they were referring to as the ""God Particle""?&&The obvious way to one-up a trailer only weeks before theatrical release.&&Sometimes this timeline is alright.&&Jesus, how did they keep this so well under wraps? Talk about experts of misdirection, they had everyone fooled. &&I am losing my mind. I thought it was crazy when 10 cloverfield lane dropped a trailer only for the movie to come out a couple months later but this is taking it to a whole new level with shadow dropping it out of nowhere. 

And the fact that it's actually connected to the first film has me super excited (Though the marketing in the trailer is saying we finally get answers on where the monster came from even though if you follow the viral marketing you already know the answer to that)&&Damn, what a ballsy marketing strategy

Edit: I'm a little confused, is this the one that people have been calling ""God Particle"" before? &&Now that is a surprise &&[I knew the posters linked! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/6mt25) so I put The Cloverfield Paradox and The 10 Cloverfield Lane Posters together 


UPDATE - 

I might just be overthinking this whole thing I've actually noticed that 2 different posters for 10 Cloverfield Lane actually link with the Cloverfield Paradox poster [link](https://imgur.com/gallery/Li3Ur) 

&&I just turned on Netflix and saw the header for it, came looking to see if I missed the announce for it earlier or something.  Ironically I'm looking for something to watch other than the superbowl and this would be a perfect movie for me... damn.&&I'm speechless. A few hours ago, we were speculating the movie's official title. And now, we find out the movie is coming out tonight? J.J. Abrams, you magnificent bastard.&&Bruh, I loved how they just showed the trailer and then said ""btw, you can watch it in a couple of hours"". Just great.&&[Yup, it's happening.](https://i.imgur.com/6ExWt9j.png)&&It's that Cloverfield 3 movie that nobody knew when was going to be released?

where is it streaming?&&This could genuinely be a game changer for the movie business. Being able to pull off a surprise release like a Beyoncé album would be something you’d previously think was unfathomable. Can’t wait to watch this tomorrow.&&I love everything about this franchise. The monster and the found footage style of the original, John Goodman's AMAZING performance in the sequel, and the insane viral marketing throughout.  We shouldn't even be surprised that the third film is just manifesting out of nowhere.  

CANNOT WAIT.&&Fuck me I work tonight&&This thread is for sharing your excitement about this since the other megathread got overwhelmed by Cloverfieldposting. Two hours after the Super Bowl ends and the movie ostensibly airs, we will post a Official Discussion.&&I hope Netflix is prepared for it. &&[Trailer!](https://youtu.be/8brYvhEg5Aw)&&Okay so I’ve read a bunch of posts that the movie is hot trash. 

I was kinda pumped to watch this tomorrow. Does anyone like it?? &&RIP Netflix servers.  There's a reason they usually launch shows and movies in the middle of the night.&&The only downside to this is...doesn't this mean there won't be a physical release? So we'll always have Cloverfield, & 10 Cloverfield Lane, but now we'll never be able to own this one. 

Unless I'm wrong, but I mean how many other Netflix original movies(let alone shows) have been released physically? This is why I wish it came to theatres :/&&I watched the other movies and did not enjoy shaky camera Cloverfield all that much. 10 Cloverfield Lane was good though, and definitely felt some of that vibe with Michael hiding out in some shelter. I think I blocked the ending out though cause I feel like I remember War of the Worlds instead and that confused me. 

I was optimistic going in as I thought we'd get some good answers as to why giant aliens were hanging out on Earth. 

Spoiler time. 

Instead we got Event Horizon with some Solaris on an Armageddon/Supernova type mission, followed by a Godzilla cameo. 

The biggest problem I had is the fact that the Sun is still working, free energy right up their ass the whole movie. 

For some reason I assumed the Sun was dying, how else to explain why they would run out of energy so soon? Hmm. And if they didn't think that was enough energy why are they not working on Fusion reactors? Or anything else? 

To spoil it further, they go to black alert and turn on Space CERN and ended up in a Mirror Universe where pretty much all of their MU selves were shitty people, hmm, familiar. Meanwhile, it looks like Satan himself shipped some Godzilla monsters the other direction, because why the fuck not? That totally seems like a fair trade. 

The MU world did not appear to have monsters running about, so what gives? What's with the extra dimensional physics defying monsters that end up in Prime Universe but not Mirror Universe? 

Also it turns out the writer of the movie doesn't know what a paradox is, so I was disappointed with that. For a minute I thought MU Jensen was also the PU little girl that Michael saved which would feed into a paradox plot line as they kept cutting from the girl to Jensen, this was definitely hinted at, but nope, nothing came of that unless there is a sequel. 

For all we know though the next Cloverfield movie will be about dystopian evolved humans, Vampires, that feed on Godzilla monsters and battle it out with werewolves, Kate Beckensale will star. 

&&Well, good thing I never make plans because I'd have to cancel them after hearing this news. The first one has a special place in my heart and Lane was great, so my hopes for this one are very high.&&Do I need to have seen 10 Cloverfield Lane previously?&&Who else went through the credits hoping to see something?&&guys it’s ON YEAH&&It was surprisingly mediocre. In the words of the neutral planet: ""I have no strong feelings one way or the other""&&Shame the other 2 movies aren't on Netflix.&&I instantly checked Netflix but was in no way expecting it to actually be there, looks like I got something to watch tonight!&&So what happened to God particle?&&Man I thought I was the only one who liked cloverfield. I'm happy for this hype!&&I don’t understand why it’s not being released in theaters. Paramount desperately needed a decent hit. &&What a great surprise. Plus, did I see Chris Dowd in this? I wonder if he’ll be.... disabled. &&Just finished it.  It was kind of ehhh.&&Honest question. I know there are 2 Cloverfield movies. One about a big spookie and one about john goodmans basement...i think. But is it worth watching the other two, or can i jump into this feet first?&&I'd have handled losing my arm much much worse than that. Chris O'Dowd is delightful &&I really don’t understand how this movie got an MA rating lol.&&[!](https://i.redd.it/vu2i0dhsiae01.png)&&as a non-american, after what game?&&what?





















WHAT!?!?&&Any idea what time the game ends? I don't watch the football.&&Is this ""The God Particle""?&&On the one hand, this could be an ingenious way for Netflix to show what streaming is truly capable of.

On the other hand, this could be an ingenious way for Netflix to get as many views as possible on a movie dump before reviews hit.

I hope that the film is fucking awesome and that this isn't just a gimmick of avoidance - but hell, I'll be watching regardless.&&guess i forgot the subplot in original cloverfield where the world was on the brink of war and nobody had power??? how tf did tj miller charge his camera then??&&honest question.. is it ""On Netflix only tonight"" or is it ""On Netflix only, (since) tonight""? 

Because my timezone (here already is Feb 5) is some hours later and at exact time when this should be aired, I should be waking up +-. So.. I just to know if I should prepare for being disappointed of missing it out or it will be there even later in evening.. 

edit: by the look of other Netflix only trailers, it seems they always put date or something down but it always means ""Only on Netflix"" + date. So hopefully, this is the same case.&&Does anyone else feel like they just bought the rights to a scary space movie and added in ~5 minutes of cloverfield tie-ins?

That would possibly explain why there was so little press/hype for this - I feel like it wasn’t produced as a cloverfield movie. It wasn’t kept under lock and key, but likely was decided last minute to become a part of the franchise.

I was so excited for this, but... wow. This was a major let down.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV1fUwKMdAI&&More excited for the movie than I am for the super bowl at this point&&Netflix and their big fat balls. Love it.&&Movie's up! Go watch it!&&It's out!!!&&Glad you decided to pay that extra dollar a month?&&Man, I've wanted someone to do this surprise release thing for ages now. Good going, Netflix!

*post-watch semi-review edit: It was interesting. Not mind blowing, but still enjoyable. Possible Spoiler:[I'm happy that this Cloverfield outing was, at its core, more tied into the original than *10 Cloverfield Lane* was. I'm also curious as to how they expand this franchise.](#spoiler)&&God damn it I was about to hop in bed until you told me this....&&Wasn’t this movie shot two years ago and supposed to be called God Particle?&&I mean the only advertisement they need is putting it on front page of everyone’s Netflix and if it good people will talk about it and sell more memberships&&It was okay. Telegraphed and sorta bland A-story with a much more compelling B-story that didn’t really end well, in my opinion. But that’s from someone who has probably seen the original 15 times and followed the ARG extensively as a 13 year old in 07, aka someone who immediately had high hopes. 

Decent sci-fi that might honestly work better as a stand-alone rather than as it is billed, a prequel. Plenty of questions were answered, but it seemed to only be to facilitate this new story rather than to actually attempt to be faithful to the original. 

I think the energy crisis is a bleedover from the original script that was then purchased by Bad Robot and turned into a Cloververse film, because I don’t remember anything about one being mentioned in the original. Source: 15 viewings. &&It was a fine fun movie. I found it more entertaining than the first one. Definitely worth the price of admission.&&Can’t wait!!! &&Just watched it. I now understand why they did this. If they had put this in theaters it would’ve made no money. Truly awful. &&A good 50+ minutes into this, and so far it´s hot garbage. Not nearly good enough as a follow-up to Cloverfield Lane 10. Regardless of the stories connecting or not. Hopefully ""Overlord"" will be better than this mess.&&It sucks&&Oh god its so terrible like a cheap made for TV movie basically. Useless dumb setting too.&&Nobody has answered if this is being released permanently tonight, or is just being released for tonight only.&&I would like the OP to stop being so negative in the comments about watching it. Just let people have fun. It's obviously not the best movie ever or it would have been released to the theatres.&&I'm enjoying it a lot. So I figure I'm going to be in the minority come discussion. 
&&Currently laughing at the people who were incredibly in denial that 10CloverfieldLane wasn't connected to the original movie. &&I decided to stay up to watch this knowing damn well I have to be at work in 5 hours. I thought, ""I waited 12 years for this, tonight I treat myself"". I deserve every second of the punishing tiredness I'll be feeling all day. &&this movie is really terrible. As someone who loved both Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane, I am very disappointed in this garbage.&&This is so awesome.  Gonna skip watching the trailer and go straight into watching the movie later tonight! Thank you Netflix!&&FUCK YES &&Fucking insane&&[deleted]&&Is it over yet? &&You know what would blow my fucking mind? if they also released the 4th one as well tonight but didn't tell anyone&&Its out!!&&It was edited clumsily - seems like they cut a ton out. In the middle it got really WEIRD in good way but then a scramble to the finish with w ton of cloverfied mythos and Easter eggs shoehorned in.&&It was the movie LIFE but connected to Cloverfield&&Does Cloverfield Paradox = God Particle? &&Well that was awful. &&I'm watching it right now...


...and it is fucking awful. This is not a release. It's a dump. It's like a pg13 version of Event Horizon. God this is bad. &&God this movie was fucking dreadful.&&False alarm. It's terrible.&&It’s too bad it was by far the worst of the three. Don’t even waste your time with it.&&For anyone else coming to this thread late: I watched it.  It's not a good movie.  I'm so glad I didn't pay theater prices to see that garbage.&&To all those users in the previous Cloverfield threads on this sub that basically called this: how do you feel right now? &&I can only hope Valve does this with Half-Life 3 someday.

""It's out. It's on Steam. We know we don't need to build hype. Here it is.""&&People like to complain about studios milking franchises or making unwarranted sequels. But never get the credit when studios do something like this. A fresh take each time within the mythos. &&Yall should watch Altered Carbon, great series by netflix&&The movie isn't going to win Academy Awards, but if you enjoyed the first two, this one isn't so bad. Solid Sci-Fi movie. 

Looking at all the critics crapping on the film makes me wonder if they are just pissed that Netflix cut them out of the release process. they didn't get to have their press screenings and write their articles for websites and get all that ad traffic. I think critics are a little biased &&Thought it was horrible.&&Movie was pretty bad. Movie of the week quality production. Generic sci fi bullshit story with hardly any tie in to Cloverfield.&&This movie is pretty cheesy so far (30 mins in). Not saying it’s bad...just kinda goofy &&and it's fucking terrible. &&Hate to say it but they were right to not spend lots on marketing. It was pretty bad. Felt like a bad movie of the week with a big budget for effects. Every space cliche. Really disappointing &&[deleted]&&AND it’s awful. &&The movies honestly horrible &&What tone was this movie going for? I'm confused. It wasn't a comedy, or a thriller or mock documentary. &&Much more straight sci fi than the first two, but definitely very cool.&&it was...meh.  it had all been done before and better, elsewhere.&&My reaction after watching is somewher e between ""ummm okay"" and ""meh""&&Looked more like JJ Abrams thought the movie had bad potential, but they are too deep into the movie, so decided to just go with it, make it a Netflix release to market for Cloverfield 4 instead. &&Can we just get a legit sequel to the First Cloverfield? [Just watched the first 20 or so minutes of the movie and the only tie in to the Original Cloverfield is that the Spacestation is named Cloverfield](#spoiler) 

So stupid&&Gravity is going the wrong way on the space station!!! FFS!!!&&This is mad&&https://imgur.com/NKnUmPi&&What the fuck is going on?&&God dammit. I want to watch this rn but I have to wake up for work tomorrow.&&God damn, Netflix is the best. Those guys are geniuses &&I love the Cloverfield franchise and I can't wait to see what direction they take this film.&&Hey it on Netflix now!!&&[deleted]&&This is God particle right? Might explain how the movies all oink up.&&[deleted]&&On the other hand though, why release a shit movie and take all this time to make sure it’s seen by 110 million people? That kind of makes me hope it’s great.&&Critics basically only matter for IRL viewings on opening weekend anymore. Whole different equation for streaming.&&like.. putting there a big movie instead of cinemas? Proper big name movie?&&They should have tried a dual-opening. Theaters tomorrow and Netflix at midnight. Especially if it's a legit movie worth seeing in a theater. &&I'm beating a dead horse here, but this is how I've always hoped that Valve would release Half-Life 3.  No build-up.  No advertisements.  Just...hey look, Half-Life 3 is on Steam now.&&Set's a very big precedent for the movie industry. I can just imagine going into the best movie of 2021 and not knowing anything about it before hand, no cast details, set picture leaks, trailers that show the whole movie, and best of all no dreadfully incorrect speculation, just blissfull ignorance&&As someone that shit's on Abrams for reasons that I still think are quite legitimate, this was pretty damn cool.

Edit:disregard.   The whole movie is a big mess.  Christ, this is awful.&&except the movie is shit&&Since it was advertised on the SuperBowl it's safe to say they still spend a lot of cash for the marketing in the end &&I love this kind of marketing, the reason why Cloverfield is my favorite series is because it's so fucking mysterious, their ARG's are awesome, and their marketing is so ballsy. 

Netflix is absolutely perfect for this thing, too. You can't really just randomly drop a movie in theatres with hardly any marketing or words about the movie at all, but with Netflix they can just drop it on there at any time.

Edit: Wow if you love Cloverfield, watch this movie ASAP.&&There was a ARG for it vut that was likely directed towards more devoted fans which makes this even more win win.

The fans get a big pay off for months of hype and work meanwhile people who barely remember it from all over the world will have instant access to a movie after watching the superbowl.

It's pretty genius 👌&&Out of nowhere for me at least. That's some fucking balls.&&I literally have heard nothing about this til the moment I saw the commercial. That's some pretty tight-lipped secret keeping.&&#NoMoreTheaters&&The first trailer literally said coming soon and the last trailer I seen for it (just now) said stream it now that’s fuckin baller&&They are shitting their pants in unison&&Missed opportunity to call it ""cloverse""&&Big move on both parties by not going into theaters. Huge respect&&Streaming after the game is a masterstroke. I can imagine a shitload of people switching over to netflix right after the game is over.&&Which Super Bowl party are you at where everyone is following Cloverfield?&&> my entire living room gasped when Netflix popped up at the bottom, getting the biggest reaction of the night

As someone who's not big into movies and TV and what not, can someone explain the significance with this? 

Why is it so special if Netflix made it? I thought they made heaps of stuff these days &&Wait WHAT? It’s actually a sequel to Cloverfield??? I am watching this tomorrow. &&If it even comes close to how good 10 Cloverfield Lane was, it should be excellent&&We’ll see - I’m expecting it to still be like that, where it’s a standalone film with elements that explain the Cloverfield universe, but based on that marketing, it sounds more like a sequel. 

Like you said though, either way I’m pumped. &&Agreed. So pumped! I thought it was going to be more of an anthology film (which would have been awesome too!) Such a cool series.&&[deleted]&&Do we actually know that it's a direct sequel? The trailer could've have been just been using the footage from the original for marketing purposes. &&The script had nothing to do with the prior two films, so I'm guessing there were either last minute reshoots or Netflix is just advertising it this way to get as many views as possible. &&We knew something was in production but this is the first official marketing.&&The movie's been in production for a couple years and been rumored to be a Cloverfield movie for a year or so now but it kept getting delayed and last week it was rumored that Netflix wanted to buy it from Paramount &&This was being rumored *maybe* a week ago but that was under the belief that there were production issues. &&I read an article earlier this week that said it was going straight to Netflix, and sooner than some might expect. But I never imagined...&&It is 3:02am in London right now. There is 2m16s left on game clock. Team with ball is down by 5 (less than one score) I’d estimate 315 am-330 London time

Very few movie universes have sucked me in the way that the original Cloverfield did. &&Definitely going to be a big night. Studios will be paying close attention.&&hopefully doesnt crash&&Yep.&&Next time, they won't even advertise it. You'll just be watching something unrelated and the movie itself will start playing.&&Even the darkest timeline isn't all bad.&&I'm still impressed by how they pulled 10 Cloverfield Lane's marketing off. It's amazing they could keep a movie so secretive in the age of the Internet.&&They didn't though. Rumors were up all over the place for months &&It was known as God Particle but other than that there were hardly any leaks or information&&Where does it come from?&&This blows my mind because this changes things in the entertainment industry. Like for real. This shotgun, barely announced game they just played changes things. I feel like this is gonna be the first time that it really dawns on people just what Netflix does. You gotta know they did that shit on purpose. Hit us with the trailer then hit us with the movie less than two hours later. They basically pulled off the best commercial ever. And let’s be real. Shots fucking fired. No bullshit over the top marketing plan. No need for Big studios for distribution. No interviews or cheesy leaks. Just hey, we got this thing you might like. Come check it out. In the middle of one of the most watched programs on tv. If the big movie studios didn’t already know about this, I can guarantee Hollywood is just one giant “WTF” right now. I may be over analyzing it, but this shit is playing out like Netflix was trying to send a message. This shit is wild. What a time to be alive.&&God Particle was just the working title for it. The same way “Valencia” became 10 Cloverfield Lane. &&It is, I've seen Daniel Brühl in the spot, who is part of the cast of God Particle.&&It was God Particle&&The original script was titled God Particle&&A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.&&Nice job!&&Great job! Now do the same when ""Overlord"" gets a poster this year!&&Interesting, since 10 Cloverfield Lane takes place underground, while Cloverfield Paradox is set in space&&Kinda cool that the paradox one is in space and the line leads down to under the earth in the bunker&&Maybe re-watch Cloverfield?&&[deleted]&&Have Netflix up and ready to go and shit. &&All aboard the hype train  choo choo!&&netflix after the game&&Tomorrow?

A trailer analysis thread wouldn't be terrible for some people. I understand the bombardment of posts though and there is only so much mods can do.&&I'm not american and I don't watch the Superbowl.

D: so many questions.&&Cloverfield fans feel welcome to come stop by the Cloverfield fan sub - r/Cloververse

[Heres our discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloververse/comments/7vb6ly/the_cloverfield_paradox_film_discussion/)&&I like it for what it is. Somewhat disappointed by it, was hoping for more. But the first half or so is exceptional and very intriguing and it kind of falls apart toward the end. Feels like the Cloverfield elements were added way late in the game but they work to enhance the franchise. Worst of the three but still enjoyable and entertaining to me.&&Honestly it's not that great. It's pretty evident that Bad Robot bought a subpar Sci Fi film and edited in a few scenes to tie it into the Cloverfield story. &&Watched it, it's pretty awful.

Take everything that is bad about Prometheus and nothing good and put it into this movie. It's all over the place, and personally I think it makes the original Cloverfield worse.&&Nah, I'm fairly certain they use Amazon web services which automatically scales to meet demands.&&That seems unlikely. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black have physical DVD sets. Why not a movie?&&That's a good point, never really thought about that.&&I appreciate your effort here but there is literally no sense to be made from this movie. It's just big steamy pile of stupid unrelated scifi tropes. Not even worth an analysis &&The whole movie was a series or literally impossible things and at the end of every scene the director looks at the camera and shrugs “Quantum Mechanics!!”

The guys arm that got swallowed into the wall and reappeared literally writing the solution to their next problem? Not to mention the dude just goes “Huh....Ive got no arm. Oh well!” How come the whole other crew died except for the crazy blonde chick who got fused into the wall? Isnt there green energy like solar, wind, and hydro?

Why would they build a particle accelerator in space? How did they power it? How do particle accelerators generate energy? How was there still gravity in parts of the ship with no spinning? What the fuck happened to the russian guy? His eyes started looking around and he randomly went crazy but exploded in worms?

The whole movie read like a 13 year old who just watched a youtube playlist on space and quantum mechanics and didn’t understand any of it but tried to explain it to his friends. They literally just throw words in like “higgs boson” and “quantum entanglement” randomly into sentences to sounds scientific.

Way too many tropes and cliches. Terrible characters and horrible writing. Not to mention how incredibly ham fisted all the cloverfield shit was.

It was the sequel no one wanted and here it is. Absolute shit.&&10 Cloverfield Lane was a “spiritual” sequel at best. The events of the first movie did not tie into it directly. You shouldn’t be missing anything by not having seen it. &&no but you should because its a pretty good movie&&Probably not but this might bridge the original film with 10CL&&I think Paradox is god particle&&This _is_ God Particle. Last month they changed the working title to simply ""Untitled Cloverfield Project"" because of general production messiness and the lack of a promise of release, and then said that it would tentatively release in April. Instead it is coming tonight as a Netflix film and the official name is ""The Cloverfield Paradox.""&&They weren’t expecting one with this - if rumors are to be believed, it tested poorly. They probably made their money back by selling to Netflix.&&Kind of? That’s generous. &&Was just about to post this. I'd say tv14&&Yes&&I could see it being a dump before reviews, but then again...Superbowl spots aren't cheap. Why waste it when they could just do a cheaper marketing scheme later this week?&&All 3 took place in different dimensions&&It means, '(Premiering) Only On Netflix, Tonight (Where It Shall Remain For All Subsequent Nights)'.&&That's what happened, as far as I know. Originally it wasn't a Cloverfield movie and they changed it later. But that's the same thing that happened with 10 Cloverfield Lane and that movie was great.&&[deleted]&&[Confirmed!](https://i.imgur.com/mTBSFZL.jpg)&&It was so frustrating too. Frustrating for knowing I waited a long time to see what I thought was going to be a great movie but also frustrating because the characters were all just so stupid. It's like they did absolutely 0 research about NASA or international space station stuff because none of those crew members were even remotely close. Just so many questions about wtf happened but also why everyone did what they did.

**^Spoilers ^below!**

First thing that I wondered was what exactly was the main characters job on the space station? She wasn't a doctor, wasn't an engineer, wasn't a physicist(which wouldn't be on a space station anyways since they deal with information and theory), wasn't a pilot etc... I just couldn't figure out her job.

Why would you need two keys on a space station to do the thing the space station is designed to do? Why would you need keys at all in the first place? Is the system supposed to be protected from surprise visitors? Why would there be surprise visitors.... Surly they vetted the hell out of all the astronauts before sending them up on the save the world mission. Are the astronauts who are supposed to save the world somehow not trustworthy enough to press the on button on an accelerator?

Why did the key thing need to come out of a very complex para-scope like device in order to function? Why would you design a simple on switch system to be super complex when knowing the more complex you design a system to be the more chances there are for things to fail? Does Murphy Law not exist in the cloverfield universe?

Do they not know that the sun is a massive ball of energy and that you can actually use it to do stuff and things? Do solar panels, solar stills, mirrors, reflectors, and radioactive materials not exist? How can they create a unlimited power concept but not create solar panels or nuclear power stations?

If the earth was on the other side of the solar system in which the other space station would have been orbiting, why is it that jensen teleported inside of the space station? Why wouldn't she have been on the other side of the solar system with the other earth?

When their earth disappeared why didn't they just check the constellations immediately instead of having to find some gyroscope which turned on some sort of computer system that than did it for them? Do they not know star systems? Did they not have like a map just in case their gyroscope w/e thing broke? If they needed a gyroscope...why didn't they just use the space station itself since it's obviously spinning and stabilizing the space station?

Why did they instantly trust random wall woman? Why didn't anyone question why all this random shit was going on when wall woman showed up? Why didn't anyone question if she had lots of access to the station itself when she clearly was able to access things like video recordings? Why wouldn't she have been put on guard or strapped down or even just sedated?

How could they save a woman who teleported into a wall full of pipes and wires and other shit but somehow couldn't save another guy who gets gut shot? Does their cell regeneration stuff not work when they get shot?

Why would they have a 3d printer that's able to make a gun and bullets? How would they make a 3d printer that can also make working bullets? Does it also make gun powder? Why would someone fill up the gun powder tank on the 3d printer or even engineer a system to have one?

Why did the space station eat the guy's arm? Why did the guy's arm actually move around? Why did the guy's arm write about where the gyroscope magic thing was? How did the guy's arm know where they were or that someone was around to even communicate with? Like wtf is up with that shit.

How is it that she had time to say ""i'll explain it later"" but couldn't just say ""we were in another universe""? Maybe don't send yourself a msg if you're on a time crunch kind of situation. Why would she send herself a msg or the plans to make the station when she knows that they had their own station which only broke because the german guy in their universe sabotaged it? Why not just send the vital data that allowed the thing to work in the first place?

Ok that's about it for now.

edit: Another I just remember was why the hell would they put the detach control for a section of the space station on the inside of the section that is to be detached and why would they require the door to be closed in order to detach it. If the detach system is there in case of emergency, wouldn't you want to be able to use it in case an emergency happens?

If they were having trouble finding power to do the thing with the space station than why didn't they just turn off the motors that were spinning the space station sections? Surely they must be using some sort of power in order to continue spinning it. Why not just shut off all the stuff to every other section of the station except for the parts that are needed to do stuff?

Why would they go for a space walk but only rely on being tied down with a rope and a latch? Why didn't they have those big ass backpacks that can orient astronauts in space or fly them around? Or like at least magnetic boots that allowed them to walk on the outside of the station. Surely they could have thought of those kinds of things when they created universe moving technology.&&Hey guess what??  Netflix confirmed it’s here to stay.  Yay&&Yup. It’s baaaad. Hat off to Netflix, they made more drama out of it than in the film itself. &&It's not quite made for TV level bad/cheesy.  But it's definitely not as good as the other two films.  

edit:  Okay...  now they're out in space and it looks like their crawling around scaffolding on earth with normal gravity.  They didn't even try to make that scene remotely believable.  &&It’s about the same caliber as like... a CSI episode. I’m halfway through and I am so bored. 

Still, it set a precedent with releasing a movie on Netflix “same-day” which is amazing! More please!&&Yeah and I still ask, “Why was I hyped”&&Only good person was that guy from Inglourious Basterds.  But still, easily the most disappointment of 2018.&&Yeah, would have tanked at the box office. &&Let your tomorrow-self deal with that!&&on the cw directed by the same guy that directs the arrow series&&Recognizable name brand that carries a lot of interest with it. By getting it out there, people will jump to see it without knowing if it's actually good or bad. And in the end Netflix will win regardless of the film's quality, kind of like Bright.&&I risk downvote Hell but... ON THE OTHER OTHER HAND...&&I don't think that's true. 

Most people I know look at reviews to decide whether a movie on Netflix is worth 2 hours of their time.&&Yeah people have very different value assumptions about box office movies vs Netflix movies. To see a movie at the cinema that's going to be over £20 trip for me with food and transport in mind. It better be a damn good movie for that kind of value proposition.

For streaming I account for the satisfaction of everything I saw on it that month against the monthly subscription price, even if they release a pretty mediocre or even disappointing film I haven't wasted a ton of money on it once it's run time is added against total time on the service that month.

Although I'm pretty rational and calculating with these kinds of things since uni and most people won't put this much thought into it.&&Putting a big name movie out right after they announce it.&&I was talking about announcing a big movie immediately before it actually becomes available.&&> like.. putting there a big movie instead of cinemas?

What?&&I mean I'd say Bright was a proper big name movie in terms of actors/production.&&Wtf are you trying to say?&&Can't keep it quiet like that.&&[deleted]&&Theater chains wouldn’t like the “releasing a film in theaters and on Netflix at the same time” strategy.&&Not even on the main page, some guy just looks up half life to buy it and notices 3 is on sale.  Posts to reddit, post is deleted for trolling, someone else posts a screenshot and steals all his karma.&&I considered mentioning Valve too, but yeah. Probably not gonna happen though.&&Unless that's all of the marketing they do, hoping that word of mouth will catch on and they save a bunch on promotion. &&[removed]&&Still *way* less than most films.&&Arg?&&The new one had an ARG? Wait where? I didn't hear anything about it.&&8,629 subscribers, 10,053 online

Never seen that before&&Don’t blame them one bit. If this was TWOW, i’d be at the store, buying supplies, so i could lock myself in my apartment for a week.&&Cloververse sounds better to me&&Seriously. This is a film that could easily be released in theaters (and one that was supposed to), so it getting a Direct to consumer release 3 months early is huge news. &&I just spoke to a mate who’s a cinema manager. He’s pissed. The movie is still listed on their bookies as released in April. He’s pulling it from their schedule now but he’s not happy the distributors didn’t tell him themselves. &&Was gonna go to bed. Watching it instead. &&RIP whatever TV show won the right to be the ""lead out"" after the game.&&I can also imagine a shitload of people that have to go to work tomorrow and can't watch a 2 hour movie at 10-11PM&&None of them, which is why it was so shocking. &&I think it was more shock that it was a Netflix movie and not a typical big name studio. I was surprised that I was Netflix. &&Netflix didn’t make it, they acquired it. It’s a franchise that has traditionally premiered in theaters, and is known to have a cult following, so for Netflix to not only get it, but release it exclusively, three months prior to its scheduled release (because it was originally going to be theatrical released in April) that’s a huge move. 

Like you said, Netflix makes a lot of content, but a majority of its popular content has been TV shows, and they haven’t had a ton of success (at least to my knowledge) with exclusive films, especially if you look at movies that are parts of known franchises. So for them to get a big Hollywood title, exclusively, and surprise launch it, it’s a big deal&&Trailer suggests it is the story of the event that caused the cloverfield monster to awaken!

AKA this is the movie about the satellite that fell in the last scene of cloverfield!

Edit: after watching it, I can safely say It's an okay film that is only tangentially related to clover. Everything concerning clover is an honest to goodness B plot that was stitched into the script, and the film more or less feels like it belongs on Netflix for good reason.&&It looks like the atmosphere is very different though. We’ll see, excited anyway!&&So it’s a sequel to found footage cloverfield or to trapped in a bunker 10 cloverfield lane?

At the end of the first film you see an object fall into the ocean briefly and if you time the date on the camera to the site of the fictional company Tagurato they say that they lost a satellite that fell into the atlantic ocean at that time.

/s&&Pair of docks...  That's where you park your two boats, right?&&The last bit of your comment is unconfirmed, but will very likely be addressed in Paradox. Cloverfield and Lane take place 8 years apart (2008 and 2016) so the connection is not clear or linear. &&Well, John Goodman’s character in Lane works for the company tied to the monster in the original, so they’re definitely adding things to tie them together. &&This is why people are so excited for this announcement.

I've been on a 'high' ever since.

Oh and I also can't watch the new one until my wife has finished This Is Us...so I got that going for me.

&&I forget that girls name but her boyfriend was Teddy :)&&Compared to just sitting at home, yeah. &&Yeah that was genuinely exciting. Reminded me of old Apple product launches where Steve would talk about this amazing product as if is was months away, then drop ""And you can buy it...today."" &&It's a great feeling when companies do this, because it doesn't feel like they hype something for all its worth. The opposite would have to be Game Of Thrones, for example. I might be remembering it wrong, but they hyped the like 5 second trailer *of the trailer* of the 7th season. If there was any new footage it wasn't more than a second or two. Like they consist of more publicity than content.&&Link on a motorcycle, no less&&This is the best strategy honestly. Given too much time fans will hype a game to unsustainable levels, like Fallout 4 or FFXV. 

Just release the game the day you show it off. Then no one can judge it on their expectations.&&I'll cry if I don't see Frank and Matt on screen together again.&&Start lifting, post almost nude selfies&&You could put in the work to become an influencer, or purchase an account. Some of them get bought and sold like a business. But you won't be buying one that revolves around a particular person or band.

Hashtags. Hashtaggies. Hashtags. Become the hashtag slinging slasher. It puts  your post on the top of the Instagram hashtag feed for a brief moment. So if you put a ton of relevant hashtags, then it momentarily puts you at the top of a ton of hashtag feeds. That's the purpose of them. You'll get a follower here and there if the actual post is okay, but if you're a sexy person then you'll get a fuck ton, like 5-15 followers. I showed my friend this yesterday and he was getting about 45 likes on his stuff and gained 10 followers, and probably half of them are real people. The other half will unfollow after a couple of weeks, but that's fine because if you post 2-3 times a day of insterestinf (or sexy) stuff you'll grow a lot.

Then again I'm sure there's some detail in an interview or part of one of the movies that challenges that.&&Source for them being 8 years apart?&&Bro, reading this made me excited all over again.

10 Cloverfield Lane heavily features an iPhone 6. Howard says something about all the ""kids these days"" saying YOLO. That term was popularised in 2011. 

And if you have time to look into the ARG there are many, many things that make it clear that Lane takes place in 2016.

Jóhann Jóhannsson Dies: ‘The Theory Of Everything’ Composer Was 48,38917,7wmq14,http://deadline.com/2018/02/johann-johannsson-dies-obituary-the-theory-of-everything-composer-1202284591/,1194,1518283186.0,,"That's genuinely sad.

I feel like the guy was just getting started.

&&This is so unexpected and so sad. Jóhannsson's work, particularly on *Sicario* and *Arrival*, was outstanding.

(Important to note that ""On the Nature of Daylight"", from the opening and closing scenes of *Arrival*, is composed by Max Richter. Check him out if you haven't heard of him, another terrific composer.)&&[Just saw Aronofsky tweeting ""fuck no"".](https://twitter.com/DarrenAronofsky/status/962379571084611584) My sentiments exactly. RIP.

EDIT: Seems he's changed it to [devastated.](https://twitter.com/DarrenAronofsky/status/962380825676406786) Still, the sentiment remains the same. Fuck no.&&What the hell? How, why D:?


This is so sudden.&&I genuinely felt like he was a rising star. To a casual moviegoer such as myself not every composer stands out to you and Johann definitely did. He will be missed.&&[deleted]&&Oh, man. This is so sad - he was one of my favorite composers. “The Sun’s Gone Dim and the Sky’s Turned Black” is one of my favorite musical compositions ever (used very effectively in the first trailer for Battle: Los Angeles). His scores for Arrival and Sicario were beautiful as well.

RIP, dude. I’m really going to miss you. &&What the fuck?

God damn it, he was so talented!&&Fuck, this one hits home. After hearing his score for Sicario I became a huge fan of his work. I encourage everyone to look at his non-soundtrack music.

=(=(=(&&He also scored Prisoners (2013) Sicario (2015) and most recently Mother! (2017).  Not sure what happened but 48 is certainly too young for this talented man. RIP.&&Holy shit what? I had to read that title a few times.&&Holy fuck, this one came out of nowhere. His work on Arrival was amazing.&&[The sun's gone dim](https://youtu.be/RPH7LXPZFBo)&&This is what I enjoyed from him the most, so damn cool.


IBM 1401, a User's Manual https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvPKxRMciRs&&WHAT?! NO! 

his score for The Theory of Everything was beautiful.&&Incredibly sad to hear this... especially as an Icelander. Way too young and such a talented composer. He will be missed.&&God fucking damn it. His work on Arrival was some of the most haunting and ethereal stuff I've heard in years.

Rest in peace.&&The sun's gone dim and the sky's turned black.

&&My wife is not taking this well - besides loving his music, she hung out with him for a bit last year taking photos: https://www.flickr.com/photos/kexp/sets/72157680499376054/
&&Absolutely shocking, he had all the potential to be one of the most influential film composers of our time. If anyone hasn't; check out his last album ""[Orphée](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngUnLL4CAck)"". A Haunting and beautiful collection of tracks that was the perfect encapsulation of his work. 

Hvíldu í friði, Jóhannsson.

&&What.... This is just.... So sudden? 48. Damn. His scores were always just so intense and good.

I remember that border scene in Sicario, just beating and making you feel so uncomfortable.

R.I.P. Jóhann&&Reading this news on Twitter caused my jaw to actually drop. I talked to him over email back in 2011 telling him how much his music inspired me to write, and I still listen to it while writing to this day. While it's not much and nothing tangible from him, unfortunately, I'll now cherish that email response. We were robbed years of amazing scores.&&Only started to take notice of his work in ""Sicario."" The piece that has echoes of the ""Jaws"" theme was perfectly unnerving. His work on ""Arrival"" was also amazing.&&Icelander here, everyone is speechless. This is a huge loss to both the international scene, and also the local icelandic scene. He played in two bands that are cult favorites. &&Holy shit! This one hurts a lot&&The Theory of Everything, Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners..

Dude definitely had range, R.I.P. &&fuck&&Was he ill? Is that why he didn't (get to) finish Blade Runner?&&No... Arrival was an incredible soundtrack. We lost a great composer. &&My girlfriend ended up being his go to violinist. She toured with him and knew him well. We all shared a late night drink in London and he was the shyest man. This is such sad news. She was so proud to work with him and he was such a gentle soul. And I was so proud of her. And as people have said, he was just getting started.&&This is heartbreaking. I actually first heard of him from his studio work, before he scored Denis Villeneuve's movies. He has some brilliant albums, my favourite being [""Fordlandia""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og9QtUJZ8iI) which I recommend to anyone who enjoyed his work.&&He’s worked on so many great projects. Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners...they wouldn’t have been the same without him. Only 48, too, what a tragedy.&&Sicario is one of the greatest scores ever. RIP. 48 is too young.&&this has genuinely ruined my day.


he was my favorite ""new"" film composer.  his stuff is so full of emotion and strength. 


fuck this.  fuck this so hard.&&[Jóhann Jóhannsson - IBM 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCyGrcPqB2M)&&This is so fucking tragic. A gem of a talent, taken so soon. &&This is incredibly sad, one of my favorite composers. I had hoped to seem him perform live one day.

I highly recommend listening to his album IBM 1401, A User's Manual
https://open.spotify.com/album/3ZqqvWwHzoVCxwdsaUaF9z?si=rYLoCt4YQQiJheV3-4n6Nw&&Still mesmerised by his Flight From The City (https://youtu.be/AlftMNmDH00). Rip.&&Pretty surreal seeing an Icelandic name at the top of /r/all. 
I am sad to see him pass, but his work will be eternal. Hvíldu í friði vinur, þú gerðir veröldina betri með nærveru þinni. &&Jóhann was aggressively disrupting the ""norm"" of Hollywood music. He's one of the few artists to make the avant-garde experimentation a norm, and it's very sad to think of the decades of music we'll never hear. He would have easily been the John Williams of sound art in this century. &&This might be the first celebrity death that has actually knocked the wind out of me. What a sad day.&&Im absolutely devastated by this news, he was my favorite composer.  Rest in peace Johann&&I was scrolling Facebook just now and saw this exact article. 

I thought nothing of it and then kept scrolling and then it just hit me like a ton of bricks. Holy fuck. I had to scroll back up and read the article title again.

I just can't believe it. 48 is way too young. 

I offer my condolences to his family and those who knew him best. I'll honor him by listening to his beautiful scores, this weekend.&&I'm usually not touched by this kind of news, but this time I am.

This man had its own way to write music by using modern tools; he is an inspiration for me, and I enjoyed a lots of movies thank to the atmosphere his compositions brought.

What a loss.&&This is one of those times when a death feels so sudden... So unexpected and senseless... That I can't help but to feel devastated.

Johann was a legend on the rise. A composer so bold and unique that I was waiting forward to his every project like a kid waits for a mysterious present. I never knew what I was going to get, but every time it was something amazing.

What a great loss this is... 🙁 &&The sun's gone dim...&&Fuck man he was truly making a name for himself :( I am currently doing a mini dissertation on Villeneuve and dedicated a big section the the atmosphere created by Johannsson’s scores and this is just heartbreaking to read honestly &&Johannsson was one of, if not one of my favorite ambient producer still doing work...this is so surprising, so sad. &&I fell asleep listening The Whirling Ways of That Pass last night. Such a beautiful, moving, expressive song. He was truly gifted and will be sorely missed.&&Holy fuck. Such a huge inspiration and one of my favorite composers. I listen to his stuff on a constant basis and I feel like his career was finally taking off—this definitely hurts &&What in the fuck??? Just when he was rising among the ranks of movie composers.&&The music from Arrival was incredibly moving. One of the best scores in recent memory, IMO.&&Sicario was perfected with his music. So raw and dark - [The Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9gcEZMZO8). As a fellow Icelander, I'm deeply saddened by this loss. 

&&I used [some of his music](https://youtu.be/dt7pjz3Vr_4) in a final project for a 2d game engine design course in college. I was listening to it a bunch while developing the game over the semester and on a whim emailed him asking for permission to use it. He responded the same day saying yes, no strings attached, and wishing me luck on the project. Cool guy, great composer.&&I'm not here, this isn't happening&&The hell?Quite sad 

His work with Villenueve was excellent.
&&He is one of my favorites. I absolutely loved “The Beast” from the Sicario soundtrack. I’ve never heard a song that set an ominous and mysterious tone in such a quick and strong way. 

RIP may his legacy and inspiration live on. &&What the fuck. This is so sad. &&The suns gone dim, and the skys turned black.... Truly&&When John Williams was this young he was still yet to do wonderful scores such as E.T., Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Harry Potter. His career had basically just begun skyrocketing with the release of Jaws, Star Wars, and Close Encounters.&&this really hurts.

whenever i want to introduce people to modern classical, Johann Johansson is one of the first people named. 

he is an absolute giant in the world of minimal classical music and set the standard for the current generation of composers making beautiful, pure harmonies which thankfully took us away from the dissonant abomination that is atonal neoclassical music.


i'm heading to a classical concert in a couple of hours, hopefully Johann will be there in the spirit of the musicians... 

rest in peace.

&&Not film related, but Johann was one of my favourite musicians of all time. I thoroughly recommend that if you like his soundtrack work, go find his album IBM 1401, and read alot bit about the story it tells. I woke up the this news this morning and put that album on, and was in tears for its duration.

Vale to one of the best. He really introduced a new genre and world of music to me, setting me off on ambient, experimental and soft adventures. Having his music in my life changed it for the better, and it hurts that I won't ever get to hear new, exciting and innovative work from him.

That's not to disparage his soundtrack work. It took some movies I loved to another level (Arrival) and helped me enjoy some films I might not have otherwise liked (Sicario) &&Aw man... this is very sad. I really enjoyed his work, some very interesting compositions, and I felt there was still so much more to experience. I particularly liked his score for 'Prisoners'.

Very unfortunate news. &&WHAT?! NOOOOOOOOO! He was one of the best composers of this age. The film industry lost one of its best.&&My wife walked down the isle to this from ‘The Theory of Everything’

https://youtu.be/CT1lSHzG4Vs

Thank you 

Rest in peace &&Man, I made a conscious effort recently to listen to movie scores and really fell in love with his score for Arrival. &&Wow, that is not what I expected to hear today. R.I.P., sir.&&Dude WTF?! He’s currently one of my favourite composer and I was just listening to his latest score ‘The Mercy’ holy shit this is so fucking sad :(&&He was a rising star in the film music world. At last year's IFMCA Awards (the Oscars of film music) he won Score of the Year for his work on Arrival. Such a devastating loss for the film scoring community and for music fans in general.&&Sicario, Arrival, Prisoners. The guy was going to do Dune (i think) but that didn't happen obviously.

A human life is a human life, so it's sad no matter who dies, especially at such a relatively young age, but damn. This guy was important, to say the least

really lost a bright one here, RIP&&The trio of him, Villenueve, and Deakins could do no wrong. Those three working together on more films would have been epic. Damn.&&What the absolute fuck, I was JUST listening to his soundtracks yesterday and talking to my friend about what his Blade Runner soundtrack could've potentially sounded like. Holy shit, he was one of my favorites. RIP.&&RIP- he made the world more beautiful in his time here. If only we can all do the same.&&What the fuck NO!!!&&About 8 years ago I was driving hope listening to a public radio station. A song came on that had a melody that just floored me. It was simple and just made everything ok. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxak3rZT3Qc

In some of the hardest points of my life, putting on this song, which I still do, makes things seem ok. Thanks for the music Johann.&&Nooooooooooooo :( this sucks... I've always loved his music. Here a are some of my fav pieces by him

For those saying they were excited to see what he came up with after Arrival, his score for Mandy, which played at Sundance and should come out this year, is phenomenal and definitely not to be missed. Looking forward to hearing his last couple of scores. He'll truly be missed.&&Such a shame, he was so talented.  RIP&&He was on his way to becoming one of the all time greats.  I was so excited to see what he had to show the world in the coming future with his talents.  Listen to this and remember a true genius:

This was my favorite Sicario track. A perfect tension builder. Denis said in the commentary that he told Johann he wanted something luring below, something that was like Jaws, and it was properly named The Beast. Im will pop my Sicario blu-ray in and put on my 7.1 Sony Gold Wireless headphones in your honor.&&I'm in utter disbelief. Rest in piece. ;(&&man, this fucking sucks. i was so hoping to see where his career was going to go, and if he and villeneuve would collaborate again
&&This is one of the more saddening and shocking deaths to me. I've loved Jóhannsson's work, and even got to meet him a few years back. Fantastically talented and kind person. Gone way too soon.&&What the fuck&&R.I.P, he's was a great composer, the work he did with Denis was always phenomenal as well, I'll always remember sicario &&This is extremely unexpected and tragic. He was so young?! His work with Villeneuve was tremendous. &&Orphée was my soundtrack while driving around Iceland. 💙❤️&&Being named Johann not once, but twice made him destined to be a great composer. RIP.&&As an icelander I’ve been following his career for decades.
He was so close to the top.
This is unbelievable tragic.
&&Yo what the fuck this is awful&&I am absolutely devastated. He was my favorite modern composer. I found him with the *Prisoners* film score and loved **everything** he has done since.

This is terrible. He'd been booted off *Blade Runner 2049*, they didn't use his score for *mother!*, and he had so much left to give us musically.

Just awful and sad.&&[Here They Used to Build Ships](https://youtu.be/PWB9P5dTJcU) (from *Copenhagen Dreams*)&&Shit, that’s really sad. His Arrival score blew me away. Easily the most profound sci-fi soundtrack since Goldenthal’s Alien 3 score.&&This is so sad. I remember seeing the video for his song 'Sun's Gone Dim' years ago on YouTube and it moved me for weeks. The video itself is so surreal, but the music is phenomenal. They also used this music a few years later for the film Battle Los Angeles. Can't recommend this song enough. RIP JJ, thanks for the help. &&This is genuinely sad. One of my favorite socres is from Prisoners. Always liked his music, he had a magnificent way to express all kinds of feelings through music. He will be missed :(&&Fuck...I loved his music&&May he RIP. &&This is so heartbreaking! I really looked up to this guy as an Icelandic music student hoping to become a Hollywood composer.&&Arrival is the most sonically pleasing film Ive seen in my 24 years. This man had such a long carreer ahead of him, but the work he gave the world in the time he had is nothing short of genius. &&This is crazy. It feels like he just started his rise to popularity recently, worked on some incredible films in the past couple years, and now he's just gone. 
So sad. &&:(

This will give me a new layer of sadness to Denis Villeneuve's already depressing movies.&&RIP&&The sun has dim, and the sky turned to black...&&The suns gone dim is so good &&The Suns gone dim. :(&&Johann is death process&&May you rest eternally in Valhalla, Jóhann son of Jóhann. &&That's how old my dad was when he died. &&Holy shit. I wonder if he had health problems in private and that has something to do with him ending up not scoring Blade Runner 2049 as initially announced. RIP to a great composer and a hell of a partner for Villenueve. &&What the Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck...... so incredibly sad and shocking. &&He will forever be remembered by me because of THE BEAST.&&Just realized who this was and have recently gotten into his work. Sicario is amazing and on the level of Ennio Morricone. So sad to hear.&&what the fuck&&The Beast 😢&&Dreadful. His music is incredible. To this day his IBM 1401 album is still truly amazing. I could listen to it all day long. :'-(&&Arrival was such an inspirational score for me. Can't believe this is happening. ❤️😥&&How depressing. His works on Arrival and Sicario are some of the best scores that I have ever heard in my life.&&When I first saw this news on Twitter I thought it was a joke/had to read it twice to be sure of what I just read. So gutted. I was also going to get tickets to see him at Sigur Ros' Norður og Niður Festival (was already going for Sigur Ros) but then he had to  cancel. He was one of my favourite composers. His score for the Theory of Everything was the reason I cried the first time I saw the film. It's one of my favourite film scores. He was a talent and will be greatly missed. May he rest in peace.&&Incredibly saddened. Does anyone have a cause of death? &&Nothing will ever quite give me shivers like ""The Beast"" on the Sicario soundtrack.&&Literally came in to say ""I feel like the guy was just getting started"" so I'm glad I'm not the only one who felt that. He left us with such a beautiful body of work.&&Awful news. Terrible loss. ""And in the pause of silence there came the sound of bees"" is my favourite choice for a soundtrack when I'm working. Please listen to it.&&One of the greats. I'm completely torn by this, loved everything he did. rip...&&What the fuck? This is absolutely tragic.&&I am so insanely bummed out about this. I remember much of 2010 onward, having Fordlandia or And In The Endless Pause There Came The Sound of Bees on repeat. It became the soundtrack for endless subway rides after long nights of work, or cab rides through dark February streets at 2am. When he started showing up as a major composer for feature films I was ecstatic, and really looked forward to his score for blade runner 2049.   I really wanted to see his Mother Opera. 

Damn. I guess I know what's going to occupy my spotify play-list for awhile.
&&It’s been a day, does anyone know the cause of death?&&I'm very curious to hear what he had in mind for 2049. The score as it is, is very beautiful, but I have a feeling his would have been a lot more ambient. Such a talent lost. &&Does anyone else just feel angry and like they need to do something? It's hard to explain. It's like i know he has died and i can't reverse it, but i feel a desperate need to change it... I'm just like ""NO!""

He is one of my favorite people in music. I loved his work with Denis who is also one of my up and coming favorite directors.

 I feel i just lost a future full of beautiful and unique music to compliment beautiful films :(&&No no no. He made such great works and it feels like he was just getting started. RIP&&What ?! How ?

No.. Nooo.. Fuck no... :'(&&Holy shit, what the fuck. This guy is the definition of a hero to me, and he was just getting started. He was my favourite film composer from the few scores he did and I am budding to do the same. His work on Prisoners is some of the best ever. Holy shit. &&What an amazing composer :(. This is truly heartbreaking. RIP.&&That's terrible. He was so young and he was such a great composer. I was looking forward to seeing him team up with James Marsh again for The Mercy.&&This is absolutely tragic, my heart goes out to his loved ones. Don't wanna sound generic, but I was genuinely listening to his *Sicario* score last night. Damn, such sad news. &&Well goddamn. 

He was amazingly talented and The Theory of Everything was one of the best scores from that year.  &&Wow I'm stunned&&Gone to soon!&&This is awful. He was such a talented composer and it's a shame that he had to go so young. &&Unbelievably sad news. This sucks.&&Outstanding soundtrack for Sicario. RIP.&&I absolutely love his Sicario and Arrival scores.&&I am really heartbroken by this. ""Kangaru"" from his Arrival score is absolutely beautiful&&[Melancholia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eit-N86m718) from Sicario.&&So young...

He was an incredibly talented composer; what a loss&&He also did Blade Runner 2049. Great composer. Sad to see him go.&&This is so heartbreaking! No joke, I was listening to the Sicario score when I stumbled on this. Sooooo sad!!! &&Such sad news. One of my favorite composers. It seemed like he was only getting started and I was so excited for all his future projects.

His [score for The Mercy](https://open.spotify.com/album/734eHQVYtt20HpPpBY9dug) was released a week ago. Check it out. If you like his other music, this will not disappoint. I'm sure he would have appreciated it.&&This is awful. His soundtracks were always a major reason why the films they were in were so great. I was really looking forward to more Denis/Johann matchups.

He was an incredibly unique Artist and it's a damn shame that the world will never get another masterpiece from him.&&Theory of everything is my favorite sound track ever. &&Shocking news. Superbly talented composer that added so much to the films he scored for. 

Personal favourite is Sicario but love all of his work really. The Theory of Everything Score was also magnificent and a huge contrast to Sicario showing his range. &&:( One of my favorite modern film composer...R.I.P. JJ&&Oh wow. Wtf. He seemed like he had just finally made it to the show after his work with Dennis Villeneuve too.&&I loved his Sicario and Arrival soundtracks. Rest in peace&&So sad. He was a brilliant composer. I was really looking forward to tracking his progression, especially after Arrival which I thought was groundbreaking. RIP&&This is an absolute tragedy. This man had so much beautiful music to give the world and he barely seemed to have begun showing us.&&https://youtu.be/sN9gcEZMZO8
The Beast - Sicario (such a terrifying piece) this man had something really special.&&Heart breaking. &&This was the first time I literally gasped and then shouted ""Noooooooooooo!"" in reaction to a post title. (And I'm at work.) This is so damn devastating. His score on Sicario and Arrival MADE those movies. I remember telling my husband while watching Sicario that ""whoever this new guy is, he's going to give Hans Zimmer a run for his money once he gets a few scores under his belt."" God damnit. &&This is devastating &&Oh man this hurts, his score for Arrival was phenomenal&&Love his 'Odi Et Amo'. Love his work in 'Arrival'. 48 is too early, a very talented composer who was making very beautiful music. May his soul rest in peace.&&It makes sense now why he suddenly came off Blade Runner. Very sad!&&this a huge shock!! I've only just discovered his music when Sicaro and Arrival came out.

this is a horrenduos loss!&&Damn, Arrival was one of my favourite soundtracks. Rest in Piece&&He was my favorite artist, although I never actually wound up listening to any of his soundtracks or more recent works. Virdulegu forsetar, Englaborn, and Dis were amazing.

[His songs were incredibly interesting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxak3rZT3Qc)

[Here is his piece Odi et Amo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hFlsR_y2t4)

[This is from his lesser known work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuLLJ4Q0HJo), Virðulegu Forsetar, which is very difficult to find

I had the opportunity to listen to Virdulegu forsetar while driving through Iceland, and it really is the soundtrack to the landscape.




&&Only really knew hm from his solo works which were incredible. He had decades more to give which is sad. &&Fucking hell such a talented artist &&I hadn't heard his music until Sicario and then especially Arrival. Amazing artist who made films come alive with his art. This really sucks.&&Absolutely gutted to hear this. What a great talent. &&Very unexpected and sad news for music lovers.  My condolences to his family and friends.  &&Dude was a talented composer.  This is absolutely out of nowhere. Rest in peace man&&'The suns gone dim, and the sky's turned black'

This is awful. His work on 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and 'Arrival' are exceptional, and I was looking forward to hearing more of his work. R.I.P.. Very shocking news to read.&&Rest in peace and thank you for the music &&Fuck.  As a long time fan of his, this really floored me.  An incredible discography of music...what could have been only just the beginning.  A huge loss for both music and film.&&A sad day for cinema :(&&RIP :( 

&&Was just listening to Johann when I saw this news. Ive been exclaiming him as my favorite artist since I saw Theory. This makes my heart hurt so bad.&&Damn what a loss. Insanely talented composer. Rip&&I'm so sad about this. One of the few highly original contemporary composers, and not just his film work.&&Well this is awful, I listened to his music nonstop for months to help me concentrate and study...it was so perfect. RIP Mr. Jóhannsson.&&Nooooo

So bummed about this. His work is incredible, original, and captivating. Truly a unique and gifted artist that seemed to have potential to be one of the best. &&Aw man. Fucking hell.&&What the fuck. He's one of my favourite composers. This is sad. &&His music really guided and inspired me during some crucial times in my life. Devastating loss for music and film. &&That's such a tragic loss. He was one of the most promising composers. Arrival had one of the best soundtracks, I've ever heard. Rest in peace.&&This is unexpected and heartbreaking.

He was a talented artist. This is awful.&&WHAT?!? Dude was on such an upswing.. this sucks.. &&my heart broke this morning when I saw this &&Still mesmerised by his Flight From The City (https://youtu.be/AlftMNmDH00). Rip.

&&That moment you you discover the artist you appreciated after his death. Goodbye Mr. Jóhann.&&This is really crushing. He was such a talented composer. I was really excited when it was announced in the early days of production that he would score *Blade Runner 2049*. Was disappointed when it ultimately went to Hans Zimmer (though he did do an excellent job alongside Benjamin Wallfisch) but I heard some of his influences and effort still went into the final product. As a big fan of the original Vangelis score I was hesitant to give any other composer a chance, as I felt it couldn't capture the feel of the film as well. Regardless I was excited because Jóhann's work on *Sicario* and *Arrival* was excellent, and his album *And in the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees* was some really beautiful ambient music. So sad to hear about his death. We truly lost him in his prime. &&I randomly decided to watch Arrival today. After reading through several articles and the Arrival Wikipedia page, I found out he made don't score for it. Damn. All while I was playing the soundtrack of the movie too...&&Have you guys heard his album for the short animated film, *Varmints*? The album is called *And in The Endless Pause There Was The Sound of Bees*. Please listen to it! It is my favourite album by him, followed closely by *Orphée*......He will be missed by his family, friends, and fans alike. And, everyone, continue to spread the word of his beautifully moving compositions, despite his young passing. Perhaps some day, sooner than later, his deserved reverence will be realised!&&I really enjoyed his music including his work seperate from film.

I think the first track from him I heard was [""Sun's gone dim""](https://youtu.be/Iv4CuIIspdE). Pretty great stuff. 

It's a sad day.&&48 is too young no matter how you think about it. Been a fan of his work since ""The Theory of Everything"". 

Rest in peace. &&NOOOOO Omg I love this guy&&I met him a few years ago after he had done he score for Prisoners. Really nice guy. So sad to hear about this :(&&His music helped me finish my thesis. I’m sad :( &&I thought he had the potential to be the next John Williams level of epic film composer &&from the photos he always looked like in late 20s. It is horrible he is gone not even a halfway into his life&&He'd just come to the point where he was ready to establish himself as a true legend. He already was to those in the industry, but he was finally starting to get due recognition from the world at large. So awful, already one of the greats at just 48.&&Yes i feel the same. And in a sense he really was just starting. 48. He should have at least 25 to 30 years of work ahead of him. &&His work on Prisoners was also very good, sad to hear this news&&It was very likely he was going to do the score for Villeneuve's Dune adaptation. I was so excited for that possible score that will now never be. What a shame.&&Indeed.  The Icelandic musician community is in shock.  Jóhann may have risen to international fame as a composer for cinema and modern/classical music, but he was also a member of two iconic Icelandic bands - HAM in the 90s and Apparat Organ Quartet in the 2000s.  Both were hugely influential and popular domestically and worth checking out.  

[HAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9GjJiQn7ws)

[Apparat Organ Quartet- With Johann on vocals!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmePuV7ZZYo)&&If you like his music, I highly recommend listening to [the Song Exploder episode where he takes apart the track ""Heptapod B"" from Arrival](http://songexploder.net/arrival). It's basically a 15-minute interview where he goes over the different parts of the track, how he came up with them, recorded them and how they fit into the whole as you listen to each isolated voice or instrument as he describes it. Then at the end you get to hear the complete piece and it all comes together beautifully.&&His non OST music was something else as well. The [IBM album](https://youtu.be/_o_WF7N73Kw?list=PLIWd-ha17vEmYUE5o_b4WDK_4bSoA4tNj) is one of my favourites suites of music, ever. I didn't think a song featuring a guy reading an installation manual for a printer could bring me to tears. &&Sicario’s soundtrack is benchmark. 1982 Blade Runner Vangelis level masterpiece. 48 is way too young, but at least he left a big mark in cinema.&&His work in Sicario added to 70% of the suspense in that movie. &&His music was used in one of the greatest movie trailers ever https://youtu.be/-Pd-uuDi28U
&&His work on arrival was so different but so perfect. I was really excited to hear what he had come up with next. So sad. 
&&The Miners' Hymns changed my life. This is so sad. &&Oh my god. So distressing. Arrival was absolutely fantastic. Fucking awful.&&This is devastating. He was immensely talented. I only just started getting into his work a few months ago :/ I was legitimately looking forward to whatever he was going to work on next...&&He was one of those composers where I heard he was making the music for a movie and I would see it just because of that. Sad day&&> Max Richter. Check him out if you haven't heard of him, another terrific composer.

also, if oyu like kafka and tilda swinton, check out richter's *the blue notebooks*. 

also, if you like good TV shows, check out *the leftovers*, which features a wonderful max richter soundtrack

also, check out richter's take on vivaldi's four seasons

also, check out richter's *infra* because it's super good&&Wish they wouldnt have robbed him on the chance to score Blade Runner.&&*fuck*, this guy had so much talent. &&Richters work on the Leftovers was superb and more recently his Taboo score was incredible.&&The arrival of the birds is the single greatest piece of classical music I have ever heard. This man was a genius. Very sad he died young.

&&Yeah it took me a while to find that theme as it wasnt in the official ost on spotify. Max Richter is amazing. So sad to hear about Johann, his ost for Sicario was perfect, gives me goosebumps everytime. &&didn't he do a soundtrack to mother! that wasn't used?&&I know he was considering turning mother! into an opera with Jóhannsson. That would have been something truly special. &&[deleted]&&Oh man what a tremendous tremendous tremendous tremendous loss. stunned&&This kinda bugs me. If he changed it himself, fine, that’s his prerogative, but I just have this image of some marketing exec calling him up and telling him that his expression of genuine grief and shock was bad for his brand. &&[deleted]&&48 is way too young and it definitely felt like the best was yet to come for this guy. He's always a highlight in every movie he's done esp his work with Villeneuve. He will be missed. RIP.&&I've never seen something shared on Reddit that had my jaw drop so hard. This guy was phenomenal, his work in movies really resonated with me. I recently listened to a Song Exploder episode with him talking about a track off Arrival. Really really intelligent, intuitive, and artistic guy. His talent will leave a hole in Hollywood. &&[deleted]&&Agreed. I truly expected him to be seen in a decade the way we see Zimmer, Newman, and Desplat today.&&[deleted]&&His death is a tragedy, but his work will live on. That's the beauty of art and expression. &&Masterpiece &&There's a [song exploder](http://songexploder.net/arrival)  about this one

Credit tu /u/ultrabert for digging up the link&&There is also this [hauntingly beautiful piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxDOQSrsy68) from *Sicario*. &&Water!

Water!

What an alpaca!

What an alpaca!&&That was so fucking beautiful. The earth is unfair &&Was about to post this too. This song really defines how unique Johann is.&&Arrival is one of my favorite movies, and I just realized the music must have been one of the major factors for the eerie feeling I constantly had during that movie. I should definitely rewatch it someday.&&Whew, that was exhilarating and relaxing.&&In a movie about language and deciphering it, this track is genius. &&My wife and I just watched Arrival last night and I was singing his praises for scoring... This is so sad, he was incredibly talented&&[Arrival | The Swimmer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gog1PQ3BGfQ)&&No shit, that was him? Awesome. That was the best thing associated with that movie. What a talent. &&Agreed.  “Sun’s Gone Dim” in the Battle LA trailer is so powerfully moving. 
He will be missed. &&IBM 1401: A User's Manual is one of my top 5 albums of all time. This is the most upset I've been about a musicians. I seriously can not believe this happened...&&Check out the whole IBM album. The guy was special. &&The trailer was the first thing that came to mind when I saw the news. Shame the film didn't live up to the epic feel the song gave the trailer. RIP. &&https://youtu.be/-Pd-uuDi28U&&> “The Sun’s Gone Dim and the Sky’s Turned Black”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4CuIIspdE&&The [Sun's Gone Dim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4CuIIspdE) for sure.&&His non soundtrack stuff is so bold and daring. A bit cheesy to put it like that but true. I went to sleep to IBM 1401 for months. &&Yeah, Sicario had a badass ost. I was pretty disappointed when I saw he was removed from Bladerunner 2049, but his influence was still clearly there.&&i thought mother didn't have a score at all? at least i don't remember any music.&&He also was the original composer for Blade Runner 2049. [Here's one of his tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-JjKuFNbNs). While I loved Zimmer's work on 2049, I think that it probably would have been even better with Johansson's score.&&The Theory of Everything is superb &&That Mother! score fucked with my head.

We will massively miss the music he never got the chance to make. &&I wonder if he scored Sicario 2, which comes out this summer and looks as absolutely great as the first movie. 

Update: he didn’t work on it. Icelandic cellist Hildur Guðnadóttir did.&&Same. Really hoped I had read it wrong.&&You should hear his work in Sicario. I had just found out he did the score to it not too long ago. Such a sad thing to happen.&&Tears me right up&&Probably the most appropriate time to play this...&&The follow-up, Fordlandia, was fairly amazing as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og9QtUJZ8iI

> I recorded some pipe organ and the low frequency guitars towards the end in a cavernous church in Drammen, Norway. The ending is a 5 minute long continous ritardando, quite possibly the longest one ever on record, should anyone care...&&I have many great memories while listening to this album&&I had to read the headline like five times before understanding it... [Cambridge, 1963](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J7vyQpWsyA) is one of my most favorite pieces of movie music. &&The Whirling Stars That Pass is still the most beautiful minute of music I've ever heard.&&You guys have some of the best musicians in the world.&&Is music a big thing in Iceland? It is astounding how many extraordinarily talented musicians come out of there.  

The ones I seem to enjoy at least all share a kind of open, dissonant, and beautiful quality to their music. So much emotion despite either a lack of vocals, or vocals in a language that I don't speak. &&YES. This soundtrack has haunted me since I first heard it and I listen to it often. The movie wouldn't have been half as good without his innovative genius. So sad.&&I encouraged many of my friends in the musical community to see Arrival on basis of the score alone (and also because it's an incredible film, my favorite of 2016). I told them that it's the perfect example of a film score. Jóhannsson is a legend and will be remembered. &&Your wife was lucky to get to know him. This is sad :(

I was hoping I could see him live in concert one day. I was looking forward to his future music. It makes me so sad thinking about it.&&Great photos. &&PLEASE post this separately so it won't get hidden, these are so incredible and alive! Amazing moments captured.&&Those are some lovely photos, what movie/work was it from?&&incredible photos though. Do you know if the Johannsson family is aware of these photos? They're stunning. &&These photos are incredible.&&This. Soundtrack stuff is obviously great, but this is on another level. &&His last score also just came out called ""The Mercy."" The second collaboration with James Marsh &&Yes Orphée is so good. It was the soundtrack of one of my last trip. God damn it this fucking sucks. I'm really sad right now.

I think I first started appreciating him with his ""IBM manual"" album. It's very geeky and atmospheric, people should check it out.&&Which two bands are those?&&From the interviews I read, Denis always said that it didn't work out with Jóhannsson and that he was looking for another kind of soundtrack.


I mean, unless I'm wrong, Jóhannsson recently did the OST for Mandy, by Panos Cosmatos, which just premiered for the first time a few weeks ago, so I think he was still active and working, right?&&> I thought nothing of it and then kept scrolling and then it just hit me like a ton of bricks. Holy fuck. I had to scroll back up and read the article title again.
> 

this is exactly what happened to me. I scrolled past it, and then thought wait what? surely i've misread... and then i went back up and it just... horrible. 
&&Of course the real sad thing is the people who loved him who are left behind and I don't mean this in any disrespectful way, but be we as movie fans also lost something. Like you said, potentially one of the true greats.&&He was definitely on his way to being a household name, Maybe not John Williams status, but definitely Hans Zimmer.&&He was talented, but I truly don't believe he had the mass appeal and approachability that John Williams has. &&Actually, it appears he went all the way through life.  Anyone of us  could be gone tomorrow.&&I was really hoping wed get to see the two reunited for another film in the future :(&&I know him because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4CuIIspdE) from seeing the Battle Los Angeles trailer.  It alone made that movie seem epic&&Oh no :( arrival was one of my favorite soundtrack. It is making me very sad. What a loss &&i got his record englaborn from soulseek when i was like 13 after reading the review on pitchfork. i wasn't into classical or ambient music at all at the time, but i was totally hooked after that. he was definitely a huge influence on my taste in music.&&Shoutout song exploder absolutely adore every episode&&I've said this before, but Heptapod B is one of the few instrumental pieces I have in this 450+ song Spotify playlist. It's such a wonderful, intricate piece that works on its own, almost like musical Morse code, and also works in tandem with the movie proper.&&yes, this is a great interview indeed. &&Great interview, thanks for posting it. I can’t believe he’s gone. &&That was fascinating, thanks for sharing.&&Orphee is one of my favorites of his to read to.&&This is the album that introduced me to Jóhann Jóhannsson. IBM is a master piece.&&Englabörn is so good.&&An absolute favorite of mine. Listening to The Sun's Gone Dim on repeat right now.&&Englabörn and Dís are another two of my all time favorite albums. The way he managed to capture emotion in his work is perfect.&&Hi IBM album is always what I think of when I think of him, fantastic album&&That album is one of the greatest of all time. I'm on my phone but people should look into the context of it. His dad is arguably one of the first people to create music on computers, and that album perfectly encapsulates the beauty in even the most basic synchronistic music.

I'm truly heartbroken that he died.&&[deleted]&&Immediately what I thought of. Such an amazing song.&&Never saw that movie but I'm grateful for it for giving us that song &&You have no idea how long I’ve been trying to find this song. It’s been so long I’d started to think I imagined having ever seen this trailer. Thank you. &&He first came to my attention with this trailer, what a beautiful track. &&Me too. They being dead yet speaketh...&&>Richters work on the Leftovers was superb

He's one of the main reasons I watched the show. Did not disappoint, and I loved his use of ""November"" as well.&&Yeah, they experimented and gradually came to the conclusion that it would work better without music and they used more kind of ""noises"".&&He was the sound consultant iirc. Amazing work like always.&&>“I mean for me, there’s a certain beauty in that,” says Jóhannsson, on the phone from his studio in Berlin. “It’s like a sculpture. You start with a slab of granite or marble, and you carve things out. And in this case, we carved out all the granite, all the marble. And none of it was left. That was just the reality of it—and that was what the film wanted. That was what *Mother!* basically demanded.”

https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/mother-movie-jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-score-johann-johannsson/amp?__twitter_impression=true&&according to IMDb, yes (it ended up having no score)&&mother! had an incredibly subtle soundtrack, and Jóhannsson was working his way up to becoming one of the all-time great composers for film. This is a devastating blow to movie lovers.&&Would have been better in that form of entertainment.&&I don't get the downvotes. I feel the same way.&&He was Denis Villeneuve’s boy. I was waiting for him to sign on for Dune and give us his LOTR/Star Wars level masterpiece.

We’ve truly been robbed of such a talent today.&&This guy wrote really powerful and atmospheric scores. What a loss. &&Never heard this before, here's the link http://songexploder.net/arrival&&That SongExploder episode is one of the best. He’s so articulate about his art. &&I thought that was just creative differences but that could've been cover for an illness. &&I don't think so, the articles always mentioned that Jóhannsson's OST simply wasn't working out for Denis, and he parted from the project on good terms... I mean, he still did other work in the meantime, so I don't think that's it.&&As far as i know his score was basically finished. I think there's a work in progress cut that has it. Plus, he was playing shows up until last week, so i don't think there were any long-standing health issues here &&Well, that was definitely interesting.&&I didn’t realize that Beaker could sing so beautifully.&&Too much art for me, lol.  &&Yeah, but there will be no more, which is a right pisser.&&http://songexploder.net/arrival
That was super interesting.
the site is a goldmine, thank you. &&Found my new favorite podcast. Thanks for the link!&&I knew it was gonna be Desert Music. I remember sitting down and listening to the whole soundtrack and the swell in this piece with the strings gave me hardcore chills.&&You motherfucker.&&YouTube [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv4CuIIspdE) for the lazy.&&Totally agree. One of my faves too.&&I always put it on for long drives. Beautiful album&&This was my first exposure to him, through the trailer for [Battle: Los Angeles](https://youtu.be/-Pd-uuDi28U). The trailer blew my fucking mind, particularly because of this song. It was a ""holy shit, is this a real experience?"" type of moment.&&I knew I recognized his name! Ive never really searched out his music, but I heard that song once and had to get it. Now I guess I should check the rest out.&&Fordlandia
Orphee 
And In the Endless Pause There Came the Sound of Bees

All great as well.&&IBM 1401 is simply incredible.

Getting to hear some of it live was one of the highest points of my music-loving life. &&Finally. Some one else who liked his original work. Fordlandia changed my life and put me to sleep for months. &&Holy fuck I just clicked that the soundtrack Johann is the same as the IBM album Johann. I haven't watched most of the movies he scored, but I love that IBM record a lot. Damn. &&Always loved his music, was so glad he was getting huge soundtracks in the past 5 years! Really really really want to hear the work he did for blade runner, was so sad when he got replaced&&IBM 1401 is just amazingly beautiful. I feel the same way about Fordlandia. &&He composed a score but [they decided not to use it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother!#Music)&&You're correct that it didn't have any score. But he did originally write one. [Here's an article about it.](http://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/mother-score-eliminated-johann-johannsson-darren-aronofsky-sound-design-1201874404/)


He was also working/talking with Aronofsky about an opera of mother!

I hope that maybe one day we get to hear what he composed for mother!&&While I agree with you, I'm 95% sure that's fake.&&I agreed that it was interesting. Would have loved to see what his actual work for 2049 would have been, but Zimmer and Wallfisch's score fit the film so perfectly that I don't bother dwelling on what could have been because what is was so amazing.

Rest in peace, you wonderful and talented man. &&[Forces of Attraction](https://youtu.be/CT1lSHzG4Vs)from that one is always going to be my favorite piece of his. The score didn't really impress me until the beach scene, but his work there was really unbelievable.&&I vividly remember being in the cinema watching Socario thinking Johannsson is nailing this soundtrack. Loved every second of that film, helped in no small part by that thumping percussion. Fucking gutted&&I haven't seen that yet, and I need to go fix that.&&Fordlandia, the entire album, was the soundtrack to one of the toughest years of my life. It helped me through that time, and it is so very special to me. I'm so saddened to hear of Johannsson's death, but his genius lives on in all of his works. &&Hearling fordlandia live (the highlight, i guess, 100% amazing concert from start to finish) was soul-shaking.&&So true. I was looking forward to seeing Jóhannsson at Sigur Rós' *Norður og Niður* festival in Reykjavík last month but he couldn't make it because his flight plans got messed up or something of that sort.&&Yes. From SoundCloud rapping to orchestras, it's huge. Sports and music are our thing.&&It's a society that has figured out a lot of things other societies haven't, so it makes sense that more people would be free to pursue their true passions ...&&I think her sadness is not just for Johann, but the amazing people she briefly met from his community that must be equally devastated. The incredible (and incredibly nice) musicians he brought on the tour, his fantastic manager, etc.&&[Live on KEXP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIaS60-y5Vo)&&This was during his US tour last year. It was an in-studio (closed to the public)  performance at a radio station. Video on YouTube https://youtu.be/TIaS60-y5Vo&&The album had ~50 views before today, so unlikely they saw these.&&One of my wife's favorite moments: Johann doing air guitar while describing a song: https://www.flickr.com/photos/kexp/34545216426/in/album-72157680499376054/&&I love how he put a soundtrack behind a verbal lesson in, if I remember correctly, changing the toner cartridge of a printer. 

He was such a unique composer, both personally and in films. I’m glad he was able to give us his music. &&Apparat organ quartet is one, not sure if the other&&Olympia, Unun, and Ham apparently.&&I heard it was a heart attack :/&&Damn Denis should honor him to release his version of the Blade Runner soundtrack!&&Completely agree, hearts go out for people who lost him on a personal level.

But yes as /r/movies it's certainly tragic to see a potencial rock star like himself have thier life dashed short&&Agreed. I also felt this with Esbjörn Svensson, he was on the brink of greatness.&&every director who dreamed of getting to work with him.&&I think he had the potential, but we'll never know&&I feel like Hans Zimmer is more famous than John Williams. At least in Russia he is.&&I agree.&&To be fair, it's likely that no composer will ever have the mass appeal that John Williams has. He composed the scores for 3 of the top 10 films at the domestic box office (adjusted for inflation) and 8 of the top 20. No one else even comes close to that (the only other person who even has 2 in the top 20 is James Horner for Titanic and Avatar).&&Somewhat pedantic, right? They were referring to life expectancy. It doesn't make them ignorant to the realities of life. &&I think we were all hoping for a 'Dune' reunion, that could have been something else. Damn, this sucks. What a loss for the film/music community. &&Me too, I was so excited when he was announced as the composer for Blade Runner 2049, a shame it didn't work out for the film.&&Imagine how trite that trailer could have been with the typical trailer music, Hans Zimmer booms and all the current trendy bells and whistles.  

That piece of music was probably more responsible for actually getting people into the cinema to watch that movie than anything else.  Jóhann should have gotten percentages on that crappy movie.  
&&Holy shit that song is heavy. &&That trailer totally got me into him and Nil Frahm and Erik Enocksson. Changed my musical life.&&[deleted]&&can you link the playlist? thanks &&I quite enjoyed it&&Shh bby is ok&&Article states he was credited as the composer&&I saw Darren at the TIFF screening and he said most of what Jóhannsson made was not put into the movie because they both believed the movie did better without it. That is why he wanted to make an opera, to put all of the great tracks he made to use. 

His score got scrapped for blade runner as well. Kind of a bad year for the guy but I hope we get to hear some of these works at some point. Really great stuff in the films from previous years. &&I loved that movie. It’s not for everyone but people act like they’re owed something else on it.&&God he was perfect for Dune. He really helped set the tone for those movies, they wouldn't be the same without him. &&Denis said himself, Deakins, Joe Walker, and Johannsson made a very tight unit. When his score for 2049 was rejected, I had a bad hunch:(&&I really wanna hear his unfinished Blade Runner 2049 soundtrack. Shame we will never hear his side of the story as of why it wasnt used. The [first trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haXvp8M9Cog) had such an awesome tone to it.&&I discovered him late but he instantly became one of my favorite composers. He had a unique creative mind and I will miss his music.. &&The soundtrack to Sicario is one of the biggest factors that sucked me into that movie as deep as it did. &&[deleted]&&According to [Craig Mazin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/clmazin/status/962388858351452160) Johannsson had just signed to compose his HBO Chernobyl series, so definitely wasn't a long-term illness that was well-known. &&highly doubt it, he was just announced as part of the lineup for Primavera Sound&&i’m scared&&Get enough confidently insane people in one room and shit like this happens &&Nanananananaaaananananana﻿&&Battle LA and Terminator Salvation, films which trailer was better than the whole film.

Also trailer #3 of Battle LA has the song too.&&How god I knew his name was familiar. How We Left Fordlandia is a favorite of mine. What a loss to the industry. :(&&Well that's just heart breaking. Imagine pouring yourself into a literal work of art and they tell you they've decided not to use your work :(&&I’m with you. Had tickets and couldn’t make it. This is so tragic.&&It's kind of fascinating. A product of long winter evenings?&&I visited Iceland last year. on one of the days of casual city-seeing we decided to go to Hallgríms Church. the organ that was playing in that church was one of the most impressive things I have ever felt. such raw power behind it but still so beautiful.&&Really, where? Do you mind linking a source or something?&&Rock star is spot on. His work really did embody this larger than life quality, especially the film scores and how they built up and became a part of the films in a way not every composer accomplished. 

This hit me like a ton of bricks. I read the headline about 10 times before it actually computing. &&Yeah John Williams is pretty iconic in the states. Between Star Wars and Indiana Jones he was shot up to the likes of Beethoven. It makes sense that he’s not as big in Russia, he was at his prime during the Cold War. &&Our generation will never see another John Williams. It’ll probably be 100 years past Star Wars original release before someone can be fairly recognized as just being inspired by Williams rather than an imitation. &&James Horner who also died tragically young. &&I would have thought Hans Zimmer would be up there. I would certainly describe him as someone with ""mass appeal"" as well&&Yeah, it's a damn shame. The Villeneuve / Deakins / Jóhannsson powerhouse has made some of the best films ever in my opinion. 48 is entirely too early to go. I hope he didn't suffer.&&Yea - he was one of the main reasons I was excited for a potential new Dune. Tragic, especially so young.&&Came to say pretty much the same. I was fond of his work for being music I would listen to on its own merits regardless how I felt about the film (*The Arrival* *was* beautiful, however). Very sad indeed. 😿&&I actually loved the score and soundtrack for 2049. It really sets the right time and pays homage to the first film really well. A sad loss indeed, RIP and thank you, Johansson.&&I kind of want to see his work on the film if they have it. It would be cool to listen too. &&Hans Zimmer is actually quite capable of doing subtle, moving scores as well (check out his work on Last Samurai for example); but I get what you're saying. &&>Max Richter did most of the heavy lifting on Arrival. It’s pulled mostly from his 2004 album Blue Notebooks. 

False. The only Max Richter is ""On the Nature of Daylight"" in the beginning and ending scenes. That track is very powerful for the film, but to say the score is ""mostly"" Richter isn't true.&&To me the heavy lifting stuff came from Heptapod B, Hydraulic Lift+First Encounter, and Kangaru that I love the most from the Arrival soundtrack.&&[Avast!](https://open.spotify.com/user/22urizyusxr6l73ncw6pe33my/playlist/3NjP9hCtRVhGp9mbOopbF5?si=oQVzrL6iSZOVZaplkx46WA)&&Indeed, very whelming.&&Yeah, but the movie doesn’t have a soundtrack, because what he wrote wasn’t used. so he basically was more of a consultant.&&I also just appreciate studios taking a chance on super weird shit.&&I felt incredibly misdirected by marketing, which made me angrier as the film went on, but I can't blame that on the film itself. Oh well.&&What do you mean? Depression?&&What hunch?&&Trailer music is almost NEVER composed by the movie's composer. It's usually from something else the studio owns or bespoke trailer music.&&\#ReleaseTheDemo&&I have no idea why it wasn't used, but if I had to speculate it's either A) oversight by Warner Bros who wanted a bigger name tagged to the film (hence the Zimmer colab) or B) there's some background problems with Vangelis and the score (intentionally) borrowed too many of his themes. If you listen to the final score, the original theme is pretty much non-existent if memory serves me right - it's not very listenable so I haven't returned to it again. &&You don't just have a heart attack in your 40s without some other larger issue at hand.

EDIT: Yes, it's possible it was a genetic condition, but in Hollywood I'd say the odds are on lifestyle choices that would make the heart attack less of a surprise.&&He was supposed to play at a festival in May, too.&&Actually from what I've read, it was at least partially his idea&&He still heavily collaborated with the director on the sound design of the film, I don't think he considered it a loss at all. &&Wikipedia said he and afronsky agreed not to use it and went with a minimal score using the score at certain points&&Yes partly, but I have to give the most credit for the platform young musicians are given to break through. Every year we have a huge contest for bands with members aged under 25 and the winner is handed a record deal, Of Monsters and Men originally won that competition, Kaleo who are also worldwide first made their mark when they finished 2nd (iirc) in that competition. Then also our young musicians have unlimited support from our biggest radio stations who push them to keep going every day.&&Drinking, knitting, and making the world’s best music...&&Unfortunately my best friend's mate is a family friend of Jóhann's so no link available. Will comment a link if the Icelandic press has any official update on it!&&Yeah, I think it's fair to say that John Williams is the consensus pick for greatest composer alive.

(Yes, I know, I am sure you have your favorites, and may think he is overrated. I said ""consensus pick."")&&Djawadi has the most potential. He’s already done some amazing work with GOT and Westworld, and he’s barely 40. Probably still has another 40 years of music in him. &&I don't think our generation will ever see another Spielberg or Kubrick either. &&His only movie in the top 20 is The Lion King. The Dark Knight is at 31, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is at 49, and The Dark Knight Rises is at 68. While Zimmer only has 4 movies in the top 100, Williams has 18.&&Couldn’t agree more with this comment&&Yeah but that music was by Hans Zimmer, who replaced Johansson. The guy was saying it was a shame Johansson couldn’t work out with the film.&&Yes, but it was the most memorable piece from the whole film. Which I think is the idea he's trying to get across.&&[and if you look at the actual original soundtrack, Richter’s not even on there.

Mixed reviews on a movie like that don’t seem like a bad thing to me. It makes me sad that taking risks is a dying concept for most studios.&&I’m happy that they made it, but if I hadn’t read a review I would have been completely weirdered out.  &&Never trust marketing. Their job is to get your butt in the seat, not to show you what you're gonna get.&&It was such a hard film to market. &&IMHO trailers have been shit for years. I can't trust a trailer to not ruin an entire film for me, so I don't even watch them anymore. I actually avoid them. 

For mother! it worked out well because I actually ended up enjoying the movie the same way I enjoy every other movie--by having no expectations and letting the plot develop in the exact manner that the film makers intended. 

I know that some trailers are better than others, I just choose not to risk it anymore. &&Almost never sure.

Stress, overwork and lifestyle choices. 

The possibility of fucking up your health doesn't start at 60.

&&I have a friend who is obese and smokes, had 3 heart attacks before 38. Dick Cheney had his first heart attack at 37.

Djawadi has an amazing range, spanning so many different (cinematic) genres.&&Oh wow I did not know that thanks for pointing that out. Zimmer, wow.&&It was actually more Benjamin Wallfisch than Zimmer. &&It's absolutely the most memorable, and has the biggest impact on the film. But to say that the score is ""mostly"" from Richter is false. The vast majority of the music is Jóhannsson, and we shouldn't discount his contribution to the score just because a track was used from Richter's (fantastic) collection.&&Wait, really? I thought the music for when they see the ship for the first time was the most memorable - the way it built and then got uncomfortably loud and weird with every shot of the ship.&&Arronofsky=weird...that's all you need to know going into any of his films&&Very interesting - thank you for sharing! While I love Zimmer's work, I hate that he came onto this seemingly out of obligation instead of want.

I knew though it wasn't Max Richter because the song I heard from Arrival which was ""On the Nature of Daylight"" was actually from Shutter Island. But I also knew that it wasn't originally for that movie but instead from his album The Blue Notebooks.

INTERLINKED

DOES YOUR WAIFU PUT YOU IN A LITTLE BOX? INTERLINKED.

C-CELLS.

YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BASELINE, WEEB.&&Do I need to watch the original first? &&Absolutely incredible film. I loved every minute of it. It lived up to everything.&&I just saw the OG Blade Runner for the first time and then immediately watched 2049. I felt like they had been planned together the entire time. &&Do I watch the original first?&&This is the only film that I ask ""who's the cinematographer?"" after watching.&&Sucks that it flopped at the box office. Really was not expecting that.&&Deserved it, too. Incredible shots from that film.&&[deleted]&&Shunned at Oscar nominations but who gives a fuck! Best movie of 2017&&That Deakins hasn’t won an Oscar already is baffling to me. &&It was kino&&I was in absolute rapture for every second of the film. &&This film blew me away, yet none of my peers seemed phased by it for some reason...

It broke me in a way that I don't even really know how to articulate. It was so fucking good. That soundtrack... maybe its the soundtrack... almost exclusively supplied the LFE for the film  - And goddamn it was some cavernous depths; perfectly mimicking the brutalist nature of the architecture. Even from an audio engineering perspective this film is a masterpiece. &&Incredibly audio visual movie.  I really enjoyed it but I didn't think the story was too great.  I have only watched it once, so it may take another viewing. I still really enjoyed my time watching it. I wish I had a 4k oled...but my plasma still does incredibly well for the visuals.

I never thought we would get another 80s ish cyperpunk movie, probably the only way it would happen today is if it had a big name slapped on it...e.g Blade runner. No way a studio would make one standalone... even more so considering it wasn't a big money maker.  Sad, at least the genre is popular in video games.

I see a lot of people thought it was was way too slow, not much dialogue..I thought that was the best part.  

EDIT- Wasn't a big money, not was.&&I thought BR 2049 was very pretty, but the plot was a bit wtf. Not as good plot-wise as BR. Ultimately I find it very disappointing how much cool stuff from the source novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is not included in either film. 
I want to see PKD done right on the big screen. &&Totes deserves it, too. I was definitely in aww of some of the scenes and action/choreography. &&While i didn't much care for the movie itself, there is absolutely no denying that each and every image in it was stunning. &&So I just watched Blade Runner 2049 yesterday night while I was on a fair amount of LSD, and I highly recommend it to everyone. Seriously the entire movie was almost made for it. The art is absolutely incredible in every single way, the soundtrack and sound effects are perfect and even though I quite literally had no idea what was going on most of the time, I fell in love with this movie. 11/10 would recommend. &&The flyover of downtown, on Joe's return trip home,  the light from the wider drags trying to escape the suffocating blackness of the overpopulation Hell, holy crap that was so well shot.  It really did convey hopelessness for our race.   Well done.  Its not a movie it's art.&&Here is an analysis about it’s cinematography. https://youtu.be/lF5lmYgoYEM&&Fell asleep watching this. It just droned on and on but I agree the cinematography was gorgeous.&&It was an absolutely amazing movie. The images, the story, the many layers all of it worked together.. So great&&I never rated the original. But this sequel was absolutely incredible. &&I really need to see this movie but I'm afraid I won't understand it without watching the first bladerunner&&Non-Newtonian sci-fi for the win! Hopefully altered carbon will increase popularity in this sub-genre.  &&I think this is a film-makers film, art direction and sound design was outstanding. &&I was really looking forward to this movie but it fell flat for me.  Slow, plodding, contrived are just a few words that come to mind.  I should have felt huge and ethereal but it felt claustrophobic and predictable instead.&&Now give Deakins his god damn Oscar already. &&Long and drawn out. Didn't see the need for it to be that long.&&It was a beautiful film. Well deserved. &&Do I have to watch the first one before this to enjoy it?&&This will be my first 4k purchase. Hospital the TV and this will do it justice&&i love how they take picture, it's look like not normal for Sci-Fi movie. No hand-held-effect, ""the art of silence"" is wow amazing.

and i believe this is best movie i ever see in last year, or maybe in 2 years or maybe more.&&It looked lovely, just shame the rest of it was empty, hollow and overlong. 

I think Rutger Hauer summed it up perfectly after watching premier 'They should have left it alone' 

In years to come 2049 will be forgotten&&I found this movie boring.  Loved the original.  &&I might be alone here but I thought the film kinda sucked. I hadn't seen the original so maybe I'm missing a big frame of reference. I just kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. I understood a robot was able to give birth but I didn't really get the point beyond that. And if I needed to see other supporting material to even understand the movie, that's a bad movie imo.&&I enjoyed this movie, but the amount of praise it's getting is really starting to bother me.

They just took a ""the one"" story line and slapped a ""bladerunner"" skin on it.

Again, the movie was enjoyable and visually stunning (again, bladerunner skin but with modern technology), but to sit here and act like it was this stellar creation is just kind of asinine.

The original bladerunner (do Androids dream of electric sheep) was great because it passed a question: ""at what point should we empathize for our creations?""

Bladerunner 2049 didn't add to that. Again, it was just a typical ""you are 'the one'"", cookie cutter bull shit story that we've seen a thousand times with the usual twist ending.

I enjoyed it, and I hate to be a buzz kill, but in the end it's just another reboot. It's actually kind of sad, because I was beyond excited for the movie to come out... But it's unfortunately true.&&It was a beautiful film with lots of great art direction. But I found it too boring for theater consumption. I feel like Westworld was a more entertaining take on those same questions. 

I'm just glad Harrison Ford got to be in it before he passes. Can't do a Blade Runner without him. Look forward to seeing a sequel.

Edit: passes, not passed. Ford's still alive.&&The plot sucked&&I found it a bit boring myself... but nice. Never dislike sci fi... The girl hologram was a bit of a fantasy :D &&I'm the only one that found this movie long, boring and shallow?&&Why does a film bathed in orange and teal win a cinematography prize in 2018?&&blade runner had me up until the diversion to go meet harrison ford as harrison ford

they need to stop putting him in movies he's completely immersion-breaking by now.&&Normies btfo

Sometimes the best movies are ones where something ISNT happening every 30 seconds. &&This film is so underrated&&Yeah he's the runaway favourite to win. &&The only other films that even stand a chance are Dunkirk and The Shape of Water, and although they're both beautifully shot they're nowhere near on the same level as BR2049.&&Honestly, I don't get it.

Blade Runner 2049 was the best film I've seen this century.&&Movie of the year.&&Who he?&&Please&&agreed, I really think this movie was amazing &&Yes..! all three shorts added so much great context. I only discovered them way after I originally saw 2049 in theaters. &&Shinichiro Watanabe is a godly director. Watch some of his shorts in the Animatrix, or Cowboy Bebop.&&Anime short?&&scored by Flying lotus &&Nick nack? &&I second this opinion.&&can you recommend others that are similar?&&Agreed. Best Sci-fi film to come out in years. &&Me too. Like everything about it. It was so damn immersive. It makes you yearn to be in that world even though it's a shitty world to live in. &&Hey, I did. 5 times.&&People went to see it. Sure, it didn't make a profit, but that's just because of how big its budget was. It made more money than The Shape of Water, Three Billboards, Lady Bird, and Call Me By Your Name have combined.&&They did, just not in droves like the emoji movie.&&I went with my dad opening weekend. Both of us being big Bladerunner fans, we left happy, despite there being some tonal differences between the films. 

The biggest difference we noted between the 2 films was the way violence was used and portrayed. The violence in 2049 was much more Hollywood, and less visceral as the original's. 

It was probably done as part of an attempt to make it slightly more approachable for modern theater audiences, while not completely invalidating the feel of the original. 

But it still didn't smash any Box Office numbers, most likely because of the ""art"" label so often associated with Bladerunner. 

If 2049 had been generic action fluff, the Bladerunner fans would have rioted and decried it as a bad sequel, causing bad press. 

And because it's not some generic action fluff and already has an established label of ""sophisticated art"", generic casual movie goers won't go to see it, instead opting to save their time and money for the generic movies they prefer. 

Not saying that generic movies are bad, or that casual movie goers shouldn't enjoy them, but it's not surprising that 2049 didn't smash any records. 
&&I went alone because none of my friends/family wanted to watch a “geeky sci-fi” movie. Their loss, it was wonderful. I’m a huge Blade Runner fan and I wasn’t about to miss the screening of 2049, but unfortunately I didn’t have time to go watch more than once.&&I was shocked to see an empty cinema win I first watched it. Some dudes even left half way through &&Can't blame people, it has to be your cup of tea. I really liked it, felt a lot like the original blade runner. I went with friends who saw the original years ago and they complained the film was pretty slow. I told them the original was aswell, but apperently they forgot that.

If you don't like the setting there is really nothing to grab your attention in the film. So I think it has a somewhat niche audience.&&""nobody""?&&This killed its box office:  
- R Rating  
- Long runtime  
- Unrevealing trailers &&Can Reddit please stop thinking that they are some kind of film conisseurs for enjoying the ""art house"" underrated gem that is Blade Runner 2049? Yes, people went to see it. It made $260 million at the box office. It wasn't hugely profitable, yes, but don't pretend that people didn't see it.&&Stuff a Marvel intro at the beginning and you'll have the profit threefold.&&i did twice, one of the best films ive watched &&I recall practically having the theater to myself just high as fuck enjoying the entire ride&&It's a master piece imo&&I went to watch it and watched the 4k version recently as well. I'm so glad to know that it's just a good. Although when I did go to watch it there were a bunch of teenagers and a few kids (for some fucking reason) that understood zero shit. Maybe that's why the film tanked? &&I loved it, Jared Leto's character was a joke though. I'm glad we didn't see much of him.&&I think you’d do yourself a disservice if you skip the original. Even if you’re not a huge fan it provides enough context that will help you understand the sequel a lot more. I also think even if you don’t love the original it doesn’t mean you won’t really enjoy 2049. &&No, but if you don't, and you like it, and want to watch the first one, you'll just have wished you watched it in order.&&I'll just copy paste what I said to someone else who asked. Short answer ""not really but you will understand what's going on much more easily if you do)

>Yes. But I'll warn you, the original is a slow burn noir film with a sci-fi/cyberpunk veneer. It takes its time telling the story. It is about questioning rather than a satisfying conclusion. I think a lot of people who watch it now have the expectations of a science fiction film when that isn't what it is at its core at all. But it will explain a lot of what's going on in the new film and give better context to the world. 

>It's absolutely one of the best films of all time and one of the strongest examples of 'show-dont-tell' world building ever. I still prefer it over the new one, that being said I love the new one. Please watch it :) the Final Cut&&For God's sake, yes. Harrison Ford's character, and a couple of others who make appearances in ""2049,"" are where they are directly because of the first film's story. I didn't like ""2049"" at all, but if you're going to watch it you need to set it up with the first one.&&I thought Blade Runner 2049 was simply a ""good"" film, but *Blade Runner* (Final Cut) is my favorite film of all time. Watch it first.&&Looks like we're family now.&&Which version of the OG Blade Runner did you see? There's a Theatrical Version, and Director's Cut, and The Final Cut. The Final Cut is the best one. &&Yes. But I'll warn you, the original is a slow burn noir film with a sci-fi/cyberpunk veneer. It takes its time telling the story. It is about questioning rather than a satisfying conclusion. I think a lot of people who watch it now have the expectations of a science fiction film when that isn't what it is at its core at all.

It's absolutely one of the best films of all time and one of the strongest examples of 'show-dont-tell' world building ever. I still prefer it over the new one, that being said I love the new one. Please watch it :) the Final Cut&&Certainly. Use a good sound system, too. That synth is... *cums*

Edit: this song gives me such intense chills: 

https://youtu.be/9FxwHfoWdS8

(On spotify as well)&&Yes&&No need at all.&&Yes but for goodness sake don't watch the narrated version. I thought I'd just put it on for the umpteenth time because it's on my Now TV subscription and oh my god that narration ruined the film. I lasted about 15 mins before turning it off. Shameful.&&Word of warning to a modern viewer, Blade Runner is two hours but can easily feel like 3 because it’s complex, fairly slow paced, and often feels like some sort of dream. A masterpiece, but it’s not easy viewing. 

2049, on the other hand, is closer to 3 hours but feels like 2 imo. Just flies by. Perfectly paced and the storyline is friggin fantastic. &&The director's cut! The voice over from the theatrical cut was intentionally bad. Literally. Harrison Ford went on record saying he hated when the studio forced him to come in and perform it, so he intentionally did it badly. He thought Ridley's cut didn't need a voice over because the audience could figure out the enough through context and dialogue. The voice over between scenes drags you out of the film so damn hard. Find the director's cut, please. &&Made sure you watch the cut called The Final Cut. It's Ridley Scott's definitive cut and it's the one that the sequel BR 2049 is based off. All other cuts dramatically alter the story and some completely butcher the ending.&&It's not necessary, but will definitely make the movie better for you.&&[deleted]&&This was my exact reaction too! First thing I did was google the cinematographer when I walked out of the theatre. Turns out I’d seen some of his other movies, not all of them though I would definitely call this his magnum opus&&I wouldn't say flopped. It wasn't a blockbuster, but it made it's money back.&&People are stupid &&I agree! I think Denis Villeneuve is one of the best directors working today. I love every movie of his that I've seen.&&When I saw this movie looked like one of my animes I stroked out and reached nirvana, bravo Denis&&Rapture, or it held your rapt attention?&&Enraptured&&Yeah. The long, contemplative sci-fi formula isn’t for everyone. To me, it is a tragic love story between a toaster who wishes he was a human and a screen saver who wishes she could be a toaster. On my second viewing I was a bit misty in the eyes. 

Such a brilliant movie. &&See Radio Free Albemuth if you want to see PKD done right.&&I bet most movies on LSD are pretty amazing.&&Don’t forget the score and sound design.&&I can absolutely understand that someone might not like og Blade Runner. You have to be in a certain mindset to really enjoy it.

Br2049 doesn't have that hurdle for me. Where some parts of og BR were such a slog that I kind of wanted to skip them, 2049 just has me devouring every single moment of it.&&Watch the first, it's truly one of the greatest films of all time. But it's slow and deliberate (like the sequel) so be aware of the pacing going into.it!&&Not long enough in my opinion. My gf and I both could’ve watched another 3 hours. The film is superb &&Not long enough&&Yes watch the original first! It set the bar high in terms of cinematography and visualisation. After watching that, you can appreciate the achievment of this modern installment even more! Very talented cast and production team, they did an amazing job!&&I think you could enjoy it without, as it's more of a tangential sequel than a direct sequel, but I'd recommend watching the original first. It's not dissimilar to The Force Awakens; it makes sense by itself, but you'll understand more when Harrison Ford shows up if you saw the previous films.&&You do. But they're two very different films. I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but I was baffled when I finally watched ""2049."" I . . . hated it, and I was really sorry to walk out feeling that way. I was rooting for it all through production, especially when Villeneuve and Deakins got attached, but I thought it was just awful.&&It's a movie about atmosphere and tone. That said, it does help to have seen the original, for context.&&> I understood a robot was able to give birth but I didn't really get the point beyond that. 

I'm all for people not enjoying the film but if that's all you took from the film then you quite clearly weren't paying any attention atall. The film is enhanced by the original but I felt like it stood well on it's own too, and it certianly didn't require viewing to understand it. &&You are not alone. I too felt that the movie lacked a certain catalyst, or felt very out of the loop with the references with the original.
 
The movie's pacing is slow, and that's true, since it's more of a detective movie with the audience being the detective, and the characters being the suspects.

It's a hands-on film, and that's why I love it, it makes me feel like I'm really there. But yeah, I agree, sometimes I feel like Blade Runner 2049 would be interesting as a standalone film, yet I find it understandable with the direction the creative team had taken. The film wouldn't have the level of depth it currently has if it isn't a sequel, wouldn't do it as much justice if it were a standalone film.&&I felt like 2049 was really a subversion of a ""the one"" storyline more than anything; it setup K to be this prodigal son, only to reveal that he had no predefined purpose. It forced him to find purpose through his actions (saving Deckard at the end) rather than through his heritage, which I thought was a pretty neat reversal. You could call it a ""usual twist ending"", but I feel like it really plays into the movie's theme of identity and humanity; K, by choosing to save Deckard, made a fundamentally ""human"" decision, calling further into question the difference, or lack thereof, between replicants and people.&&I disagree, mostly because the film makes you feel like it is your standard, he is the one, film. It then subverts that and tells a very different story.&&If other people liking a film you did not like bothers you then you have much bigger problems pal. &&you’re implying the sequel doesn’t pass a question and i think you couldn’t be more wrong. the movie has lots of interesting themes which you can reflect on&&Lots of people liking something in a way that you do not shouldn't bother you. 

But then again, I disagree with you. I think BR2049 not only adds to, it exceeds the original and makes the original a better movie as a result.&&I think youre right in terms of entertainment, but BR2049 was absolutely meant to be in a theater. The sound design and visuals are the reason you watch a movie on a big screen instead of your living room.&&>  Harrison Ford got to be in it before he passed.

Wut?&&> I'm just glad Harrison Ford got to be in it before he passed

Fuck you man. Damn near shit myself..&&> I'm just glad Harrison Ford got to be in it before he passed. 

**ಠ_ಠ**&&Doubt there'll be a sequel.&&Slow, methodical, and not a wasted word =/= boring. This movie was crafted. Westworld is cheap, by comparison.&&Totally agree. The movie seemed to stop after every thought and revaluation like it was saying “take that in. See how deep it is? Yeah. Deep stuff, man” 
I kept thinking it myself “WE GET IT! MOVE ON!” 

And that long drawn out Harrison Ford reveal... after he was in all the trailers. It just took too long to get where it was going after we already saw where it was headed &&nope, really boring to me too&&It is underrated by no means, what it is is under watched.&&Ah yes you can just feel the utter lack of any form of appreciation from this subreddit&&He's the runaway on reddit to win for sure. But any pick is a solid choice this year. I'm going to go against the grain here but as much as my jaw was on the floor for the majority of BR2049, The Darkest Hour is actually my pick this year for the Oscar. No easy feat considering Deakins is a god, but I thought Bruno Delbonnel did a phenomenal job. The camera movement and framing was exceptional. The lighting, especially in the scenes with the King was incredible. Shape of Water was exceptional as well, but with Del Toro being such an auteur I always felt I was watching his vision, and not a true collaboration - as you got with Delbonnel and Deakins. 

That said they're all deserving winners.

edit: Reading some of the comments below I'm just going to add this quote from Roger  

>*“The way I see things comes from my experience in documentaries – I like the camera to be invisible. If the audience becomes aware of the camera, it takes them out of the movie, and you have failed in some way.”*&&Nah, Oscars don't like Sci fi. He should win but it's going to Hoyte van Hoytema or Bruno Delbonnel&&i saw the movie first a few days back, boy are you spot on. the movie is on a league of its own. every single scene can be frozen and hung up in a photo gallery.
the movie is absolutely gorgeous and the movie itself is hypnotizing&&I saw all of those movies and Blade Runner 2049 is the only one that made me say out loud “wow this is the best cinematography I’ve seen in a while”. Normally cinematography is something I consider after seeing a film. There are also a great many shots in that film I would love to hang on my wall as art. &&Gosh I was afraid this movie was gonna suck. I didn’t watch any trailer and was genuinely afraid it was going to be a rip off of the old story.  Then Ryan Gosling.. *ok*... I said to myself.. well let’s give this a shot after all. 

Fuck! 

Not just Gosling. They nailed every actor. Every scene, every dialogue.

*”GOD DAMN IT!”*

Also,

JARED FUCKING LETO.

The movie deserves an Oscar just for the landing(s) of the evil guys hover car.

Damn it might be the best modern sci fi movie I’ve ever experienced. It’s so overwhelmingly and achingly beautiful.&&Having seen all three, there was no shot in Dunkirk or Shape of Water that made me go ""Wow"". Whereas BR2049 was full of them.&&I have a severely handicapped son, and can only get to the movies maybe once a year.  For a dude who, before fatherhood, would get to the movies at least 10 times a year, this is crippling.

I am *so glad* I squeezed a Tuesday night @ 9pm show in for this.  Bladerunner had always been an immense influence in my life, and having the opportunity to see a new one on the big screen?  Holy shit.  And what's more, it *eclipsed* the original.  Stunning.  Every frame.

The other time this year was The Last Jedi. 

I think I'll skip Solo.&&I really do not understand the praise that The Shape of Water is receiving. I personally found it deeply contrived and formulaic. &&Dunkirk is exactly the type of movie to get that award. We just have to realize at this point that the academy is not objective at all, and suffer from some severe biases. If the two favorites are a sci-fi movie and a WW2 movie then odds are the latter will get it despite the former being better.&&Yeah but for Oscars: War Movies > Sci Fi.&&I try to avoid speaking in hyperbole, but it really was magnificent.  Achingly good.&&this was my exact emotion coming out of it... I actually couldn't have been any happier&&I don't know about century but it was definitely the best film of 2017 in my opinion&&I watched it five times in the theater, each time just as captivated. The most times I've seen a movie in the theater previews to that was two.&&That’s the most hyperbolic statement I’ve read this millennium&&The fact films like Logan, Maudie & Blade Runner 2049 aren't nominated but Get Out is nominated is honestly astonishing.

Sally Hawkins should be nominated for best acress for her performance in that & Ethan Hawke best supporting actor for his performance in it.

Hugh Jackman in Logan best actor too.
&&I certainly thought it was the best sci fi I've seen in decades, however the middle aged couple who chatted all the way through the movie didn't think so. One reason I don't go to the movies anymore.&&Its my favourite film ever and the original used to be my favourite. It was so great it exceeded my high expectations for it&&I'm with you. I almost never tweet, but as I was leaving the theatre I sent one out one that said *Bladerunner 2049 is the best Science Fiction movie I've ever seen,* just so I'd have a definitive, time-stamped reminder of how I felt right after it ended.&&You would be right, if only it didn't devolve to a fan-service melodrama towards the end...&&What were you in jail for?&&I loved it but c'mon. &&I loved it, but I thought the inclusion of Deckard/Rachael was awkward and unnecessary. 

The film felt like it had it's own thing, a similar vibe but maybe a bit more abstract/atmospheric than the original, and it just felt like the story could have easily stood on its own without involving those past characters on screen.

Same goes for the brief interview with Gaff (I saw Battlestar Galactica for the first time recently, so I'm all for more Edward James Olmos, just didn't like this bit). The scene in Vegas was awesome by itself, but it just didn't feel like it completely meshed with the movie overall.&&It was ok but not brillant IMO, the original is x100 times better.&&[deleted]&&Agreed. 
Reminds me I need to go buy the blu ray&&Would you suggest watching them beforehand?&&you got a link for the shorts?

I watched the movie recently and wouldn't mind watching them.&&I honestly thought the two live-action shorts were way worse in quality the movie.&&Samurai Champloo yo.&&Didn't realise he ~~made~~ worked on the Animatrix, that explains a lot. I kept thinking of it while watching the Blackout short film. &&""See you space cowboy"" haha Ave already seen it, and Samurai Champloo also.&&Here are the short films:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMP1YpQSGhQ&&yeah seriously, link?&&They released 3 Shorts online that you can see on YouTube; ones anime, and the other two are live action - check them out my dude!&&there are three prequel short btw. all on YouTube. &&Shit, were they really?? Had no idea, now I love them even more &&The original Blade Runner :\^)&&I thought Children of Men is slightly similar in just being awesome Sci fi. &&Ex machina&&Arrival. Same director, amazing film.&&I mean if you're into anime Psycho pass had some similar stuff going on. It's a cyberpunk detective thing as well. Damn good show&&Something about this movie had me wanting to watch Looper (with Bruce Willis and Joseph-Gordon Levitt) again. I'd recommend checking that one out!&&Mad Max: Fury Road&&In terms of dystopian scifi world, altered carbon on netflix is pretty allright&&Minority Report and Gattaca are 2 fantastic sci-fi's with great world building and themes. Not that similar to blade runner but you'd definitely appreciate them if you're a fan of blade runner. &&If you haven't seen Akira you should.&&The Netflix show Altered Carbon has been similar in scene and in its ‘suck you in’ ability. Too bad it’s not on the big screen with surround sound. That was the experience it was made for &&I’m not gonna lie, I’m going to be so bummed out if, when we get to the year 2049, the world doesn’t at least somewhat resemble the world of Blade Runner.&&6 for me. Not kidding. I did my part and then some haha. Its a shame it doesn't really help though. &&Loved it. It “transported me” are the words that come to mind. Both people I was with hated it. &&I, uhhh... I bought tickets to it 3 times but only saw it twice, because I messed up the 2nd purchase. I thought I booked saturday, but actually booked friday. So, I find out en route to the cinema and think ""Nope, there's no way in hell that I'm NOT seeing it again"" so bought another ticket on the spot.

God I love that film...&&And I did twice. Wish I went early the first time so I could've gone back more but it left theaters after my 2nd viewing. And I don't have a home setup to truly appreciate it versus seeing it in a theater.  &&5 times here too *high five*

I would've gone more but my 5th time was the last showing :(&&Ditto, 5 times. I usually hate rewatching movies. &&2 times here&&I also saw it four times at the cinema. It was just such an experience, the scale of the film was impressive on the big screen. I bought the blu ray as well and the first time I put it on the tv i was like I remember this all being bigger.&&Can you watch it before watching the original Blade Runner?&&I FOUND YOU IN THE WILD!&&Blade Runner 2049 made $40million more at the box office than the Emoji Movie did.&&There were a few scenes that were defintely more hollywood than the original. 

But Luv crushing the glass into the police chiefs hand is probably the most visceral display of violence in both movies imo. Also when she broke Cookies neck with a chop. 

&&And I wonder how the movie would have done if it was 30 minutes shorter. On the way to see it me and my mate couldn't stop joking about ""2.79 hour runtime!""&&Pedigree be damned. They never should have let the budget above $100m.&&It was underwhelming which is all they meant. You put a lot of words in their mouth.&&You did you boo.&&This was my wife’s exact reaction. She wasn’t a huge fan of the first (she’s not a fan of “old” movies) but it gave her the context she needed and she really enjoyed 2049&&That explains why I didn't like the movie. I thought this was the first of its kind, didn't understand anything at the end, left confused and was even more confused why people liked it so much. &&Agreed on the last point. I'm really lukewarm on the original Blade Runner. I think it raises some great questions about humanity and everything, yet in between these powerful scenes is just kind of a lot of (in my opinion) weird 80s crap that I'm just not into.

That being said, BR2049 is one of my top 5 favorite movies. I love it, even more so when I watched it a second time at home. &&I saw the Final Cut! That’s what Amazon Prime offers. &&I thought my head was going to explode a few times there during the screening with Atmos etc.&&<3&&Syth addiction is a dangerous thing&&Every synth I hear.. *cums*&&Im sad they didnt bring vangelis back, it was good, but imagine if they brought him along&&ty, wasn't sure&&[deleted]&&I wouldn't say it's inferior, it's just really different&&[deleted]&&Yea, there is a space between ""success"" and ""flop"" wherein BR 2049 lies. The numbers were disappointing, but like you said, it didn't really lose money. &&Brave little toaster.

For sure the formula isn't for everyone, but dialogue in almost all movies is so horrible that saying a lot less can go a lot farther...but people are so use to constant dialogue, action etc... something has to always be happening else something seems different or wrong.

It is the first movie in a while that makes me want to set up my surround speakers...I have a really nice 3.1 setup but my space doesn't make sense for 5.1 ATM...resist atmos&&I'd totally watch a romantic movie between [Talkie Toaster](http://reddwarf.wikia.com/wiki/Talkie_Toaster) and the [Flying Toasters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_%28software%29#Flying_Toasters) screen saver.&&I watched the final episodes of the original Twin Peaks while tripping, it scared the shit out of me.&&It's a masterpiece. I just love how it takes its time. Scenes linger, have meaning, and have time to work&&I think the original just doesn't translate sometimes. It's incredibly clunky, even in the final cut.

Take for instance at the start of the film when Deckard visits the LAPD. The chief explains how the replicants escaped *twice* - first in the office before he says ""no choice pal"", and then straight after when they're smoking in another office while watching the videoscreens. Both times his explanations are incredibly similarly worded. It's a very bad start to the film.

You then have a second shot of flying toward the Tyrell Corp headquarters, with almost identical music and similar shots to the opening eye sequence. It's a bit jarring.

The later half of the film is incredible and makes up for it, but I can see why lots of people can't come to like it.&&About atmosphere and tone? Im not sure thats the theme of the story but its certainly the strongest element of the priduction...&&He needed more explosions and car ads in the movie. &&Who would have thought that watching the first film would mean you understand more references to the second?&&Slow? It's fucking glacial...

Beautiful film without a doubt, but we were left disappointed. &&No it doesn't. It's just a bullshit double twist ending.

It turns out SHE is ""the one."" Surprise!

But, like I said. The movie isn't horrible, it's just not deserving of being as revered as it is. It was, in reality, just another reboot of what was a truly great movie

&&I agree 100%. This movie was meant to be seen in cinema. Won't be the same on a tv&&[deleted]&&Same. I've never rushed to google quicker.&&I feel like all the people calling it boring, either thought the original was boring, didn't watch the original, or don't remember the original, because although I like the original, it is a much slower film by comparison.&&Westworld isn't cheap by comparison. Both Blade Runner 2049 and Westworld can be amazing. They aren't mutually exclusive.&&I think that we're so unused to deliberate camera work and silence in use of enhancing storytelling that it's hard for people to sit through now. The original has a very similar pace. We're just fed so much high action media all the time that when it slows down people have difficulty seeing through it. &&Did you just revoke this movie's gem status?&&I think Deakin gets it because the Academy realises he should have won at least one by now &&Darkest Hour was quite good.  Not BR2049 good, though. The world building, I can understand WW2 London,  but I need to be taught LA in 2049.  Deakins taught.&&Never thought about it that way, sometimes I marvel or wonder how they filmed a shot and it does take you out of the movie. &&[deleted]&&Avatar, Inception, and Gravity all won Best Cinematography. It’s not like sci-fi doesn’t do well here.&&That’s exactly how I describe it to people. Pause, print, art. Amazing.&&It's a fantastic movie and really did the original a good service. I haven't seen every movie that got a nod for best picture award but i was surprised it didnt get a nom for it. I think i have seen 4 or 5 so far. &&Nearly every Deakins film is like that, though. His snubs are beyond comprehension.&&I agree ... but, I think so much of that actually hinges on the art direction of the film more than the cinematography. Yes, the film was beautifully shot. But without the incredible world-building of the art department, the film would look nowhere near as good. &&I've yet to see the movie but am planning on doing so tonight. This gets me very excited to do so! &&was on a flight which had BR2049 to view. My headphone port for the flight was broken so I just rewatched BR2049 as a visual ride. Such a beautiful film.&&What I love about that movie is tha toy leaves you with a bunch of big open questions about the nature of life and relationships (to name a few). 
But at no point attempts to preach to you about any of the standard shite that currently infests movies. 

That and the fact it was just a well shot movie. &&The movie is gorgeous, but the plot is very lackluster and not engaging.&&The only other film which made me feel this way recently was Sicario, also by our boy. &&This is an interesting perspective and I'm not sure Roger would like to hear that sort of praise. He has said about his role ""The way I see things comes from my experience in documentaries – I like the camera to be invisible. If the audience becomes aware of the camera, it takes them out of the movie, and you have failed in some way.” &&Ryan Gosling fucking annihilated that memory facility scene. Dude was on fire the entire movie.

[The delivery on that GODDAMMIT...](https://youtu.be/Oa9c9JBBGxM?t=222)&&[deleted]&&Since a place beyond the pines I don't ever ugh at him. First impression for most people is he's pretty boy standard actor but I think he's one of the best lately.&&Dave Bautista saw a miracle.&&Leto*&&While I agree about BR being better, the burning spitfire shot was absolutely beautiful.&&You are hard to please! There are several amazing shots in Dunkirk (Tom Hardy's crash landing is gorgeous) - overall it's beautifully shot. It's almost up there with BR2049 imho.

That said, I agree that BR2049 is visually a stone-cold masterpiece from start to finish.&&haven't seen the shape of water, but I disagree about Dunkirk. Imo it's pretty unlucky that BR2049 and Dunkirk are competing the same year. They are in a league of their own, especially BR2049.&&Different strokes for different folks. I loved *The Shape of Water*. My only criticism is the lack of fish-man penis.&&Shallow and pedantic.&&But it's also del Toro, who I love, but that explains the unabashed praise I think.&&Kind of how I felt about Blade Runner 2049 to be honest.

And regardless of how you felt about The Shape of Water in general it was beautifully shot, which is the point of the category.&&So how people feel about blade runner 2049&&Ok but Fury Road took all the technical awards and it's certainly not a traditionally Oscar baity movie. &&That defaults to the best movie they've seen this millennium. &&>Emotion

You're way off baseline!&&I went home in a kind of otherworldly daze. For some reason I watched the sun set over the western mountains where I live (Canberra, Australia), and I kept thinking how much I'm lucky to be alive to see such a film and feel the emotions that it caused in me.&&What’s you’re problem with Get Out?&&Logan was not a better movie than Get Out.  
I get it, old hero who's lost his shine, one last chance to redeem himself, with a kid.  
I love Children of Men as much as the next guy, but Get Out was a better movie on its own, and it was another league as far as originality.&&I LOVE the original, but in what way was it actually superior to 2049? I see them as equals&&4k*&&Personally, I wouldn't.  I think they explain too much, so would take away some of the mystery and sense of discovery from the main film.

I don't think there's anything in them that is necessary to understand the main film, or that adds to it in any meaningful way.  You might not know everything going into it, but you don't need to.

tl;dr: In my opinion there is more to lose than gain by watching them.&&I think so. They're supposed to bridge the gap between the original film and 2049.&&It's not necessary but shows some stuff that happens between the first one and 2049. It's nice little background information. &&Yes&&Yes, the best way to watch 2049 is having seen them and the original because then you are fully immersed in the setting already and can focus on the story, themes and amazing visuals&&Yes lol. They are extremely crucial to the story and without it, there are things that are completely bereft of any context. Watching them before might spoil a bit of the movie when you go in, watching them after might leave you feeling like the movie was incomplete and therefore not that good (I'm in this camp). Wish I'd known about them/watched them before. &&https://youtu.be/aMP1YpQSGhQ&&Everybody talks about Cowboy Bebop but I think Samurai Champloo is his best work.&&He made two segments. It's an anthology film by different directors.&&Thanks!&&I wish I could be you guys right now. You’re about to see the most beautiful shorts ever made. &&https://youtu.be/rrZk9sSgRyQ&&Will do!&&haha&&Loved that movie so much but didn’t know it was the same director. That’s a good suggestion, just watch their other movies!&&This is true only for the visuals though. For the scripting and acting they are on a whole different level.&&Been meaning to watch that. My TV will have to do haha, thanks for the recommendation &&[deleted]&&Well next year in 2019 is suppose to be the original blade runner so... close enough?&&That reminds me of the time I watched Tron: Legacy 9 times in the cinema.

Such a gorgeous film. &&I regret not seeing it in a theatre. Renting it on my 50 inch tv with shit speakers really didn't do the movie justice. Hopefully it'll come around again one of these years.&&2 for me. IMAX and 4DX&&Did you really spend ~$70 on one movie? I wish I had that kind of money haha&&I rented it on Redbox! No one wanted to go with me :/ 
&&Same happened to the original. It made plenty of money after release. I think/hope the same happens here&&Interlinked &&Same exact experience! First time I’ve ever completely lost myself to the sound and scenes in a movie. Loved the original, but this...this was something special.

That said both my wife and friend though it was incredibly boring and drawn out. They expected a futuristic action movie. &&Counterpoint, it's probably Ray crushing Tyrell's skull in the first for me haha &&>It's a shame nobody went to see it. Quality film.
>>Can Reddit please stop thinking that they are some kind of film conisseurs for enjoying the ""art house"" underrated gem that is Blade Runner 2049? Yes, people went to see it. It made $260 million at the box office. It wasn't hugely profitable, yes, but don't pretend that people didn't see it.
>>>It was underwhelming which is all they meant. You put a lot of words in their mouth.

You didn't exactly follow the comment chain, did you?

>&&Not a fan of ""old movies""? I pitty that ammount of forced ignorance.&&Well beyond context the ""sex scene"" was something unique in cinema. It took the idea from ""Her"" and went all the way. My jaw was open in wonderment the whole time.&&I went to see it with friends who hadn't seen the original, and they seemed to enjoy it just as much as me.&&Seems like it's closer to a soft reboot than a direct sequel to me. The protagonist is different, the antagonist is different. The only character with any appreciable screen time that's the same from both movies is Deckard, and without spoiling anything, he's not exactly the main focus of the movie. 

While I certainly think seeing the first adds depth to 2049, I don't think it's required by any stretch. My GF hadn't seen the first and she followed everything just fine in 2049.&&BR2049 made *just* under $260 million worldwide on a budget  of $150 million. I have no idea about the costs of marketing for film, but if we assume  $100 million spent on marketing, BR still made it's money back.&&Ford is going to pull a Christopher Lee, and then some.&&If it were true it would be good bye Rick Deckard, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, (the best) Jack Ryan, and more... 

That day should be a long way off I hope. &&Or they thought original was boring too... I wanted to like 2049 more than I did, but even the amazing aesthetic wasn't enough to keep me engaged. &&~~*underrated*~~ *underwatched gem*&&Yeah, the Oscars are kinda notorious for picking people that ""deserve"" an Oscar.  Same reason I bet Gary Oldman wins best actor.&&No idea deakins never won an Oscar.. his work is impressive &&That's been true for years now and still hasn't happened.&&Yes, like *Total Recall*'s inspiring message to Elon Musk: ""Get your ass to Mars.""&&I really hope this one stands out tho, This film really took the deepest and nuanced existential questions possible and translated them into film perfectly , which is a feat rarely accomplished.

What is conciousness?
what is it to be human?

You have the dynamic between K who is purely organic but designed to have a controlled contained conciousness

on the reverse side you have joi who is completely digitial yet whose consciousness strives to be ever more sentient and unbound.

I think the love dynamic between these 2 gets over looked

Its a tried trope that BR2049 pulled off flawlessly  && All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.&&""...Every frame a Rembrandt...""&&I liked The Post but was surprised that it got a nomination over Blade Runner 2049. The Post was good and very well acted, but it was pretty generic paint by numbers. I liked it, and I doubt I'll ever watch it again. &&I've said this in other related threads, but an Academy insider did say that the main reason BR2049 got glossed over was due to poor box office performance which is emblematic of a bigger problem within the Academy. &&One reason: science fiction.&&the moment I lost all respect for the academy was when his work on Skyfall got beaten by Life of Pi&&There’s always some epic that out-peacocks his transcendently shot “normal” movies.&&[removed]&&exactly, cinematography isnt only wallpaper shots, cinematography is so much more, its visual storytelling.&&It's definitely about framing as well though. The art department has to be on point (which they definitely were), but the have the painting look, the cinematographer needs to frame every shot perfectly. &&What I love about this movie is robot boobs.&&Those silhouettes against the sunset are so vividly painted in my mind.&&The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was Deakins masterpiece. Unfortunately he did it the same year he did No Country for Old Men and split his votes, losing to There Will Be Blood, which is a beautiful film as well.

Good year for cinematography that one. &&Prisoners too; which wows me even more because the look is so startlingly different so some of his other films (but no less beautiful)&&I get his point but if you are very into analyzing films you'll always be considering the camera. &&Ryan Gosling really showed his talent with this movie. The world building coupled with Ryan Gosling's acting was so terrific it completely took me into the movie. It will be in a few years what blade runner is now.
It's a bloody masterpiece.

&&Yes. Totally unexpected, it scared the shit out of me.&&That was the moment when Gosling convinced me that he is an amazing actor.&&Yes https://i.imgur.com/32z02oS.jpg&&Glib facesmile&&[hyperbole intensifies]&&The story is so logical as a next step for the replicants. Brilliant idea. It's a shame there wasn't a proper sequel much much earlier with Ford and Young.&&This scene has stuck with me since seeing the film.
I think its a good yardstick to measure if someone is likely to 'get' this film.
If you don't find the baseline tests unnerving then you probably aren't getting this film.
Amazing film and a superb sequel.&&Lol I got the movie deal at Pancake Parlour then went to see it at Dendy&&I said the same thing to my friend! I went with her and she didn't like it... I just couldn't understand and said that I just felt lucky that I got to see it in my lifetime. The scene where Joi takes in rain for the first time and he tries to touch her face almost made me cry. It just felt like it was addressing so many things about who we are and how daunting the future is, even via the soundtrack and visuals. Maybe not even the future - just future representations of the issues we experience today.&&A comment I made after seeing it in IMAX

""I feel the same way, I left speechless and I shit you not, almost tearing up at what I had just experienced.   The visuals, the SOUND! I can't say enough about the editing with the music.  One of the greatest things I have ever experienced and again, I am not exaggerating, one day later I am still in absolute awe, I will never forget my first viewing of this complete masterpiece.""&&Why is there a problem with believing it's not deserving of a spot over the likes of Logan/Blade Runner2049/Maudie?

I'd put Get Out in the same category of films like 'Split'. Movies with cool concepts that were done really well.&&Well for one, the second one is a thematic rehash of the first. I really didn’t detect anything really that new in the sequel that wasn’t explored better and in less time in the first film. To be fair, I’ve only seen 2049 once but thats how it felt the first time. Also, color palette wise, 2049 is very dull. It does look great but I wasn’t a big fan of Deakin’s monochromatic choices for many of the scenes. &&The first one explores deep spiritual questions of mankind such as the meaning of identity. The new one is a further exploration of the world where the first movie takes place. It's the difference between great art and entertaiment. And 2049 doesn't do a good job at exploring that world as the story is quite confusing. Also the cinematography of the first one is superb while 2049's is good but no match to it. In overall it was too gray, maybe intentionally as a contrast to the ""colonies"" but we never see those. Also the shots of the first one are brillant and the music is unforgettable.&&I don't think you need a TL;DR for 4 sentences. &&For me it actually enhances the experience when watching the main movie, ""Wow, that's the guy in the short. What are they gonna do to him?""&&Thanks&&thanks m8&&Champloo is great, but Cowboy is definitely better. &&Space Dandy, baby.&&To he fair in the anime community they're both pretty equally acclaimed as must-see masterpieces and always among the top recommendations for someone's first anime if they're trying to get into anime&&Sorry, I realise he didn't make the entire thing, I meant I didn't realise he was one of the people who worked on the Animatrix.&&Honestly, Altered Carbon has awful pacing. The art direction is great but it's wasted by terrible direction imo. &&No problem! It’s quite a bit gorier, but it has a REALLY interesting overall plot/story and the cinematic aspects and sounds are incredible. There are definitely touches of Bladerunner in there.

It’ll getcha hooked in.
&&I just want my giant purple holograms trying to sell me stuff while I’m walking down the street.

Love that scene in the staduim.&&Me too. TV roughly the same size, but i made a point of listening to it through some decent studio reference headphones i have. Never done that before, but it made a world of difference. Very immersive.&&Yes but the theater cranked it tooooo loud. I have tinnitus (ringing) and if I can hear that drone that techno noir sound imagine what the crowd must be hearing. &&Tron Legacy is one of my favorite movies to play in my basement's home theater. The floor in that room is tile. And when I play that movie, with its gorgeous 7.1 DTS-MA track, I play it LOUD. The acoustics are fuckin incredible. Gives me goosebumps. Those drums in [this scene](https://youtu.be/aNapFsNDbZE) (they kick in at 1:26), make the room fuckin shake.&&Just go yourself! No one else gives a shit that you are there by yourself. Dont let that stop you from seeing stuff on the big screen. You have to be quiet while watching anyways...going alone to a movie is great. You don't have to compromise on anything. &&#&&Yeah that was far more gruesome than anything in 2049&&Pitty? Ammount?&&The lack of sharp image/sound just ruins the immersion for many people.

Ah, but was she actually like that, or was she just programmed to make you think that? Everything she said and did could have just been how she was programmed to act human.&&Nah. I bought the bluray.&&“...Every meme a Dickbutt...”&&Feel exactly the same way. When the credits began I thought to myself ""This was a good cast, a good piece of history and it's time to go home.""

After Blade Runner 2049, I didn't want to go home, I wanted more.&&Spielberg + Hanks + politically relevant topic = nomination by default. The academy tries to be more than it should be. &&Holy trinity of Hanks Streep and Spielberg. How could it not get a best picture nod?&&You just described good night and good luck.&&I didn’t even need to watch the post to know it was going to be an Oscar bait movie. &&Surely thats not right considering the only big movie nominated would be Dunkirk. Regardless, box office performance is a poor metric. BR will have a far longer life than all those movies combined bar maybe Dunkirk again. &&I'm not positive, but didn't Blade Runner 2049 make more than all the other nominees except Dunkirk and maybe Get Out?&&That's fucking horrible, awards shouldn't be decided based on the money it makes. If thats the case Fast and Furious 7 should have cleaned up at the oscars.&&Life of Pi was a beautiful film. You can't put it down like that. It's dishonest and disrespectful. However, where I agree, it's a question how much (if at all) DP had anything to do with visual language and quality of that film. That said, same question can be asked for any film. How much is due to director, pd, creative producer (if film has one), etc. With Deakins we are at least sure it's his input, since his movies tend to carry a visual signature.&&No you didn’t. And if you really did, you just didn’y want to acknowledge Life of Pi is a gorgeous looking movie because Deakins lost.&&The visuals and audio were excellent, saw it in the theater and at home and for a drab and dreary world I wanted to spend more time in it.

&&Everyone except the marketing department, which did a horrible job. &&Should I see he 1982 Blade Runner before seeing this one? Or can I just jump right into this one and enjoy it. Will I be missing out on plot and story elements?&&Exactly, it's all a collaborative effort. The art department needs to be top notch and they need to put details into everything, even if they think it might not ever show up on camera. You need to give the cinematographer the freedom to choose his/her shots on the fly. If you only plan your sets around whats on the storyboard and the cinematographer decides at the last minute that he wants to shoot from a different angle for artistic reasons, the set and props need to be able to support that. Without everyone working their A game, you end up having self-imposed limitations that can affect the final look of your movie. &&The night vision scene, hnnnngh.&&I'm hoping to somehow tangentially get into VFX some day, and a lot of that motivation came from seeing what Deakins achieved in BR2049, but every piece of his work is perfectly tailored to the story being told. The raw, natural, earthy feel of Sicario, Prisoners, Jesse James and No Country is what he does best, but his application of those skills to a dystopic future setting was a wonder to behold. &&Plus the score. I was just engrossed the whole movie. My first time seeing Gosling in a movie and color me impressed.&&Had you just not seen anything else he'd made over the last 15-odd years?&&Slab Hardcheese&&**airhorn**&&As soon as I got home after the movie I had to look up the first baseline test again and found someone posted this non-movie version.

Are you guys for real?

It was  a great movie and all, and the cinematography was sublime, as usual for Deakins, but you guys make it out to be a singular experience without comparison. Almost religious. It’s a bit weird. &&This has been an outstanding year for high quality ""genre"" film. With that said I think that Bladerunner 2049 and Get Out were both runaways this year for my favorite movie, both because they were masterclasses in utilizing the codifiers of their given genre to the fullest extent, and also because they had such a satisfying narrative. &&You’re honestly upset that Get Out got nominated for an Oscar over Logan?

You know this is the Oscars right? Superhero movies are never taken seriously, it’s amazing that Get Out was even nominated.&&McAvoy is perfect in Split, but I thought 10 Cloverfield Lane was a better take on a similar concept. &&Honestly, if there's a film least deserving of a spot it's the Darkest Hour, not Get Out. The Florida Project and Bladerunnner are the only real snubs this year. Logan was good for a comic book movie (better than Darkest Hour admittedly despite the ill comparison), but doesn't really deserve to be in with the top runners.&&Hey I'll say it : thought Logan was bad.&&I would say that 2049 explores those same questions, but also brings in joi  who seems to be a real person even though she's a hologram amd a product first, but still has emotions, or does she? 

I felt that the cinematography was better than the original, but that's something you can attribute to personal taste.

I would say that both movies have beautiful shots.

I am in now way trying to undermine the value of the first movie here.

Edit: also, what was confusing about the story to you? I found it to be pretty straightforward.&&Sorry, I got distracted half way through your comment.  Would you mind adding a quick tl;dr to help me out?  Thanks.&&Yeah, that's kinda ridiculous.

tl;dr: I agree with u/joybuzz when he says that a tl;dr is not needed for four sentences. The purpose of a tl;dr is to provide a short summary of the preceding comment, for people who might not have the time or interest to read through it in its entirety. However, this is only really necessary when the comment is quite long. Like, at least several full paragraphs. But if the comment is short, then it can be read almost as quickly and easily as the summary, rendering the tl;dr useless.&&Fair enough.  I'm not one of the filmgoers who needs every character to have a fully fleshed out or conveniently interconnected backstory.  I'm fine with passing characters, just as you find in real life. 

And I actually enjoy *not* knowing everything, so I can exercise my imagination and preserve that sense of mystery, that, once gone, you can never recapture.

In fact it's one of the many reasons I tend to prefer film over TV series, that often cannot resist filling in all the gaps as they go on.  But I appreciate that everyone is different.&&That's what I thought, but I didn't want somebody else to be confused.&&I like the premise, and everything else you said sounds great&&Say what you want about the story etc, but the music, and the effects really submerge you into the world. I still get chills when the title credit pops up, and when Flynn is racing down the tunnel. It's up there with the Drive OST. &&I can tell you why that happened. It's as simple as no Daft Punk.&&Very immersive, interlinked.&&Idk, that lab tech with the broken neck in 2049 really got to me for some reason. &&I would argue the scene where [Wallace has Luv just blow the brains out of the Rachael clone, specifically to hurt Deckard](#spoiler) is one of the most *emotionally* brutal scenes depicted in film. I remember feeling my stomach drop and I felt physically ill at the callous, disgusting brutality. How it just did not 'affect' the antagonists.&&The violence in 2049 had a punchiness to it that the original didn't have. Denis is pretty good at very realistic yet brutal depictions of violence.&&I'd argue most movies that are significant have been re-mastered and re-released in today's formats (Blu-Ray).  So this shouldn't be a huge consideration unless they are watching an old VHS tape laying around.&&Really? I always considered a flop to be a film that made less than the budget.&&again my point is that the movie challenges the question

what is conciousness?&&My goodness I love this movie. I've watched it twice and I still can't be sure. She could have been just like most people. We use the words and phrases we are ""programmed"" with (i.e. education and life experience) to try to communicate new and novel ideas.

For example, it's not uncommon for us to quote song lyrics, lines from poems, or movies to express ideas to others. &&Who's to say that us humans aren't just programmed to act like humans?&&It’s been a while since I sat and watched a movie and could actually feel a smile on my face bc I was enjoying it so much. &&I could’ve watched hours more of blade runner &&Damn I thought (story-wise) the movie was twice as long as it needed to be&&Idk I can rewatch it. I also am obsessed with Edward R Murrow though haha&&I agree, but as I said, it's emblematic of a bigger problem within the Academy. BR2049's poor first weekend basically meant all the press talked about was the poor numbers which people then equate with bad movie and then the attendance drops further. It's a death knell. And narratives like that unfortunately taint people's perceptions. &&I think Get Out will be remembered for a good long while.&&I love nolans movies and read so much good stuff about dunkirk that i rented it on amazon and it was .. super underwhelming. Not sure maybe I should watch it a second time but it just did nothing for me and I was disappointed.&&Doesn't matter, all the press talked about was how it was bombing at the box office. Unfortunately people tend to listen to that noise får too much and it taints perceptions. None of the other films lost their studios 80m either. &&I think it also cost more to make. &&It's not about it having a big box office haul so much as it's massive losses being a pervasive narrative throughout the films run. The film lost an already struggling Alcon 80m and basically all the press talked about was how poorly it preformed. Unfortunately there's a weird parallel people draw between box office failure and the quality of a film, so there was a big assumption that it did poorly because it was bad. &&The audio/soundtrack was revolutionary IMO. The way the ambient sounds of the scenes turned into the orchestral arrangements of the soundtrack was something I've never heard before. The horrifying sounds of vehicles revving up would transform into haunting synth/horn arrangements.  
 &&Yes,watch the 'Final Cut' version of the original. If you only watch 2049 you will certainly appreciate it, but there are points that you will miss.&&You will definitely be able to enjoy 2049 on its own, but if you have the time to do so, you might as well watch the first one  (Final Cut only!) before you do so. It is every bit just as incredible as the second and it stood as the quintessential sci-fi film for years. You stand to lose nothing by watching the first one, but a lot to gain.&&You definitely don't need to see the original to enjoy the new Blade Runner. I feel the new movie is a superior film as well.

The original is worth watching though considering how monumentally influential it is to science fiction. Purely as movie though I do think it shows its age. It's still good but not a masterpiece like of lot of people tout it as.&&I am sooo tired of Hans Zimmer. His style permeates everything these days.

But something about BR2049 is different. It's just sounds so refreshingly alien, I love it.&&Gosling has a good arsenal of well-acted movies: Drive, Half-Nelson, Blade Runner, La La Land, The Nice Guys, The Big Short, The Ides of March, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Blue Valentine, Lars and the Real Girl.

But it's the best piece of film I've ever seen.

It surpassed the original, on the home turf of the original.  I was stunned. &&Well I hope there's nobody around that tries and shit on your parade when you experience something that resonates with you. &&Huh. I have definitely had what I would consider to be spiritual like experiences seeing movies in the theater for the first time. Movies that hit you at a certain point in your life when they introduce thoughts or ideas you haven’t had before. I would consider seeing The Matrix, Fight Club, The Fountain, BR2049, and others to all be in that category for me. &&i think it's ok to be deeply affected by entertainment  - people say similar things about art pieces or music&&I'd say that Logan was the first superhero movie since The Dark Knight that can hold its own among the top movies of that year. It's not loke the formulaic MCU films or the lackluster DCEU films, Logan holds up as a solid movie arguably more so than some best picture nominees this year. Tossing it aside just because it's a ""superhero film"" is grossly undervaluing how good of a film it was. &&Yeah but the ending ruins it.&&TL;DR: They don’t think you need a TL;DR for 4 sentences&&Did you watch the shorts before or after?&&lol your tastes sounds like the opposite of me.

For start, I enjoy both movies and TV series. But my favorites always have an extended lore and fleshed out characters. I like studying why a character have that particular behavior, what motivation makes them do what they did. I like to predict how would they react to the development as the story progress based on their personality.

Being able to get emotionally attached to a character is my favorite thing in fiction works. Be it by using explicit or implicit means throughout the story.&&The Son of Flynn I love it so much &&I love when Separate Ways by Journey kicks in when he goes in the arcade.

The Sea Wall scene where they're firing them, so fucking loud, I've never been as stressed out watching a scene and so much of that hinged on the sound team. &&Like the opening scene when Bautista's character smashes him through the wall &&Pretty sure the full budget was supposed to be something like 400 million&&You think that, I think that, common sense and logic thinks that, but the companies don't&&I believe Joi in part was supposed to represent how replicants are viewed I  the Blade Runner universe.  For us it seems obvious that replicants should have rights.  However, many of us will dismiss Joi as just being a machine that isn't truly alive.  Yet, aside from what they are made of Joi and the replicants are essentially the same thing.  Both, machines created for a purpose.

She reinforces this with the ""alphabet of you"" discussion where her and K comment of how DNA and binary serve essentially the same purpose.  If the right combination of DNA can make a human or replicant more than an animal, why can't the right combination of binary make Joi more than a machine. &&That feeling that encompassed me as K was walking toward that abandoned furnace... That's what movies are about.&&I saw it twice in the theatre, and watched it last week on a flight.

I love the OST, and it's a true soundtrack best experienced (or at least first experienced) as part of the movie.

Although [Sea Wall (skipped ahead to a more melodic part)](https://youtu.be/NujlXgBmUoU?t=1m42s) I can jam to in or out of context.&&I think the entire process is used to test the emotional and physiological changes (if present) of a Synth and that by ensuring the synth does not have an emotional and/or physiological reaction to the interrogation/test, they are still controllable rather than becoming independent as a fast explanation.

I don't disagree, and certainly enjoy doing that myself, but I don't feel the need to do it for every character.

I do not get any Han Solo vibes from that guy. The things he says, the way he says it, none of it feels like Han. It doesn't even have anything to do with how he looks, he just doesn't act like Han.&&Not since John Wayne played Genghis Kahn has anyone looked or sounded so little like the person they were playing&&Well this doesn't bode well. &&I was hyped after the super bowl spot, only seeing a poorly lit Han at the end. This mess made me immediately understand why Disney thinks it will bomb. Alden Ehrenreich seems like absolutely terrible casting. I wasn’t even one of these people that believed no one would be able to step into Ford’s shoes, but good god that was bad.&&The guy sounds, looks, and acts nothing like Harrison Ford's Han. Nothing against the kid doing it, but it's no where near being even close. This was always going to be the problem with the film, and Disney had to know this from day one. If the ""Everything is alright"" scene is supposed to be him being as close to the character as possible, we are in big trouble. 

The other problem is the ""best pilot in the galaxy,"" line. That is a title already held by Anakin, Luke, and now Poe. I might have thought it better that his aspiration would be to be the best smuggler in the galaxy. But thats probably not PC enough. &&Eh. Didn’t have much interest in this to begin with, and the trailer hasn’t really done anything to change that. &&I'll try spin offs, thats a good trick&&I don’t know, this looks like an SNL skit to me.

I still think the Falcon looks a little too ""pristine"" for even 10 years though.&&For a split second I thought it was HK47 so I had a mild heart attack.&&@thor Revengers&&Yeah it had some parts that were off. They forced breaking up Emilia Clarke's dialogue to try to make it sound cool and it just didn't work.&&Its gonna become the ""I have a bad feeling about this"" for the spinoffs. I could've sworn I heard that line in Rouge One&&I always took Han as the kind of guy who was a criminal first and found out he was a natural pilot on accident. He also never really proves himself as an awesome pilot in the trilogy. He just continues to get really lucky, which was part of his charm. &&Don't forget the ""kicked out of academy for having a mind of my own"".

Movie aimed to teenagers.&&What about Ewan MacGregor?&&The music was probably the most jarring thing for me.  You get the sounds/visuals of switches being flipped on what looks like the Falcon's control panel, and then..... overdrive guitar swell?  It just didn't feel right.&&I mean, it's a spin off movie, it's going for a different tone. Doesn't mean it'll be as good as the originals, but I don't think the main star wars films will be going in this direction at all.&&Even better, let's just use Harrison Ford, and all pretend he looks young. &&Just CGI Harrison Ford's face over his, it'll be fine&&He looks absolutely perfect as Lando. This is Donald Glover's movie now!&&It looks like something from a cheap porn parody film&&This title card is fucking horrible, wtf&&Why can’t we have Abed as Han in this&&I had that issue for Captain Kirk/Chris Pine up until the final scene in Star Trek 09, so maybe we'll see a bit of that here? Hopefully. &&SPICE MINES OF KESSEL&&They’re going to do an origin story for, “I know.”

Emilia Clarke’s character will be the first person to say that to him. And that’s where he got it from! 😄

barf&&I'm calling it now, the main plot will be about the ""kessel run"". Remember that throwaway line someone ad-libbed in 1977? Haven't you always wanted an entire film about it?&&[RedLetterMedia did a great video predicting what stupid ideas they’ll have to explain things as mundane as the origin of Han’s vest.](https://youtu.be/kjEd3DpH_e0)&&He sounded like him for a second in teaser but he sounds nothing like Harrison Ford here.&&At the very least he needs to be loud and obnoxious. Not mr cool and suave &&Agreed. I think it’s because the dialogue is very generic and cliche in this. “I’ve been running scams on the street since I was 10” sounds like it could be from any movie like Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall Street, anything. “I’m putting together a crew”. So what is this? Rogue One again? “I might be the only person who knows what you really are”. Once again been in a million movies. There’s just nothing creative here. Even the end gag we’ve seen a million times “I thought we were in trouble but we’re fine” and then they’re in trouble. I’m hoping they’re just using the generic dialogue parts to sell the trailer but we’ll just have to see.&&Agreed, kind of benefited from keeping Han Solo in the dark &&Yeah - I never thought of Han wanting to be a pilot.  I always thought his principal motivation was to make a buck.&&YOU CAN'T STOP MY SHINE!&&OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!&&It doesn't feel like Han at all from what i've seen here. Lando seems like a good fit though. And that monologue at the beginning was horrible. &&[still goes opening night then whines about it for the next few years on social media]&&American blondes are so last century. &&And it would be more exiting and dramatic. In this movie, are you worried what happens to Han, Chewie or Lando? No, becuase they show up unscathed in other movies. Do you care what happens to Woody, Daenerys or the alien extras? No, because no matter the outcome they never show up in any other movie.&&> This looks like a movie that nobody asked for.

And we're going to get 1 per year from now until eternity now that Disney owns Star Wars. &&Ron Howard: ""It wasn't""&&I don't know why anyone thinks Disney will ever put out anything truly conceptually adventurous. They bought the IP to make a shitload of money for the next infinity years. They will jostle the ingredients some and package it a lil differently but it will always be a safe bet. &&When Deadpool feels confident enough to go the weekend before it's not a great sign&&We just had a Star Wars movie two months ago--Disney needs to give it a break before tossing out another one.

The infrequency of movies was part of what drove Star Wars mania. It's one of the reasons I've felt Disney's annual Star Wars movies plan was so shortsighted. A new Star Wars movie stops being a special occurrence if it happens often and predictably.&&It's almost like that scene in Space Balls where they bring the stunt doubles in.

His voice isn't deep enough, he doesn't have the right tone, he doesn't have the physical gravitas that Ford brought to nearly every role he played. It feels like a guy dressing up like Han Solo instead of a guy being Han Solo. I have similar worries about Donald Glover playing Lando.

When you meet Han at the beginning of IV he’s just like “hey what’s up I’m a smuggler” - you’re not given the impression he’s the best in the galaxy or that he and Chewie are some super team who have been creating legends for decades etc etc. - just normal dudes making a living who get caught up in something special. The way this trailer and the movie want to make him into some kind of superhero or something feels really weird. &&This whole trailer has been giving me that vibe&&A true *Star Wars* film!&&The old lore had Han in the Imperial flight academy but got kicked out for going off mission to save Chewie and some slaves IIRC&&I hope he's like ""nah, I was just to great"" and we later find out he just didn't like following orders and got kicked out for good reasons.&&I like the idea that Han is just his random guy, who nobody knows his origin. We meet everyone else - Yoda, Lando, Obi-Wan. But never Han. Why?

The way he juts his chin forward, the grin, none of that looks like Han Solos mannerisms. 

Harrison Ford would have made that look charming and followed it with his shit eating grin.  It looks like he's trying to intimidate her not charm her, and then failing at that when his smile fades immediately after and it's clear she's intimidating him.  So the dashing cocky ladies man is neither dashing nor charming and intimidated by Khaleesi?&&They are *Duo* until Woody's character dies and the character stays/becomes *Solo*.&&But so far, of what I've seen of Alden, he's not a bad actor, but he doesn't have the chops to pull off imitating another actor or character the way someone like Michael Fassbender or James Franco can. 

I really hope to be proven wrong, but his line in this trailer of ""I thought we were in trouble there, but we weren't"" did nothing for me in invoking Han Solo.&&Michael Fassbender is a rarity.&&Fassbender was doing more of an evocation than an impression of Jobs. I'm thinking that the studio is going to want Ehrenreich to basically do a Solo impression the whole time which could work out poorly.&&I'm really hoping that Disney can pull this one off. Judging from the trailer alone, in which we had no time to get familiar with Solo Redux, I was not sold. If he at least had a similar voice to Ford, it would be easier to connect.

This is genuinely the first Disney Star Wars trailer which made me go 'meh'.&&Can´t even act like Harrison Ford ✔️&&This is just baffling to me.

Obviously his looks were going to be a point of contention, regardless of their intentions. Why not cast someone who is at least passable as a young Ford? Who can mimic his cadence?

That way you've already won half the battle. Instead of having everything rest on doing a different *new* Han who's as least as likeable and charming as the *old* Han.&&But if the stories from the set are true, they got neither. &&That's what made a solo movie such an odd choice, his is a hugely unique character that would be obviously difficult to cast for. Seems strange to basically pick the hardest one to adapt to start with. Whereas Obi actually has the original actor ready to go. Weird decision making. &&Howard posted a picture on Instagram during production of him working with Young.&&I don’t think it was ever reported he departed.

He might be better than average, but he never seemed like the “captain best pilot, number one in the galaxy chosen one” type. That was always Luke’s schtick.

""That bad, huh?""&&Yeah, Han is supposed to be cool *in spite of* being kind of a dork. Running towards a bunch of oncoming Stormtroopers and then screaming, anyone? Also when he replies ""I'm nice men"" to Leia.&&Thats Lawrence Kasdan script.

Lord and Miller got fired for trying to do some changes/improv.&&As someone who absolutely loved the old Legends backstory of Han that was told through three novels, these lines made me giddy because they line up more closely to that old canon than I thought the movie would.

> “I’ve been running scams on the street since I was 10”

Han's old origins was that he was orphaned at an early age and taken in by Garris Shrike, who forced him to beg and pick pockets along with a bunch of other children.  He finally escaped when he was a teen with the help of an elderly wookie, who was kinda like a mother figure to him.

> “I’m putting together a crew”

So this goes beyond the first novel into the second, but Han eventually finds his way to the Outer Rim after getting kicked out of Imperial school at the beginning of the second novel for refusing to enslave some wookies, including Chewie.  He eventually falls in with a group of other ruffians and smugglers including Lando, and does a lot of work for Jiliac and Jabba the Hutts.

>  “I might be the only person who knows what you really are”

I'm not sure how they'll string along the romance part of this new movie, but in the books Bria Tharen was basically a slave that Han helped escape from a planet ruled by cousins of the Hutts.  She helped Han create a new identity so he could join the Imperial army, and then she disappeared to face the addiction she depended on from back when she was a slave.  In later books she showed up as a rebel sympathizer who used Han and his friends to help the rebels, which is a situation where this line could easily fit in.

The only thing is that I'd hate for them to try and cram three novels worth of info into one movie, and therefore I hope there's a lot of original plot points and that the movie doesn't encompass all of Han's backstory from his street urchin days all the way through meeting Luke and Ben.  If this movie does well, it'd be nice to see a few more fun space escapades with Han, Chewie, and Lando&&Doesn't exactly bode well for the movie then if the main character only works well when they're barely seen and not heard.&&I'M LOVIN' CLOUD CITY MY HEAD'S IN THE SKY!&&Something about his lines in this trailer was weird.

You're not supposed to know what went down with him and Lando - that's what makes those moments between them in Empire where they mention things offhand just a little bit so great.

All of your examples were only for a couple of scenes at most, and the Steven Tyler one actually looked pretty terrible. Tarkin also looked just a little bit off. RDJ looked pretty great IMO, as did Ant Man's Michael Douglas and GotG II's Kurt Russell, but again, those were just brief appearances. That said, we're definitely getting to the point where CGIing an actor to appear young for the entire movie will be a feasible option.&&Han at the beginning of Ep IV is a character near the end of a long downward spiral that owes everybody money everywhere, has a ship that barely functions, and has creditors that placed bounties on him presumably just to show what happens to people who lose their money. The last decade or so of his life should be Han borrowing from one place to pay another and being forced to take increasingly risky jobs to stay above water. Not great movie material.

Lando House of Cards-ing his way to the top of cloud city would've been a better choice.&&At least we could have something about Lando considering that apparently no one remembers Lando in recent movies.

Most likely Han couldn't pay Jabba back from his own savings, but wasn't it even implied that the rebellion might pay him off as a thank you to Han, but since Han stuck around chasing that royal booty that never happened.

First image of Hugo Weaving in upcoming Irish Famine western ''Black 47'',37690,7wu1px,https://i.redd.it/gjqhi8quamf01.jpg,1932,1518369660.0,,"> Set in Ireland during the Great Famine, the drama follows an Irish Ranger who has been fighting for the British Army abroad, as he abandons his post to reunite with his family. Despite experiencing the horrors of war, he is shocked by the famine's destruction of his homeland and the brutalization of his people and his family.

Sounds great.&&>Irish Famine Western

My favorite genre&&Gonna love seeing which wins out in Ireland; feeling vindicated at the recognition of what the English did or despair at the bad Irish accents&&Finally a film about the famine. I don't think enough people realise the horrors of it, especially when everyone does that fucking Irish voice shouting ""potato!""&&I still think Hugo should have won Best Supporting Actor for Hacksaw Ridge. Man what a performance. &&Is he playing the role of Donald Sutherland? &&It took me like five minutes to figure out whose hands were where.&&I was hoping for a blaxploitation spin-off of Hitman...&&Yep, its Sam Neill&&Neat&&[deleted]&&So, what makes it a Western? Because it features horses and takes place in the 1800s?&&This looks amazing. I recently took a week long bus tour in Ireland and was totally oblivious to how massive this famine was. I came away with a bigger respect for the Irish and their plight. Seen some great monuments towards the famine and was educated on a lot of the  events from that time.

The famine walls and the famine shacks(I forget their proper name) are a great reminder. 

The Irish will never forget this travesty.&&I am sure it will be jaw droppingly good, garner tons of praise from critics and creators alike and no one will go see it. 

&&Hopefully it does a lot to shed light on the horrors of the famine, something which hasn't really been looked at in popular culture. It was an event that didn't just devastate the country and its people, it had a major global impact as millions fled Ireland and settled overseas, and is just as important to the history of U.S. and parts of the UK as it is to Ireland.&&Man... Hugo rocks that beard!&&Finally shedding light upon one of many humans tragedies other than  WW2, which also surprising coming from Hollywood &&One thing I hope is made clear from the dramatization of the famine is the true horror of what happened between the years 1845 and 1849. I don't think many people realise the depravity that so many people had to lower themselves to to survive. Just because it happened a long time ago doesn't mean we should detach ourselves from it. An entire generation of people were forced from their homes to leave for foreign shores, some of them never saw home ever again and some never even had a home to leave because all they had known the famine took from them. They were some of the bravest souls to have ever lived and I am proud to be in some way to be descended from people who lived through such despair and persevered.&&Hugo Weaving is in so many classics that I will see this in the hopes it becomes another masterpiece. &&Wait... when did Hugo Weaving become Sam Neil?&&Could people in this thread stop saying us Irish people still hate English people and are bitter over the Famine? It was a long time ago and English people alive today aren't responsible. It's as ridiculous as blaming Germans alive today for WW2.&&https://teaser-trailer.com/movie/black-47/ More info and pictures. &&Interesting!  I have recently started listening to an Irish history podcast that is almost exclusively about the Irish Potato Famine (or The Great Famine as the Irish call it).  Not sure if I am allowed to link to it but if you google “Irish History Podcast Patreon” you should find it.  It has some pretty amazing info in it.&&Mr Anderson!&&ill watch anything with Mr. hugo&&*quietly be's British in the corner...* &&Now there's a genre I never knew I needed.&&I hope the put Big Fella from Black 47 on the soundtrack &&This picture makes him look like Sam Neill, I thought that's who it was until I looked up the name since I forgot both of them.&&Whoa I can’t wait for this, will it be in mainstream theaters&&I wanna see a movie about the Siberian famine, where they became cannibals.&&[deleted]&&I'm stoked just based off the screenshot. That's looks tense as all hell. &&Huh, that sounds really original. Will check it out when it comes out.&&Does anybody else think Hugo Weaving is kinda hot even though he’s almost the same age as your father?&&Huge Weaving!! One of the elite seldom used power acting circle. See also: Sam Neill.&&Hey I worked on this! So nice to see it on the front&&You had me at “Hugo Weaving in upcoming Irish Famine western”&&I like Hugo Weaving, I also like the Matrix where we see Hugo ducking.&&I guess... *it was inevitable*&&The Matrix (1999)

Agent Smith: I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure.&&Hugo weaving was amazing in hacksaw ridge! His performance seemed more intense than others imo&&The best thing about being me... There are so many “me”s. &&One of the most underrated actors alive&&Great band, BTW&&This is one of the groups that needs more movies made about events like this. There are a ton of Irish people living today that aren't even aware of how bad things were because they have spent their time learning about the tragedies of others instead.  If you are an Irish kid in our school system, you spend most of that time learning about slavery and the holocaust.&&Wait, a movie that isn’t a superhero movie or a sequel? Count me in &&Is that Johnny Manziel?&&Yup....that's a hugo&&That is definitely not Tom Hardy.&&I miss Hugo&&Hugo is a national treasure.&&""Irish Famine western""........?&&Based on the description given by /u/BunyipPouch I hope this is pretty good, and not a disappointment like ""The Revenant"". Don't get me wrong, it was a good film, but it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be, and I really don't think it was Leo's best performance IMO&&Dude has one sinister brow.&&It comes out Feb 16. How can I find where it will be showing?&&> ""Alright Mr.Weaving, in this role you need to be really angry with just about everyone."" 

> ""That seems reasonable given the time frame, would it be a fearful angry or a vengeful rage?"" 

> ""I'm sorry, did I upset you? You seem made."" 

> ""No, my agent just plays to my strengths."" &&That's a damn good picture because now I want to watch this movie. When's it coming out!?&&They hugging&&first image of some other guy too&&Oh fuck yesssss.&&He lives just around the corner from me. Such a nice guy.&&Bad ass&&One of the writers on this was my screenwriting lecturer. Got some cool insight on it. Pretty sure I'm not allowed to share, for his sake. But it looks pretty good.&&TIL he played V in V for Vendetta&&I'll go see it solely cause Moe Dunford is in it&&Looks a lot like Mark Hammill at first glance.

Hugo is a brilliant actor and has played some epic roles of the years. Looking forward to this.&&More Hugo Weaving! Yes!&&Interesting topic for a new film to be about &&Gonna see it here at the Berlinale in a couple weeks. Looks pretty good.&&i remember when i was a child and everyone had lucky numbers except me. I sat down one day and drew out all the numbers and couldn't decide between for and seven so i put them together. ever since then I see this number EVERYWHERE. and yeah I know I know if I'm looking for it I'll find it more...but IM NOT. it freaked me out so much that I googled It
.
.something like ""what's up with the number 47"" and a couple pages dedicated to explaining why 47 is the ""quintessential random number of the universe"" popped up and I was thoroughly more weirded out.&&You had me at Hugo Weaving&&Agent 47 in blackface&&i love movies like this.&&Damn.  That looks like some Revenant type shit!&&love it cant wait&&Forgive my ignorance.  As an American, how the hell can I watch this? I only see it being shown I’m Berlin and released in Ireland. &&So... West Ireland?&&How likely is it to get broad distribution in the US? This looks like something I'd like to watch.&&They should premier it at the next EU - UK Brexit meeting. 
Get the Irish minister to introduce it. 😆&&Agent Smith has aged.&&What was Hugo pulled over by the cops?  Weaving. &&Holy hell yeah that sounds amazing&&Are there any other Irish Westerns? This sounds badass, but also depressing as hell. &&Apparently it's a remake [of this short film from 2008](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1344653/?ref_=tt_trv_cnn)&&Sold.  Sounds like a badass flick.&&I upvoted you so your score would be 1916&&Sounds like an Irish film; depressing as fuck.&&I really want to see this!! This sounds very depressing.&&As a fan of bleak everything, I’m super excited. &&Historical post apocalypse. Never knew I needed this til right now! &&The reason I’m from where I am is because great great grandpa cronnyberg fled the famine. As I’m sure is true for loads of people, some who may not even realise it. I’m so up for watching this. &&I wonder if this will have the same sort of effect *Braveheart* had in Scotland and help to buoy Irish nationalism in the North for a new generation.&&I'm kind of shocked I can't think of another movie that takes place during this period. Anyone? Anything?&&Is it a western if it doesn't take place in the old west?&&A couple of years ago during a trip to Ireland I saw advertising for Irish country music shows in a hotel's pub near Gort. They showed men with cowboy hats and boots.  No joke.&&Great call, hopefully a lot of the actors are sourced locally or have good vocal coaches. 

Nothing distracts me more than a horrible attempt at an irish accent!&&Ah the guy in charge is Irish, and the supporting cast is full of solid Irish character actors (Barry Keoghan, Jim Broadbent, Stephen Rea). I trust this is in good hands, even if there could be some disagreement in intonation on the Offaly/Laois border.&&At the least Weaving will nail it.

Edit: his character isn't Irish...&&I never understand this, there are *loads* of Irish actors they could get. I get why they need a few big name stars that will sell internationally but they could easily have predominantly Irish actors. &&This is going to be Ireland's braveheart. As a Scotsman I can safely say that's not a good thing.&&I actually applied to be an extra for this movie, they were looking for native Irish speakers from Connacht (West Province of Ireland) where this movie is set, so they seem to be committed to getting it right.&&I know this might be futile, but just in case you want to read what historians think about the potato famine, I made a comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7wu1px/first_image_of_hugo_weaving_in_upcoming_irish/du3o6s5/) earlier linking three threads in /r/Askhistorians. I'm also very willing to answer questions, preferably in PM. I'd rather avoid being berated for sharing what is now basically the fairly widely accepted concensus within historical circles. It was less widespread when I started my research roughly 8 years ago, but it is now.&&British*&&> especially when everyone does that fucking Irish voice shouting ""potato!""

As an Irish man living in Wellington for the past 8 years.... still get this a few times a month, on average.&&Keith Lemon, the ""comedian"" that does that, can eat a dick. Any of his characters are basically the same ""Dont foreigners sound funny?"" bit&&Yeah the old potato joke has always struck me as fairly poor taste, that shit SNL skit a few months back for example. &&Maybe a nomination over Patel, but not a win over Ali.&&I thought his performance, like almost everything in that movie, was a bit too over the top to be taken seriously.&&I wouldn’t have had him win, but he would have deserved a nomination. I probably would have also nominated him for V for Vendetta and had him win for The Matrix.&&The scene where he was talking about his friend's shirt was brutal. The pain and torment Weaving was able to convey was nothing short of spectacular&&he's about as versatile as actors can get and up there with the very best imo. &&I thought it was Sam Neill. &&Looks like a Donald Sutherland/Paul Giamatti lovechild&&No he's the killer from Too Many Cooks.&&The big challenge for me was figuring out that the hand on the left guy’s waist is his own hand. &&Thing hitched a ride.&&I came to find this out.&&The worst year of the famine was 1847 and is known as black 47.&&“Good afternoon, 47. Your target is the entire population of Ireland.”&&I am pretty sure there is a version of that idea in Black Panther. But I would watch the shit out of that spin-off.

&&""They do move in herds""&&Hugo weaving is my ""what actor would you pick if every character they've played was in your army.""&&Mister O'Sullivan&&The time of the potato is over Mr Anderson.&&Cowboys Ted! They're a bunch of cowboys!&&It has to do with outlaws, guns, revenge, soldiers, and is set in the wild region of western Ireland. It's in the style of a western.&&Its set in Connemara 

Edit: To give a serious answer though, heres a description of the plot:

'When Feeney returns to Ireland after fighting in the Afghan War with the British Army, he discovers his family was thrown out of their home and died in the poorhouse in his absence. Enraged at the manner in which his family was treated, he embarks on a one-man vendetta to bring justice to these famine victims, working his way up through the Irish political and social hierarchy to destroy all those who left his family to die.

On his tail, is Hannah, played by Weaving, an aging British soldier, a famed tracker of deserters and old friend of Feeney’s, who is sent to stop the young soldier before he can encourage revolution among the battered and starved people.'

Sounds like it might be a revenge western with the main character travelling around on horseback killing people. &&The Proposition is a Western, too, and that's set in Australia.  

Westerns have evolved to become a broader genre than merely just cowboy films set in the American west. They've become more about armed outlaws, a desolate and untamed landscape, ruthless men, revenge etc.&&a boxty western&&A basic theme of the Western is the absence of Government and Law. Typically, the story is based on the actions of individuals, either ethically or unethically.&&I can't even begin to imagine the kind of fear and panic that must set in when an entire population realises they're literally running out of food. To think this kind of thing still happens today is pretty upsetting.&&[deleted]&&Kind words dude, thank you👍🏻&&Then years later become a cult classic.&&He's pretty good at picking interesting scripts!&&Can we blame those protoindoeuropeans for driving us celtic peoples from our lands around the mediterranean that were ours all the way back to our neanderthal ancestors before our human ancestors migrated out of Africa?&&I think it has more to do with the word Genocide being thrown around. The word famine exists for uses like this and genocide exists for something else. Kind of weekends the use of words when people just exchange. Genocide is the intent to eradicate a people. The great hunger was just Britain doing a shit job at handling it. Also free markets and all that aren't always the best help, state welfare is needed in a free market world.&&It's the case of aristocratic negligence over anything else, most people on this thread are colouring it as a intentional conspiracy of genocide which is very far from the truth.&&Your last sentence neatly describes contemporary England. &&Fin Dwyer is a knowledgeable lad&&I'd like to share a revelation I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your nationality. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with their surrounding environment, but you British do not. You move to another area, and you multiply, and you multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A potato. The British are a disease, an colonial cancer of this planet. You are a famine, and we are the cure.&&Love that band&&That band rules&&Might not be the same across the board but in my school Irish history was given just as much time as world history. We learned all about what was done to our ancestors. &&Same. How is this the first I'm hearing about this if it's coming out next week? &&Found it! My work here is not needed.&&I really hope they don't completely ignore the influence England had on our famine, if they do it'll feel like it's missing a large reason why Irish people are still angry about it to this day. &&>Are there any other Irish Westerns?

[Into the West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHcMIXxkn3M) maybe. It's not a western in a conventional sense but the film itself uses American western movies and motifs in it's characterization somewhat. But the Irish idea of the 'West' has particular connotations that the film explores, using some 'western' elements to draw parallels.

Ultimately the 'West', in Irish culture and in the film, has been seen as a bastion of older ways and traditions that could be accessed or re-discovered by exposure or travel in to the west of the country. This is relatively recent, really since [an Gorta Mór](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)) (the Great Hunger) in the 1840's. Before this many Irish people only spoke Irish but after only pockets of native speakers remained along the western seaboard. When the [Gaelic Cultural revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_revival) began in the 1880's and into the early decades of the 20th century there was a great interest in recovering and recording what had been lost and the West was seen as the repository of this culture and knowledge. Poets such as [W.B Yeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats) expressed this perception of the west in their work frequently. The linguistic and cultural revival in many ways created this unique idea of the Irish west.

The film plays with and mingles Irish and American Western tropes and narratives quite beautifully.&&*The Wind That Shakes the Barley* is a great film about the Irish independence war in the 1920s.

Mankind's adversarial relationship with a bleak and difficult landscape (the location itself is typically an antagonist itself in westerns), a personal pursuit of justice or righting a wrong by the protagonist, and relatively lawless and/or morally grey inhabitants are all prime features of a western.&&Are Irish accents hard to imitate?

&&The population wasn't just running out of food, it was being forcibly taken from them.&&That's not the case.

>The problem in Ireland was not lack of food, which was plentiful, but the price of it, which was beyond the reach of the poor.&&Fun fact, the Ottoman empire sent boat loads of food and donations of cash to aid the famine in Ireland. The Irish people were so grateful, hundreds of Irish nurses traveled to aid Ottoman troops during the Crimean War against Russia years later.

Less fun fact, the British diplomats told the sultan to scale back his donation, because it would look bad if he gave more than Queen Victoria did. Also part of the story is how the English tried to block the Ottoman ships from unloading their cargo of food, so the Turkish sailors just left it on the docks.

http://www.ihistory.co/how-an-ottoman-sultan-helped-ireland-during-the-great-famine/&&The influence on, as in, the entire reasoning behind it.&&I read about the famine a couple of years ago and I always thought it was just the potatoes got a disease and couldn't produce but it was also the English were taking all their food and leaving them with nothing. I read that some even call it the Irish Genocide. Really sad to read.&&Yeah, I just visited Ireland recently and it was educational. I'd always thought the famine was just a result of unfortunate conditions and diseases that resulted in low crop yields.

Not even close.&&The way I understand it, Ireland at the time grew nothing BUT food. The Irish, mostly poor, grew potatoes and ate them while the English used Ireland as a giant plantation to grow more expensive foods for export: beef and wheat. Many English never even saw their estates in Ireland - this is where the term ""absentee landlord"" originated.

The Irish famine was caused by a potato disease. It caused potato crops to fail and deprived the poor of their main food source. Wheat and beef weren't affected but weren't eaten in Ireland because they were too expensive and continued to be shipped to be sold abroad all throughout the famine. 

Despite the Irish dying in droves, the English parliament did not force controls on wheat and beef prices, nor did it forbid their export. It makes sense, since many of the members of parliament had Irish estates and did not want their profits affected. So for years, thousands of people watched their children starve and then starved themselves, in many cases mere yards away from tons & tons of food that the English army said they couldn't have.

The people of Ireland are still a little miffed about that.&&Britain, not England.  The Crown was formed by Scotland and England, i know it isn’t as trendy to hate the Scottish but you can’t just single out England. &&It really annoys me that the history of Ireland under the British isn’t covered in history at school in England&&[deleted]&&My boyfriend did some extra work for this and said it was fairly anti-British&&And I still keep reading comments from certain folks that British colonization was a positive thing (ironically, they were talking about India).&&>I really hope they don't completely ignore the influence England had on our famine

Most American's aren't exposed to authentic Irish accents, so they don't know what is right or wrong.

However most of the world is regularly shown American faces and voices, leading to more ready impersonation. 

An Irish person will know when an Irish accent is wrong, and probably when an American accent is wrong, however an American person will only know when their nations is incorrect.

This comment in my Irish voice.](https://vocaroo.com/i/s0W09xBz6uAA)&&Even Irish actors sometimes try other variants of the Irish accent in movies and they sound pure shite&&I don't think it's necessarily hard, but in most productions you just have people using 'Stage Irish' or 'Orisih', which is a bit of a ""top o' the morning to ya!, oh me pot o' gold!, pa ta pa te potato!'&&Trouble is in how widely Irish accents vary. People from the sticks of Donegal, or Cork would have trouble even understanding each other through their accents. 

When actors do an 'irish' accent they typically blend aspects, or focus on Dublin and don't really care what part of Ireland they're supposed to be from. Worse again when two actors playing characters from the same place and sound completely different.

The classical training creates a very different attitude which manifests itself in the typical range of character Europeans can play.

Or just factual?&&Good. To ignore what their nation did and how it effectively exacerbated the famine to its advantage would be a disservice to those that died. People these days (English people especially) aren't educated as to why Irish people to this day still hold a serious and deep grudge against England for what they did, and hopefully this movie opens light on it. &&Well anything about the famine should be.

I look forward to seeing the Lords and twaddlers of Britain regale their other roll of total dickheads once more and the Irish giving them a proper kicking (Hopefully). 

If it's anti-British, then it's anti-British government of which I have no problem with as someone who's 75% against most of the shit the current British government try to pull. 

Anything that reminds our current British government of some fucking humility is a big tick in my book. The fools in Westminster (And most of the house of lords) responsible for the famine should have hung.

It's set within a solid historical context so we know the scope will be narrow.&&Policies that also killed millions in India through famine. &&No you are right in pretty much everything you say. However, what must be considered is how the political and economic situation in the decades leading up to, and including the years of the Hunger, was (mis)managed to create the environment where this level of catastrophe could occur.

It has been called a famine, hunger, genocide, contrived starvation and other things and it remains contentious to this day. But by 1845 a huge number of the population worked large areas of land for absentee landlords (they lived in Britain instead of their land holdings in Ireland) growing grain, raising livestock etc for export and the profit of said landlords. The workers were retained on tiny plots on which they could grow their own food. The potato was the only food which could reliably provide enough of a yield on such small plots of poorer land in terms of nutritional and caloric output for they and their families to subsist.

This economic/political model loaded the gun, the monoculture in the variety of potato used for subsistance aimed it, and the blight fired it. Inaction and strict adherence to the ideology of non interference in the market to reduce the price of other foods exacerbated the scale of the calamity in the early years. 

There was also certainly an opinion among some in senior positions in Britain that the catastrophe was divine punishment to the Irish and others who saw it as an aid to their aims of fully colonising the island of Ireland (an enterprise which was already underway for 700 years by that time, although it had never been fully achieved in that time), hence they felt the disaster should be allowed to continue and not be mitigated by them so as to more fully conquer Ireland.&&You're correct but there was also a similar dependence on potatoes by the poor across Europe and the blight was worse in many other countries such as Spain. Nowhere else had a famine though because the ruling classes made sure people had alternatives to eat. The opposite was true of the British ruling class. They made sure the Irish were dependent on potatoes and then provided nothing else when the crop failed initially, preferring to let nature take its course.&&It was death if you're lucky rather than than a half year jaunt to hobrth in a ship if festering disease&&Yeah, the potato famine is considered by some to be genocide with how England handled it&&Well that wasnt exactly unusual in the context, and access to many lakes and rivers is still controlled by Fisheries Ireland who employ bailiffs etc. &&Yeah obviously, goes without saying. If the famine in Ukraine is a genocide, then surely this one is too. What's the double standard for?   
  
And might as well add the Bengal famine/genocide too while we're at it. &&A lot of this is due to emigration.

Regarding the death toll during the Famine:

> A census taken in 1841 recorded a population of 8,175,124. A census immediately after the famine in 1851 counted 6,552,385, a drop of over 1.5 million in 10 years.

Which is obviously horrendous. But then you'll see the population keeps dropping for the next 75 years. The population of (combined) Ireland dropped to just above 4 million in the 1930s.&&Well, if one includes the great diaspora . . . there are more Irish outside Ireland than there were ever within. There are over 33 millions of persons of Irish descent in the States alone.

I'm from North-Dublin which has traditionally been seen as working class. However I'm from a well off area of it which tempers my accent to a more neutral point.

Further I was born in England and lived there until I was three - this was beyond my memory but it has undoubtedly coloured the manner in which I speak even if I'm not conscious of it.
&&The richer parts of Dublin have very neutral accents which have been described as American like.

Most Irish people, not some.&&Over the space of about 50 years our population was halved at the hands of the Brits. All while it was illegal to speak our own language and fish our own rivers/seas.

Anyone who knows anything about those times would tell you it was unquestionably a genocide. The genocide of both a culture and a people. &&Most of those that consider it “controversial” to refer to it as a genocide are coincidentally English. &&I mean, Colonialism is still being swept under the rug. It doesn’t count if it’s them. Ever. &&In good part because a lot of that initial drop was the young and fit emigrating. So they aren't around to have kids.

Most of the later drop is due to the young and fit continuing to get the hell out of ireland to better opportunities elsewhere.

&&And they still haven't recovered to the population level of the 1841 census.&&During the famine 1 million emigrated, they didn't *all* die btw.&&I think they have the largest ethnic legacy after German American descendants. &&As a long time player of X-Com your veneration of a snake man makes me highly suspicious of your island.&&That's basically what we got in the England.

Potato famine, lack of food, people fee to England. Nothing about  why there was famine. Nothing about relief ships being blocked by the English. &&> Queen Victoria literally sent ships of ottoman aid back because it made her look like a useless bitch by comparison

There's no evidence for that event.&&As is the case for a lot of the history of the British Empire. &&*checks username*

I'm gonna take that with a grain of salt.&&The indian famine is generally overlooked still though. 

So weird to but the blame on the brits for untrue things when there are actual things britain should own up to. &&Gallipoli speaks for itself.&&[deleted]&&More Irish died in Gallipoli than New Zealanders yet no body remembers that.

Edit: I was mistaken about the Australian numbers, they had higher deaths. I have also been told the number of Irish dead was in the region of 4000, not 2100 to 2700.&&From my experience, I know most Brits (including myself) generally think of Irish people as our brothers more than anything (which I think confounded a lot of the older generations, for example I saw lots of older people wondering why English people were cheering for Ireland in the Euros and World Cup). Having lived abroad in the US for a decade now, I can tell you that English and Irish will often end up interacting like they're brothers rather than from different countries, there's just too much of a shared culture between the two places to feel like you're somehow completely different, especially when you're surrounded by people who culturally are completely different (like Americans). But I will say, a lot of the history of the interactions between Britain and Ireland haven't been taught to us as much as they should have been. I realised that I didn't know enough about the history even of The Troubles until I decided to sit down and watch some documentaries about it, growing up you just hear on the news whenever a bomb goes off.&&Aye but the refusal of descendants to seek justice for or to apologise for atrocities annoys a lot of people and I don't mean laypeople, I mean the government. &&I don't hold it against the English people, I just hope they lose in every sporting event&&The British government declared that the free market would fix the problem so they denied relief. 

I always find it funny how when capitalism kills millions it's a famine or imperialism at fault.   But when millions of Ukrainians died in famine the blame is communism not famine or imperialism.

&&Still not fair to us in the North :)))))&&A worse offender I've seen is Irish people in general. People act like everyone speaks like we're from Limerick with that ""Ah sure top of the mornin to ya lad!"" way, when we do not. 

As a Dubliner hearing actors trying to do our accent is often painful, [Colin Farrells natural accent in this scene in the movie 'In Bruges'](https://youtu.be/XaPzN2gD3PQ) is the template actors or anyone should go off in future when trying to do a Dublin accent because that is literally how we talk. 

e: I didn't mean people from Limerick talk like that, obviously they don't. But a thick Western accent is as close to that stereotypical ""Top o da mornan ta ya lad!"" as you can get. &&He is, but he was born in Northern Ireland. &&Well if you asked him, he’d say he was a kiwi alright, but he was born in Omagh.&&He's a kiwi but also an Irish citizen. &&Worth a bit of a gander. A bit too close in subject matter to My Left Foot)(location included) but a decent drama nonetheless.&&Oh aye, he's kiwi, but Irish parents I think.&&He spends a hell of a lot of time in Australia though. &&His parents would still have theirs though, he'd have a better ear for it. Fuck know what Pierce Brosnans excuse is.&&I'm from I Roscommon and I would've said you sounded more like you were from the North.

Then again, I go to college in Dublin and people back home always say I don't sound Irish at all any more.  
I think actors make it more difficult on themselves when they try to do a really strong accent well rather than doing a more neutral one.&&I just now realized that he was also Slughorn&&Narp.&&British *The Matrix* would have a lot less bullets and a lot more pepper spray&&Actually Australian&&He's part Welsh.&&The coldest capital in Australia. It lacks most of the critters that will kill you in Sydney.&&it's scary how many genocides the supposedly ""good guys"" have done, England did it to the Irish and to India, causing millions of deaths, the U.S. almost exterminated natives, and the list goes on. But when ever we talk about these events, people always go ""but the communists killed 100 Million!( a number that is highly debated)"" dude, just because another nation u considered your enemy committed genocide, it doesn't absolve your nations own genocides.

edit
As I'm getting more attention than I thought I would, I will answer some of the general stuff I've been asked

1. Who thinks the British Empire were the good guys

well, no one, I just used them as a example for atrocities commited, the ""Good guys"" was more for the U.S, because they, (including myself for a time) belive that they are the good guys in any situation, and have covered up some nasty shit in the past. Alot of the world's problems today come from the U.S trying to be the world police and attempting to harm anyone who says otherwise. 

2. Did what happened in India be considered genocide.

I was more thing of the famine that happened in the 1800s caused by the British more so than what Churchill did to them during ww2. I believe if we're gonna consider what the British did to the Irish as genocide, then we should also consider what they did to the Indians as genocide as well.

&&No it wasn't.

The point was not an intentional killing of a group, but rather that they were behaving in a good old capitalist way and not giving a stuff about the lives and livelihoods of the irish. If they could be useful and work the fields, fine. But otherwise they were useless mouths to feed.

Some seem to forget *why* marxism and communism rose - it was because capitalist owners didn't care, or even consider they should care, about the masses

To view the irish potato famine as genocide is to miss the point - it wasn't the English getting at the irish - it was the rich not giving a stuff about the poor, any poor, anywhere.
&&> Most of the later drop is due to the young and fit continuing to get the hell out of ireland to better opportunities elsewhere.

But that isn't attributable to the Famine, its a separate debate.&&Just to indicate how far off we still are, the population of Ireland (the island) is still only roughly 6.5 million, over 150 years since the famine (4.7 million in the ROI, and 1.8 in the North).&&Whenever you hear the term ‘sectarian violence’ do you think it’s sectoids? &&*Sips tea*

*Laughs in oppression*&&Reminds me of this old documentary I was watching about egypt that had a geologist instead of an egyptologyst or archeologist. I cant spell either of those words...

Anyway, this geologist was talking about the british plundering of egyptian antiquity and how archeologists are fucking over the valley of the kings for personal fame, allowing the shale to liquify, thus destroying the whole kit and kaboodle. 

well he goes to this museum in London, that I can't recall the name of, and talks to their head curator or whatever he's called.

The Geologist tries to get him to admit that what England did was wrong and that they shouldn't have all these ill gotten gains. 

the circles the curator runs himself in explaining how just because someone stole this shit doesnt mean I have to give it back.... you know what, Im doing a shit job of explaining it, Im going to find a link. &&> As is the case for a lot of ...~~the history of the British Empire~~.

....world history&&Nah he's right, all jokes aside. &&dont forget the opium wars and the war crimes they committed in the boer war&&>*Hear them whisper*


>*Voices from the other side*


>*Hear them calling*


>*For their foes, now friends are resting side by side*&&In the context of the movie, it was a single officer who was overly brutal and cruel and had been reprimanded about it before, and then was going to have to stay in the US or return to England in disgrace for his actions.&&Were we really taxing you too much seeing as we just spent a fortune saving north america from having rude waiters and hairy lady armpits? or was it just the no representation part &&No one remembers that because it is not true.

It is estimated that 2100-2700 Irish died at Gallipoli [source](https://tintean.org.au/2015/04/06/gallipoli-an-irish-as-well-as-an-australian-campaign/) 
whereas there were ~8700 Australian deaths and ~2700 New Zealand deaths [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Campaign#Casualties)&&Completely agree. I’m living in the US right now too and on the rare occasions I meet somebody from the UK it’s always such a treat. It’s like this shared “Hey! You’re here too!” moment of camaraderie, and it doesn’t really matter that I’m Irish and they’re English or Scottish. We just both share that experience of being from across the pond. 

&&> to apologise for atrocities annoys a lot of people

Tony Blair issued an official apology for the Famine in 1997&&This is why people still hold a grudge, their complete lack of acceptance for any wrongdoing or any form of apology is why people are still angry about it. 

All it would take would be a simple ""Yeah our ancestors fucked up, sorry"" and a lot of anger would be eased, but for as long as they don't people are always going to be bitter about it. &&I see your point there. It’d be just decent for a member of the royal family or the Prime Minister or someone to visit a memorial site and give a short speech or something. 

Like when Obama visited Hiroshima in memory of the bombing. No Americans today are responsible but he still went and showed respect on behalf of the country. That’s a good thing to do in my opinion. Shows a lot of maturity to accept responsibility that you could just as easily blow off as not your problem. &&Limericks people don't talk like that either tbf &&Is it just me or are the American accents in that scene seem terrible?&&Were those tourists supposed to be American? Because their American accents were laughably bad, which is funny because a few comments up someone said they usually can't tell when actors from other countries use an American accent.

&&Thanks for this link, definitely going to watch this movie later tonight. 
It's a shame that a lot of actors do a poor imitation of Irish accents because Colin Farrell's accent is quite nice.&&I have a weird tick that when I am around people I develop their accents unintentionally. An old boss of mine was from Dublin and I'd say ""yer man"" every two seconds. &&What? Limerick people don’t talk like that at all man. Classic dub&&Lived in Ireland 20 years, not once ever have I heard anyone say ""top of the morning to you"" unless they were making fun of bad Irish stereotypes&&Character is a brit.&&Indeed. As an Irish man I hardly consider the British empire the good guys however. The ordinary British citizen is just a normal person like anyone else, but the empire class were bastards. &&Err, I'm English and at no point have I thought of us as the good guys when it comes to Ireland.&&Dan Carlin really made me think about this on his Mongols podcasts. He compared Genghis Khan to Hitler in terms of his ruthlessness and how he oversaw the deaths of so many people. We don't speak about Genghis in the same way we speak about Hitler and the Nazis. He wondered that as we move further away from a historical event we start to find it less terrible.&&I don’t know of anyone who justifies/denies the atrocities committed by the British, US, or any other empire.

Why would you shoehorn in that bit at the end, other than trying to whitewash and justify the atrocities committed by the USSR, Red China, etc.? They were bloodthirsty, oppressive, sadistic regimes. &&There are no good guys in history. The history of humanity is the history of people killing and enslaving each other. Good guys by itself is a completly subjective term. If the Nazis had won WW2 then they‘d be the good guys. &&Good post. Fair points.&&*Goes back to playing EU4*&&Flourish the pinky&&Those sips are about to get a lot smaller with Brexit looming.&&I don’t understand why people try and defend the actions of their forebears or countries in this manner. It's _okay_ to say ‘look, we fucked up’. It's admirable even. What isn’t okay is to defend them even though what they did is clearly abhorrent or wrong...&&It's a valid argument.

You live in a house you work 40hrs a week to pay a mortgage on.

That house and property has been bought and sold 50 times since it was originally stolen from a native (US).

You should have to give it back?  Why not?&&I'll take stole some mummies and won't give back some jewels over allowing millions of people to die from starvation any day. 

And if you think they only did it once, [I've got some bad news](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943). 
 
But we could talk all day about horrific shit that they did that goes way beyond grave robbing tbh, and I have to be in the pub in 10 minutes. &&lol Egypt has also plunderd itself of its own riches aswell.&&Are you referring to the 1993 documentary [*The Rape of Tutankhamun*](https://youtu.be/ltsIb7CPhN4) presented by John Romer?  It's one of my faves and I think everyone should see it.
&&Considering the upheaval Egypt has been through, those antiquities wouldn't have survived if they hadn't been in a British museum. You might not like it, but it's the safest place for them.&&[deleted]&&Eh, the rude waiters are Parisians, not French in general.  Hairy armpit ladies on the other hand, yeah that's worth burning down churches for.&&Shh, there's a circle that must continue to jerk.&&> All it would take would be a simple ""Yeah our ancestors fucked up, sorry"" and a lot of anger would be eased, but for as long as they don't people are always going to be bitter about it.

The Prime Minister of Britain apologised 20 years ago&&To be fair most of it can be put down to ignorance, most people just aren't aware or ever made aware of how bad the whole England Ireland thing was, I know it's not taught in most schools. &&And it’s not like this shit stopped 96 years ago with independence, the Good Friday Agreement isn’t even 20 years old yet.  And the fact that Theresa May and all the brexiteers who don’t give a fuck about what happens to the border and would break the GFA if they could is just a reminder that the British government and a large portion of their citizens have always seen us as lower than them and having to bend to their idiotic wills.  Nothing changed for them.  Their true colours are just showing again.  At least now the Irish have control of their own fate and can block any unsatisfactory border proposal.

I don't think Tarleton burned down a church full of civilians, but he did massacre a lot of surrendered Continental troops.  My point is that he really was a bad guy, even if Hollywood did *gasp* exaggerate and take liberties to make him seem even more a villain.  

I do agree with the overall take that we shouldn't portray the British as Nazis in a revolutionary context, but from a American revolutionary perspective they certainly were the 'bad guys' and by that point in the war, public opinion had swayed against the Brits pretty dramatically, and not just because ""they were taxing us too much.""&&He did apologise for the Famine in fairness&&The DUP alliance bullshit has most of my family seething.

The President of the United States of America thinks that no other nation has access to the exact same media, and in some cases, media that is even more violent (IMO). And yet, mass shootings do not occur there. Other nations are FAR less violent, and they watch/play the same damned things...

So he may just be remarking that ratings are more influenced by sexual content than violence. FWIW, that's a common sentiment here on reddit.

Yeah. *Maybe* one of those teachers are proficient with firearms, are able to keep a cool head in a crazy situation, and will be able to prevent an attack. But really, most people are going to freak out and lose control. Even if you do own guns and are able to take them into class, it doesn't mean you are mentally prepared to handle a situation like that.

Plus, this ultimately leads to another situation where the expectations are placed upon the teachers. On top of trying to teach and do your job, now you're going to be expected to take firearm safety courses, training programs, getting their gun licenses, etc. How much extra shit are teachers supposed to do on top of their actual jobs?

Do people really think a teacher is gonna put a violent  child down instead of trying to talk them out of it first? No. They’re going to be terrified, confused, frozen, and more. Or worse, they could overreact and shoot someone as a knee-jerk reaction.

Just LISTEN to that. Those kids were scared in the beginning of the video, they knew a shooting was happening and that they could die, but once that gun went off near them they went into full on terror mode. The sheer loudness of those shots is going to cripple 99% of people with fear. That is a BIG gun and it's ripping that school apart. What is a teacher going to do with a 9mm against that? There was a trained armed uniformed guard at the school that was too scared to go confront the killer during the shooting.

He's just so stupid and with such a limited vocabulary that he can't express that idea.&&Still, there already is. I believe ""strong grisly violence"" only falls in R rated movies.

even worse the inevitable wrongful or controversial shooting.

Maybe one of those teachers are proficient with firearms, are able to keep a cool head in a crazy situation, and will be able to prevent an attack. But really, most people are going to freak out and lose control. Even if you do own guns and are able to take them into class, it doesn't mean you are mentally prepared to handle a situation like that.

If armed people magically stopped and prevented all shootings then we'd see vigilantes rising up time and time again in states with open/conceal carry.. yet it almost never happens.&&Exactly. And now you’ll have stressed out, unappreciated teachers being harassed by students and parents.... with guns!

Teacher gets angry and snaps, and the gun is right there... Or a student wants to commit the shooting and makes a plan to steal a gun from a teacher. Again, the gun is right there, and even with training I doubt all of the teachers could be trusted to keep their gun safe. (especially if they work at a ""good"" school and let their guard down)&&For decades, schools have been underfunded enough that teachers buy classroom supplies out of their own paychecks. And this is a common enough practice that there is a tax deduction for teachers that do this (although it isn’t nearly enough to cover what many spend). 

And this fucker thinks that these overworked, underpaid people should be paid a bonus for taking on another, extremely serious, responsibility? How about we pay them more for doing the work they already do?

Guns are in fact legal, including many which would be considered “assault weapons” in the US (though some, like the AR-15, are classed as restricted). That said, [this 7.62mm rifle](https://i.imgur.com/Ukm95IG.jpg) is considered a non-restricted firearm. Meaning it does not even need to be registered, but the owner needs to fill out some paperwork and pass a background check for a firearms license. Not too different from many states in the US. Yet mass shootings seem to be far less common, even in areas where hunting is popular and rifles abundant. 

However, Canada universal healthcare. While not perfect, the system does provide access to mental healthcare as well. I suspect that this has a lot to do with the much lower rate of mass shootings. &&Same goes for Australia, the UK and New Zealand.&&Australia as well.

I don't think things are going to go well with Mrs. Crabapple having a Glock.&&And probably leave their gun somewhere on accident.&&Or a 6 foot 5 ninth grader overpowers a teacher and takes it from them. Or someone takes it from the teachers desk if that's where they keep it. Having a gun less than 20 feet from kids at any given time is a bad idea.&&Yes. As a gun owner and someone who's owned an AR-15 since the 90's, I have to be very upfront with the reality of guns. More guns = more gun deaths. Generalized 1 on 1, small group, and suicide based gun violence is completely seperate from mass shootings though. It's important to keep that in mind. If a suicide victim or gang member sets out to kill a rival gang member, it doesn't really matter if he uses a hammer or an M-249, the end result is still ~1 death. In a mass shooting, the limiting factor is time between rounds fired, time between reloads, and the force/effective killing range of the bullet fired. 

It's no coincidence that the top 4 deadliest mass shootings (Oslo, Orlando, Las Vegas, Port Arthur) were all committed with semi auto box magazine fed rifles. 

Another factor anyone serious about curbing mass shootings should consider is this: Is there much difference between a bump stock and a fully automatic rifle (especially when firing indiscriminately against a large group of tightly packed people?)

If not, is it a coincidence that the first person to use a (somewhat) fully automatic rifle in a mass shooting that also happens to be the most deadly mass shooting in American history?

If it's not coincidence, is it possible that the laws prohibiting easy access to fully automatic weapons (NFA) have therefore kept fully automatic weapons out of the hands of mass shooters, and thereby saved many lives?

&&Or worse, get expelled&&Or the police mistake the teacher for the shooter and kill them when they arrive.&&I haven’t seen it, but I heard a teacher wrote an opinion piece basically saying, “I work to teach your children. Not to take a bullet for them.” 

When I heard that my head was just like, “Well, yea.” Teachers (I think globally) are held to such higher standards than most people/job occupations. I feel we don’t need to be arming teachers and it is not their job to be human shields. Not that I’m condemning any teacher that has or would put themselves in the line of fire, but I feel that if we are going to take this problem seriously in America, then we need to start somewhere that makes more sense than arming a teacher. &&Also judging by the amount of times teachers have lost my homework I wouldn't exactly trust one to keep track of a gun.&&It just irks me that this argument has to be made... it’s such a terrible idea, yet somehow it sparked a national debate. I agree with you, but I wish my brain never had to conjure a defense against arming teachers.
&&This isn't even the most likely scenario. Consider this:

That one kid with the troubled home life who's been the bane of teachers forever. Today he's especially on edge, and he won't calm down. You try to get him to go to the front office before things escalate, but instead he gets confrontational. He's a junior in high school and on the football team so he's bigger and stronger than you. He starts walking toward you, his voice raising. You remember the gun on your hip, is he trying to take it away from you? Do you draw it and threaten him? What if he doesn't stop, do you kill him in front of your class? If you leave it holstered, will he take it? Who will he use it on?

Seeing as how the police officers in our country shoot people all the time in exactly these circumstances, it is idiotic to think that this exact situation won't start immediately happening if we start putting guns in schools. What would have been, at worst, a physically aggressive student is now a life or death choice in front of young kids who are supposed to trust you. The only right answer is not putting a gun in that situation in the first place.&&For the record, your scenario is highly unlikely to happen. Teachers, even with a gun, would not be going room to room. The protocol in nearly every school situation like this is for the teachers to lock the door, turn the lights off, close blinds, and every student and teacher to get out of view.

No teacher is out. No teacher is going door to door.

Teachers with guns is still an insanely bad idea.&&If you don’t think trump has motivated every moderate and liberal to gtfo and vote in 2020, you’re crazy

> When scholars have examined real-world violence – school shootings, homicide, and aggregated assault – any tiny links between video games and mundane acts of aggression completely disappears. Research done by the US Secret Service and our laboratories have both found that less than 20 percent of school shooters played violent video games with any amount of regularity. Not only is interest in violent video games rare among school shooters, these perpetrators express much less interest in this violent medium than most other individuals. If you were to enter any school in America you would find that about 70 percent of the male students habitually play violent video games. If there is any link between violent video games and school shootings it is in the opposite direction expressed by politicians and researchers examining irritating loud noise exposure – those who perpetrate acts of violence in schools are more than three times less likely to play violent video games than an average high school student.&&I fundamentally disagree with a lot of policy decisions he made.

-Donald J. Trump&&Yeah I feel like swat officers are trained to shoot anyone carrying a gun first and ask questions later.

It would only be a matter of time until one lost it and shot a kid. 

To bring it back around to film, it's Chekov's gun. If you introduce a gun into a situation, over a long enough timeline, it's going to get used. &&2018: Epidemic of school shootings

NRA: ""Arm the school buildings!"" (I dunno, I adjust don't understand how the NRA thinks.)&&Or, “We had someone on the property who was trained and carrying. If he had followed protocol this would have been over before all of these people died. We don’t need stricter gun laws, we need people to follow the system and guidelines put in place. The system works if people follow it, and unfortunately this guy tried to talk down the student because he knew the kid since he was in kindergarten and he didn’t want the kid to get hurt, and if the teacher would have just shot him then none of this would have happened.”&&A number that seems to be floating around the Internet is that the NYPD has about an 18% accuracy on firearms. And they’re trained for this (notionally). 

Teachers with guns in schools is just asking for friendly fire accidents. Not to mention how the police, responding to a shooting, might well shoot the teacher. Philando Castile got shot during a traffic stop, after merely informing the cops that he was (legally) armed. I can’t imagine that this would go better during an actual shooting.

I was playing some Rainbow Six Siege last night. When I woke up the following morning, I realized I turned into an Englishman in his mid 50s. I began to throw around what looked like balls with the Union Jack on them, and I kept voicing my contempt for ""fookin' laser sights""&&That and Google's helpful search engine result customization putting you in a bit of a fucking echo chamber.&&Yup. It wouldn't be very long before we saw a teacher try to stand up to some bully kid by murdering them. ""I feared for my life so it's justified self defense!""

It would turn out exactly like modern day police.&&That's why the principal needs a gun too, a bigger gun. So when the teacher's gun is stolen they have a backup. Or maybe some sort of kill drone. In either case the superintendent will need an even biggerer gun. And so forth until you get to the top. We're all assuming Trump is a stable genius, so well give him the biggest gun and hope he doesn't misuse it&&This.  There are more accidental ~~fun~~ gun deaths in this country than deaths from school shooting.

It's asinine how anecdotal stories drive policy instead of actual results.  Do what works!

I'm 100% done underestimating how fucking dumb my fellow Americans are. Not taking anything for granted.&&Oh shit i guess i don't. I must be in some sort of minority here.

The main problem with this country, underlying every other issue we are facing is that we can't fucking get along long enough to even talk to one another..&&""You need a guy in every school that even from a mile away, the school shooter sees that guy and says 'uh uh, I ain't messing with that dude.' ""&&Here's how I imagine a school shooting occurs in the ""armed school."" 

Bullets ring out, kids panic. Some teachers try to get their kids to safety/locked inside their classroom while others just abandon their kids to be heroes heading towards the sound of gunshots. Teachers get to where the shooting is, they don't know who the shooter is, some of them get shot. 

If the shooter is a student they may be stopped or may blend into the panicking crowd of students. If the shooter is an adult / a teacher, then the armed teachers (who certainly won't be well trained / prepared for this compared to actual police or military forces) may realize they're a danger or may confuse other armed teachers for the shooter.

Then SWAT rolls in and takes everyone they see out because that's what SWAT do.&&And having a gun around *drastically* increases the odds of committing suicide. Hell, it's not even just teachers we'd have to worry about. A student who wants to perform a shooting or commit suicide would have another way of getting ahold of a gun.&&The armed teacher's dilemma: shoot a terrorist-student or not shoot fast enough, and other students die or you die or you miss and shoot an innocent student or you are disarmed and get shot with your own gun or your gun is used to shoot innocent students or your gun is the only gun available and becomes the only gun shooting innocent students...&&Philando Castile.
Not being pedantic, his name should be remembered.&&I like that you think he listened instead of pretended to have empathy. &&He said something similar after the Orlando shooting:

“If you had some guns in that club the night that this took place, if you had guns on the other side, you wouldn’t have had the tragedy that you had.”&&So teachers now should take an oath like a police officer? What a fucking joke. In this last situation, what does he think an armed teacher could’ve done? He comes in with an AR15, smoke bombs etc. Students go running and screaming in packs. Are teachers supposed to fire into a crowd of students hoping to hit the gunmen? This is so sad. How the hell can we get this NRA puppet out of office? &&And the students, of course, won't be able to use the teachers' guns. Because they belong to the teachers. That's just the rules.

We also need to train the teachers to be better shots. All this money we've been saving on their salaries, we can spend on making sure they're trained like killers. Finally an education initiative worth spending money on.&&Yeah.  The MPAA could use some significant improvement, particularly in the transparency and advice departments.  They could also add some additional ratings as well.  BBFC may not be perfect, but they're a lot closer, IMO, than MPAA.  

Also, [This Film Is Not Yet Rated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTL3XMDwY0c). &&Also not a trump supporter but much of the time I see things like this where people and the media are misinterpreting what he's saying or just taking things out of context.  I wish they'd stop, because it just gives credit to his claims that the media is out to get him.  He says plenty of stupid crap on his own that is 100% meant verbatim that they can run up and down their tickers and headlines - there's no need to spin things like this.

When i'm reading / listening to quotes from him I find I have to take in alot of context to have any one clip or quote make sense... he doesn't speak from scripts most of the time and tends to put many little interjections into his own train of thought as he spews his shit forth.

It can be hard to follow, but with just the smallest bit of critical thinking we could avoid spreading false conclusions like this post is doing.

There are quotes and citations in the [dissertation.](https://archive.org/stream/schoolsofhellase00freeuoft/schoolsofhellase00freeuoft_djvu.txt) Aristophanes and Xenophon seem to be the big muckety mucks about those gall derned kids.

And how laughably easy it'd be for a student who wouldn't even normally have access to a gun to snatch one from a teacher when it's at/in their desk, they step out, or whatever, and enable more shootings, rather than prevent. Nevermind if a teacher gets pushed too far..&&Better yet, teachers would never have anywhere the training like officers. Would be perfect place to commit suicide by armed teacher.

They would have to be trained to take all students in the classroom out of the potential line of fire, and to stay aimed at the entrance to the classroom.

Do you know how many kids are looking to escape?  Bullying.  Poor home life.  Undiagnosed mental issues.  Nasty break ups. 

Middle and high school is a rough time.  Kids are learning a lot about the world, and some times make really bad decisions.  

Normally, those decisions don't have a lasting impact.  But with an armed teacher present?  Things can get really dark, really fast.&&News actually broke that there was an armed deputy nearby the Florida high school that never entered the building as the shooting was happening. So even if you have teachers trained like officers, they still might not do anything. &&And unfortunately the current state of police instigated violence would indicate that they don't receive enough training either. &&When you have a baby pistol vs something a Marine is trained to use I seriously can't blame him. &&RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!&&And some, I assume, are good ideas&&I think I remember their old infomercial staring Roger Moore ... https://youtu.be/2JqcDOr7kPQ&&And maybe there should be a certain age at which a human being is considered capable and responsible enough not to destroy other people's lives or their own with such a powerful tool. &&Ridiculous, how would we ever get everyone to agree on the colors? we should build roads that lead to rings entering intersections instead.&&We could, bear with me here, give them the ability to turn on and off on either side to indicate we're turning? &&Thank you!

Add in that teachers may be more hesitant to *shoot their own fucking students* than some students will be to shoot their teachers, make a gun present, and see how that situation ends.&&I would love for people to realize that it is absurd we are even having this conversation. If movies are to blame, I blame cowboy movies because they seem to have rotted the brains of old white men everywhere if they think teachers are going to be living out fucking wild west cowboy shootouts in schools taking down school shooters as if it’s staged by fucking hollywood. The people that come up with these ideas seem to have no idea that a school shooter scenario massive panic ensues, and what happens when the police arrive, how are they supposed to know who the shooter is? How many teachers are going to be shot by police because they assume that’s the shooter. There are literally a million ways everything goes wrong and only one where it goes right.

If any game could be made into a a legitimately good film, this would be one.&&I'm surprised they didn't just [Will Yun Lee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498449/?ref_=tt_cl_t1) who voiced Wei to play him.

The character was supposed to be in his early or mid 20s.  Donnie Yen is 54.  And if they're gonna go with an older guy, they might as well have gone with Will Yun Lee.  He was the voice actor for the game.



Regardless, I hope Emma Stone has a 3 second cameo in the movie like she did in the game.&&There better be a date scene with Emma Stone.&&I'm one of those people that never enjoyed GTA, but I really loved Sleeping Dogs. The picture looks really awesome. I hope they really show off how gorgeous Hong Kong is.&&Donnie seems pretty old for the part. &&Bit torn over this to be honest.

&&Fuck a movie, make a damn sequel, this game was amazing!&&Can't wait for Donnie Yen punching civilians for no reason as a undercover cop.&&Oh god YES! Sleeping Dogs was such a great game, and with Donnie Yen starring, I guess that means we're going to be getting some awesome fight scenes.

No excuse not to get it if you haven't played it before.&&John Woo would be the perfect director for a game like Sleeping Dogs.&&Ha, just finally played and finished this game only last week. Looking forward to Donnie Yen getting snagged in the scenery.&&A few things:

1. I love Donnie Yen but Wei Shen is 28 years old in Sleeping Dogs. So if Donnie is Wei, I’m not sure how that’s going to play out. Donnie looks younger than he is, but not that young.

2. Wei Shen is Americanized. Sounds it. Donnie speaks great English, but still accented. They should’ve gone with an Asian American on this one.

3. There’s no way the story of Sleeping Dogs can be told in 2-2.5 hours unless it’s a very abridged version. 

Kelly Hu and Edison Chen should reprise their roles. &&Sleeping Dogs is at the top of my list of games that I think are most deserving of a sequel. I never expected that it would get a film adaptation, especially since apparently it wasn't very financially successful!

I'm not complaining, this is awesome news! I just hope that the movie generated interest in a game sequel.&&I don't care if this movie is good or not. i just want it to fund a second game.&&If he fights like I play the game, all he'll do is counter-counter-counter lol. I can't get any of the other button press combos right.

That aside, they have also *got* to cast Emma Stone right ? &&That role was made for him!
Yes please;&&Is it me or is he a little too old for the role?&&Donnie yen is the best as soon as i saw ip man i was hooked...&&I liked Sleeping Dogs, but the plot doesn't seem super distinctive. Fairly standard undercover cop story. Fun to play, but nothing about it screams ""film this"". I guess it just guarantees car chases and fight scenes. &&Can't say he isn't an excellent choice to lead this. The story could work wonderfully as a simple detective/action film and wouldn't really have to deal with the same problem that many other video game movies would, such as bringing video game lore into the movies in a natural way.

This is just a standard turf war story with a protagonist torn between two sides. I see no reason why this can't at the very least be an enjoyable action flick. That said, some references to the quotable parts of the video game would be nice.

&&That is one of my favorite games of all time I hope they can do the story justice&&One of my favourite games, loved the fighting mechanics!&&I’m surprised they didn’t go with Wei’s voice actor, Will Yun Lee himself.

Donnie Yen is a legend, but he’s significantly older than Wei Shen, and looks it. So I’m not sure how this is going to play out. &&Get Wilson Yip to direct this and this will basically be SPL 4.&&Should be Lewis Tan instead&&I think I'll probably just watch infernal affairs again instead.&&This seems unnecessary when the game is practically an adaptation of *Infernal Affairs*.&&Please put Emma Stone in this movie.&&One of my favorite games&&:O Sleeping Dogs was awesome!&&So ironic that the game doesnt have Chinese language option&&Every time I played sleeping dogs I had the biggest craving for pork buns &&""Pok gai!""&&""I'm Sun On Yee, motherfucker""&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yahD_0WI4s&&Tiffany went for a boot ride shortly after.

Maybe I should&&Wasn’t the plot of Sleeping Dogs already a riff on Infernal Affairs? Adapting it into a movie seems kind of redundant.&&But it’s basically an elongated Hong Kong crime flick.

I am skeptical they can fit it all in under 2 hours. &&>  If any game could be made into a a legitimately good film

I strongly disagree. Great game but the story line was a generic Hong Kong gangster/martial art film. &&Never forget Double Dragon http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0106761/&&I would kill for a Bioshock film by Del Toro&&Yeah, it's actually almost a game made out of a movie trope. Good fun, predictable but stylish, it's really something that could be pretty good.

I think better as a Netflix or HBO series/movie but sure, it's might be decent as a full-blow movie I suppose. Not really sure why they need the Sleeping Dogs tie-in though for what is **really** a very basic plot. Still, executed well it'll be fun.&&Yeah, it's weird that they didn't. He is the voice actor, he looks more like Wei than Donnie does, and he has done acting on camera before. &&Probably because he's Korean and Hong Kong people would not appreciate it as much as having a local star be the lead.

Voice acting for a game is one thing...being the lead for a live-action movie and needing to appeal to the masses requires a whole different line of marketing.  &&he  can't do action choreography like donnie yen. he's third only to jackie chan and jet li and still young enough to do it. he's also the most famous asian action actor right now. so if will yun lee was chosen, the movie probably has a shitty crew behind it.&&Donnie Yen will sell more tickets&&I knew that I heard that voice before when I saw him in Altered Carbon!&&Maybe Donnie Yen is the better singer to pull off that karaoke scene /s&&Holy shit, I didn’t realize that’s who voiced him. Hell yeah. He may not be A-list but he’s a damn fine actor &&He’s no spring chicken either &&My ideal cast is a bit old, but assuming that Donnie is Wei, would be:

* Jackie: Peter Ho
* Winston: I... honestly don't know. I think Rick Yune could do a great job, but he'd be better as Dogeyes.

* Uncle Po: JAMES HONG AGAIN! 
* Big Smile Lee: Hiroyuki Sanada
* Broken Nose: Lucy Liu
* King: Terry Crews
* Raymond: Aaron Kwok
* Pendrew: Charles Dance or Colin Firth (yes, there's a bit of an age gap there).&&'Why don't you have a pork bun in your hand?'&&POK GAI!&&The soundtrack to this game is amazing.  Introduced me to Hudson Mohawke with [FUSE](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NujFi3fCuEw).  I feel like it takes a lot of balls to dedicate an entire radio station in a mainstream ""triple-a"" video game to a lesser known label like [Ninja Tune](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KjbPtmHoDGI).  I used to listen to a them a ton back in the 90s/early 2000s when trip hop was a thing.  My only problem with the soundtrack was that so many of the songs have extended intros so you'd jack a car then head across town and get out just as the track drops.

Anyway, somewhere out there is a fight choreographer trying their hardest to think of as many finishing moves involving parts of the environment as they can.  Particularly fans.  Lots, and lots of fans.&&20 minutes of Take On Me&&Awesome video game. Terrible minigame&&""I fought the law and the..law won!""&&[deleted]&&Do we have confirmation that he'll be playing Wei Shen? The game had quite a few roles that could be played by a man of his age. He could play Big Smile Lee, or Ricky Wong, he could even play Uncle Po if they age him up a bit. There are plenty of major roles he could play without being Wei. &&> in his early or mid 20s

No, you're wrong there. 

When you first meet Jackie Ma in jail in the beginning, it's established that Wei Shen transferred back from the US after leaving Hong Kong in his teens. 

He tells Jackie Ma that their shenanigans were 15 years before.

It's established in the next scene and throughout the game that Wei Shen was an officer in the San Francisco PD on the gangs unit, who had a record number of convictions because he infiltrated Asian triads in the Bay Area. Those two facts are why he was brought into this investigation. 

We also know that a couple of the Red Poles (Dog Eyes and Winston) knew his sister when she was a teen and felt she was well developed and hot,  and Dog Eyes says he fucked her. And I believe Wei was older than her. So she'd have to be between 12 and 17. 

Assuming a median teenage year of 15 when he left, that puts him at 30 at the beginning of the game. Assuming even a couple of years younger, that puts him at 28 at the youngest. I feel like he's 32-35 in the game. &&imagine if they cast a 54 year old woman for the live action version of Mirror's Edge &&Will Yun Lee was awesome in Altered Carbon. Would be great if they cast a bunch of the voice actors given a number of them are actually actors too.&&He just got done playing a gangster working his way up in the triads in Chasing the Dragon.  Seemed okay to me.

Will Yun Lee is hardly a headliner at this point.  The fact that they're willing to go with Donnie Yen says the studio actually believes in the project to me.&&Donnie looks like he could pull of being in his 30s. I think he could do a pretty good job as the character. I wouldn’t have minded better casting though.&&Yeah I was going to say Daniel Wu from Into the Badlands would be a better choice in terms of age but just found out he is 43!

His American upbringing would match the character more.&&Wow... I googled that, found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2o8txpXDUM

I had no idea it had that super star cast and that the voice actor for the main character looks just like the main character. &&Hes korean&&Will Yun Lee is like 45 or something, and also Korean. I love the dude, don't get me wrong,  but I think Donnie will be a good fit.&&I think Donnie Yen is a bit too old for the role. He's 54 and it would be better if he were in his younger days.

You know who would be a better fit? Wu Jing (吳京), the star of Wolf Warrior. He's huge in China and check out this [pic](http://img1.utuku.china.com/533x0/news/20170324/b05a1225-f99a-42f8-99a1-fb52fa9161db.jpg), you'll see that he looks a lot closer to Wei Shen than Donnie Yen does.
&&Holy moly. I never picked up that was her.&&That was such an unnecessary cameo. Her character just disappears from the story afterwards with no explanation whatsoever &&sex scene*&&They definitely will.

That's what HK filmmakers do best, showcase the best/gritty streets and alleys of Hong Kong.&&It was like a GTA game directed by John Woo.&&If this movie does well it could inspire a sequel game. &&It felt more realistic to me. You never really rose to the top in a matter of months, you weren't packing a freaking rocket launcher in your clothes, and melee combat was blissfully fluid.&&Hong Kong was the main character&&I liked the idea of SD but I didn't have time for another open world game&&Same here!
Personally didn't like the directionless ""open worldness"" of GTA type games but SD had just the right balance of open world vs direction/storyline to keep me hooked.
Sad it never got a worthy sequel &&There could be a scene where he gets caught by the police after stealing an armored car and running twenty people over. He then wakes up in the police station with less money and goes and buys a pork bun and does the same thing again.
Edit typo&&Jackie, these are fake as fuck!&&That'd be an interesting cameo&&It might work if the movie would be more like an homage to Wu's flicks rather than trying to be like them. &&It was originally created as a homage to the HK action flick genre but it actually holds out on it's own, it deserves a sequel but I guess with the studio shut down a movie is as good as we're gonna get? &&It's like a reverse Street Fighter: the movie: the game &&united front went bankrupt, so I dont think thats possible unless they get someone else to work on it&&The developers United Front games went bust, Square Enix holds the rights and considering that it was a cult game with a small following there will only be a sequel if this movie is successful
&&Not if the studio employes Hong Kong powerhouse superstars, director and crew.&&Nobody is an asshole for expecting a video game movie to be bland.&&I’m sure you’re right. I loved that game but videogame movies always end up sucking, I don’t know how everyone in this thread is forgetting that.&&If all they did was reproduce the game's cutscenes shot-for-shot they'd probably end up with a better movie than Assassin's Creed, so hopefully it will be decent. TBH the story was somewhat predictable though; personally I think it was very good as a game but mediocre as a movie plot. So I guess it'll mainly hang on the fight choreography.&&""starring role""&&and he eats a pork bun, because otherwise he is only half a man&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8340  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/30582)&&""A man who never eat Pork Bun is never whole man""&&Fun fact: ""Pok Gai"" in Chinese is 仆街. It is a swear word that literally means ""fall to the street"", and is the Cantonese equivalent of ""Go fuck yourself""

EDIT: ""Dew lei"" in Chinese is 屌你. It is (again) a swear word that is 1:1 Fuck you. A common phrase thrown when there is an argument is 屌你老母. ”老母“ is a degradory term for mother (which literally means old mother). Unlike you American folks, the phrase ""Go fuck your mom"" isn't used by edgelords but by the locals when they're shouting at each other.

燒春包 (Siu chun Bao)/ 燒春袋 (Siu Chun Doi): Burn your dick but it means ""burn spring bag""

Thinking about it just makes me feel good.&&I loved the driving! Maybe I'm misremembering but it seemed to have this soft driving assist going on that made it feel really smooth and easy to get around with.&&Yeah, but jumping off and on vehicles felt really badass. It's just that driving in GTA games is usually very smooth and GTA games are typically everybody's frame of reference for games with similar themes and gameplay.&&Dedicated dooring button though.&&It's been a long time but The Getaway on ps2 was similar. Decent story with actually solid and fun gunplay (if not a bit stiff). The driving though? Talk about fucking up your game because of one single component. Worst driving and navigation I ever encountered in a game up until then and ever since. It really detracted from an otherwise fun game.&&I had no prblm with a driver,I got used it to it really quick&&It sucked but I loved it still. It had great atmosphere and lots of the soundtrack was amazing. Id often get stoned and drive around at night on the ninjatune radio station.&&What was the problem with the driving? The action sequences of swapping cars was pretty awesome and I loved cruising around listening to the unique honk kong style radio stations.&&the driving felt like mario kart, which honestly suited the game really really well.&&It's Hong Kong. People literally switch between Cantonese and English all the time. &&It makes sense in the game as Wei Shen spent a lot of time in the US, so speaking English would come more naturally to him, and so he'll speak to people in English and people will speak back to him in English.&&It's actually an homage to 90s HK triad films. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_and_Dangerous is one of the more popular examples.&&Oh, I know, let's set it in Boston!&&I believe it was originally supposed to be True Crime: Hong Kong but they lost the True Crime license. &&It was the spiritual successor of what would have been True Crime Hong Kong. &&what made infernal affairs good is the way it played out and not the premise. so it doesnt matter if they have similar premises.&&Exactly, this will be a movie based on a video-game that is based on a style of movies...

I'm saying it right here, this will be generic and with all the expected tropes of Hong Kong crime flicks... I wish it wouldn't be so, but I don't see why believe any different.&&> I feel like this would just be some pale imitation of the games source material.

Donnie Yen, great as he is, is already 20 years too old for the part. They've messed this up from the jump.&&> But it’s basically an elongated Hong Kong crime flick. 

And this is how you get me to buy a game.&&It really depends on how they pull it off. A few years ago game to movie adaptations sucked bad (mortal kombat, etc even though kid me loved them) . Now we have superhero movies that are actually awesome. While I do think they may ruin the original game content I still eagerly wait for what they're doing with it in a movie. Who knows, it might actually be really good. I hope it is. If it's as enjoyable as the game its already worth my time.&&Well, SD is a game that was heavily inspired by HK cop action drama films so shouldn't be too difficult for them to translate the game in what inspired it.&&Just about any game could make a good film. Studios have a bad habit of totally fucking them up is all.

No narrative is exempt from being fucked by careless production.&&Sleeping dogs had a plot  right out of a hong Kong police movie anyway.&&I still think it's possible to do a good AC movie, they just need to get it right. Yeah, put much of the movie in the part of the game people skip over, good idea.

As for Tomb Raider, well, there's another one out soon, so here's hoping.&&And Max Payne was supposed to be the perfect universe to turn into a movie too. And it sucked. Not sure if anyone wants to even remember that movie anymore.&&For some reason, they decided to focus on the crappy organization from the second game instead of making it a survival story like the first&&> Tomb Raider

We've already had like four movies from that, including [this short movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnQTW9V61jo).&&They did a decent job with prince of Persia &&I wish.&&Most of it was driving around, collecting secret chests and fighting.

You can easily cut down the 649 fights I had in that game to about 10 or so in the movie and probably eliminate 3-4 hours of driving lol.&&Really, the story is just ""undercover cop comes back to Hong Kong, infiltrates the mob, has conflicting loyalties, red wedding, finale"". The only part that they may have to stretch is how he actually builds up trust, but you can do this with a simple ""skip forward a few months/weeks"". They just need to get the pacing right.&&Thats a good thing. You can literally take the actual good parts of the story, cut it down to 2 hours, and bam you have your action flick with a real story that's intense the whole way through. &&Agreed. The reason it was so great was because I could actually *play* the part that I'd watched in so many Hong Kong Films.

The plot itself was nothing to write home about. Twists, turns, death, betrayal, redemption. But nothing too memorable... except maybe the relationship Winston and Wei shared during the game.

Lucy Liu was dope though.&&If you think about it, thats actually the best reason (besides the involvement of Donnie Yen) that it could work&&Yeah for sure, but at least that's an easy enough concept for a studio to handle. If they don't totally blow it, it'll at least be a bit of mindless fun for a couple hours.&&Yeah he was just in Altered Carbon. Dude is ripped enough to pull off an action lead. (And hes 5 years younger than Donnie Yen... which still puts him in his late 40s...)&&The often make the character look like the voice actor so the look isn't a complete mismatch for the voice.&&> he looks more like Wei than Donnie does

They often use the actors faces as models when designing. Not sure if it was the case here but I can see it.&&It's not that. They give no fucks. American Korean Jaime Chung is always doing Chinese American roles.

Donnie Yen is a A lister. 

Will Yun Lee is a nobody. Doesn't sell tickets internationally.
&&I firmly do not believe, as with the game, that Hong Kong will be the main intended market for this film.&&Hong Kong doesn't have enough of a population to matter for box office results.  The real reason is probably just that they needs someone who could do believable fight scenes and Donnie Yen was an easy fit &&Yup, action choreography is what Donnie Yen excels at and there is no question he is leaps and bounds ahead of the other guy.

The only other person I could see this doing justice is Jet Li but he most likely will not be doing any action films again due to his condition.

Also, people are forgetting how connected Donnie Yen is. If he is going to be the star of the movie, he will have the Jackie Chan effect where he could easily grab legendary Hong Kong fight choreographers and stuntmen if the studio plays their cards right.&&Yeah this is the main reason&&She’s totally half-Asian, u know?&&> Uncle Po

Surely James Hong must reprise that role.&&Look at the linked image in the OP. He's almost certainly playing Wei Shen.&&this guy sleeping dogs&&According to this [fan wiki](http://sleepingdogs.wikia.com/wiki/Wei_Shen), Wei was born in 1984 making him 28 during the events of the game. His sister is actually older and was 20 y/o when they left Hong Kong while Wei was 10.&&

He was 28 in the game. He was born in 1984, and the game takes place in 2012. &&35 to 55 is still a big difference.&&Ming-Na Wen could actually make it work.&&He's also a TKD master. Used to teach in my city back in the 90s. I remember when he left to become an actor :'( cool ass dude back then. &&They could also have casted sung kang 
&&perhaps not the place to be saying this, but fuck me i cannot for love nor money find a goddamn copy of that film that isn't mandarin!

heres my canto audio T_T&&Asians don't raisin&&Yeah, I'm a big fan of Donnie Yen and Sleeping Dogs, but Donnie playing Wei is kind of weird since a big distinguishing part of Wei's character is that he was raised in America and is only just now coming home. I'm sure Donnie will make the action fantastic, but it's going to by necessity be a very different character at this point.

Daniel is much more like Wei than Donnie; he even grew up in California and just sort of stumbled into stardom in Hong Kong when he went back to East Asia on vacation. There's another active actor in Hong Kong named Andy On who would also make a great Wei Shen--he's not as famous as Daniel or Donnie internationally, but he's another ABC with some good action credits to his name.&&Daniel Wu. I'm not gay, but maaan...&&Now I understand the really good voice acting.&&Lucy Liu completely slipped by me the first time I played, too. &&That happens with every date, they're just a way to unlock some bonuses. &&At some point you learn that she just has a thing for Asian guys and run around with a lot of them. Still, I wanted to go on a second date because ya know, it's Emma Stone.&&Apparently the dating in the game was supposed to be a lot more developed, but they cut it short because of budget.&&""So Donnie Yen is able to smell crime. And when he's not busting heads hes back at the lab banging his hot lab assistant Emma Stone. Now here's the Twist: we show it all. Full penetration and we show a lot of it.

Back to the lab, full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of...ends.""&&It really is! Also, Donnie Yen is an absolutely amazing actor/martial artist. I'm excited because he would definitely bring the character to life.

It’s really good and you can tell the developers know the tropes. But it’s more a homage than a great plot that needs to be a movie again. It’s already a bunch of movies.

Now it will fall to getting a good director which they had best be doing, cause I swear to Jesus I am going to pitch a fit if it ends up like Assassin's Creed.&&I'd give a smart arse reply like ""Tetris?"", or ""Pacman?""  But then they managed to make a movie out of angry birds and battleship...&&Big video game studios know how to make video games so they waltz into the film industry with lots of bad ideas thinking they're the shit.&&You couldn't be more wrong here. Most games have terrible or ok stories. Many have good PREMISES, but the studios would have to come up with an actually good story for that premise that fits into a 2 hour movie. And that's where many fail. They treat it as a game, not a movie.&&Yes, Infernal Affairs or the USA version the Departed.&&I assume you mean a good AC *movie* because there are multiple good AC games with Black Flag being my personal favorite. 

As for the AC movie, not great but I’ll give props to the creative idea of how Michael Fassbender enters the Animus - that claw machine was way cooler in the movie than entry in the games. &&The modern day segments are what make AC special&&i dunno now, you kinda made me wanna watch a film with just donnie yen fighting 649 dudes consecutively
&&This already sounds like a John Woo movie.  I feel like Sleeping Dogs was a Hong Kong movie turned video game and now they're just turning it *back* into a movie.&&Yeah, it's a story as old as the hills really. 

I think the real problem they'd have adapting the game itself is that the loyalties in the game are *very* conflicted to the point of glorifying the gang code of honour quite a bit and making the police side about equal in weight, even absent massive corruption or mitigating factors. That works well for a game but for a movie they'll probably fuck that up horribly. It's certainly possible to do it right but, well, they'll likely chicken out.&&emma stone was in the game so yea automatic 20/20 tbh&&i don't know, [this scene/mission](https://youtu.be/fMa6L32CzrQ) will forever be ingrained in my memory. i can't even watch the whole thing anymore, it was fucked up.&&I love Donnie Yen, but totally agree. Will Yun Lee is the perfect fit still. 

(And he's fantastic in Altered Carbon).&&His scenes are so much better than the person they have a playing the main character. &&>Doesn’t sell tickets in China&&Jet Li's condition?  What happened to him?&&Is she actually? &&I was just thinking that but the guy is 88 now, I wonder if he'll still be up to it?&&Hmm, that image looks like it's from the movie special Id. Which i felt is similar to sleeping dogs. I could be wrong about the image though.&&Haha. I'm in Bangkok right now and I've been seeing so many things from the game that I reinstalled it last night. While it's not Hong Kong, the two cities are so similar. I just booted it up this morning to test it and went through the first scenes again so it's fresh.

In BKK and across Thailand, I've been quoting the pork bun guy to my GF and buying them, I explained the little temples around town thanks to the game, and even driving on the wrong side of the road is strangely familiar (we just rode over 800 miles by scooter across Thailand). Then there's all of the architecture and little alleys and the piers and docks, and the pedestrian crossing bridges. I feel like I'm walking around in the game. The only real differences have been the different landmarks and more Buddhist temples, haha. &&sure, but it wouldn't happen in the first place &&Lee's TKD! I used to go there in the late 90s Napa represent&&Out of all of my time alive, and most of that being spent on the internet, this is the first time I have heard, “Asians don’t raisin.” 

You’ve already helped start this day off so right. &&According to Wiki Wei went to America at age 10.  Donnie Yen moved to America at age 11.  I'd say at least that part is a close match.&&Wait whaaa?&&I found Lucy out by googling something related to the game - would never pick her voice out otherwise.&&Tiffany took a long drive off a short pier in the trunk of a car in my game so... closure? &&I always thought the point was to show the main guy has trouble connecting to people. After a couple of the dates the girls will call you and say you're a fuck boi and they know you have been cheating on them.&&I killed one of my dates after you find out she was seeing someone else. Wei was cheating too but don’t you sass me. &&It's been a while, but I think one of them returns in a side story DLC? But yeah still inconsequential to the overall game.&&[deleted]&&""That is brilliant, that is the most brilliant movie I've ever heard in my life!""&&Yeah, the studio got closed down unfortunately.&&Triad wars was the suppose spin off which SE closed the studio.&&It actually wasn't. Originally it was supposed to be its own game, then Activision came and tried to make it a part of the franchise.&&> ""sharp satire of american culture""

About as much as Winter Soldier is political thriller&&Hm, i'm totally fine with that. They know how to make decent actions movies so Sleeping Dogs should be pretty easy for them.&&Oh god. I was excited about the film until I read this. Fuck.&&I imagine Sleeping Dogs is much easier to translate into film, without all the future/past split and games upon games of lore baggage and such.

Not to mention Sleeping Dogs itself is heavily steeped in the Hong Kong action film aesthetic.&&[deleted]&&Has there ever actually been one before this?&&I think he was talking about the HK film industry in general, which is typically strong. That being said, I don't know if the movie's being produced by a HK company or by a Hollywood one, either way we shouldn't expect too much. With news like this, Reddit likes to get excited, but judging by past endeavours I'd say that's only setting oneself up for disappointment. With Donnie Yen playing the lead role, it might just end up becoming a big blockbuster, aiming for a large target audience. Most people in the theater seats probably haven't played the game and the studio knows this. That's usually a big reason why gamers or other fans of certain source material (book fans for example) tend to be disappointed with movie adaptions of their beloved game or book. Understandably so, but it's best to keep this in mind as to avoid disappointment.&&That's because he knows every triad member eats pork bun, because all triad members are whole man. &&Pretty and smart...&&Haha, I was talking to my friend at work about the game and he was like: ""Man, I was so excited when I finally got to be a Red Pole..but no, everyone still treats you like shit! Why do I still have to do all this random shit people ask me for?""&&Same but sheeesh buns are expensive AF! &&Far from the worst in Cantonese, Cantonese swearing is next-level, some of the stuff said wouldn't make sense in English but it can be so vulgar.&&Ah, my sweet sweet summer child.

Reminder that these are just the ones I remember right now and would be happy to update once I think of more&&But what actor can handle such a role?&&Oh god I remember that if you held the normal brake, handbraked, and did a wheelie while at speed you would just go flying all over the fuckin place

It make no sense but Holy hell was it fun&&Don't forget ramming bad guys heads into vents and other menial stuff suddenly turned brutal death instrument&&...I just remember the knee breaking. My god that would suck to have happen to you.

Those guys with the guns in the water tunnel still fuck you up though.&&Yes, and once you get ahold of a knife or a CLEAVER holy mother of shit things get brutal. This game has some realistically scary knife/sharp melee weapon combat&&I thought there was something wrong with me while driving those things... &&In my opinion, if you're driving in Just Cause 3, you're doing it wrong.&&oh fuck, why would that ever be a design choice&&I'm just surprised there was a game that featured real car names for a Saab and a Nissan fucking Micra &&Yeah, trust me, I fucking know. It was the most frustrating thing in the world. It almost made the free roam pointless because unless you spent hours upon hours circling those streets, you could never remember where everything was. The city was simple enough for that.

It didn't help that the setting was London which meant the streets weren't a straight forward grid layout. I loved the gun play but I fucking loathed having drive from place to place in that game.&&Maybe we had different experiences or different social groups but my friends definitely speak english together from time to time. Majority of the time it's cantonese but there's some swapping here and there. &&I’ll do you one better, throw in Matt Damon and Leo Dicaprio just to make it confusing &&Daddys home 3?&&Yeah, I have to agree. I'm just getting a bit jaded because I wish people didn't get as hyped for this since this could've been any other HK crime flick, didn't need the Sleeping Dogs name at all.

There's a lot of video games with interesting themes that would make me more excited for a movie. Things like Fallout, Bioshock, Super Mario, No More Heroes, Metroid, Devil May Cry... fucking Earthworm Jim!!!

I don't agree at all with the idea that video-games don't translate well to movies, you don't have to put the same plot/experience. It's about the world. And this games have worlds that are crazy, fun and interesting.

We have countless Sleeping Dogs movies and we'll keep on having them.&&Also nice that at this point you get the DLC included with the definitive edition.&&[deleted]&&I can't be the only one who thought Tomb Raider was okay :(&&I completely expect Tomb raider to be shit which is sad because it could have been a really easy to do it right, first off why the fuck would they give the project to some no name director who has only produced shit movies, why would they make it PG13 and why would they fit 2 games worth of story in 1 movie. I know the game is over the top action but I felt the movie shouldn't be, it should be a more realistic action with a nitty gritty feel to it not fucking impossiblely far jumps and explosions in a rain forest.... Sorry I just need to vent about this lol &&Well they just rebooted Tomb Raider. So we still need to see how that turns out. &&And you know what? I'm perfectly ok with that! The whole point of the game is a homage to those movies. And I'll be honest, unless you're actually going to look for asian cinema it's been a long time since we had movies like that on the big screen. &&The problem with translating games is that a lot of the game's story is built through hours of gameplay. How do you translate gameplay into narrative? 

We know Master Chief is a badass cause we play him being a badass. But a movie can't be two hours of Master Chief shooting aliens. But a Halo movie without Master Chief shooting aliens is not really a Halo movie. How do you balance those things?

 Not only that, a lot of things only makes sense because they are gameplay mechanics. For example, jumping from hundreds of meters into hay makes no fucking sense. But it works in a game because you need a quick way to get down from the top of the high landmarks.

I don't think it's impossible to make a good video game movie. It's just a lot harder cause you have to translate gameplay. And it's going to take a lot of attempts until Hollywood figures out the formula.&&Plot for Tetris: if you try to fit in perfectly, you and everyone else may as well disappear. So this one weirdly shaped piece that never fit in (who is also a gril btw) and never even WANTED to fit in, despite her parents' and society's wishes, decides to jam herself in diagonally. No more pieces can fit... they all pile up and break the game. Now they're all free, she's a hero.&&Battleship wasnt a movie though. Its basicly narcolepsy which you can project on a wall.&&*Angry Birds* was both surprisingly competent and true to the game as well. I was quite surprised.&&It happens from both sides. Game studios that don't know how to make movies, and movie studios that don't know the first thing about the game they're adapting. Both tend to want as much say as possible, as they're both protecting their separate interests, making it all a clusterfuck.&&Yeah, I meant movie, I love the series, I think Origins is my favourite since 2. Fun fact, the new Animus has a very brief cameo in Origins, won't say more than that.&&Yeah I hate reading about how the modern segment is “the boring part” or “the part everyone skips”. The whole point of the game is the modern segment... at least, it used to be. It’s what tied everything together. &&Ip Man 3 has a scene that's basically that. At least 100 guys anyway.&&Still worth playing though.&&I would kinda love it if she showed up in the movie too.&&Speaking of that, is the show good? Been hearing a lot of things about it&&I just did a little reading and he was suffering from Hyperthyroidism and couldn't exercise for several years on Doctor's orders. An interview from about 18 months ago says he's healthy and ready to go, though. He is also 54, which is pretty old for Wei Chen at this point.&&She played a half-asian half-hawaiian in aloha, hence the meme&&No, but it was the biggest affront to my eyeballs since Mickey Rooney as Mr. Sabatoshiyamoto&&no&&He's still acting. I haven't played SD since it first came out, so my memory of the specifics of the role in the game is limited, but I'm sure with stunt doubles and CG they could overcome any age-related limitations if needed.&&The up side of playing Uncle Po is that if they play it accurate to the game, then James Hong wouldn't need to do anything strenuous. &&Oh yeah, I think you're right. 

Still, the fact that he's put the image of himself next to the image of Wei Shen to me implies that he's playing Wei Shen. We'll have to wait and see though. &&Yeah I mean, I've visited both Thailand and Hong Kong and played Sleeping Dogs... They're two completely different cultures. There may be some similarities but if you're explaining Thai culture based on a videogame based in a completely different country then it's not really accurate at all.&&I’m Asian and I’ve never heard that before &&For future reference, it's ""**Asian** don't raisin"", NOT AsianS. Rhymes way better, and is in line with the original, ""black don't crack.""&&Yeah, fair, I know he lived in Boston a good while which is why his English is so much better than his contemporaries. I think it's really more the age that's bothering me.&&Yeah, Not Ping returns.&&It's actually not really dead, most of UF's devs move to Istolia.&&SE didn’t own the studio, just the IP for SD. The studio shut down on its own.&&I gave TW a fairly good shake for about a month before it closed (I can't believe I hadn't heard of it earlier, SD is in my top 10 all time games). 

TW was just all kinds of awful - basically Farmville or something meets brief combat action that is repetitive, based around only gunplay, and is essentially pay to win. &&Really. There's so much hate against Fast and Furious but they're really not that bad of movies. They aren't meant to be story-driven, meaningful movies, they're meant to be fun and entertaining action movies. &&Look, I think they are perfect for it. All they know how to do is fun popcorn flicks. And Sleeping Dogs is just that.&&Hopefully with Yen on cast they won't have to rely on camera tricks for the fights, that was what ruined AC for me.&&This guy swears 屌你老母 buddy :)&&屌你老母!&&The first time I did that it caught me off guard. I thought I was just going to bash his head on the vent cover. Instead I'm ramming his face into the fan blades behind the vent cover. &&Metal grates covering shop windows, vending machines, *the fucking end of the game.*

Just.. Wow. No moralizing about it either, you were the roguest cop of them all and you really, really fucked up people and just that one guy was upset about it most of the time IIRC. He completely has your number from the outset, now that I think about it.&&They were going for a cinematic aesthetic in that game which, to them, meant eliminating the HUD entirely. They wanted you to feel like like you were playing a movie. They did a decent job hitting the mark but it was ultimately a very misguided design choice. 

There wasn't even a map that you could open in the pause menu. Nothing. Literally no way of navigating the city except for your blinkers constantly flashing in the direction you needed to be headed. If you were driving straight towards the destination, they wouldn't blink at all until you had to change course again.

It was a solid enough GTA clone whose memory will forever be marred in that offensively terrible driving system. That includes how shitty the car control was independent of the terrible navigation. Anything involving driving in that game was awful. The rest of it was great.&&That sounds like an amazing cast! Maybe Alec Baldwin as one of the cops? He'll do great!&&The BioShock movie was getting made with Wentworth Miller in the lead role. I don't know what happened to it though and I assume it's been cancelled. Same goes for the Borderlands movie. Maybe when Fury Road came along it rendered it redundant, who knows.&&A movie based on no more heroes would be so unbelievably shitty that it would be hard not to watch, while also being impossible to pay for &&The Mummy and The Mummy Returns also did the whole inter-war period adventure thing really well.&&> not even the sequels pulled it off 

Which sequels? The trilogy was entirely awesome and there weren't any other Indiana Jones movies made &&they need a guy with a ton of charisma to lead. not a girl(angelina) who is too gritty or even a guy like the rock who is kinda goofy but likeable. at this point, i'm not sure who can replace young ford out of the entire roster right now. none of them have the right bits for it.&&I’ve never seen it. What did you like about it?&&After a barrage of cheap, exaggerated Malay speeches to pass as ""Asian"" in games, a game with Mandarin and Cantonese was an especially welcome experience for me

I certainly would like to watch this&&If you can make a book from it, you can make a movie. The Halo books aren't bad reads at all, and they're obviously completely lacking gameplay and interactivity. If there's enough to make a story, there's no reason to try to translate odd gameplay mechanics to film.

&&> a movie can't be two hours of Master Chief shooting aliens

I disagree. that would be epic.&&I feel like Wreck It Ralph really got the video game movie thing right, honestly. &&That sounds vaguely close to the best  [movie of 2017.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_emoji_movie/)&&Pixar here. We need to talk.&&Battleship was two action sequences/montages with ""movie"" slapped around them.  I mean... *drifting a battleship!*&&It was the closet thing to a navy propaganda movie we've had since WWII&&Yes two big industries clashing.&&Yep. After Desmond died the whole thing feels pointless.

""Wasn't an apocalypse about to happen? How did Abstergo managed to get Desmond's body, his friends left his body there? What? I have to find sages now? What the fuck are sages?""&&I think AC was too ham fisted in trying to condense all of the plot lines into a single film. Players were slowly presented parts of the modern line and the historic one over many hours of play. Really I think you need a TV series to have enough time to do the slow development needed for it to work.

On top of that, the weird story line is harder for non-gamers to get into the franchise. They spent a ton of time trying to set everything up and as a result didn't let any of the characters develop or elaborate on the plot.

I wished they just focused a ton more on the historic timeline and then only teased the modern day bits here and there, expanding on it further in later films.&&you're telling me you enjoy walking around an abstergo office at 1mph? the desmond scenes were okay but in black flag the modern segment made me turn off the game a few times and I was hesitant to return to it since it was 10-15 minutes of nothing I cared about&&that's the problem with AC movie, in the game it has a little of everything for everyone. 

In the movie, they have to focus on the story, which many people find to be the worst part, especially the modern era.&&Oh, absolutely.  I wouldn't have commented had I not played the game.  I think I bought it launch day.&&Yeah, it's really good, I've heard some people say it dragged a little bit, but personally I thought it was great.&&Healthy may be an overstatement. He has looked like death compared to his former self in the past few televised events I saw him in. He has also switched from western to Chinese bhuddist and herbal medicine.&&I think I actually did hear about that but completely forgot it since I never saw the movie &&Mulan live action was supposed to have a white guy as a love interest ....&&I always thought it was weird how there’s “white people”, “black people” and then just “Asians”&&The best girl anyway.&&Square Enix owns the IP I think&&Usually Western films don't get it right when it comes to fight scenes. The fights in AC were just horrendous and amateur.&&easy there, nephew&&芝士漢堡！&&There were a surprising number of environmental kills and they were all very, very effective. I don't think they played up that element enough.&&I wonder how accurate it was to real London. Like maybe if you live in London it's easier to navigate&&Yeah I bet. Total shot in the dark here, you know who’s hot? Fuckin, Vera Farmiga. Throw her in there somewhere, you’ve got the makings of a good movie. Somebody get Scorsese on this &&If anything Borderlands could easily cash in on the hype of Fury Road while still being a lot different with it's wacky world.&&The Mummy did. The mummy returns was a CGI infested turd of a movie.&&I was gonna answer the same thing.  Both are better, IMO.  Indiana Jones was pretty good, but I liked The Mummy movies better.&&Temple of doom was weaker than the others though.&&You are correct. There is only the holy trinity. Really, there's only 1 ridiculously long IJ movie.&&I think he's talking about Temple of Doom. &&theres actually a fourth sequel in the works or maybe not.&&The temple of doom definitely fell off the rails (pun intended) when it comes to being too campy and silly, it also had the worst character in any of the 4 movies in Billy, who ruins what was before a pretty okay movie.&&The monkey/Shia rope swinging scene was a fever dream&&Boobs&&Usually books expand the universe, they don't retell the story of the games. So they can create their own narrative without the need to translate gameplay. But you still have to play the games to follow the story.

The Assassin's Creed books do the opposite, tell bit by the bit the same story of the game, and they are actually pretty boring. Not because the writer is bad, but it gets stale reading again and again how Ezio killed some guards.&&You're not wrong, but there's also a substantial difference in medium between novels and film. And while yes, you *can* adapt a novel into a decent screenplay, there are a lot that try and fail. If anything, I'd say that the successful ones seem to be the exception and not the rule. And ones adapted from videogames are even less so...

It doesn't have to be that way, but for whatever reasons, that always seems to be the case. I'd love to be proven wrong by a really awesome and compelling videogame film, but it's not something I hold my breath for.

(Also, on a side note, the Halo novels were fantastic. I'm still kinda bummed that Bungie pretty much retconned Fall of Reach. That would have been amazing to see.)&&Patrick Stewart

as Poop&&That scene was hilariously unbelievably but I forgave them for it because I loved it. Stupid movie, but don't get me wrong, but sometimes stupid movies can be entertaining.&&That's what happens when you ditch storytelling in favor of making sure you can make a game every year.&&Because they removed all ""content"" since the fans would constantly bitch and moan about the modern segments. They went through about 4-5 games where there was good content with Desmond, but every game the fans would complain about the forced modern segments. Now, they don't even add that much there anymore.

This entire comment chain spawned off of ""put the movie in the part of the game people skip over"", meaning even though there was shit going on, the guy/girl didn't care and just wanted to see historical figures running around killing each other.&&as an experience, it was tighter than some of the gta games. less filler, more fun. somewhere along the way, rockstar thought more was better with gta. gta 4 was boring. &&Yeah I watched about 20 minutes of it on a plane, gave up, then went back to it when I wanted to fall asleep.&&""Yellow"" has been the term, but there were several Pan-Asian movements in the 40's through 70's pushing back against European imperialism that created a texturally complex reidentification in response to The West. And several of those Pan-Asian movements involved people that The West would consider ""brown"" rather than ""yellow."" So Asian it often is.

Ultimately, there's very little genetic basis for a lot of these categories in the first place, so the development of political and ethnic identities with similar/shared historical origins and isolated cultural evolution from ""The West"" taken on by people as self-reference rather than relying on exogenous naming conditions may be more rational than one would first guess.

It's also worthwhile to contrast European and African diasporas and the bonkers history of scientific racism and political theory in shaping these identities, particularly in relation to each other. There's years of academic exploration just to start to get to the heart of it. So, yeah, it's not always intuitive but there's a reason for that.&&我要跳舞！&&Aquarium.&&Fuck you guys for ruining this for me. &&I just watched the Mummy again tonight and I still like it as much as I ever did. I haven't seen The Mummy Returns in a few years but I remember liking despite thinking even back then that the Scorpion King CGI character was garbage. I bet I still enjoy the pygmy mummies and the Anubis dudes. I'll try to remember to edit this after I watch it with my kids tomorrow.&&They're a lot of fun, but I think at least two of the three good Indiana Jones movies are better.&&Still pretty good though, I like that it's a bit different without losing the Indiana Jones feel&&Tru dat.

This movie will never be greenlit.&&The Scorpion King itself is one of the bettery campy fun movies out there though. &&I admit I haven’t seen it since it came out. Seen the original a few times and it still holds up as a fun adventure movie, but the sequel I remember just doubling down on the CGI and otherwise rehashing the stuff from the first one that worked. Just not as well.

Never even saw the third, but the end of the second with the pyramid Turning green I just remember looking so bad..&&indiana jones is way better. it actually feels like a serious movie where the mummy is pure fluff. indiana jones and the last crusade is what the da vinci code MOVIE wished it was. &&I think it lost a little of it. Indiana Jones is a globe hopping adventure. In Temple of Doom all the globe hopping takes place in the first 10 minutes.&&Username checks out...?&&My friend's pitch for that movie was 'The Rock pulls an arrow out of his back and then shoots it' so I was sold then and there. &&I shamelessly love that movie. &&new tomb raider looks like it mighr be good though&&",2018-02-04 00:18:52

Nice to see him and his group continue making films.  DMC Films also produced MacBeth, The Light Betweeen Oceans, and Assassin's Creed.

fuck&&He does not know karatay. &&I don't know if I could watch two hours of Kung Fury.&&This is amazing!! Also, Hollywood is weird. Why they are doing this, I have no idea. It’ll never rip the original. 

Also, Hackerman better be in it. &&YEEEEAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!&&this is fucking awesome&&Weird. I would've expected someone like Kyle Mooney or Andy Samberg, but not Fassbender. That being said, I loved the short so I'm not complaining yet.&&Yes!!!!!!!! King Fury is right up there with Napoleon Dynamite for me. So ridiculous it makes it funny. I think the Hitler fight at the end was the icing on the cake for me.  &&in other news, he’s also facing physical abuse allegations &&Lol why is everyone so angry and disappointed? What did I miss? I saw the movie on Netflix and thought it was funny. Maybe he just wants to be in a comedy. Can someone fill me in as to why everyone is bothered by this.&&Why can't they just make a full feature film of Michael Fassbender as Magneto hunting down killing Nazis? &&ITT: Everyone being experts on how long Kung Fury should be. GTFO.&&wat&&100% miscast &&Thought it said Kung Pow&&I love Kung Fury. I love Fassbender. I am so happy right now, I would've never thought that this was something I wanted to hear this bad.&&Kung Fury was already 5 minutes too long. &&Kung Fury started to fall apart after 30 minutes. Dragging a sequel out to feature length will ensure it won't be funny or entertaining.

If I want 80's nostalgia and aesthetics, I'd go watch season 2 of Danger 5. If I want nonsensical over the top action, I'd go watch the Crank movies. I see no desire to see them mashed together. It just feels like sensory overload and the filmmakers just trying too hard.

Ready Player One is already using nostalgia as a crutch and it looks like a cringefest. And it doesn't have the glaze of irony over it that Kung Fury does.&&""The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't the search for meaning; is to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you will be dead.""&&I've never heard of this school. Tell me more? &&Got Kung Fury mixed up with Hong Kong Phooey and was real confused with this whole article. Then realized I was a dumbass. 

Mr Peanutbutter should definitely play Hong Kong Phooey though. &&Seems like people just like to have fun sometimes.

MUST HAVE BEEN REAL TOUGH&&I'd do Kung Fury over Shawshank Redemption if I was an actor. Come on. &&I honestly don't know what is happening to his career at this point. I'm a bit sad as a fan tbh, I think he is an incredible actor and I was expecting different kind of roles from him. Fun is fine, money is fine, but just go grab that oscar, fassbender!&&Yeah he's been making some pretty atrocious film choices - is he deeply in debt to the mob or something?&&Michael Fassbender is such an interesting case. Dude is honestly a class A actor. Among the greatest male actors in history tbh. Some of his roles have honestly shook me really hard with how good his performance was (Hunger and Shame come to mind). 

But lately his been taking some absolutely trash roles. I don’t know if he’s to blame or his agent or whoever. But for love of god, someone give the man a good script. 

Edit: just wanted to add that I did forget about Frank (to be fair you don’t see his face a whole lot in that one lol) and his performance in Steve Jobs was good even if the film was lacking. 

But to clarify. I’m not insinuating he’s in the top 10 of 20. Just that he’s phenomenal. Just wanted to clear that up haha&&Did you not see Kung Fury? That shit was fantastic, how are you thinking it's a bad choice? Sure, it's not a deep introspective character study, but they don't come around often enough for an actor to fill that role. Personally I'm excited for him to do a movie like this. &&2019:

""Ok, Mr. Fassbender, here's my idea. You're a detective...""

""Right.""

""From the future.""

""Ok.""

""And your character is gay.""

I had no idea this was a thing until just now. That is really unfortunate if any of that is true.&&Why is everyone a fucking asshole God daaaaamn&&Fassbender not, not Fassbender!&&He is&&It's the first thing in the article dude...&&He is&&I also just think that Kung Fury worked because there wasn't that much invested in it. I can see this being the sort of project where the studio pours tons of money into an IP that's weird and niche, and then they get worried because it's weird and niche and they're afraid they just lost their tons of money, so they make a bunch of changes so the IP isn't weird and niche anymore, alienating the fanbase and negating the whole point of buying the IP in the first place.&&I listened to a Q and A from Jeremy Irons regarding his work on the D&D movie. Apparently he hated the script, the director, and the production of it. However (and to Paraphrase) ""I needed to put a new roof on my castle in Scotland and the check for the movie covered it exactly, so... D&D.""&&If Mitch Murder is scoring it it’s a definite watch. &&Have you seen Danger 5? Season 1 is basically Kung Fury but as a TV series (I'd be amazed if the guys who made Kung Fury didn't draw heavy inspiration from it). It didn't feel tired at any point so it's possible this could work, although they'd need the right writers on board to pull it off.&&I'm with you.

This announcement in particular just dampened my spirits. This feels like Sharknado 2, where the 'joke' and charm just falls apart when you apply real money and actors to the project. &&Whatever, if its McGruber or Hot Rod level wacky, I'm all in. Fassbender is the cherry on top.&&I’m sure this adaptation of a short, super-geeky concept to a two-hour high budget film created by people who don’t understand the subject matter will go extremely well...just like Pixels did. 🤪&&Might be a controversial opinion, but I thought the trailer for Kung Fury was miles better than the whole movie.

If they had less cringe slapstick and more of the first scene of the movie, it would have been fantastic.&&I feel like Kung Fury fell apart right around the 12 minute mark, after the hilarious time hacking scene. It just lost steam and kind of coasted to the end. &&If done right, it could be a Airplane!/Top Secret/Naked Gun revival, with Fassbender making a move to be the next Leslie Nielsen? Could be hilarious.&&I honestly don't know if I could take a cull hour and a half of it.  It was amazing, but after a point, the brain just has to shut down...&&The schtick was old after looking at the poster. It's been done to death a thousand times over, and there are better actual corny 80s movies to watch.&&Turbo Kid already did the concept of a tongue in cheek 80s throwback movie great since it actually had heart and characters that the audience cared about. Kung Fury was 30 minutes of a long joke pretty much. The concept has been done way better even Danger 5 did it.&&I feel like the main thing I didn't like about the original was the fact it was shot entirely on green screen.

Basically everyone I know that saw Kung Fury loved the hell out of it.&&I’m seeing this shit the day it releases, a Kung Fury feature film sounds like a dream come true.&&Reddit is pretty predictable.

It's essentially a hivemind of that annoying 15 year old iconoclast we all know and hate.

When Kung Fury was an obscure inside joke short-film it was great. Now it's going to be made with actual money and popular talent in a way that will make it accessible to a wider audience, so it's time for Reddit to turn around and hate it. 

I'm still waiting to watch the same turn whenever Binging with Babish inevitably gets turned into an actual TV cooking show or Tom Scott makes a documentary or something. &&The accuracy of this comment is astounding. &&Sorta related, I found out recently that Michael Fassbender was in 300. It was like his first big film role.

For an example, look to ""Army of Darkness."" Coming from Evil Dead 2, they had a major release and a bigger budget. Instead of going over the top with big budget effects and casting, they took the money and made a movie packed to the seams with the sort of schlocky weirdness that made the originals work.

I definitely question whether or not the premise of Kung Fury has the legs to be a feature, but I wouldn't rule it out. 
&&Wasn't Pixels originally a short movie on YouTube before some studio picked it up and then it became an Adam Sandler movie and everyone was like ""Who asked for this?""?&&Gonna bookmark this for when Kung Fury inevitably ends up as you say so I can get that sweet BestOf karma.&&I feel you just explained what happens to 99% of the movies made in Hollywood today.&&Or the studio sells it to Netflix, who posts it directly after a football game. &&[deleted]&&Danger 5 was made by the same people who made Italian Spiderman, which was a great, self-contained thing.

>your head

Cmon. You seriously expected a movie about a Timetravelling Kung Fu Cop who fights Adolf Hitler to be a Serious Film Endeavor? It was made by one dude via Gofundme. What did you expect? &&to each their own. i genuinely enjoyed the original and excited for this. &&Reddit loved it too. But now we've reached the anti-circlejerk circlejerk part of Reddit's obsession with something. It's the point where Reddit's cynical nature implodes on itself.&&I enjoyed it because of the poor quality and the fact that it was only 30 min. Making it a hollywood movie seems like it missed the point&&To me, Kung Fury is like candy. It's nice in small doses, but if I ate a whole bucket of it, I'd just be sick. So I can understand the somewhat muted reaction to a feature-length version - it hasn't proved that it can actually provide anything substantial. &&Everyone is thinking he's tanking his career for doing this fun role for a smaller production. But I'm imagining Fassbender doing for Kung Fury, what Tom Cruise did for Tropic Thunder.

Edit: rephrased last sentence.&&> When Kung Fury was an obscure inside joke short-film it was great.

No it wasn't&&He was easily the best part of the film. He was the only death that resonated with me in the movie&&Fuck a movie, how about a sequel.&&I thought it was too short. It sets up for this grand adventure, only for two scenes to end the movie (getting lost in Viking time, and defeating Hitler).

I think it still executed the idea perfectly. 80s parody of a buddy cop action movie with the latest visual effects and humor.&&No. Jorma Taccone or bust for Kung Fuhrer.&&Yeah, David Sandberg is still in the movie, I assume as Kung Fury. Not sure who Fassbender will be.&&The 30min version was structured and paced for a 30min run time. If they expand to something like 90 minutes, it will be structured accordingly. &&But 10 minutes (what many people prefered) would be way too short. It would leave you hanging with the desire for more

About 30 minutes was perfect&&Of course theres no way they'd write the script to properly use the expanded time at all. They'll totally do exactly what the 30m one did and make literally no use of the longer medium what-so-ever.&&Why does everyone assume the feature will be just like the short? It's like saying ""aw, The Raid 2? We don't need another OTT action movie set in a tower block. One was good enough"" before even knowing the premise. Or not giving Don't Hug Me I'm Scared Ep. 2 a chance cos you ""already know the gag"". 

I'm really looking forward to seeing what else they can come up with and will judge it once I've seen it. Sure it might not work but, with a casting announcement like that, I'm beginning to think they might have a proper crew and production on this (rather than just a bunch of dudes who do VFX and their mates)...

I guess we all speculate in our own ways but I am optimistic about this one.&&https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Ryan+Reynolds%27+Pikachu&oq=Ryan+Reynolds%27+Pikachu&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&&And *Macbeth*; I absolutely loved his performance (and everything else) in that film.&&Well he better stop because I paid for 0.00000000000001% of his paycheck when I saw Alien Covenant so I have a say in what he chooses to act in.&&Yeah I like that he isn't up his own arse, like his other pretentious counterparts.

Say that once he has a track record of it 5 or 7 years down the line.&&Hahaha. This is what the report says ""David Hasselhoff, who sang the theme to the original '80s homage cult short, will also appear in the action-comedy""&&Army of Darkness made $11.5 million (domestic) on an $11 million budget.&&Your example is from 25 years ago. The studio system and subsequently how big-budget movies are made is extremely different from then. Studios are unlikely to take a risk on anything, especially something that is niche and does not have a lot of source material. With *Army of Darkness*, there was already two successful films, which were made on shoestring budgets. *Kung Fury*, on the other hand, only has that 30 minute video with very little story and was barely worthwhile for those 30 minutes. It's just a series of obnoxious homages of 80s homages* strung together with little substance and no character.  

I'm not trying to be A nay-saying sourpuss or whatever. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly alright for it to exist and they can make whatever movie they want, but on a purely business level, this sounds like the dumbest and most poorly-thought idea for a full-length movie ever. 

*It's not even a homage of 80s movies anymore. This 80s shit has gone so far up itself that the newer stuff is just referencing the homages rather than the original source material. &&Actually I think it was a Futurama episode first. &&This is similar to how Ian Ziering got involved with Sharknado. He saw the script and thought it was terrible but his wife told him they had a baby and needed money.&&Unfortunately for him though, My Cocaine missed out on receiving his first Oscar win in person because he was filming that shitty movie.&&[deleted]&&I found Sharknado 1 to be enjoyable. It was bad in subtle and clever ways once you got past the premise, and despite trying to be bad on purpose, it was so ridiculous that it kind of worked. 

My favorite running gag in the movie was the incredibly confusing rising/falling water-depth levels. 

For example, showing the characters next to a deep dark puddle, then cutting away to stock, sunny, deep-ocean shark footage as if the shark is a nearby threat. Then the character go to a mansion on a hill, and the water catches up such that it floods their living room and starts to come up the stairs. The characters then jump out the window, get in a car, and drive (downhill) back into town.

For Sharknado 1 and Kung Fury - I think the reason they work (despite their purposeful corniness) is because they're still small budget movies with a passionate crew and director...

It's just that they have movie-making talent and they've apparently seen a movie in their life before. The same can't be said for Johnny Wiseau, James Nguyen, or Neil Breen - who've made movies that are good-bad in a different, less competent way.&&Val Kilmer, man. &&What other movie can you say where the hero fucks his dead wife's ghost? &&Michael fassbender starred in the first one?&&Soundtrack was top notch, it had the perfect blend of comedy and gore where it wasn’t disturbing when people got mutilated&&You should watch ""A boy and his dog"" if you want something fallout-esque. &&Yeah I enjoyed the 60s parody a bit more but the 80s one had a lot of high moments, mainly the extremes that they took each character.&&You take that back. Agent Hitler and Mckenzie are the best things to happen to that show.&&And now I need to go find out of there is any news of a Danger 5 season 3.&&I couldn’t do the second season at all. Stopped an episode in. It’s a shame because the first season is one of the funniest things that i’ve ever watched, it’s too bad they didn’t stick to it&&Jesus fuck, this thread...

Kung Fury was a kickstarter, by a guy and his friends. They started in his garage.&&It was done on a shoestring budget and those old school practical effects are far more expensive and take a long time to make. Having a decent budget means we may actually get proper effects. &&That's why I loathe Robert Rodriguez' ""grindhouse"" films like Planet Terror and Machete. Shit's jam-packed with lame fucking CGI. Why not use shitty practical effects instead? Literally no one likes digital blood or tacky green screen bullshit. Just lazy. &&That's because one dude made it via crowdfund. What do you expect? He's not exactly a AAA Hollywood studio. He did what he could with the resources he had. 

The Hoff ain't cheap. &&The black dynamite zequel cant come soon enuff but at least it should be this year&&Problem is that it's generally really expensive *not* to use CGI.  I take it more as a homage than a totally authentic parody.&&I didn't say anything about the story. I don't want it to be serious. It absolutely should be a stupid movie. But I don't like the green screen style because it doesn't feel like an 80's movie anymore. I'm all on board with the idea, but the execution just did not line up with what I felt it could have been.&&Same here. I think it's fine if people aren't interested in a feature-length film of this, but I will say it's mighty odd that so much circlejerking was happening when this movie came out and the fanfare for it was off the charts on reddit. 

Now it seems like everyone has had a change of attitude. And by that, I mean all of the top comments are negative towards it.&&I mean have you read the top comments?  They are basically saying yeah it was good, but already overstayed its welcome at 30 minutes.  More isn't exactly better in this case.&&A) Just because a movie is made in Hollywood does *not* mean it’s big budget. And B) Even if it does have a big budget, it doesn’t mean the style needs to change.&&Nah, let's get Forest Whitaker for the role.&&this is seemingly a very hard concept to understand for some people.&&EXACTLY!  It baffles me how many people are so obtuse about this.  Everyone's acting like this is the first time that a short film has ever been extended into a feature length movie.  Ever hear of Sling Blade, District 9, or Sin City?  All short films or concepts that were extended into feature length films.&&I thought the 30 minutes version was too much too.&&What the fuck&&He was also in Band of Brothers. &&Yeah it's almost like he's hardly made any really shitty decisions in his career and we should all expect this movie is going to be fine, I bet it's gonna be hilarious (and not as overhyped as that super shitty ghostbusters remake for instance)&&Like it's this double-edged knife.  I _want_ him to do well and be able to do niche projects like this, but I also really adore watching the more high-brow stuff he's done in the past.

I also would like him not to have another movie like The Snowman and end up turning himself into someone who's seen as a bad investment.&&Oh, then they forgot *Inglourious Basterds*&&Do they just stop looking at all of his prestigious roles in the past because he chose to do something fun/different?&&He is dog.&&That's remarkably astute, do you perhaps pursue a career in law enforcement by any chance?
&&It's from BoJack Horseman.&&Don't act like you don't know &&This song actually has alternate lyrics to the original. This one aired s4e1(I think) in an episode with no Bojack. The normal lyrics are about him&&I'm sure you know this but for those not in the know: These lyrics are only for that one episode, the end credits usually play the same song but with lyrics about Bojack himself&&No, Mr. Peanutbutter is named so because dogs like peanut butter and he is a dog.&&To add on to your point t it's not because he's desperate but because he's carefree and everything just works out for him.  &&Wow, they're gonna make beautiful little tomb-raiding assassin mutant robo-babies together.&&So 2017 *was* his year after all.&&She looks simultaneously 14 and 40&&Assassin's Creed / Tomb Raider crossover confirmed?&&> Alicia Vikander.

edit: it’s being produced by J.J. Abrams, here’s what’s being included in the series:

>The teaser trailer mentions titles of and characters from a number of Stephen King novels, including: It, Dolores Claiborne, Needful Things, Salem's Lot, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Dreamcatcher, Night Shift, The Green Mile, Misery, Hearts in Atlantis, The Shining, The Mangler, Four Past Midnight, Different Seasons, Nightmares & Dreamscapes, The Dark Half, and The Night Flier.&&T-Bag can be the psychotic guard in the zap chamber. &&Shawshank Redemption with Adam Sandler playing all roles.

Edit: Typo.&&It'll be remade with an all female cast. Can't go wrong.&&> He seems to be a huge science fiction and gaming fan.

Slow West was so good too.&&I'm throwing this out there I loved Kung fury and the addition of Michael ass blaster has me all for it&&I recommend it out of the blue all the time!  I don't get why it's so unpopular, the second time I watched it in theaters I was the only one in my auditorium.&&I recommend it all the time but I also recognize that I have a fanboyish affinity for Aaron Sorkin’s writing style. &&\#Fetoo

the bar for that is the ""Emoji"" movie (of course, the ""Tetris"" movie that afaik is still in development might beat that one out. at least emojis are literally expressions of emotions. but what kind of big studio movie can you even do with freaking ""Tetris""?).
&&> was barely worthwhile for those 30 minutes

I have to SERIOUSLY disagree with you on this point but I do agree it wont carry to feature length with any real sucess execpt maybe as one of those 5 year later cult classics.&&Tell me exactly how Triceracop, Thor, Barbarianna, and KUNG FUHRER are homages to homages? The movie isn't just about homages. It also managed to pack in tons of 80s weirdness in its own unique way. That's what made it so much fun. It WASN'T just a tired rehash.&&I AM LRR OF THE PLANET NINTENDU SIXTY-FOUR!&&The difference being I don't think anybody was asking why Ian Ziering was in sharknado.&&Whaaa? I thought Season 2 was just as good, if not better than season 1. “Johnny Hitler” in an 80’s high school had me in stitches.&&You probably didn't recognize him because of his new red bandana.&&The director said the new movie will be a different story with completely new characters but still set in the same universe and continuity. &&Just in case anyone hasn't seen this, the directors also did an origin video for Apple: https://youtu.be/G8kFIbmmuEk&&""The music! It's not blocking out the communism!""&&The kaiju battle with hitler was amazing&&Sadly enough Danger 5 won't get a season 3. Think they even auctioned off most of the props.&&I follow those guys on twitter. It’s long gone.&&It gets better, but its REALLY different. They nailed the vibe there were going for (send up of 80's/90's action).

I get that not everyone enjoyed the change, but I liked it.&&At least watch the second episode of the second season. It's called Johnny Hitler and it might be the best episode of the entire series, regardless of season.&&Machete also just sucked in general. Amazing trailer, but they added too much shit in that subsequently watered it down.&&Username checks out.&&I'm guessing because more people are familiar with Fassbender than Kung Fury, even on Reddit.

That being said, I do share the concerns that Kung Fury might not work as a full length film.  Still seeing it tho&&Yeah when it came out anyone saying they didn't like it got down voted to hell, I know cause I was one of them. This is odd.&&I mean they already said they wish they had a chance to make it longer, the original plan was to have Kung Fury fight Hitler all throughout different points in time, but the budget didn't allow it. I would love to see that.

I (and I am sure many others) got to the end of Kung Fury and wished it was longer.&&I couldn't disagree more. Everyone be watched it with was begging for more. It's absolutely hysterical. The level of the visual gags is pretty much unmatched as far as I'm concerned. I could absolutely watch a feature length version of that. &&That's precisely what I'm surprised by and disagree with. I loved every second of Kung Fury and I'd love to see more. &&Hell it seems most people forgot it was originally written as a feature length film but 30min was all they could afford.&&I liked him in Prometheus too.&&I didn't see Assassins Creed, but a lot of people say that was his first terrible decision. &&Just as we are all Secretariat&&So does he bang like a human or a dog?&&I doubt it.

I have to go back and find the others. &&That makes so much more since. I still don’t know the words then. 😞🎉&&Additionally, Bojack's name is also a reference/play on words.

His last name is ""Horseman"", which is a combination of horse and man. His character in the show is also a combination of a horse and a man.

It's crazy how much attention to detail they have with these little easter eggs.&&My dog doesn't like peanut butter. Weirdo.&&It's because you just occupy yourself with meaningless task after task and then eventually you die, to roughly paraphrase Mr. Peanutbutter.&&[Michael Vick made me a strange offer...](https://youtu.be/4sRr6o8YdZY?t=21)&&So Nicolas cage? &&Does this make him a womb raider?&&God just thinking of them creating those murderous babies makes me so.... red....&&Don't forget about massive dongs&&r/13or30&&She is 29 and he is 40&&Nice&&but Maytag honors major appliance warranties for only ten years though.&&Yeah but I hear he is like 12, ya know what I'm saying?&&Aliens / Ex Machina crossover would be more interesting.&&deleted&&How do we know about this? &&At least Back to the Future is safe until Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale are dead.

And yea Slow West kicks ass.&&>addition of Michael ass blaster has me all for it.

Some people think he is a shitty actor.  But in the end, I like how cheeky he is.
&&Yeah, I thought it was a really engaging. 

Danny Boyle's movies are always fun to watch, I love Aaron Sorkin monologues, and the performances were brilliant. Totally overlooked imo.&&Jake Gyllenhaal also happens to be in the same boat as Fassbender when it comes to shitty Ubisoft video game adaptations (prince of persia + assassin's creed), lol&&Haha awesome&&I personally think Tom Hardy belongs in that top tier&&Cuz we need some cuz we need some ACTION!&&Fun fact, None of the events of Army of Darkness have ever been mentioned in the show because they don't own the rights.&&You see this, you primitive screwheads?? This is my ***BOOMSTICK!!!***&&The people funding it probably cared&&Except as an investor, you could have gotten a better return from a savings account back then.&&The point is it's a poor example to point to for the potential financial success of a Kung Fury movie. &&He's the best damn partner anyone's ever had. &&Obviously I might have used a little hyperbole, but at the same time, as far as money is concerned, *The Emoji Movie* made quadruple its budget back while I cannot imagine a full-length *Kung Fury* movie breaking even short of a miracle from God. &&It was more like, ""hey, that's the guy from 90210.

Good for him!"" &&[deleted]&&Can confirm, am currently the proud owner of the Coke Snorting Anaconda puppet used in season 2&&That makes me sad.&&Yeah, the fake trailer was pretty awesome. 


It's a shame Rodriguez has gotten so lazy. He used to be so fucking inventive and cool, but now he's basically the George Lucas of action films. &&does it? afaik cgi blood is *less* expensive (and of course less effort) than using ""film blood"".
&&Yeah... Literally every movie rests on ""if they do it well."" Most movies can be reduced to a single sentence or two to sum them up, its all in the execution&&He was fantastic in Covenant too. &&My theory is he did Assassins Creed as a favor to someone involved with Macbeth. Fassbender stars in both, Marion Cotillard is in both, same director, same director of photography....&&As soon as I wrote that comment, the next one I saw was hating on Assassin's Creed and I just went ""shit, haven't seen that."" but yeah, I hear it sucked and was his first terrible decision.

really?

where has my life gone?&&I don’t know why people didn’t like this movie. I’m gonna go watch it

Edit- it’s not as good as I remember it being but it’s definitely entertaining

2nd edit- never mind I fuckin love this movie&&This made me happy, as cheesy as it was.&&The marketing around this film was first class. I was lucky enough to get a sneak preview of it.  When we arrived at the theatre, they asked everyone to form two groups:  Freddy fans vs. Jason fans. Then they separated the two groups inside, with each group having their own half of the seats.  The Freddy fans were given cardboard finger knives and the Jason fans cardboard hockey masks. Everyone was really into it, teasing and shouting at the opposing side. They did some trivia for prizes and did some Q&amp;A about both films' history.  Then we got to watch the movie. It was probably the best experience I’ve had watching a movie in a theatre.  I might still have my Jason mask somewhere. &&TIL 15 years ago looked like 1985.&&Now they need one for the new Kong Vs Godzilla movie with holographic projections &&FREDDY V-V-V-VS-S-S- FREDDY VS JASON&&Sound track was awesome&&The scene were kruger sees that Destiny's Child chick and goes something like ""oo dark meat"" makes me lol&&Never saw this - who ended up winning? &&Sort of messes with me that this came out 15 years ago.

This movie was pretty fuckin cool to child me.&&""Good people on both sides folks, believe me.""&&I fuckin love this movie.  This movie was the first time I'd ever attempted a multiple friend hang out and everyone actually showed up!

I also remember that I found this one website that had so many juicy movie tidbits about all movies - I think it was f13forum or something.  Those nerds knew their shit.  I remember hearing about so many movies coming out before they were announced cuz of that forum&&""Freddy, do you think you stand a chance in this fight?""

But as a huge boxing and mma fan, this promo is excellent&&I actually really like how this movie blended the two mythologies and backstory of both series.

The video records are all lost though, because the building exploded shortly after the continental breakfast provided for the teams' staffs.

We need more of this stuff to happen again. Maybe *face off* Nic Cage and the Declaration Of Independence. &&That video made me miss Quiznos&&Movie had an immitation Jason Mewes.&&Freddy kreuger will always be nightmare fuel

&&I’m old enough, and enough of a hardcore VHS Boom-era horror fan, to remember the anticipation of a Freddy/Jason movie. This shit was hyped for over 10 years, back when we would scour Fangoria for leaks and tidbits. &&I remember when this movie came out and I was like 5 or 6... my father thought it was a great idea to take me to go see a movie with two horror/slasher characters... I asked him before hand if the movie was scary and he said it was a comedy. 
 
I cried during the first scene, I think it was like Freddy's origin or something; I know for sure there was fire in it, and then I put my hands over my ears and closed my eyes as tight as I could for the rest of the movie. When the movie was over my arms and face were so tight I felt like I was turning into a tree...&&The production of this movie rented my grandmas house for a couple scenes. 

Still haven’t seen it. &&I saw that movie in the theater and I really liked it. &&Wtf that was 15 years ago now. Im sad now fuck. &&This is hilarious! 

I remember when this movie came out as it was around the time when the major blackout happened. I was up in a cottage that wasn't affected by the outage and remembered reading a comparison on Freddy and Jason and a (bad) review on the movie in the newspaper. 

Even if the critics didn't like it, I still loved it. It finally put two of the biggest slashers together in a winner take all brawl, and it was fun as hell watching it all unfold! It also helped play a role in getting me interested in the horror genre, particularly old slashers, so it'll always be held with good regard by me. 

I can't believe that it'll be 15 years old, this August!  &&That cop trying not to laugh &&Has it really been 15 years?! Omg I'm old.&&16 years ago I auditioned for the part of Jason.

[Coffee Shop Prank](https://youtu.be/VlOxlSOr3_M) &&The problem with Freddy Vs Jason was that the ending was wrong. The original ending was waaaay better.

It was supposed to end with both icons killing each other in a final devastating blow, and both of them going to hell. When they show up in hell, they start to fight again, but fucking Pinhead shows up and goes ‘any room for a third, boys?’

Leading into the sequel Freddy vs Jason vs Pinhead&&Not many people know, BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET MUTHA FUCKIN ASH (from Evil Dead) TO BE IN THE SEQUAL &&Who won?&&I wish I took those 1/40 odds on neither of them dying&&TIL I weigh the same as Freddy Krueger &&stay in the ring vorheeeeeeeees

That was kind of cute. Jason looking around speechlessly was great.&&Freddy Kreuger and Luke Skywalker were roommates.&&It's been 15 years already? Damn I feel old.&&Christ on a cracker. That came out 15 years ago? I remember seeing it in the theater. &&Thanks for making me feel old lol 
15 years ago???? 

Ugh &&True but it showcases Freddy as an actual pure badass that we hadn’t seen before. When he’s dragged out in to the real world he’s pretty much kicking Jason’s ass.

My opinion is that he won their battle.&&I remember when this movie came out someone did a spoof called Freddy vs. Ghostbusters&&There's actually a whole book out on the dozens of iterations and attempts this film went through before finally being made.  &&Wow that was 15 years ago? I'm getting old&&First movie I ever got to see tits in &&All I can think of is Scary Terry now, you can run but you can't hide bitch! &&I met Robert Englund once at a con whilst wearing a Freddy Krueger sweater. As I approached him, he said (in character) “nice sweater, bitch.” 

Definitely one of my fondest memories&&Woah. TIL.&&Watching that just reinforces that Robert Englund is the only person who can play Freddy&&Well it helps that Jason just doesn't talk&&Freddy SHOOTS HARD on Jason.&&Fucking Roman Reigns all over again. Gotta push the pretty boy. &&poor booking for sure &&If you can get over as the heel, you're worth a million dollars.&&Not to mention that he's a child molester...&&Freddy, the kid diddlin racist from your nightmares, HEROOOOOOOII!!&&[I'm convinced Frank Miller is slowly becoming Freddy](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hChCuPfvMFY/maxresdefault.jpg)&&Robert England is an amazing actor though. &&I'm just glad the top reply in this thread is lamenting Kane Hodder not being in that movie.  I totally agree.  It's odd to think a character with literally has no lines could show any sort of range, but I always thought Kane really added something to that role.
&&I have so many fond memories of smoking a ton of weed in high school and watching this. My friends and I weren’t even horror fans and we loved it. &&Liking Ken Kirzinger as Jason is my unpopular opinion.&&Robert is also a really cool guy, but when he switches on Freddy for you, even out of makeup, it's frightening as hell.&&In hindsight I think even a lot of fans appreciate it now. It's just a fun film, pitting two iconic horror legends against each other. I enjoy it.&&This movie came out at the height of my high school horror movie phase. I was so unbelievably stoked to be in a theater watching Freddy and Jason in the same movie, I didn't even really care if it was good or not.&&Dark meat&&Whenever I’m channel surfing and see this playing I will watch it 100% of the time. It’s a blast.&&I enjoyed it for what it was; a silly take on classic horror.&&Man the Torpedoes!&&I liked it a lot, it was cheesy but it didn’t claim to be anything else, so it was a good time. &&“Hey man, wanna take a J break?”&&I'm not a big horror fan but I loved it. Just cheesy fun. &&I loved it too! I even loved the poor man's Jason Mewes lol &&It's was easily my favorite out of the Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday The 13th movies. &&I enjoyed it too &&I think it’s because it wasn’t what everyone was expecting. It was more of a Freddy movie featuring Jason plot wise much like Alien V. Predator was a predator movie featuring xenonorphs


Edit: I’m not personally complaining but just like falsely/oddly advertised yet good movies that get bad CinemaScores people expected something different than what they got &&I remember when I was younger and visiting a mall in China and like all malls they have an electronic store with TV's set up and the movie was playing and I still remember the exact scene where that woman disrobes and shows her breasts. No American mall would be allowed to play a Rated R film on their screens &&if they had an actual actor instead of one of the members of destinys child it would of been a better film. She was the worst &&It's the same amount of time from Friday the 13th Part 7 to Freddy vs Jason (1988 to 2003)

Likewise with Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master to Freddy vs Jason (1988 to 2003)

15 years then seemed like such a bigger gap. &&[deleted]&&I swear to god, time sped up for me when I hit about 23 or 24.

I was aware of that phenomenon -- that time subjectively speeds up as you grow older -- but I've been really surprised at how pronounced it's been, now that I've been experiencing it firsthand.

It's also crazy seeing how fast teens grow up, considering how subjectively long the period from age 14 to age 18 feels when you're that age.

It's like my brother, who's now 17, just like, went from being a kid to basically a young adult almost overnight. Extra weird considering I literally changed his diapers, lol.&&Couple of months ago a local drunk walks up and rings the buzzer. We let him in, try to assess him but it seems like he just wants to talk. He takes us through his childhood, several relationships, schoolyard fights and his enlistment in the army. He laments how they trained him to kill but never taught him how to live. Anyway after some of this and some of that we suggest he go and grab a bite at the pull-up burger hut across the street. He hears us but doesn’t budge. I brew some coffee and we offer several more times, finalllly after around 2 and a half hours and multiple attempts he eases up from the chair and leans over to the doorway, looks up the street to see the lights on and breakfast underway. I guess he didn’t believe us because he suddenly yells out “They really are open?! WHERE DID THA NIGHT GO?!” 

It’s a common phrase now after long nights with several calls ‘WHERE DID THA NIGHT GO?!”

“ where has my life gone “ brought this story to mind.&&I liked it. &&It was my first rated R movie. I remember because I *really* wanted to see it, but I was 13 at the time and my parents kept saying no. So I wrote a page and a half essay explaining why I was mature enough to see it. And they let me! And if I remember correctly besides a few boobies and F bombs it wasn't bad. 

And then they let my younger brother watch rated R movies after that no problems. Like wtf? &&I love the roller coaster of emotions you got to go on&&Right? That was dumb, cheesy, even a little cringey, but damn me if I don't have a big dumb smile in my face right now.&&On the flip side, the only preview I've ever seen was Catwoman. I'm still in therapy.&&This is how movies should always be&&My thoughts exactly &&In the red corner, weighing in at one hundred and sixty four thousand tons, the irradiated dinosaur hailing from parts unknown, the King of All Monsters...GOOOJIIIRAAAAAA!

And in the blue corner, from Skull Island, weighing in at one hundred and twenty one thousand tons, the Eighth Wonder of the World, KING KONG!

(added 100 thousand tons as an estimate to how big they'll make him for the movie).&&There it is&&VERSUS JAY VERSUS JAY VERSUS JAY JAY JAY JAJAJAJAJAY JAY JAY JAY JAY JAY JAY JASON&&Good to hear that Konky got some work after Pee-Wes’s playhouse went off the air. &&Came here to make sure this was mentioned. Great metal compilation.&&Seriously. Also just remembered how much I loved From Autumn to Ashes back then....brb, going to piss off all my neighbors....&&Jesus it's like a time capsule into early 2000s angsty nu metal. Throw some Korn in there and you've got a kid going through pubertys sound track for when their dad yells at them.&&Came here to say this. Still listen to it in my car from time to time&&""How sweet, dark meat"" and the best thing was  how he was going to go in for the kill but stopped short because Jason was behind her. He was sort of torn between being scared of Jason and amused by her impending grisly demise. Love Robert Englund. &&Mostly Jason, but basically neither. 

The Elm Street kids sort of defeat them both by blowing them into Crystal Lake, then Jason walks out of the lake in the last shot holding Freddy's severed head, but then Freddy winks at the camera.&&It's kinda ambiguous. It depends which franchise you are a fan of, you can make the argument for both.

Still has a great final battle though.&&The folks from elm street.

Basically, both of em never dies. Jason is immortal and Freddy trapped Jason in a perpetual nightmare.&&neither can die, so no one wins. Jason always regenerates and freddy lives in dreams&&Jason cuts off Freddy's head and then walks off carrying it, but Freddy winks.&&I remember I was out skateboarding on a summer day under the shade of a big tree on a newly paved road, hanging out with my friend, and we were talking about whether or not we were going to see it.  Next day, same setup, except he's telling me about how awesome it was.

We were 15 then.

I'm 30 now and a little sad.&&Big ole tittayyyz&&We need a good remake/sequel to either of these franchise before thinking about a connected universe.&&....VS Michael&&Closest thing I got is the Freddy vs Jason maze at Universal Studios. Coolest thing though, they have multiple endings that play on a screen towards the end and it's randomized so who wins and how is different on the first few walkthroughs.&&Seconded, the ending SCREAMS sequel &&I wouldn't mind if they made a battle royale with more horror icons. Throw Michael Meyers in the mix while we're at it! &&There is a Freddy vs Jason vs Ash comic. It isn't too bad.

But I agree, we need a film. &&With the soundtrack by jadakiss and fabulous, they released a Freddy vs Jason themed album recently.&&There was a sequel planned starring Ash from Evil Dead that got turned into a comic miniseries.&&Check out Freddy vs Jason vs Ash. It's a graphic novel made from the suspected script for a Freddy vs Jason sequel that was rumored to been scheduled but was cancelled when Bruce Campbell wouldn't sign on (which seems odd cause he seems like the type to be down)

As a huge fan of all the series involved I really enjoyed it. They made a Freddy vs Jason vs Ash 2 which I absolutely loved even more than the original comic.&&That we do. I honestly wouldn't mind more horror/slasher movie mash-ups. Maybe Chucky in puppet master? Just spit balling. &&Movies have a self life these days&&Where they team up and do good deeds and community services.&&This and The Ring were my first two horror movies, I was like 10 when I saw them (not in theaters) . I don't know how I was allowed to.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.586405585)&&Wait, seriously?&&Well it's not really that scary but definitely not suitable for a 6 year old lmao. I wonder what would happen to show a little kid The Conjuring 2. Crazy ghost nun was creepy.&&Dude watch that shit! You even have ties to it.&&I was that someone. &&Haha that all sounds so super sketchy &&If I remember correctly, the movie ended with Jason cutting off Freddy’s head and walking away with it, but then you see Freddy wink to show he’s not really dead. 

Fade to black.&&> Remember Mcgregor said he had to fight Diaz who was three times the size of him.

Aaah the 450 pound Nate Diaz of Conor's nightmares. The truest horror villain.&&Dont let it be a secret. It was a fun ass film!&&It was also interesting because in the movie Jason was the face. Freddy resurrected Jason to control him so he would get kills and the kids' plan focused on getting Freddy killed by Jason.&&Actions speak louder than words. 

— Jason&&Should have gave him a voice box like old school Kane&&It's the classic silent monster heel vs snarky babyface.

It draws.&&[Who the fuck is that guy?](https://youtu.be/JMw1GmJzF6A) &&Just hopefully Masked Jason doesn't go corporate. &&You likes are 666.

/r/squaredcircle: MELTZER CLAIMS FREDDY HAS MEGA HEAT FROM VINCE EXPECT HIM IN DRAGON GATE BY JUNE &&Freddy says ""Jason and The Honkey Tonk Man are the two biggest assholes in the business today.""&&Believe it or not, he's never actually established as one in the original films - just a child murderer.  He never even gets called one by other characters.  Evidently that was something they discussed while making the original film and deliberately avoided.  

Robert Englund talks about it here:

http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3363090/robert-englund-on-the-nightmare-remake-child-killer-thats-nasty-enough/

In the remake though, he's actually a molester.&&He absolutely is. Iconic comes to mind.&&Isn't it Englund &&Robert Englund.&&There was a great interview with Kane about this. How he interpreted the characters body language since Jason was completely silent. The one thing that stood out to me and made me remember all the scenes was when he said he would always turn his body first then turn his head in the direction he would need to face. &&I actually wrote a paper on Kane’s performance as Jason much to the lament of my professor. Kane’s performance makes All the films better for it. Otherwise, Jason ends up being some weird mongoloid hillbilly. Kane really put menace into that role. There was a sense of urgency in his movements and a dark intelligence behind his stalking. Kane is really where Jason wasn’t a Myers clone anymore. &&Tell that to /u/petermayhew&&Ken did really good in the role to not have Kane. No reason not to like him at all. He made a pretty decent Jason.&&Although it *really* did give Freddy the short end of the stick.

He only kills two people (**edit:** in lame and uncreative ways) in that movie compared to Jason who kills, like, 30.

**Edit^^2 :** (Man, a lot of clarification) Yes, the final fight between them was pretty sweet.&&So much blood. That final battle was the shit.&&They were planning for Freddy and Jason to continue their fight in hell only to be stopped by Pinhead.&&Literally fell asleep to it last night, i love that movie! To me it's like a time capsule, i was about 16 when it came out and even then I knew it was kinda cheesy but loved it anyway. The soundtrack is still a guilty pleasure for me and I even love the way it was shot, mostly nightime and raining. Like you said its just a fun ""turn your brain off"" movie.Enjoy it for what it is!&&I hated Jason's design in that, and annoyingly enough, now everyone recognized that design as his normal look.

His stupid open jacket and grey leathery skin really didn't do it for me. He had no color compared to the original. &&Similarly, I hated Alien vs Predator when it came out, but have since come to like it. Just had to separate it in my mind from both franchises. The sequel though..

edit: I should have mentioned there is an unrated cut that is superior to the theatrical version, so that has a lot to do with why it's more enjoyable now..&&The problem was the marketing. We wanted to actually see them fight each other and kill a bunch of people in the crossfire, but we barely got any action at all&&Oh yeah, fans loved it then also. But we're a small minority of movie-goers. It was exactly what we asked for since the early 90s: Freddy and Jason ripping wadhother a new one in a deathmatch. And that's exactly what the last 20 minutes of the movie gave us. 

Every fantasy was fulfilled. Freddy's getting stabbed with his own glove. Jason's eyes being clawed out. Limbs torn off. Massive fire bombs. And Jason walking off victorious because, really, who thought Freddy could win any real 1v1 against that tank of a monster?&&The end fight was cool as shit, but the characters were abunch of douche bags and fake breasted bimbos, really vapid and uninteresting, except for the blonde dude in the mental institution I really couldn't stand any of them&&Yeah, I think the main reason it was so hated was because people expected a genuine horror movie.  When it turned out to be a comedic thriller slightly poking fun at the whole genre, people didn't like it.  Just an opinion though.&&Same here. It's a guilty pleasure of mine. &&We’re fine with you murdering children. But RACISM? &&That's a bad way to describe AVP, it's Aliens with a predator as the protagonist &&In a similar, but unrelated comparison - I just realized it's been the same amount of time between GTA Vice City's release in 2002 and today as it was between the time GTA Vice City took place (1986) and when it came out... 16 years.

Trends in the early 2000s don't seem nearly as spoofable today as the 80s trends did in the early 2000s...&&Friday the 13th Part 7 is the worst one. It’s even worst than Jason X. &&I still believe Jason X or whatever it was was a fun movie. &&Isn't counting the gaps like this cheating? There were movies released after Friday the 13th 7 and Elm Street 4, not good ones but they still were there, before F v J.  

Since Vs there haven't been any (have there? I'm not including the reboots) so that's a much bigger gap.  

Although the point is fair, being 15 years older when you're younger seems like an impossible length of time to wait for something. Especially without hoverboards and flying cars.&&eh, i'll only be 50 then, still 19 years younger than my mom is now&&My parents moved us to Florida in 97. This year I’m turning 36, the same age my father was when we moved here. That recent realization tripped me out. &&I LOVED the ""cgi"" camp councillor boobs over and over and over when it came out&&Yeah I really enjoyed it honestly. Not the best Nightmare movie by a long shot but probably the most entertaining Jason movie since Jason X (which is also hugely entertaining).&&They already pulled that Band-Aid off with you. &&I saw a mystery horror screening that was fairly commonly predicted to be the Blair Witch reboot a few months before it released and it was really cool in the theatre, with the straw figures hanging all over the lobby and sound effects of the forest footsteps and branches breaking before the movie started, etc. 

I still really dig that movie, and I'd be really interested to see if the reviews being released before I saw it would've altered my opinion of it. &&Freddy fans on left, Jason on right. Pixar screenings were never better. &&This will only happen during invited sneak previews. The logistics trying to do something like this for all movies would be a nightmare. &&Super VR Godzilla V Mothra V Kong coming to a city near you.

Gojiraaaaa! &&I was honestly expecting a shitty ""J-J-J-JOHN CENA"" but then I remembered that not everything is a shitpost.&&I have a signed drum head from a gig they did at the Cotton Club in Atlanta.

Killswitch, Spineshank, Sevendust, Mushroomhead. &&That soundtrack was one of the last gasps of nu metal. &&**Got your nose!**&&Freddy is eternal whereas Jason has physical limitations. Jason X showed how to defeat the beast, but even then his body could still have survived somehow. &&I remember reading that Robert Englund (Freddy) considers Jason to be the winner.&&Did they ever see the light of day on film?&&X was about as good as it will ever get.  Cheesy sure, but that was a fun movie.&&We need someone who can actually write decent Freddy movies, then we need a good Freddy actor, those were my biggest problems with the Jack Earl Haley movie . The OG Freddy actor is hard to replace in my opinion, and the last movie wasnt scary and was too serious for a Freddy movie.&&Well Blumhouse is making a new Halloween movie

If that turns out well, maybe they should look into that as an avenue, get some new Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Hellraiser and the like films and when they're sorted, consider an expanded slasherverse*

*I mean, beyond the old slasherverse, considering if you count easter eggs as canon, as well as those two, Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Child's Play, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a couple of others are canon&&Vs ash&&Boobies &&Chest-burstingly serious&&I was the kind of kid that was terrified of the THX logo when I would watch movies on VHS cause of how fucking loud it was... My dad should've known there was no way I was gonna be able to handle Freddy and Jason in the same movie.&&Haha I’m really not a fan of scary movies. I’ll give it a go someday though! &&Good, now I can finally ask. Did you wait those 15 years for that wet dream to become reality? How it turned out?&&Basically leaves you with blue balls&&[deleted]&&Freddy just wanted to use Jason to instill enough fear to get his powers back since his power is based on fear.

When the friend of the first kill is lamenting his death he falls asleep and sees Freddy. Freddy tries to slash him, but it phases through him and Freddy remarks, ""damn, still not strong enough. ""&&The kids plan was to get them both to a spot they could die right? Jason being afraid of water and Freddy fire. So they put them on a dock and blew up the dock. &&But at the same time, all the kills in Freddy vs Jason but one are from Jason. Jason killed pretty much everyone in that movie.&&I can't fucking hear anything

-Beethoven &&[How much does this guy weigh?](https://youtu.be/T9AbN5dySl4) &&Wasn't in Tokyo Dome. Only 4.75 stars. &&Now I want Freddy vs. Yamato&&Huh, I was certain that it was established in the first film. Thank you for the info.&&I think everyone just always *assumed* that he was a child molester even though they never fully blurted it out.

I mean, come on, who murders that many kids without molesting them first?  Or at least molesting them after.&&He IS Freddy. His hand movements say it all. &&He's the Vincent Price of our generation. &&Hah man I never consciously noticed that but thinking back on it, that really does give him a distinctive feel. Kane was awesome.&&Kane was the only Jason I was ever legitimately scared of.  They used to just have stuntmen play the role, as I heard it.&&He’s a much bigger part of the plot. Jason is just kind of an unstoppable force, and he’s used by both Freddy and the teenagers at various points. Freddy is the movie’s Big Bad, whereas Jason is just an additional problem, albeit an incredibly dangerous one.

Honestly, it’s a good way to balance the two. Freddy is the bigger problem, but Jason has the higher body count.&&To be fair isn't Freddy *using* Jason for like the first half of the film? He's tricking Jason into killing, mimicking his mother or something. Freddy spends half the film regenerating his powers, as he can only exist in the dream world at first.

So technically Jason is Freddy's puppet for the first half of the film.&&In addition to what others are saying it also kinda makes sense based on their source material to have such a big difference in kill count. Jason has always been more of a quantity guy, I think he actually has the highest kills per movie of any horror movie character, whereas Freddy is more of a quality>quantity guy. The original Nightmare on Elm Street only had like four kills, but damn if they weren’t all memorable. &&True but it showcases Freddy as an actual pure badass that we hadn’t seen before. When he’s dragged out in to the real world he’s pretty much kicking Jason’s ass. 

My opinion is that he won their battle. &&Two? I only remember one. the guy whose brother comitted suicide and freddy writes 'Freddy's back' on his corpse
&&Really I thought it screwed over Jason who is turned into a mindless tool.  

Also to be fair,  in the real world Freddy isn't a threat.  Made sense,  plus it was a tie..&&Look at the kill counts from Friday movies and compare them to Nightmare movies.

Jason's kill count in *his* first 7 movies is

Part 2- 10
Part 3- 12
4- 14
5- 22
6-18
7- 16

He kills 22 people in FvJ. Killing is Jason's identity whereas Freddy can talk and can drive the plot forward through other means. Jason is a ""dog without a bone.""

Freddy has killed 35 people in his movies including FvJ. He really doesn't do a lot of killing in his movies.

&&"" Gentleman, what seems to be the problem?"" That was what Pinhead was supposed to say. &&Ive only seen the first pinhead so correct me if im wrong, but the cenobites aren't really a fighting group so much as a cabal of pleasure and pain right? I feel like it wouldnt make sense for pinhead to step in&&Oh wow, I literally just left a comment saying that's how I wished it would've ended. I didn't even know this. 
Chucky would've been hilarious too.&& Plus introducing Ash from evil dead&&I think a lot of that was influenced by the hills  have eyes.

Americans where less scared of colorful big guys and more scared of leathery hillbillies&&Yes!! And the weird longish hair he had, I wasn't into it. Something was even off about the shape of his head, which is a bizarre thing to complain about but hey, he just looked stupid&&My favorite Jason look is from part 9 followed by part 7 .&&I think there was a bit of an argument/controversy, because they didn't get the original actor to play Jason, like they did Freddy. So die hard fans really could tell a difference in Jason's mannerisms. &&Gonna have to disagree on that one. As a HUGE fan of the first Alien and first Predator, AvP was a pile of steaming dogshit that was just a huge disrespect to both franchises. At least Freddy vs Jason actually paid homage and respect to the older films in the franchises, and was also tongue in cheek. AvP felt like it tried to be too serious for its own good.&&I only like *AvP:R* for the Pred-Alien hybrid. That things was really awesome in design and concept; I genuinely liked it. Everything else in the movie is a ginormous let down.&&Why though? All these films promise massive fights, only to have a goon like squad of humans wandering around at the heart of it all. Couldn't they just do away with them completely and focus on the actual fight itself?&&[deleted]&&Is it really racist to say someone has darker skin? Like, she does. &&> Trends in the early 2000s don't seem nearly as spoofable today as the 80s trends did in the early 2000s.

True, but there's definitely some ones that stand out. NSYNC style, blonde highlighted tips on the gelled hair come to mind..&&> Trends in the early 2000s don't seem nearly as spoofable today as the 80s trends did in the early 2000s...

I guess because the 80's fashion and cultural styles were so outrageous and ""exotic"". I think about how in *How I met your mother* Robin Sparkles' music videos are supposed to have been recorded in the 90's (because the actress is obviously too young to have been a teen pop singer in the 80's) but they still go for a ""general 80's"" vibe (and handwave it with how the 80's didn't come to Canada until 1993 or some shit) because it's so much funnier.  
If we're gonna spoof the 90's we're stuck with ill-fitting jeans and middle part hairstyles on guys. That's... just not very funny.&&Vice city take place in 84 doesn’t it?

So cheesy but one of my favorite lines.&&Jason X was the epitome of sci-fi/slasher film making simply because it contained the [sleeping bag scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF629C5WRqU). &&I remember seeing that movie as a kid and hating how cheap looking and dumb it was, but as an adult I can appreciate the cheese factor~~y~~.&&[deleted]&&As someone who has never seen any movies from either of these franchises do you think they're worth a watch? I'm not a huge fan of the slasher genre, but I do enjoy horror/thriller films and I understand that these two characters are iconic. &&Haley was fine I thought.  He's a great actor and did a pretty good job.  And I think it being more serious was the point, has been for most of these remakes.

But yeah, not a great movie.  But for me, it had more to do with growing up with the series, and walking home from Elementary school down Elm street when they were coming out!&&VS Hellraiser's Pinhead. &&That's not a fair fight. Ash took on armies of Deadites.

Which makes Freddy a parasitic monster, because when he kills all the kids in town, and the parents aren't susceptible, nobody will remember him, and he won't be able to go on.&&8-07u93498-hhwqwgjoi[eqpgergerqg,qergji[opkqjiop[qwegji[opsADF\

Jason is pretty green but he seems to have a decent grasp on ring psychology although he definitely rips off Kane with the whole ""huge deformed supernatural beast under a hood"" gimmick. &&It was just implied. It's the implication that makes him so terrifying.&&Yeah, I think that's probably where it comes from.  They never state it though, even when occasionally it'd make sense to - like a police officer mentioning what his crimes were in one film.  They show him murder a girl in flashback in Freddy VS Jason too - he licks a photograph of the kid to paste it in a scrapbook, one of the most effectively gross moments in the franchise.

I think him being a molester is compatible with the films (never explicitly denied), just never confirmed, essentially, and deliberately avoided by the filmmakers.  &&Yes. And his speech patterns are downright perfect. To me that’s one reason that it’s going to be impossible to remake Nightmare without losing something incredible. Horror is always going to be ostracized by the film community, but I can think of only a handful of performances for a villain that iconic. In my mind it’s Freddy and Nurse Ratchet.&&Well yeah that's why they hired Kane because he was also a stuntman. &&You know, I honestly never thought of it that way, but it's a really good point. Great observation!&&>So technically Jason is Freddy's puppet for the first half of the film.

That's still kinda lame and a weak excuse; it was still Jason actually doing the killing.

Freddy doesn't even get any real creative kills like in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street: Dream Warriors"" which was a high point for the franchise.&&Jason is  brutal. Freddy is evil.&&#BloodFountian4lyfe&&Oh no, I had 0 problem with the actually title fight itself, that was done very well. 

I was just disappointed that Freddy himself didn't get any creative and satisfying dream kills.&&Technically, Jason is a mindless puppet overall. &&Yep. They couldn't get the rights to Pinhead, unfortunately, so they had to drop the idea.&&Well, it's what the writers wanted. Plus I think the cenobites we're changed to being literal demons, whether hailing from hell itself or transformed from humans.&&Pinhead could definitely break up the fight with his powers. &&Jason's design for part 9 is so unbelievably wasted it's unreal. Like, it's the best of the ""inhuman monster"" designs (My favorite human Jason is part 4) but it literally Is around for 2 minutes of the movie. &&Kane Hodder and yah he contributed a lot to the character. I remember recognizing something wasn't right about Jason's movements and later found out that they had recast Kane without even asking him if he wanted the role.&&But after watching AvP: Requiem, the original AvP is pretty decent. &&Then I’ll have to disagree with you. The movie paid many homages to the original franchises and took their respective monsters faithfully to the core. Perhaps the weakest part of the movie was the humans, with not so stellar performances but AvP is akin to FvJ. For example:

• the opening shot of the Weyland satellite resembles the Alien Queen’s skull, giving you a false start on where the movie is. 

• Weyland is (for the movie at least) the founder of Weyland Enterprises which the android Bishop was modeled after. 

• the opening sequence for the Predator ship, mimics the launch sequence from Alien where the space helmets act like pilots to the ship, now with the Predator helmets. 

• The sacrificial chamber in the pyramid is the same design as the sleeping pods in Alien. 

• Both the Alien and the Predator are presented as unstoppable forces that are hunting the humans. They couldn’t do anything against any of them. They didn’t kill any Predator and I Think they didn’t kill an Alien either. 

• The story is taken straight from the first AvP comic series where a human colony in the planet Ryushi, or something like that, encounters and Alien Queen that has been planted there by the Predators to use as hunting grounds. 

• There is even a human-Predator alliance in the comic, branding her with the symbol of the clan, like in the movie. 

• They introduced in this movie the concept of bigger and more powerful plasmacasters. 

• Again, they showed multiple visions from the Predator helmets. 

• They repeated the concept of honor between members of the clan, leaving the protagonist alive at the end. 

•The design of the Queen is superb. It’s the best look since Aliens. 

• They teased the coming of the Predalien, which again has appeared before in the comics and the video games. 

•there is a shot of The protagonist that is very similar to a shot in Alien where Ripley’s hand is seen coming from an air duct and then the camera focuses on her eyes. They are both almost identical, so it’s another homage. 


Personally, I think the music was great and the movie was pretty enjoyable. Of course it has its flaws and everything but I don’t think it was disrespectful of the original franchises. 

&&It could be because I am now watching the Unrated Edition, not the theatrical cut. If you've never seen the unrated version, I would check it out. It adds more than just some blood/gore. I felt like they paid enough respect to the sources. I'm not familiar with the AvP comic books, but if you think of this movie as a comic book movie, it kind of puts it in perspective. I'm not saying it's Citizen Kane, just that it's far more enjoyable than I originally gave it credit for.
&&I agree. AvP is the shittiest movie I’ve seen 10 times. I went into it thinking “ how hard are they going to nerf Alien for this to work?” And they did. The plot is perfectly set up to make Alien at the disadvantage so it’s an even fight. 

Aliens from 1986 Aliens would’ve made quick work of everybody in those movies by the end of act 1. &&They should have done the plot of the original AvP comic.

And I swear to god, if another Alien movie has the Alien facehug and then chestburst within like 5 minutes of getting facehugged, I'm gonna' lose my shit.

Fuck you Alien: Covenant.&&Oh my god thank you. My buddy and I were so hyped to see this movie during college and we were so let down. And for the longest time everyone gave us shit for hating the movie. I finally feel vindicated.&&Me too. I wish we could have seen the bloody thing though.&&Baggy ass pants&&the scene where he puts the two hologram girls in a bag is hysterical.&&X is so awesome; it's true. I've seen it so many times, but I definitely wouldn't call it a ""good movie."" So many amazing parts. Liquid nitrogen kill, Android decapitation, nanobot enhanced Super Jason, etc. etc.&&I do love Jason Takes Manhattan. I don’t know why people hate it so much.

Friday the 13th: Part V: A New Beginning, however, isn’t even a Jason movie at all. It’s a copycat killer. &&Love the rooftop ""fight"" lol. Also the girl getting shot up with heroin because reasons. [The theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB8l4MoX44g&app=desktop) is pretty damn good too.&&Disagree! Part IV is the best one. Corey Feldman 4 Life!&&No no, the best one is VI, Jason Lives. If it wasn't for that he'd still be an ugly corpse in a coffin. 1 through 4 are good, but 6 wins. &&I can see that. That’s probably my second least favorite, followed by Jason X and then Jason Goes to Hell (I kind of have a soft spot for Jason Goes to Hell since it was the first one I watched growing up, and my dad surprisingly let me watch it. 

I just hate 7 because of the telekinetic girl. It was just ridiculous, even for a silly horror movie.&&[deleted]&&It was portrayed as vr to distract Jason. They were real and they were spectacular&&Yeah what would have been sweet is if they all got stuck in a crystal lake simulation in the spaceship so that it transitioned to look like one of the OG Friday movies&&As somebody who has seen Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness at least 50 times, I'd like to hear this.&&Holy Freddy &&Had such a crush on that asian girl.&&Nice try, but I would have remembered Jason killing people in a cheese factory &&Yes.  And it's awesome.&&Jason is the silent killer who walks when the victim runs away and can still catch them.  Besides the fact that the Jason is completely unkillable, or that he has super human strength, the movies are at least somewhat grounded in realism.  

Freddy is the snarky, wise cracking protagonist who blends your reality with your dreams.  He can kill in more graphic and magical sort of ways, so the series can get a bit out there.  

I tell.you the difference because they each have a lot of content and you might not be sure where to start.  Personally, I enjoy the Friday's much more as they stick to the cliche summer camp slasher style.  

Should they be watched?  Absolutely, they are highly referenced and set the stage for many future movies.&&Honestly Friday the 13th hasn't aged well. The only real appeal is the severity of the kills, but they're not even that severe by modern standards. It's really more like an ascended B movie. 

Nightmare on Elm Street, on the other hand, is still just as amazing (the first one). &&He was originally supposed to have a cameo in Freddy vs Jason.&&Would Pinhead even be a contender in that fight? I've only seen the first two, but he's not much of a fighter. &&Dead by Daylight the movie.

Speaking of, that really needs Pinhead!&&The opening scene lmao &&Dude.... holy shit.&&You just blew my mind...&&One of the patients on my unit right now is a chubby old black guy with white hair that looks exactly like him. He's basically Paul Bearer's negative.&&[deleted]&&[And if you're not down with that...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpiNBiF8Ylc)&&And you cant teach that.&&I went in with low expectations and ended up liking it more than I thought I could expect. &&Water Helen, Water.  

- Helen Keller The Musical&&The kids couldn’t say no because of the implication. &&> his speech patterns are downright perfect

Which is fitting since he voices the Nightmarish version of Dr. Crane/Scarecrow in injustice 2, good job NetherRealms!&&Dont forget Anton Gusher or whatever his name was from No Country for Old Men haha&&> it’s going to be impossible to remake Nightmare 

That's a funny tense to use considering they already remade it with the guy that played Rorschach as Freddy in 2010... albeit it was pretty bad.

&&I don't think horror is too ostracized. It kind of seems like it's always revered when the films are excellent, like Rosemary's Baby, but it's a genre like action where it's easy to just produce schlock. But back in the 1930's and 40's horror cinema dominated, and now all of the universal horror films are seen as classics. The Bride of Frankenstein (and Frankenstein, in a different volume) made it to Roger Ebert's Great Movies list.&&I always had this weird feeling as a kid watching Freddy Vs Jason that I could replace England as the famous nightmare killer. Oh how much imagination youth delivers. 

&&This is why I want Get Out to win best picture. The idea of a genre movie winning an Oscar is so unheard of. &&Kane also moved in explosive bursts that looked like a seething anger. &&idk man I was a big fan of him possessing the stoner. Agreed I wanted more of a focus on the monsters and less on the victims but it's definitely a fun watch now you know what you're walking into&&Nightmare is an interesting series where the original is actually pretty scary and dark.  The sequels turned into more comedy and both worked.  &&Dream warriors came out roughly 15-16 years before FvJ, it's safe to say that you really shouldn't expect that much creativity if that was the high point of the franchise. &&Manson got life and he didn't kill anyone&&Are you serious we could have had a super villain cinematic universe?! I want to see Chucky making wise cracks then get rag dolled *literally* by Michael Myers. &&Who holds onto pinhead so tightly? Even when this movie was made the hellraiser series had become the worst of those 70s/80s horror icons. Though we did get a young Henry Cavill in the stupid computer Hellraiser movie.

Could of jump started their franchise to be back on a movie screen and not a video cassette. &&[deleted]&&Granted I've never actually seen Requiem, don't think I want to.&&I don't understand the hate for Requiem.  It's exactly what would happen if those 2 things went to war.  We get fucked.  And Fucked hard.  It was dark(not just the movie;) ) and showed no mercy.   &&I don't know if you mean the Alien vs human part or not.

But Chopper is impaled and instantly headbitten by Grid.  Grid then proceeds to kill Celtic.  Almost right after this, Scar is facehugged.  The Predators performed horribly, from what I remember.&&I also hated the beginning of the ""its so dark I cant see shit"" trend that started with AvP.&&Yes. And the liquid nitrogen kill. And the android KM with the cheesy lines who after looking like she's gonna tear him apart gets her shit wrecked in an instant. Jason X was great schlock&&Well, as for Jason Takes Manhattan, I think a lot of the hate has to do with how only the last little bit of the movie actually takes place in Manhattan, while the majority is on the boat.

I still love it though. His little head tilt when he sees the giant hockey mask sign always gets me.&&Oh, I had V mixed up with VII then.&&Part V was also the only one with a cast member called Voorhees so it gets bonus points for that, as well as her enormous . . . . . what was I saying? &&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Goes_to_Hell:_The_Final_Friday#Retrospective_insight&&[removed]&&What? Oh.

Oh well, keeping it.&&Thanks. Yeah, I tend to prefer horror that is more grounded in reality so Friday the 13th definitely seems more appealing, although I don't know if I like the idea of a completely invincible villain. 

I did enjoy Scream, which I suppose is part slasher/part homage to the genre itself.&&He can produce a dozen or so chains out of nowhere to restrain people from a distance then literally pull them apart. It seems pretty effective, although he's not particularly interested in picking fights.&&Not really I guess, but I'm having a hard time coming up with horror icons this early in the morning. &&The Godwin brothers (Phineas I. and Henry O.) Initials were P.I.G. and H.O.G.. The WWF has always had a healthy dose of ""dad joke"" style humor. 

One of them also went on to become Naked Mideon.&&[deleted]&&paging u/shittymorph&&[deleted]&&I wonder how she felt about the score and casting choices&&I am too drunk to taste this chicken.

· The Colonol&&😂😂😂 ""Anton Gusher""&&It's Anton Chigurh, friendo. &&I will never be able to refer to him as anything more Than Anton Gusher. Which, coincidentally, will now be the name of my first born.&&Yeah, I was more or less referring to the fact that about a year ago there was another plan for a [reboot](https://www.google.com/amp/s/1428elm.com/2017/07/09/new-line-making-another-nightmare-elm-street/amp/) 

The 2010 film really missed a lot about what made Freddy great. And solidified my belief that one can not simply usurp the mantle from Robert. 

&&There have been some incredible films that were simply ignored. The historical look at film, all film, has many horror films that rival many of the top award winners. I think it’s wonderful that so many academy nominees for best director and best screenplay are often influenced by a lot of horror films. There’s so much about the history of horror that is so influential and so very fantastic.&&Holy shit the catapillar with the bong lmfao&&When he's waiting for Jason with the syringes in hand, ""Let me handle this bitch""&&With the discount Jason Mewes haha&&>  the stoner

His name was Jay, right? In a not-at-all-subtle Kevin Smith reference?&&Yeah, it was after Dream Warriors that it just leaned WAY to hard into the comedy. Personally, I don't really like most of the movies after Dream Warriors. (Although, some of the kills are still great.)&&Yeah, I know... 

Man, it really went downhill after that, didn't it?

But, ""New Nightmare"" was pretty good and a return to form even if it was a meta narrative of horror and the franchise itself.&&Dude, it's a slasher movie. Not an in depth plot of manipulation and drama.

I went in to see Freedy kill people in creative ways, Jason to just kill people, and both of them to fight.

It only satisfied the latter two.&&This all makes me very sad... I would pay so many dollars to see a supervillain cinematic universe.&&Comicbooks solve all life’s problems.&&A little weirder than that.  The Labyrinth represented order; the Nightbreed were chaos; Leviathan vs. Baphomet.    There weren't really any ""good guys"" in the traditional sense.   &&You don’t &&It's one of those movies where it seems they knew they were making a bad movie and didn't try. But it's not one of those ""Self-Aware"" bad movies like Kung Fury.

Only highlights for me was Sam from True Blood is in it and so is Cricket from Always Sunny.&&No one's seen that movie. It's too dark to see anything.&&Boutta say, the only real advantage the predators had was against the humans at the camp. Aliens crushed for almost the whole movie.&&Those predators were also handicapped and were fresh too. The humans took their Plasmablasters and these were young Yautja taking their trials into manhood basically. &&Worst fucking noob preds ever seen. I think they were actually disabled mentally and sending them to Earth was like their version of euthanasia. &&That is true, but the stuff that happens on the boat is actually pretty exciting too. 

I’m always partial to the black kid who tries to box him, and he ends up getting his head punched off.&&My friends and I call it Jason Takes the Boat. I love it tho. &&My favorite part of that one is when he's walking down the street and kicks the thugs' radio, then scares them off by pulling his mask up

&&[deleted]&&It happens. There are a lot of them.

Arguably, Friday the 13th Part I isn’t a Jason movie either, but he actually appears at the end, so I count it. The only Jason in A New Beginning was a dream, so it doesn’t count to me.

The movie, however, isn’t as bad as the telekinetic girl fighting him. &&WHAT THE FUCK HIS UNMASKED FACE IN THAT WIKI PAGE&&That you good sir. I already forgot her name!&&Important note if you enjoyed Scream: That film's director, Wes Craven, was the writer and director of A Nightmare on Elm Street.&&The Jeepers Creepers monster?&&See also: Irwin R. Shyster (aka IRS) and more recently, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP).&&Do you smell The Rock's dinner?&&I knew exactly what that was going to be. I'm so proud of you.&&HAITCH FACE&&I hope she'd have been impressed with the turkey jumping through the flaming hoop, that took a lot of work behind the scenes.&&And a porn star name is born.&&rofl make sure you give the kid (boy or girl) his haircut too&&Do you really think it was the casting that made that reboot fail? I'm not minimizing Englund's iconic performance, but I actually think Jackie Earle Haley is a great actor and totally has the Freddie look, and he was probably the only highlight of the film.&&The only way a remake can work, imo, would be a whole new interpretation of the character. try to keep what's iconic about him sure, but also try to put a whole new spin on him.

If I were to remake him I'd have him be more like a ghost in peoples nightmares, appearing and disappearing seemingly at will. His face wouldn't look like someone who survived a fire, no. he's look like a damned charred skeleton. Remember two face from the dark knight? Picture that but his whole face made up to look grotesque.

Less humor, sadly. Nobody could match Englund's raw charisma, so you need to replace it with something else. Just a sick twisted desire to kill those he feels wronged him. hunting his victims like a predator hunts prey with no remose. he still taunts his victims but there's less humor in his mockery. He's toying with them because he wants them to know there is no hope. this is the end, and he will show know mercy.

Something like that anyway.&&And how about that guitar playing.&&Is it bad thats the only thing i remember from watching this in theatres lol&&Ah my friend you've convinced me of a rewatch while I still need to catch up on so many Oscar Noms. Or maybe just a few clips on YouTube...&&New nightmare is fantastic though&&I find if I separate them into good horror ones vs campy fun ones I can have fun with them all for different reasons!&&I just rewatched the entire series and yup really really downhill BUT I did enjoy the backstory until the whole dream demon things. &&And punchlines. WELCOME TO PRIME TIME, BITCH! *Smashes a tv on her head.*&&[deleted]&&Only good thing about it was finally seeing the Yaujta homeworld on film for the brief 3 seconds of it. Also parts of the Predator was cool too and the Pred-Alien&&Kung Fury is good though. It's definitely super cheesy, but it's good.&&The only time I could really cheer the Predators on was when Celtic was slamming Grid around, or when Scar was fighting the Queen - both of which ended with the Predator dying!

I had hoped that Wolf in Requiem would have went billy badass on the Aliens, but iirc he didn't perform much better.&&OH MY GOD I forgot about that, that’s hilarious, too.

And the kids with the boom box on the street? Fabulous. &&That's actually the one death where I realized that Black people on Friday movies do extremely well. 

Not survive the entire movie well, but we'll enough considering.&&That part is awesome!&&That makes sense. Can’t imagine how much it might cost to film there.

And That too... such a bizarre movie&&Hahaha the one from the game?&&I feel like every time Vince came up with one of those he would chuckle to himself, look in the mirror, and say ""I'm a goddamn genius goddamnit""&&[New Haitch Face](https://imgur.com/6jD2r8O) &&I'm sorry but my comment was a joke&&Dibs! &&I think it wasn’t the casting of Freddy necessarily. It was just about everyone else. It was the poor writing. I think it would have been a better film without the bullshit twist and twist back. And Freddy really isn’t given much to do. His dialogue isn’t even hammy, and his delivery is flat. I actually love Jackie but his mannerisms just didn’t do it. His voice was good, and he absolutely had the look, but the mannerisms just weren’t there.&&Jackie Earle Haley played a good slasher killer. But he wasn’t Freddy. Again I think this is to do with the script but yeah. Freddy *loves* killing and torturing his victims. Jackie looked bored. &&I think jackie did a wonderful job with what he had. but the best performance in the world couldn't save that movie. the fact that it turned out mediocre is a small miracle.&&Rex MVP&&I consider that largely separate from the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise, since it's not actually in continuity and it's actually a meta commentary on the franchise itself and horror.

Pretty good movie though and a return to form for Freddy after MANY subpar movies.&&[deleted]&&No, yeah, just ain't my cup of tea.&&>until the whole dream demon things.

Oh, Christ, don't remind me.&&I'M SCARY TERRY
YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, BITCH!&&High point. But they...REALLY leaned into them after that movie and that's all he became.

Wish they'd have a remake that was more in line with that movie.&&You could see something in that movie? 90% of the time it was too dark to see anything (and that’s even in theaters). &&Yeah, I just mean it was intentionally done in a cheesy b-movie way, but they make it good.&&Well he went 1v200 against all those aliens, especially in that sewer scene. &&I nearly had a heart attack, fucking abomination. &&[Neat!](https://imgur.com/Yr45czl)&&Mine was a reference to South Park, so it's not a problem.&&Yeah, you're right, I actually remember really wanting to like the reboot but it just wasn't there.

It's sad Englund is too old for the physical aspects of the part, but I'm sure they could work around that and give him one last great movie if they wanted.&&I thought the Nightmare reboot was actually pretty decent however it had a very different tone than what we have come to expect from the franchise. It was very much darker and more like a thriller than the campy, fun horror movies that the initial movies had become. Then again the first The Nightmare on Elm Street movie was a pretty dark movie itself, it's only later on that it really got their  personality, though even in the first, Freddy had a bit of a dark sense of humor to him and the kills just looked more creative, maybe because of the practical effects of the time.

So I'm not going to throw stones at anyone involved in the reboot. They did a decent movie, just a different one.&&Holy shit, how did I not hear about Wes Craven dying until now? Man was a horror film legend and that never came across my radar.&&Out there! Not in here!&&In special features for the move they show them in bright light and they actually look pretty cool, as a matter of fact (forgot the guys real name) some guy said on set that maybe they should make it a bit brighter and one of the directors said something to the effect of ""shut up Richard""&&",2018-02-24 08:27:21

They care about the movie and keeping some stuff a secret!''

I'm pretty sure the CGI isn't done yet. The movie comes out all the way in october. Be prepared to be exposed by every little plotpoint in that Sony kind of marketing way. Prediction: trailers after this will show his transformation into Venom, the reason why, the end fight and a at least an other fight or 2. And one of those trailers will begin with a question. &&This trailer makes the movie look more like a Sci-fi than a Superhero comicbook movie. &&I am whelmed.&&I feel like they could have also just not released this teaser. It adds nothing to the conversation. It's mostly shots of the back of heads. I'm sure the people that are excited are still excited, and the people that don't care still don't care. A trailer cut this way doesn't do anything to sway anyone. Guessing they just wanted to get SOMETHING in front of Black Panther, since presale was so good.&&Sony marketing exec: So tell us more about this Venom movie we're making

Todd McFarlane: It's going to be bonkers. Anti-hero. Tom Hardy. Spiderman. Super-dark. Huge fan base. Could be the next Deadpool.

Exec: Got it. So I'm thinking the teaser should be a real teaser, super vague, maybe a hint of an origin.

Todd: Yup, great idea. Just give them some glimpses of Venom in the darkness, maybe part of an action scene?

Exec: Yeah yeah, I get it. Tom Hardy on a motorcycle. Some blown up stuff. Then an elongated sequence around Tom getting an MRI. We're gonna nail it.

Todd: Ok, but don't forget, the fans'll really be expecting some glimpse of Venom doing something.

Exec: Yeah, I don't know. Extreme closeup of Tom Hardy going crazy in a hospital room sounds way better. Let's go with that.

Todd: <facepalm>&&Hate to say it, but I'm getting a bit of a Fant4stic vibe here. Little/no glimpses of the character(s) in costume, a bunch of establishing shots or out of context scenes, lofty dialogue, and weirdly showing off the title. Hm.&&This is actually happening. I truly don't know how I feel about it. &&Honestly if i had no prior knowledge of venom I wouldn't know what this is

They should have tried to atleast make it clear that venom is a symbiote that bonds around Eddie brock&&All right let's see how this looks, I'm kinda pumped. 

Tom Hardy: *Everyone's got their thing*.

Oh...&&if you gonna do a teaser trailer at least a little tease of what venom actually looks like would be nice.&&Why even bother doing a teaser trailer when theres nothing to see.. Again sony at it with disappointment...&&Could Sony Picture double down on their strategy any harder?

&&How are they going to explain the big white spider if he has no connections to Spider-Man? Only thing I can think of is him looking up to Spider-Man, modeling the suit after him, and then later feeling betrayed by him for some other reason. It isn’t classic but it’s still gets the “origin” of Venom across. But this isn’t even in the MCU, so they’d need another Spider-Man and fuck literally all of that noise. It needs to either be in the MCU so he can react to Peter or not exist.

They did nothing to excite the fans with this trailer &&Tom hardly looks like venom &&I want to be clear, I didn't expect to see the full Venom costume. I did expect to see something, anything, that told me this was a Venom movie and not some generic Tom Hardy picture. And it just looks like a generic action flick with a sci-fi bend at best. It looks boring it sounds boring and the overall look of the trailer just reads generic. Even the narration feels like it could appear in literally any other mindless action flick if you wanted.

Just seeing the Symbiote crawling over his arm or onto his face, just something to denote the body horror aspect of the symbiote's nature, literally just it burst out of a container and trying to claw onto Eddie's face would've been enough.

As it stands now I'm just so underwhelmed. It looks dull. If you didn't have the special effects ready for us to see, why did you even bother to make a teaser? Even Jurassic World, when it hadn't finished the pteradactyls yet, still gave us the Mosasaur.&&That was underwhelming. If you showed me this teaser without the title don’t think I ever would guess it’s a venom movie&&There was literally nothing there to be excited about.

Fucking what???

Also, no spiderman in this origin story? Eddie Brock became venom because the symbiot that merged with spiderman later merged with him. That's the **only** reason his costume and superpowers resemble spiderman's. It's like making a Robin movie with no Batman.

This is looking like Fant4stic all over again. Sony, please. Stop. Just stop.&&I just hate that they’re skipping around with the Spider-Man mythos. There are a ton of other villains worth doing - and they go back to the same one that left such a bad taste in movie goers mouths last time?

- hero “wakes up” at the end of the trailer

- The 5 second “pre-trailer” for YouTube ads

Did I miss anything?&&There’s so little to learn from this trailer. All it says to me is “Sony have made a venom movie and Tom Hardy is in it.” Edit: Yes angry geeks, I know what a teaser is - I still found it very underwhelming. &&After wachting it I had a moment of, wait a minute. Was I just fooled? I seriously came here to check if it was official. Saw it on an unofficial channel on youtube first.

I remembered there being a fake trailer a while back, I never watched that so I thought maybe I just did. 

&&I know it's too early to tell, but there was nothing that screamed originality or subverting genre cliches.

me&&More whelmed than most people here.&&Except they don't show the title of the movie in the teaser. In a theater people would just wonder what this generic-looking ""V"" movie is about.&&In a movie made basically to either spite Marvel or create a cash grab to try to keep more characters out of the MCU? I wouldn't have never expected that. &&Ah I wouldn't go that far. Fant4stic was never actually pitched at a traditional superhero movie to begin with, it was more like The Fly (which, ironically, is the type of approach that Venom would work well with).

Then Fox panicked and started fucking shit up, and Trank threw tantrums and the entire production got fucked and they rushed to turn it into a semi-recognisable superhero movie and we got an unfinished non-movie as a result.

This, meanwhile, just looks like one of those 90s/early 2000s superhero or video game adaptations that cashes in on the name but rewrites fucking _everything,_ and changes the core of the characters because the suits dgaf, and the people hired to write have never read the comics or played the games or what have you.

That poster yesterday looked bad ass, but this trailer makes me think this film is going to be Venom-in-name-only.

If it's a good movie, like Constantine, I won't mind (I honestly don't give a fuck anymore if things are adapted faithfully or not as long as the movies are good). But if it's a terrible movie AND bears no resemblance to Venom I'll be so confused as to why, in 2018 when the MCU is a thing, something like this got made.

The fact is, there doesn't seem to have been any hesitation in making this movie. No drama. No heavy reshoots. They had a vision and stuck to it. If that vision ends up being terrible, it'll just be _weird_ more than anything else. As if no one was paying attention to the climate and made the movie in a vacuum.&&Honestly surprised they got this far, was expecting it to be continuously pushed back like Gambit&&I still find it pretty mind-blowing that this movie is real. When Sony announced like half a dozen Spideyverse movies, I was sure they were all vaporware, especially when the Spider-Man deal with Marvel happened. Even when they announced the cast and director for Venom I still didn't believe it would actually get made. Now it's really happening, and they've got people like Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, and Woody Harrelson in it. &&You can tell they played it pretty safe with this one, making sure that there aren’t any big reveals yet&&Seriously, just one scene of black gunk crawling up his face while he screams in surprise would have been cool.&&[deleted]&&There you go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBBPUYNiCbA
&&[deleted]&&Yeah, just a glimpse of the Symbiote doesn't do the work. This was pretty underwhelming.

EDIT: It isn't just about the Venom reveal, too. The way this teaser was cut isn't getting me (and a lot of you) hyped for the movie.&&Well they teased us in wanting to getting to know more, so they did their job.&&might as well have just shown tom hardy in his dressing room in his pajamas saying ""its me tom hardy, im in this movie called venom.""

&&You realize they already fucked it up the minute they decided to make it instead of letting the symbiote saga naturally progress and develop organically over the next five years in the mcu instead of doing a quick bullshit cash in movie unrelated to Spider-Man right?&&I'm convinced no one at Sony has watched a movie since around 1996.&&[me](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/632/211/aa0.png)&&The teaser makes sense considering they probably haven't had enough time to make a clean shot of Tom in-costume as Venom, IMO.

But yeah, it could be better for what they have. That scene where something is making everything in the office(?) fly away, though, why?&&I thought it was a decent trailer that established the tone and character well enough without giving away story spoilers but it is an absolute joke that the trailer didn't end with a glimpse of Venom. It is literally the selling point of the movie and it's like they completely shied away from it.

Sony aren't usually subtle with their marketing, and this was certainly not the movie to be subtle with. They have a lot to prove and if they aren't even going to include the selling point in trailers like this then it's not going to generate much hype.&&Looks like an early to mid 2000's comicbook movie.

Loosely based on the comics. &&If they use the origin from the Ultimate comics, which they've borrowed from quite a bit already with the Amazing Spider-Man movies (the MCU has done it, too), then they could do it without the Venom logo. In the Ultimate comic, the Symbiote is a science experiment that used Spider-Man's DNA. It escapes and bonds with Eddie Brock, then bonds to Spider-Man because he's a strong motherfucker and a better host, then back to Eddie Brock when Parker gets rid of it. Venom only has the spider logo after bonding with Spider-Man and mimicking the style of his suit. 

They could also maybe show that the Symbiote has escaped, then have a news broadcast say that Spider-Man is wearing a black suit and is acting temperamental or some shit. Just vague enough to let Marvel make that movie if they want to. So, the baddies are trying to track down Spider-Man to get the Symbiote back, but then you see a headline saying something like ""Red and Blue, Tried and True."" Show the baddies flipping out about losing the trail, then cut to the Symbiote finding Eddie. Boom, you've got your logo, it makes sense, and leaves the IP rights in the hands of their owners.

They have already announced that this movie is fashioned after the ""Lethal Protector"" storyline. Where Scientists try to replicate the Venom symbiote and create 5 different versions of the Symbiote named Scream, Phage, Riot, Lasher, and Agony. These 5 should be the villains. 

Carnage doesn't appear in that short run. But Spidey does. 

So if they're sticking to source material Carnage won't be in the film as a villain. 

What I'm predicting is that Carnage will be born at some point during the movie and then revealed as a post-credit scene with the Symbiote crawling into a cell window to a cackling (unseen) Cletus Kasady.

You’re kidding yourself if you think Marvel didn’t at least get one round of notes in. 

Going to the conform, finishing the mix and vfx takes time. Somebody probably stayed up late during the process but you’re waaaaaaaay off to think something like this is just whipped together overnight. 

Edit: one more thing - if you think there’s a trailer editor in this business not demanding overtime you’re bonkers.

> Here's the great thing about reading the Spider-Man Sony emails - they're largely all from a group of dumbass movie executives who don't know anything about Marvel comics OR storytelling, and so hearing them describe their plans for building a huge cinematic universe sounds BEYOND clunky and stupid. They just...don't have any understanding for what actually would be good - only things that SHOULD be good based on their takeaways from focus groups and analytics.
> 
> I preface it this way because - if they had actually gone through with building out their ""Spider-verse"", it probably wouldn't have happened exactly like they're describing it. In the hands of actual writers and directors and artists, the path would have been at least SLIGHTLY less ridiculous-sounding (I hope). But since that never came to fruition, all we have are a bunch of moronic executives spitballing in poorly-formatted email exchanges - and the results are amazing, particularly this line from Sony President Amy Pascal about how Venom would be introduced:

I'm speechless.&&After seeing this trailer I wish the Sony Execs would've went with the Aunt May spy movie trilogy they had planned.&&> Also, no spiderman in this origin story? Eddie Brock became venom because the symbiot that merged with spiderman later merged with him. That's the **only** reason his costume and superpowers resemble spiderman's.

Yeah... though if they don’t do the Spider-Man part of the story justice, it may be better if they just write it out completely.

That’s a major storyline that can’t really be summed up in a couple quick flashbacks and never spoken of again.  Spider-Man would need to play a pretty notable supporting role for it to work.

If they don’t use Spider-Man, it may be best if they just sort of make it so the symb just goes straight to Brock.  Skipping over Spider-Man.  And it would still have the Spider-Man like eyes, but that similarity wouldn’t need any explanation.  It would still have the classic Venom face... but no Spider logo.  Just blackness on its chest.  And they’d probably focus on the climbing, strength, jumping, and less on the web sort of powers.

Not what we want of course.

But I’d rather they do it justice or just keep it separate, rather than trying to half ass shoe horn the Spider-Man thing in.&&I 100% thought that too. &&Holy shit I thought the whole time it was Terrence Howard and just learned it wasn't reading your comment.&&His Lawless accent was pretty memorable too.&&Revenant too, although I had a hard time what he was mumbling half the time.&&The guy has range with his American accents too.

Venom telekinesis &&Yeah, Sony isn't good at making movies. They seem to have somewhat smartened up by hiring a handful of directors who they can essentially write a check for, and know they'll get something worthwhile in return (Tarantino, Edgar Wright).

&&Bring what up?&&Why he looks like spider-man. Why he mimics his powers. Why his name is VENOM. He is literally meant to be the dark side of Spider-man. His shadow. So let's just not even worry about spidey at all. He's not important.&&You don't think this is a story that Marvel or Sony would actually want to tell? 

One of Spiderman's most iconic stories told in passing? &&didn't the merchandise rights go back to Marvel?&&on top of that, I wonder if its still even true. Venom was huge in the 90s but I feel he gets less and less popular as time goes on. He seems like a relic of the 'extreme' days of comics.&&So puzzling when the character's very existence is predicated on his hatred for Spider-man.   &&From what I've read, it's kind of the other way round. I'm sure Sony would love some of the MCU shine to rub off on their movies, but Feige doesn't want the brand tarnished.

I mean its a gym shirt thats gonna get sweaty and stinky you never wear anything you actually want to look respectable in. I think a Punisher tank top is a pretty dope gym shirt, and I don't think it means you are 'edgy,neck-beardy'. I think it just means you've got a pretty sweet taste in comic book movies/comics and you want to sweat in that shirt *Shrugs*.&&You might be a neckbeard if you're on Reddit hating on people for what they are wearing in the gym. &&In general, I just don't wear things with skulls on them, so yeah, as much as I love the stories...&&You have great power, and need to realize it comes with great responsibility, dammit. &&Spider-Man, man.

This movie needs to be the equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man 1, or Deadpool.

Except... those movies were not only good movies, but also coincidentally pretty faithful to the source material. So those fans weren't against the movie but leading the bandwagon. With 'Venom', the reverse will be the case. There is no built-in fanbase because the fans hate the idea.

Sony's betting people are going to have a clamoring for a horror movie monster anti-hero. Like a dark and gritty version of Incredible Hulk (whose movies did terribly might I add).

That's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off.&&I mean the only reason venom has his powers is exactly because Peter for the suit first.  The whole origin revolves around Eddie hate for Peter and the symbiote being angry for being rejected(the black suit is very much a woman scorned) and the two finding a common enemy to hate and punish.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDCSGI-FUhA

the hoodie will be black. *just like the character is in the comic.*&&We have no proof of that.&&Don't give Sony any ideas.&&100% intentional&&Yeah, but even ironman showed the Goddamned suit. Even if it was a literal mask, they should have teased something. There's not enough in this trailer to convince anyone but Tom hardy fans. &&I will always go to bat for Topher's Venom. he was a well done villain, for what Raimi wanted to portray. He's not a well done comic book Venom, but Grace's Eddie Brock was meant to be a mirror to Peter Parker in a way the comic muscle bound version never was. He's the same geeky guy down on his luck just trying to get ahead, but the difference is he doesn't have Uncle Ben. He doesn't have Peter's scruples, or good will. So even when Peter is corrupted by the suit, he just sort of gets... like.. douchey. He does lame things that he thinks are cool because deep down he's a sweet nerdy guy. He dances down the street, he makes his hair stupid, but to him, a giant dork, it's cool as shit. Now Eddie, in that film, when he's trying to get ahead, it's by holding others back. The suit corrupts him, but he has nothing inside fighting back against it. He welcomes it. He savors it. He's truly a bad man. Honestly, it's a very interesting concept in my opinion, and I hated what they did with Sandman and Uncle Ben's death a lot more than what they did with Venom. Evil Peter is a cool place to take the character. &&That one always got to me.&&SYMBIOTES, NED! ON AN OPEN FIELD!
&&The Deadpool marketing team once again proves they'll one day have their trailers analyzed by future marketing students in the classroom as to why they were so damn successful.&&[Here ye go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI0MGrwqb6w)&&Sony is reportedly creating their own ""spider-verse"" with all of the Spiderman characters they have the rights to, just without Spiderman himself... and it's completely outside the MCU.

Also, is it just me or does Tom Hardy look like he's constantly walking around like a hunchback?&&Spider-Man the Animated Series took some liberties with that part.

This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry,32573,7uzu4s,https://nyti.ms/2GKjF1l,3951,1517670942.0,,">Her exchange with Thurman is the kind of piece that leaves you feeling a bit dead inside, realizing that such things could have happened to a star of Thurman’s magnitude.

[Deadline's piece about it](http://deadline.com/2018/02/uma-thurman-sexual-assault-harvey-weinstein-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-1202277631/) got to the heart of how I felt about it. I can't imagine how exhausted she felt, being on such high alert waiting for something bad to happen - I felt the same reading Salma Hayek's piece. &&That was a sad read. &&That was awful footage of her car accident. 

I don't get why Quentin was so adamant about her driving it. A lot of shots in Kill Bill intentionally use a fake background anyways (very retro nod to the 50s/60s films). There could have been so many smarter options to film it without putting Uma at risk like that. And she's right - she's an actress, not a stunt driver. And even if it was a stunt driver, if there is a feeling the car isn't entirely safe, you stop everything and ensure that it is. Your shot be damned - safety is always first.&&That is *so* fucked up. Uma Thurman is a very resilient woman.&&>Hawke added that the director “was very upset with himself and asked for my forgiveness.”

And, as a summary:

>“Harvey assaulted me but that didn’t kill me,” she says. “What really got me about the crash was that it was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?” She says she didn’t feel disempowered by any of it. Until the crash.


&&> Thurman says that in “Kill Bill,” Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.

jfc that’s messed up&&My favorite Uma Thurman role is when she was Fantine in Les Miserables from 1998. Even though it was before Kill Bill, watching it now with this piece in mind would be a good reflection on just how good an actress she is, especially at playing someone who had struggled as much as Fantine had. &&Jesus Christ. If you're thinking of dismissing the article for any reason, click and watch the video of her crash in the Kill Bill set. Quentin Tarantino did an awful thing by having her do that stunt. Also, fuck Weinstein.&&The most chilling thing she said was that when she looked in the mirror afterwards she wished her hands were bloodied and bruised.  I can't imagine such thoughts and hope nobody has to, and wish she didn't. Hell is not bad enough for the monsters who cause such harm. &&Damn Quentin, that's fucked up.&&I love Tarantino movies, but I've always felt like he was a huge creep.&&Damn. That was a rough read. I love Tarantino flicks, and now that I know she went through that, it kind of sours it all for me. It's not like it's a secret Tarantino is ""weird"", to say the least, but I always thought ""Q & U"" were close. Looks like that's no longer the case, and for good reason.

Of course, all the Weinstein crap puts a damper on just about any Mirimax feature, but this really adds a whole other layer of suck.&&Dumb question: why was the car used in Kill Bill so shoddy that a stunt driver should have driven it? if I recall, there was nothing about the scenes of her driving that made it seem like all that special car had to be used.&&[deleted]&&>Thurman says that in “Kill Bill,” Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.

Wtf Tarantino&&That article was tough to read and the video of her accident was even worse. It’s sad that it took her so long to retrieve this footage. &&Reminder, this is what Rose McGowan said about the Creative Artist Agency (CAA) which Uma confirmed were complicit:
 https://twitter.com/J_H_5/status/959270847855910912?ref_src=twcamp%5Eshare%7Ctwsrc%5Eandroid%7Ctwgr%5Edefault%7Ctwcon%5E7090%7Ctwterm%5E3&&Jesus, that crash footage is horrifying. No way that should ever be happening on a $60 million dollar project. John Landis would be proud of Tarantino.&&That's a heavy and sobering read. Good that she is speaking up and is calling these people out. Crazy to imagine how long this has been going on, though, and how many aspects of life that we get to see on TV are so foul and immoral under the cosmetic layers that are coming off. All the Hollywood abuse, the gymnastics scandal, the whole politics charade; brutes and sadists are in so many leading positions, it's sickening.&&>“Personally, it has taken me 47 years to stop calling people who are mean to you ‘in love’ with you. It took a long time because I think that as little girls we are conditioned to believe that cruelty and love somehow have a connection and that is like the sort of era that we need to evolve out of.”

That bit at the end is pretty poignant. This is well produced content... actually makes me miss reading magazine interviews a little bit.&&I want to read this but the article is like an obstacle course. Each paragraph is filled with shitty metaphor.  

""By Thanksgiving, Thurman had begun to unsheathe her Hattori Hanzo ...""

Ugh! Hire some journalists. The truth deserves better.&&That video of the car crash is so heartbreaking to watch. The shot is done from behind and the character is wearing shades?? WTF. that absolutely  should've been a stunt double&&Every time Thurman speaks about this issue, I am floored by her careful thought and eloquence. She tells her story like she's the actual Bride- Beatrix Kiddo. I suppose in many ways she actually is.

She was taken in, uplifted, and glorified by the same studio that betrayed her, and she considers herself the primary factor in the Hollywood industry for the assaults of so many women. &&Huge Kill Bill fan, even have a signed poster from the movie. I'll not be able to watch them again without thinking about this crash and how she was treated by Tarantino. I'm honestly shocked by these revelations and I only wish Uma the best.&&What I wanna know is why the heck there were no medical staff on set? Maybe if spinal precautions were taken and she was extricated from the vehicle properly her neck might not be injured. &&What's with the writing here? It's completely distracting and obnoxious. Like, these are some very serious and important allegations, not a short story from a creative writing class. Feels like Thurman's story is being trivialized.&&And there goes my respect for tarantino. God damnit.&&As awful as the Tarantino stuff is in this article, I also can't say I'm surprised. Half of his films feel either like Tarantino's fetish fuel. He seems to get-off on portraying human suffering (in particular, towards women).

On the other hand, I can imagine that there is a sense of shame and guilt in screwing up this badly...but you don't withhold footage of a crash you have for fifteen years if you want to make amends for a horrible accident.&&[deleted]&&""as she vaped tobacco, sipped white wine and fed empty pizza boxes into the fireplace.""

Who the hell burns their trash in the middle of NY
?!&&That ""story"" was extremely scattered and poorly written.  Journalists should stop trying to be clever and just write it in a linear, factual way&&The writer knows how to start off an article with fire and brimstone&&So QT knew and dismissed it all.


I knew it.&&It's mind boggling to me that SAG-AFTA would even allow Thurmon to drive the car in that scene. Regardless of how 'safe' the car itself is! In pure greed sense: having a major actor injured puts an entire production on hold. In common sense and common decency, get a stunt driver to do it. You couldn't see her face.

This is so fucked up.&&""...as she vaped tobacco, sipped white wine..."" lol..
What kinda NY Times journalist thinks ppl are vaping tobacco? It's only nicotine and flavouring in the e-juice. You'd think a journalist would at least do some research on this lol..&&As a reminder there's a long history of directors being negligent about the safety of their employees. 

Bay, Landis (MULTIPLE TIMES), Gary Ross have all been responsible or partially responsible for the deaths or major injuries of their cast and crew members. I don't care how much of an artist you think you are you do not have the right to treat your employees and collaborators like chattel.

*Edit and these are just modernish directors. It was even worse back in the 50s.&&Man that's double guilt, feeling impotent because you yourself are a victim and because you feel responsible for other victims. It's not her fault though. I hope she heals. I hate kill Bill and death proof, there is something off about Tarantino's treatment of women in those movies. Fuck Harvey. My heart goes out to all the victims. Uma is a marvelous actress and beautiful person inside and out. I hope she gets the closure she deserves. &&It's long past time for CAA to dissolve. Burn it to the ground just like the USA Gymnastics Board.

While it's far less sexy, ""artists"" who DGAF about limiting their degradation and abuse of others deserve to be labeled *caveat emptor*.&&Bet Tarantino never pulled that shit with Leo or and big male star. Imagine if he did this shit to Tom Cruise if he casts him in the new Manson film he'd be toast.&&I've said this elsewhere, but what's really getting to me here is that when people (finally) get to her, none of them seem to know what to do with somebody who's just been in a crash. They're letting her move her head or moving her head, they're trying to take her out of the car. Nobody has any kind of spinal immobilizer, or a fire extinguisher on standby, not so much as a first aid kit. Somebody hands her a bottle of water?!?!

 &nbsp;

She's driving a rattling old sardine can of a car on a dirt track at 40mph through woods, with absolutely no safety features and recent modifications, and there doesn't seem to be a single trained or equipped first responder within reach if anything goes wrong.

 &nbsp;

I'm absolutely flabbergasted this was possible on a multi million dollar blockbuster. He could have fucking killed her, he should be goddamn charged.&&She sounds like a hell of a woman. I thought Tarantino was gonna do Kill Bill 3? How is that gonna be possible after that event, I can't imagine him and Uma are on even remotely good terms. (bear in mind I kind of skimmed the article)&&I'm astounded by her willingness to reflect on her actions after she was assaulted. She has every right to play the victim being that she *is* the victim, but she instead uses the opportunity to wonder what she could've done differently after the fact. 

I have the utmost respect for someone who can speak openly on this and not take the opportunity to pat themselves on the back despite turning a blind eye. Good on her. I'm even more of a fan now.&&>Thurman stresses that Creative Artists Agency, her former agency, was connected to Weinstein’s predatory behavior.

Crazy. Wonder if the agency is catching more heat? If you're part of the systematic problem leading to sexual assault...&&I found this [old Rolling Stone article back in 2004](https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/a-magnificent-obsession-20040429) with an interesting note in retrospect:

> We know, for instance, that during the shooting of the Kill Bill movies, Tarantino liked to put Uma through hell on the set. In fact, David Carradine, who plays Bill, told us about a conversation he had with Uma, during which Uma said something like, ""Why does Quentin do these things to me? He's always cutting me up, and getting me covered with mud, and having me tied up and shot in the face with a shotgun. What the hell is this shit? I mean, he says he loves me, but what kind of love is that?"" This might only be a bit of light banter. But it occurs to us now that maybe some kind of weird unstated psychodrama is playing itself out in the director-muse relationship — does he secretly love her, does she secretly feel the opposite? — and we suddenly find ourselves saying, ""Do you like being around Quentin?""
> 
> ""Umm, I have in the past"" are the first words out of Uma's mouth, and we know we are on to something. But then Uma takes them back, sort of. ""Yeah, I do, of course,"" she says.
&&My condolences to Uma, she is a brilliant actress and I had a feeling when this all started she would be a major name to speak out. 

As far as Weinstein is concerned, I applaud her courage to fight back, and her current attitude towards him. She shouldn't feel *any* guilt as far as ""opening the door for him."" He is a creep and would have (or already had) done what he did regardless of his success. 

Tarantino is a matter of time. I won't lie I love his movies and think he is extremely talented, but even his interviews doing press for Pulp Fiction you could tell he was a total weirdo. The evidence presented about him spitting and choking various actresses is bad enough knowing his foot fetish...the car incident I can't even find words for. I am glad the interview included all the references in his movies and that users are posting them as well. I don't think it's crazy that a guy who inserted himself into his own movies to say ""dead nigger storage"", and play a male nurse who allows men to rape women in long-term ICU.  Then he supplanted stunt experts to choke actresses the ""right"" way, he really puts his personal fetishes into his movies.

I have been waiting for the sky to fall on Tarantino since this whole business started. That video was terrifying, and outside the ludicrous atmosphere of Hollywood most of us would be jailed for forcing someone to drive a car like that, on that road, at that speed. It would be considered reckless endangerment, forcing someone to unwillingly risk their life. 

In the best sense of the word, Uma Thurman is one bad bitch. She sold the role of The Bride because she is really that tough, and she demonstrated it by speaking out on what must be one of the toughest parts of her life. I wish her the best, and hope dearly she finds relief from her pain.

That's a whole other can of worms I hope she can avoid too. The past couple years have shown what happens to people who have to manage pain long term, and it has given us an opiate abuse epidemic.&&I am upset to learn that Tarantino was so brazen about putting her life in danger with a stunt and then refused to help her in her lawsuit against the studio. Very awful behavior. 

But I think the people on Twitter saying QT’s bad behavior is tantamount to sex assault are conflating two distinct issues. &&Good damn it Quentin..&&Hard to read. Damn. I'm sorry she's had to live with all of that. 

&&She wasn't fucking around a month or so ago when she said should would spill the beans eventually.

Good for her.&&I have a new level of respect for any of the actresses who worked under this system with these guys in its full swing of power. The actresses who are now in the 35-60 age range. Even more for the ones who are still working. I'm just like... how did you survive this? How are you not just completely drained of all love and enjoyment for working in this industry?

It reminds me to never EVER take gossip stories about ""difficult"" actresses seriously. Because damn, I have no idea how any woman who isn't an unapologetic force to be reckoned with herself has managed to maintain a spot in this industry.&&I came here to post the Deadline piece and saw this was posted. Just sickening. &&Things shouldn't happen to anyone.  The fact that someone can abuse a 'known star' tells us that the lesser actresses and actors being abused were definitely accurate.&&“I am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did. Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of ‘Kill Bill,’ a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.”
...
“I used the word ‘anger’ but I was more worried about crying, to tell you the truth,” she says now. “I was not a groundbreaker on a story I knew to be true. So what you really saw was a person buying time.”

This part was particularly sad. She blames herself. 
There’s been a good conversation we’re collectively having about hypocrisy and complacency amongst those in Hollywood, but it is really complicated when you’re in that position of vulnerability or have been victimized. It’s so hard to speak up, and we’ve been conditioned to think this behavior is ok or normal or just what you should come to expect. &&That crash footage too..&&Really explains why Kill Bill 3 was never made :/&&It's just so psychotic. It's as if her body was reacting to things her mind refused to reveal. It's very much like war, no time at all to process what transpired while the IEDs say, ""I didn't blow up. It's all in your head"".

Good on Thurman for standing up to the insanity. Enough is fucking enough.&&Before this came out she gave a red carpet interview that I can only describe as haunting. You can see the barely contained rage in her as she tries to describe why she can't talk about what happened yet. &&I think he just had it in his head that it needed to be Uma and when she resisted he got pissed off because she was saying no. So then he pushed harder so the thing he wanted could happen. It’s immature and stupid, and damn near got her killed&&I’m guessing he did it for the same reason he had to have a 19th century guitar in the Hateful Eight that ended up getting destroyed- he thinks it lends some kind of otherwise-unattainable authenticity to the shot even though no one else would have known the difference.&&>I don't get why Quentin was so adamant about her driving it

I suspect that that's one of the things that probably changed in the last few years. After a few recent deaths on set, I think the industry put more of a focus on safety. 

Why did Tarantino make her do it? Probably because he wanted the shot. &&Glad that her 'comeback' is starting this year. She's got 4 movies coming out after barely being in any for 5+ years.&&I find interesting that Tarintino seemed visibly upset when confronted by Ethan Hawke but continued to fight with Thurman after the incident. If he was upset, why wouldn't he simply apologize and atone his actions to Thurman for the situation he put her in?&&She didn't feel disempowered by *Tarantino's treatment of her* **until the crash**. Quentin's behaviour around Weinstein's assault was enough of a reason for Uma to trust him. But he wasn't acting like a friend, or ally during the filming, and in that moment, she realized that she was the odd side of the triangle.&&[deleted]&&He's probably a fan of Dario Argento who always uses his own hands for murder scenes.&&[deleted]&&Yes I loved that movie! She was amazing in that move. What a performance. &&More recently, her brief scene in Nymphomaniac was incredible. I'm not in the least surprised she knows how to channel anger.&&That crash was tough to watch knowing she didn't want to do it and said so multiple times. &&That video was hard to watch. Also, there was no reason it couldn't have been a stunt driver. You literally never see her face! Just to know that something was wrong ahead of time, have to go through with it and then crash. I just can't imagine going through that. &&Yup that was ridiculous. I could see a director getting away with pressuring an actress into doing that in the '70s but wasn't Kill Bill filmed in the early 00's? How on earth did Tarantino get around all of the safety protocols that film studios put into place SPECIFICALLY to avoid situations like this (actors suing the ever-loving shit out of them)? Is it because they were filming in Mexico? Sheesh. I'll still enjoy my re-watches of Kill Bill but that particular scene may be coloured a different way from now on.&&[Link to the video](https://streamable.com/xuvf8)&&“The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,” she says. “I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to walk again,’” she says. “When I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn’t feel he had tried to kill me.”
&&I got confused when the article changed from weinstein to kill Bill car crash story &&Also knowing that they ACTUALLY spit on her for Kill Bill. 

I mean, I know QT has a penchant for choking - he won't let his actors/actresses fake it - but spit? That's a bit much imo.&&Just watched this. Where the fuck is the paramedic?! Where the fuck is the ambulance?! Who the fuck is that moron who decided to pick a woman up and carry her in his arms after she just suffered a fucking head on collision with a tree?! Who’s fucking idea was that? She could have had severe spinal injuries, she needed to have been collared and boarded and lifted from that vehicle by trained medical professionals. No wonder she still has neck problems, she’s lucky she can still walk. 

Tarantino has created some of my absolute all time favourite films. Fuck him. Fuck him for, at the very least, his astonishingly appalling management of this emergency situation. And if her account of how this came about is true, then fuck him all the way to Hell.&&And to keep the footage from her, presumably to stop the lawsuit they knew they would lose if it went to court.&&That Hanzo sword hilt prop to her right might have very easily been driven under her jaw if her head had bounced a little more to the right as she hit bumpy road before the crash.&&So is the idea that this crash was intentional?  I heard another story about a young actress in True Lies and the stunt man abusing her.  She got hurt on set filming a stunt.  Way to keep victims quiet?  &&Thats the worst part aboiut any forn of sexual assault- the wish that you'd been able to do more at the time. It haunts you and it haunts your dreams. To this day i have dreams where i try to scream and can't.

I have so much pride for the women who are making their stories public. It doesnt take the pain away but you hope that it stops some other young woman from goung through the same thing.&&Seriously, I want to know who the hell that actor is. &&Unfortunately, I think a lot of women who have been in Uma's shoes share this reaction. &&I feel like I'd already mentally prepared myself to find out something pretty shitty about Tarantino. It just seemed like a matter of time kind of thing, y'know? &&Not only was he an asshole to Uma on set, to the point of putting her life in danger (seriously, fuck the idea that you have to treat your crew like shit for the sake of ""authenticity"", I don't care how much of a genius filmmaker you are) but he continued to work with Weinstein for every one of his films after Uma told him what was happening. Despite the fact that by the time Kill Bill came out, Tarantino was a big enough brand in his own right, Weinstein or no Weinstein. Hell, this article references Weinstein basically crediting Pulp Fiction for *his* success, not the other way around. Tarantino didn't need him. Surely there were other producers who would be happy to be involved with one of his films. But he kept working with Weinstein until the allegations came out, and now his Manson film is gonna come from some other company. 

Tarantino is a great filmmaker but god, what a hypocritical, self-serving asshole. &&Seems more like an asshole than a creep, based on this story.&&Yeah honestly the surprising thing here is that the story about him isn't *worse*. I'm not saying it isn't terrible though.&&In regards to the Q and U relationship, it does indicate it took ""years"" for a reconciliation but it may have already happened. He is still a dick for making her do that stunt. And a creep for everything else.&&Probably tore the car apart to get the camera rig and whatever lighting may have been used exactly where he wanted it. &&Borrowed from my previous comment: 
I've been on a lot of movies with vintage picture cars. And they're always a pain. The director always wants a specific car from a specific era and the only one of it production can find is in a less than driveable condition. It's been worn down, poorly kept or modified in a strange way.  
But production wants to keep chugging to get the movie done. So we deal. 
Also it's just good form to usually not have the actor drive unless necessary, because that's your investment right there. If some terrible freak accident happens you don't want your talent out of commission for weeks or months, because that's a lot of money down the drain &&> Dumb question: why was the car used in Kill Bill so shoddy that a stunt driver should have driven it?

A stunt driver should drive a car that is properly repurposed and padded with protective material where possible. After all, they are driving with 40mph through a narrow palm forest on a sandy road. That is ridiculously dangerous on itself. That is exactly what stunt drivers are for.

It's insanity that they wanted her to drive - while only the back of her head is visible.&&What I see from the footage is that she is driving a heavy old FW drive car down a -winding- dirt road.  QT says the road is straight but it is obviously not. 

  If you've never driven a car like that on a dirt road, they fishtail very easily, especially on a downgrade.  Just looks like she only had to over compensate once and that was it.

  She should have made QT drive that car first.&&I think the author is trying to convey how traumatic the experience was for Uma. You get some degree of clarification immediately after from Herman, who describes Thurman as dishevelled and shaken after seeing Weinstein, the implication being something went down. It’s a bit idk the word, not dramatic because that sounds condescending but unfortunate certainly, since people aren’t really looking for abstract expression when it comes to cases surrounding blatant abuses of power. It’s important to note that it’s Herman who says Uma told her Weinstein threatened her, not Uma herself. I think that in itself would have been enough to show how much her encounter with Weinstein threw her off. Herman remembers and shares what she saw but Uma doesn’t.&&[deleted]&&Yeah one of the many reasons the writer is really the wrong person for this article. Did she say she can't remember what happened? Did she trail off and say she'd rather not talk about it?&&Her memory stops there because that's what happens when victims of severe trauma (like rape or assault) experience further trauma, especially from their abuser. It's like the brain's defense mechanism against going insane.&&And there's a creepy connection here. The daughter of the actor who died in the Twilight Zone set accident is........Jennifer Jason Leigh (Hateful 8)&&> brutes and sadists are in so many leading positions

Unfortunately, those are the exact people that seek power. It would be better if we could find good leaders that don't want the job and tell them ""too bad. Your the leader now."" Unsure how that would be accomplished. &&[deleted]&&>“Pulp Fiction” made Weinstein rich and respected, and Thurman says he introduced her to President Barack Obama at a fund-raiser as the reason he had his house.

And what the fuck does that sentence mean?&&Came here to say this. The article is a mess, jumping from one point to another in the same sentences. Then a quote from Thurman, then the journalist babbling something about her couch and kids? &&Dear god yes, this was so frustrating. I'm thinking this should be treated seriously, get to the point and tell us Uma's story. Nobody is clicking to check out the writer's oh so great metaphorical capabilities, it's not a novel.&&That's what they get for laying off all those copy editors. &&The writer is terrible. Ronan should've written it. It doesn't help that Uma's own words are a bit screenplay like, but the writer put in so much nonsense to such a serious topic.&&Kill Bill is my girlfriend's favorite movie of all time, partially because of the female empowerment it showed. This is gonna break her a bit.&&The whole scene is just ridiculous. A proper educated stuntman should decline to drive a car in such a condition through a palm forest on a sandy road.

Let alone the actor.&&It was written by Maureen Dowd. She has been doing 'distracting' and 'obnoxious' op/eds for The NY Times for decades now. I truly wish they had just let Thurman write own story. &&I think it's because the author knows the weight of this story so they have tried *way* too hard to make their mark as an author. 

I think if you're a journalist you have to understand some stories are bigger than your reputation as a journalist. We don't care if you write prose well, we care about what you are uncovering for us. If you do that succinctly and use good writing to tie points together and help paint clearly, then you're a very successful author. If you use your position to try and flair out and show off writing styles then you take yourself too seriously. &&I didn't need the overabundance of  prose at all either

I had to re-read that clunker of a run-on sentence about four times before I could grasp what it was trying to tell me.

&&Personally, I'm not that much fan of Maureen Dowd. She's another one of the, ""defend Bill Clinton by trashing Monica Lewinsky,"" writers from the 90s.

Poor Lindsay Lohan...&&Not to mention the fact that women who rebuff or otherwise reject unwanted and inappropriate advances are often labeled as difficult because of things the other party says about them after the declination.&&Yeah it's crazy. and the thing is ... ALL industries are like this to some extent&&The sad part is there's not more talk like this. Thurman is brilliant. She's long had a reputation for being sharp and ambitious. We can see it here. She's not just hopping on the bandwagon. She's not just riding the coattails of the movement. She's expressing how she's been grappling with these issues for years and tentatively opening up about them in an environment that she's hoping to be safe. And I think it is a safe one for her. Few people would condemn her for what she's said.


But as I said, what's sad is there's not more talk like this. You can be complicit in a crime and a victim of a crime at the same time. You can be part of a toxic environment even as the environment poisons you as well. It happens all the time. 


When an employee sees their boss being bigoted but doesn't speak up because it's not targeted at them. 


When a kid who gets beaten at home goes to school and bullies someone else.


When someone gets molested and their sense of personal boundaries degrades to the point that they don't know what counts as appropriate contact and what doesn't.



When a kid in a gang gets pushed around every day but then still does what they say because without those guys they wouldn't have anyone.


Happens in the military, in prisons, in universities, in all kinds of workplaces and industries. You can be damn sure it happens in politics. One of the problems with any legal reform is politicians spend decades working their way to high offices, salivating at the chance to ""get theirs"". So when they spend 30 years as interns, assistants, coffee fetchers, advisors, etc, they don't want to degrade the very power they've been sacrificing for all along by doing the right thing.


It's the same in Hollywood. When you play nice with the corruption you get treated well. When you give them offerings or keep quiet on their behavior or cover for them or defend them publicly, they reward you. When a dozen people are willing to sink to new lows for a chance at the big time, what choice do the people with standards have? What if Thurman *had* spoken up? Would we even care what she has to say today? Or would she be a ""washed-up has-been"" after an industry blacklisting ended her career?


The harder question is, how much did she want to speak up? She was treated badly, but if you told someone *""I'll give you millions of dollars and make you famous but you have to go to Harvey Weinstein's hotel room and try to deflect his advances,""* do you think they would do it? A lot of people would. A lot of people would outright sleep with Weinstein for money and status. And that's not a hypothetical. We **know** now that people did this and that people still do this with other powerful people.


Where does that fit into things? How can we accurately model a situation that complex?


There's a lot of unspoken dimensions to this whole movement and Thurman touches on several of them, but most people just keep carrying on about the single facet at the forefront of it all, ignoring all the rest.&&> “I was ultimately compliant,” she remembers. “I tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.”

This part here is particularly hard hitting for me on a personal level. “I was ultimately compliant”, because what choice is there? You feel guilt for letting it happen but if she had fought back, if her hands were bloody or bruised would it have made any difference or stopped it happening?&&Especially when you know speaking out could make you even more vulnerable to people who have already harmed you. There’s a victim mentality where the people who hurt you seem even more powerful than they are. When you realize it takes at least 2-5 minutes for police to arrive at a house and it takes only seconds for you to be murdered, the safest thing to do is always comply. &&You can't really blame her either. People commonly accuse women of lying no matter what.&&Very telling that Tarantino fought with Uma right after the crash and refused to give her that footage for 15 years, but when her husband approached him, he asked him for his forgiveness. Only to then turn around and do all the degrading stuff to Uma during filming like choking her and spitting on her.&&Ethan Hawks seems like a solid dude&&I shouldn't have seen that, it just breaks my heart the level of violence women confront in Hollywood. It's crazy&&Well now I'm not sad about it, because I hope Uma Thurman doesn't have to work with him or Miramax again in the future, unless she actually wants to.&&Also explains why she's never worked with Tarantino again since then&&Hah, I remember they asked Quentin this many times and he would sorta pause and say ""Well, maybe, but I need to find the right place and the script has to be just right to justify their return.""

Now we know the much simpler answer. Uma is done with QT and KB.&&that or you know... [she killed Bill](#spoiler)&&He really seems like a narcissist, the kind of person who doesn't care whether or not this is a good idea as much as whether or not this is his idea.

If he wanted to use a stunt double or film it with a fake background in studio and she wanted to do it herself outside, you bet he'd fight tooth and nail to have it his way.&&Pretty much. It's all about perspective right? He needs her to do this shot and doesn't see it as a big deal. She doesn't want to. From both perspectives the other person is being difficult and it's just a fight until the other gives in. &&But to be fair Curt wasn't supposed to destroy it. They litterally paid to rent it for a day and he ended up destroying it which he wasn't supposed to. You can tell. At Least in the 3 hour roadshow version that the people were looking past the camera because they didn't know what to do. Not qt's fault. &&Its so sad how Weinstein destroyed so many talented actresses careers. I wish him nothing but the worst.&&So glad!! I want all these actresses to have the comebacks they deserve.&&Something tells me her massive decline in her career post-Kill Bill has something to do with Weinstein too.&&My guess would be a mix of sexism and being too stubborn or too much of an asshole to admit his faults.&&He doesn't respect women is my guess. &&Not that this excuses the behavior, but a lot of people have a hard time admitting they're wrong, especially to the person they wronged. Add the fact that he's a perfectionist/narcissist and the troubles multiply.&&I feel like I now know what the next big shocking reveal about a Hollywood celebrity is going to be...&&Wow, that's incredibly weird

This is gross.&&The strangling one kind of made sense at the time hearing it since it was a potential liability and you don't want to do it more than once...having the director do it the way he sees fit didn't really set of alarm bells.

The spitting thing though? What the fuck? Why would you even use anyone's spit? Or if you absolutely have to be realistic with it to a fault, why not have it be the guy actually filming the scene with her?&&IIRC In that instance he said he wanted to be the one choking her because “choking always looks fake” in movies.  

I mean, he should’ve just let a stunt person do it (as well as choke Uma in Kill Bill) but I understand why he would do it, the (pretentious) perfectionist that he is.  I don’t think it’s as devious as the article makes it out to be.  &&Or Hitchcock, who infamously terrorized Tippi Hedren (among others) on the set of his movies.&&Didn't Dario's daughter Asia Argento appear nude in at least one of his films too? Pretty creepy IMO&&Are both Quentin & Dario doing it in the case of the deaths of male characters as well?&&Based on his work, he's clearly a fan of Argento's work. 

And speaking of Weinstein victims, Dario Argento's daughter Asia is one of them too! &&Even more fucked up knowing they were keeping the footage away from her for 15 years.

&&Now we know the real reason Kill Beatrix was never made. After that stunt she would be stupid to trust Tarantino again. &&>That crash was tough to watch knowing she didn't want to do it and said so multiple times. 

Reminds me of how Owen Hart died. Kept saying he didn't want to do a stunt he wasn't trained for, but eventually caved to pressure that should never have been put on him.&&Someone explain why tarratino would keep the video away from her cause it makes no sense&&Yeah for real, I thought I'd wait with watching the vid till I'd read the article - made it all only harder.&&So what was their reasoning for not using a stunt woman?&&The sheer lack of safety and care for stunt doubles/workers is another super dirty secret in Hollywood. Every couple of years, another stunt worker will get killed, and that's not including the ones who get severely hurt who don't even make the news.

It almost started to open up a bit after a camera assistant got ran over by a train a few years ago, but Hollywood managed to quash that story beyond the one week news cycle.

There's a scene in the cartoon ""Cats Don't Dance"" that had the big finale about the animals not getting drowned in a massive flood due to some epic movie.

Only it was based on a real silent movie called Noah's Arc

During the filming of the climactic flood scene, the great volume of water used was so overwhelming (600,000 gallons) that three extras drowned, one was so badly injured that his leg needed to be amputated, and a number suffered broken limbs and other serious injuries, which led to implementation of stunt safety regulations the following year.[3] Dolores Costello caught a severe case of pneumonia. Thirty-five ambulances attended the wounded.[4]&&My opinion of Tarantino went way, way, way down from reading this article. I'm glad to learn that he did confront Weinstein when he heard about this stuff, but he also lied about not having access to the footage of the crash scene that he forced Thurman to film.

On the other hand, my opinion of Ethan Hawke has massively improved.

>“The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under me,” she says. “I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to walk again,’” she says. “When I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn’t feel he had tried to kill me.”

>Even though their marriage was spiraling apart, Hawke immediately left the Abbey of Gethsemani in Kentucky to fly to his wife’s side.

>“I approached Quentin in very serious terms and told him that he had let Uma down as a director and as a friend,” he told me. He said he told Tarantino, “Hey, man, she is great actress, not a stunt driver, and you know that.” Hawke added that the director “was very upset with himself and asked for my forgiveness.”

Good Guy Ethan Hawke.&&Tarintino does a lot of childish shit for ""authenticity"". He remains successful and no one died so he doesn't have to grow the fuck up.&&Especially when you can't even see her face in the shot, could have been avoided completely. &&I think it was showing that Tarantino, put in the awkward position of having a multi-film lineup with Miramax and a lead actress telling him the producer on his films had sexually assaulted her, chose the less-risky-to-his-career route of brushing away her concerns. Then, as if that weren't enough, he then humiliated and endangered her health/life on the set of his next film.&&That wasn't the part that weirded me out, it was that he insisted that *he* had to be the one to do it. It couldn't be Michael Madsen, it had to be *him*.&&I didn't know this. I knew about him performing the choking in Inglorious Basterds, but I always took it as a fucked up Tarantino version of Mel Gibson drawing Jesus's line in the sand himself.

But after this article, I feel like I'm going to have a hard time watching Kill Bill again.&&He also was one of the several people of Hollywood that tried to get Roman Polanski back in America.&&Yes, because he's a piece of shit.&&[deleted]&&Wanting to spit on and choke an actress himself, because ""he knows exactly what he wants"" from the scene definitely falls in the creepy category for me. &&He can be both.&&Dude has some hardcore fetishes, which definitely spill over into his movies.&&Nah homie, that's not how we do.
Any rigging we do the exterior of the car is purely done off mounting points on the car's body.
Grip and Electric doesn't in anyway change the functionality of the car for any reason. 
The real more likely reason: I've been on a lot of movies with vintage picture cars. And they're always a pain. The director always wants a specific car from a specific era and the only one of it production can find is in a less than driveable condition. It's been worn down, poorly kept or modified in a strange way. 
But production wants to keep chugging to get the movie done. So we deal.

Also there is literally no lighting modifications in the image you're seeing. It's just camera mounted on the hood of the car. &&Fair!

I guess I'm just so use to tiny 4K video cameras being stuck on cars with a magnet and having the high ISO performance and image quality that gets damn near film. Back in 2004, you would have had to stick 600lb of Panavision film camera on the back of a shoddy 30 year old VW...

So it sorta makes sense. &&I know this isn't the issue either, and there is a career in stunt acting, but I used to work at a fancy private hospital in the LA area in physical therapy. A lot of our patients were stunt actors. A lot who would never have total range of motion or mobility again.  Perhaps this is the next big reveal in careers that result in irreparable physical damage, after this football fiasco. It never seemed right to me how much these people suffered while their famous counterparts were taking in enough money for multimillion dollar beach homes. &&I would hazard a guess as to her giving in due to the threats of him ruining her career if she didn't.&&That’s an assumption that could have been clearer if the writer had done a better job.&&I don't know why people dispute this.  None of us can remember all the details of a non-threatening event that happened yesterday, let alone a traumatic one that happened years ago.  That's how memory works.&&Is it the helicopter one?&&Honestly had no idea JJL was Vic Morrow's daughter. Wow. &&Weinstein introduced Thurman to Obama not as Uma Thurman but as the reason he could afford his house, because he made so much money from her work. It’s not written well at all.

Of course there are accidents but that one just crosses the line entirely.&&Broke his leg attempting a stunt for the latest film I believe.&&[deleted]&&I would assume he has to go through some kind of training or certification to be able to do this stuff on set. Because him being hurt could be a major liability as he is the star of the films.

For those rare occasions things did indeed change people's mind we should be grateful. 

Uma did a good thing by talking about this now, because we need nuance, and we collectively need to be reminded. &&I work at a grocery store. As a cashier the environment was very fun and sexualized. I thought it was all jokes and fun. Until I heard some of the young teenage boys complaining about the stares and comments they got from a 40 year old man. 
I said things and done things that crossed the lines and didn't think about it till then. 
I went to managment when I heard this man tried to buy sex from a 16yr old. They tried to fire me. And they still are. 
I made it ok because I joined in. But it wasn't ok and I made it hard for people to go to work. So, I know what you mean. &&I've been thinking about this for a long while. It's so complex and intricate. Who would want to speak up when they actively benefited even as a victim?


Let's say Mary Maryson was approached at a young age by a predatory producer. She had a few TV spots or commercials, but was trying to transition into bigger projects. This guy wants to see if she ""has it"" and says if she gets naked he'll know.


We're all aware she's a victim, 100%. Whether or not she agrees to some naked alone time, she's been put into a position by this producer and/or her agency against her will. What was supposed to be purely a job interview/audition is now a sexual situation.


But, on the line is the lead role in a *very* promising, big budget film and another big production with awards implications. If all things go well, even if the movies don't do well, it's better than  some BK commercial or even a one episode, two line part in a USA procedural. She's got a big project reel almost immediately.


It's disgusting, it's despicable, this producer is a garbage human...but it's *damn* tempting.


Well, now Mary Maryson is an A-lister with awards and accolades, respect of her peers and a huge fanbase. Does she want to open up that rapey can of worms for herself and relive that? Does she want to reveal to her fans and the public that she fucked Harvey Weinstein for a big job? Of course not! She worked hard for where she is, she acts her ass off, she auditioned, she researched her roles. Somehow being given the option of a dick-suck instead of an audition is seen as a ""shortcut"" or a cheat.


In a way, for her peers, it is. If they turned down the same proposition, they feel they missed an opportunity they could have earned in the audition room. There's a twisted sort of self-loathing and regret for everyone involved. *Am I really jealous of an assault victim?* or *Would I give up this career to not be a victim?* It's all sorts of levels.


Reading Salma Hayek's story was one that really struck me. She worked on the Frida project, she did *everything* to get this movie made. Connected every dot, networked, got the funding, everything asked, and Weinstein keeps moving the goalposts. Finally the production is up and running, the cast and crew are working and Weinstein says ""Now have a threeway on camera or this entire thing gets shut down and it's your fault.""

What. The. Fuck.


She has to weigh her career and her dignity and her relationships with friends and coworkers and the whole passion project. It feels as if it's *all on her*. Just because some fat fuck wants to see her naked. Plenty of people hearing that would have told her not to worry about it, plenty too would have said just to do the scene. Awful.&&> You can be complicit in a crime and a victim of a crime at the same time. You can be part of a toxic environment even as the environment poisons you as well.

If I understood him properly, this is one of Chappelle's major points from his most recent special. It's not something I'd thought of and also not something I think people want to or are ready to hear.&&Yep, and somehow the general public can’t have a conversation that complex.  It’s a black and white, hero and villain story that they want because it’s easy. &&I just hope that we don’t forget about those who aren’t celebrities. This movement has brought such great awareness and strengthened many people to come forward against these monsters. But what about those who feel they may not have a voice? People in our local communities? My fiancé assists at a DV shelter and some of the things humans will do to each other is enough to make you want to vomit, cry then crawl into a hole and never come back out. We can all make a difference though. Speak up for someone or let someone know when you know there’s abuse happening or someone is being hurt. Monsters love the dark, they love indifference and inaction.  These things make monsters stronger. So lets shine the brights on them. Please, don’t forget about the people in your local communities, families, neighbors, Co workers, etc. &&I learned at a very young age that compliance can be the only way to protect yourself from further harm - it's easier to recover from an assault when you don't have a concussion or bruised bones. It's another aspect that survivors have to tackle. Especially if you're living with an abuser, compliance may be beaten into you. On the flip side, when it's a stranger assaulting you the threat of violence is more *visceral*, honestly. You have no idea of their boundaries, no idea how much they may hurt you and there's the risk of death as well...it's twisted but with long-term abuse you've become accustomed generally how to limit the pain. That vestige of ""routine"" is something you can only shed and empower yourself after tackling that guilt. 

Either way, no, fighting back doesn't guarantee that she could have stopped the assault, but exponentially increases the odds of a more brutal attack. (Of course my view is biased by my own experience but I think it's the experience of a significant proportion of survivors from what I've seen/heard/read )
&&No and it could have just ensured she was further physically injured. 
 In her mind she didn't do enough to stop her body from being violated.  She felt guilt, and shame at the absence of blood on her knuckles because in her mind it was proof in that moment that she was somehow complicit in what happened.  &&That is such bizarre behavior for a director and way over the line. I am pretty forgiving of odd things happening in the creative process, but it seems so strange that a director would want to take the place of an actor to spit in the face of another actor. It doesn't make sense other than Tarantino wanting to spit in her face because he got off on it.
&&>Very telling that Tarantino fought with Uma right after the crash and refused to give her that footage for 15 years,

I just realized what convenient timing this is for him to suddenly just ""beneficently"" hand that over.

Maybe with the recent Weinstein/Miramax stuff he's shitting himself because he just realized that Thurman has a lot of dirt on him, actual dirt on him beyond the foot fetish crap that everyone knows about.&&Not that it’s any better, but from what I understand the spitting and choking came before the car crash.&&I’m having a hard time finding anything about the choking and spitting. I do recall the choking of Diane Kruger in Inglorious Basterds looking authentic and her looking genuinely hurt and scared. &&If I read the story correctly, the crash happened with 4 days left on the shoot. That other behavior was implied to have happened before the crash. &&Brad Pitt also stepped up.

Anybody else?&&After this article, there's now a 0% chance she does Kill Bill 3.&&It's sad because it pretty much tanked her career and fucked up her body. She doesn't have to work with him again, but seems like the damage is already done in more ways than one.&&KB is almost 15 years old, and as much as I love QT's movies, they are not nearly was good as when Sally Menke was editing them.&&She did what??&&the fact he forced her to do the car secene, combined with him being the one spitting and choking (he was also the one who choked the woman in inglorious bastards) kind of makes me think he was actually getting his kicks off this shit and maybe even did this to thurman as payback for trying to go after weinstein previously. 

Makes me really reconsider being a fan of his art if he uses the power he has to be abusive towards female actors. &&That surprised me. I thought they were really good friends&&I just don't see why it was necessary to have a historical guitar for that shot in the first place.  It's a movie, not a documentary, the movie gains nothing by having an authentic 19th century guitar compared to a well-done replica.

And Kurt was working under this assumption.  He believed it was a prop, because these things usually are when it comes to films.  It was Tarantino's responsibility to say ""hey, this is an authentic piece of history, so please be very careful with it"".  Tarantino is fully to blame.&&So what's going to happen to that asshole? I'm not up to date on that situation.&&The trauma of everything also took a massive toll on her, physically and mentally. &&I don't think he ever learned how to talk to and respect women fully.&&It's not going to be a ""shocking"" reveal since that choking story has been out for years and everyone just went ""oh, that's Quentin for ya!"". 

&&Yeah but it's not shocking because we all know Tarantino spends all his free time watching disgusting porn and paying hooker to insult his dick while he ties them up with jumper cables or something&&Except most of the reveals weren't shocking to the people who already knew about them for years and let it go on&&I can't remember if it was a quote from someone famous or if it was a comment on reddit, but I remember someone once said that they're so happy Tarantino makes movies, because otherwise, he'd be a serial killer. I don't think it'll be a shocking reveal about Quentin.&&>""Quentin said, 'He's not going to do it right, it'll either be too much or too little.

Is that something they are trained to do?&&Supposedly he was pretty OK with his actors generally, actually. Tippi Hedren was an exception because he was pissed she rejected his advances.

Also, Tarantino is not a fan of Hitchcock.&&Kubrick too, with Shelley Duvall on The Shining&&Asia has also gone on record with her own horrifying Weinstein account&&QT did a close up of the ear getting chopped off in Reservoir Dogs, with his hands not Madsen's, but it didnt make final edit. &&Yes&&That, and they agreed to release the footage to her earlier on the condition that she would have had to sign a waiver releasing the studio of liabity for future pain and suffering. 

What a crock of horse shit. &&I’d like to add this part to the list of fucked up things about it: 

> “Quentin finally atoned by giving it to me after 15 years, right?” she says. “Not that it matters now, with my permanently damaged neck and my screwed-up knees.”

She’s going to live the rest of her life with the physical pain the stunt caused her. &&Can someone explain why they'd do that? Just to spite her? Insurance stuff? Not wanting to be sued?

Just seems like such an odd thing to me.&&Wouldn't be surprised if it came out that this is why. &&Also it was a dumb idea. But yes.&&Also the guy from twilight zone... had a fear of helicopters and didn’t want to do the scene that ultimately killed him.&&Because it makes him look bad. &&It's visually shocking (no blood nor life-threatening injuries, but quite brutal). This stuff easily gets to people and Tarantino probably didn't want such footage to affect his career. This video gonna buzz now.&&Probably because Quentin wants everything to be ""authentic"" not sure why it would end in a giant fight because it's a pretty easy shot to make with a stunt person&&Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double in Harry Potter is permanently wheelchair bound because of his work on the final movie. I can't find if it was because of negligence or just bad luck, but it happens quite a lot, and you almost never hear about it.&&The whole thing with the camera assistant getting run over is fucking tragic. I used to work for the railroad and can tell you that every producer and director of that film should be guilty of manslaughter.

Why did these people think they could get away with filming on a railroad bridge without the permission of the railroad?! That's completely fucked up.&&While the ""Midnight Rider"" train incident may have fallen off the national radar, it remained in the local news, and the director served a year in prison. Not disagreeing with anything you said, just adding some info. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Rider_(film)&&Ethan Hawke was pretty terrible to Uma too, later on - cheating on her with the nanny, not to mention going on Howard Stern and talking about how childbirth changed her genitals… I wouldn't be so quick to saint him.

(And this isn't to say that Ethan Hawke is the devil or even a worse-than-average person, really. Just that he did what you'd sort of expect someone in his place to.)&&I guarantee QT knew some of the stuff Weinstein was up to...and he still asked him to be a producer for Kill Bill.&&It’s interesting how it sounds like Tarantino was angry and defensive after getting confronted by the victim herself, and only remorseful to her husband after getting confronted by...her husband. If there’s any example of an old boys club, that’s it right here&&He confronted him, but then he never really did anything. He carried on working with him, and even ignored knowing about him assaulting several other actresses.

Ask John Landis. &&Really? What other examples come to mind? (If you don't mind me asking)&&That makes sense Thanks &&He also *had* to choke Diane Kruger in Inglorious Basterds. Like Christoph Waltz could’ve done it but Tarantino said that it’s about trust or some shit.

Dude probably jacks off to those scenes.&&He did the same to Diane Kruger during filming of Inglorious Bastards. I pretended I understood why because it definitely made the scene - wasn't a half-assed effort you normally see.

But, damnit QT.....&&Because he has a weird fetish, let's be real&&[deleted]&&Did Meryl Streep get on that bandwagon too? I mean, it wasn't just QT. 
&&Ah yes, the four-foot Pole you wouldn't want to touch with a ten-foot pole.&&To be more specific, I'd say he is an extreme narcissist, perfectionist, and almost certainly on the socio/psychopath spectrum. I'm sure there are plenty of times he has crossed some lines when making his movies, one that comes to mind is when he ""safely"" strangled Diane Kruger because faking it looked too fake in his opinion.&&Okay, yeah, that's creepy.&&I feel like calling his desire to abuse women a 'fetish' kind of downplays it. &&There's like a half dozen shots in Death Proof alone that exist solely because of his foot fetish. I always noticed his foot stuff growing up, but man, rewatching Death Proof made me realize how damn gratuitous it is. 

I've nothing against people's kinks so long as they're safe, but anymore those scenes just immediately pull me out of his movies. Like he's leaping out from behind the screen to be like, ""Hey, you all wanted this right? I did.""&&this is the correct answer.&&Yes. &&Thanks for explaining that, I couldn't wrap my head around it on the first read.&&It would definitely work better in the passive tense.

>Pulp Fiction” made Weinstein rich and respected, and Thurman says **she was introduced by him** to President Barack Obama at a fund-raiser as the reason he had his ~~house~~ [X million dollar mansion].&&I think it's to show that she has positive male relationships and thus the anger is not directed at all men, but very specific individuals. Without mentioning her father, her attitude could be written off as being a man-hater, especially since every other relationship mentioned is not a good one (Weinstein, Tarantino and Hawke - he might have come to help her, but they were estranged at the time and divorced now).&&People are now just discovering the gauzy writing of Maureen Dowd. Her election columns are funny but the NYT editorial page is one of the most atrophied opinion places on the planet. They could benefit from clearing house and hiring some newer, fresher writers&&I was honestly thinking ""who the fuck wrote this?"" the whole time reading it.

I definitely wouldn't consider myself any kind of writing expert, but that all felt so sloppy. &&It was his ankle, but the point stands. It was crazy to see too. &&Tom Cruise being a nut has probably only elevated his acting/stunt performances, I know he's fun to shit on but the guy is easily one of the top 5 most consistent action stars out there.

All of it very dangerous. &&Yeah some folks end up more fragile than they were before. My gf’s mom’s bf is a veteran with serious ptsd, and he is one of the nicest most humble people ive ever met, but he is unsettled by clocks.&&honestly? Most movements fail because a tipping point is reached where people are not allowed to be honest and wrong in public. You're only allowed to recycle a *very* specific perspective. And so while awareness goes up...it actually perpetuates the problem that people need to get shit off their chest...and if generationally we don't speak about problems often, we wont speak about problems well.

Even the metoo stuff will hit a critical time where there is too much momentum in criticizing comments vs voicing comments. No one is allowed to be in public, earnest, and wrong. 

..and that hurts us because it strips failure out of the conversation as a method of teaching lessons.&&I think a lot of private discussions *will* touch on many of the nuances. Publicly however, in mainstream media and social networks, it seems that a) everything that is voiced will need to be politically correct and safe, so it will always follow the dominating narrative, and b) the most clickbaity titles will win the screaming contest. If you google Uma Thurman right now, at the top will be a tweet ""Uma Thurman was and is a powerful actress, and yet Weinstein still felt free to assault her, Tarantino bullied her into driving an unsafe car and then spat on her and choked her, and her agency didn't protect her."" So there you got it -- all nuances of the spitting and choking being part of the movie scene are lost (nuances which don't necessarily excuse Tarantino having done it, but which would be the basis for a discussion of how far a director may get involved in such scenes).

Reddit is often part of the problem, bubbling up the mob voice through upvotes while suppressing minority opinions with downvotes. We as society may need to establish communication systems that counter such effects if we want more nuances... yet, the economy of clickbait titles *working* because the most quick attention delivers the most ad views is making that hard... and having a quick downvote button when seeing opposing viewpoints doesn't help either.&&He is also the one that choked Diane Kruger during inglorious basterds.&&It’s no secret Tarantino had an attraction to her around the time Kill Bill was being filmed. I remember hearing rumors that a cut of the movie exists that was only shots of her feet, as he’s a foot fetishist. I always saw them as professional partners, as a power team making something cool together. This is heartbreaking.&&Spit on AND choke. &&Gives that weird scene in From Dusk Til Dawn where he drinks beer from Selma Hayek's foot an even more perverse feel when you know he has a foot fetish. &&I think the simpler explanation is that he didn't own the footage, Miramax did. As long as Weinstein controlled Miramax, Tarantino risked a legal battle with Miramax if he gave it to Thurman. Tarantino clearly has reason for shame here but that doesn't explain the timing. Weinstein being forced out does explain the timing.&&Doesn't read that way to me. But maybe I'm wrong.

""On February 20, 2014, the film crew, under the direction of producer/director Randall Miller, started filming a dream sequence involving William Hurt as Gregg Allman on a heavy metal hospital bed on a live railroad trestle above the Altamaha River. The producers had assured the cast and crew that it was safe to film there. While they were shooting, a train came around a corner at 58 mph (93 km/h; 26 m/s), giving the crew less than a minute to evacuate from the location, a substantial way out onto the trestle. The only escape route was toward the oncoming train. Video of the crew indicates that they were unaware how fast it was approaching; some attempted to remove camera equipment and the metal bed from the trestle. They failed to remove the bed before the braking train rolled through, and many of the crew were trapped out on the trestle. The train struck and shattered the metal bed, sending shrapnel toward crew members. Fragments struck camera assistant Sarah Jones and propelled her toward the still fast moving train, resulting in her death.[1][2][3][4][5] William Hurt got off the trestle before the train hit the hospital bed. Several other crew members were injured and were taken to hospital.[6]""

The cast and crew had been told by the producers that it was safe to shoot.

Here's the follow up on the producer:

In 2014, during production of Miller's film Midnight Rider, camera assistant Sarah Jones was killed during the filming of a scene.[13] A police investigation concluded that Miller and crew were trespassing on an operating railway line.[14] Miller ultimately took a plea deal, pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter, and serving a year in prison.[15][16] Miller is the first director to receive a prison sentence due to the death of a cast or crew member.[17] As part of his plea agreement he is prohibited from working as a director or assistant director or in any supervisory role that includes safety responsibility of a film production.[15]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Miller

He did end up serving time for manslaughter after taking a plea deal.

He did it, because he thought it would cheaper than trying to get permission/insurance/etc, and thought he could just get that shot done before anyone knew what happened.

The sad part is that there are tons of abandoned railroad tracks everywhere. He easily could have set up a scene on a track in some back farmer's field, and nobody would have cared as it was a ""dream sequence.""&&Man, poor Uma Thurman. I’m sure she doesn’t want people’s pity, but reading the article and this just made me sad. &&>not to mention going on Howard Stern and talking about how childbirth changed her genitals

What is it with asshole men going on Stern's show and talking about incredibly private, personal details about not only their lives but their partner's lives? I mean I suppose people do that online but there's usually a fig leaf of anonymity there.&&> not to mention going on Howard Stern and talking about how childbirth changed her genitals

Holy shit, I totally forgot he did this. Yeah, I like Ethan Hawke but I remember thinking at the time that that was incredibly shitty.&&He did. He already admitted he did.

>“There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip,” he said in the interview with the New York Times. “It wasn’t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.

>“I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.”

>Tarantino said that he had been aware of the settlement between Rose McGowan and Weinstein and that his then girlfriend Mira Sorvino had told him about an incident involving Weinstein making unwelcome advances and touching.

>“I couldn’t believe he would do that so openly. I was like: ‘Really? Really?’ But the thing I thought then, at the time, was that he was particularly hung up on Mira,” said Tarantino. “I thought Harvey was hung up on her in this Svengali kind of way. Because he was infatuated with her, he horribly crossed the line.”&&I immediately had a suspicion that he did, way back when allegations against Weinstein hit the news, and I think this basically confirmed it.

I'm glad he just didn't go along with it when Weinstein did it to Thurman, but I get the feeling that if it weren't an actress that he really needed for his movies and ""cared about"" (in his own way), he wouldn't have done anything.&&Weinstein gave Tarantino his career and I'm pretty sure QT was in the middle of a multi-picture contract at Miramax. I don't think that QT had a choice about Weinstein being an executive producer on the film.

That doesn't excuse the rest of his behavior though.&&He dated Rose McGowan who told him about Weinstein sexually assaulting her, so he most certainly knew. &&Of course he knew, he was one of the only people in Hollywood to publicly admit he knew. &&He said he knew like most of hollywood did&&I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt (i.e. maybe he didn't realize he went too far because he's basically a man-child) but even then, that's not excusable. The whole article paints a very unflattering picture of him. Like, it seems he reverted back to being a dick to Thurman about the crash when he wasn't worried about Ethan Hawke being up in his face.&&It may have been more simple than that: Ethan must have looked pissed, and I'm pretty sure he could beat the shit out of QT.

Even the biggest of jerks tend to get very apologetic if they fear they're about to get slugged.&&> if there’s any example of an old boys club

I've always wondered with Quentin - he is so awkward, sorry to be personal but he looks 'unique'.

I'd go further and say he intrinsically is afraid of, contemptuous of and scared of women, full stop. Sure he fetishises them, but if he weren't a director how would **that** look, some average guy...seems creepier now right?

Seems to me there is a direct parallel, sure Quentin may be a 'NiceGuy / Incel' type, but it reminds me of two things:

* How Hitchcock treated his [female stars - Tippi Hedren springs to mind](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/9753977/Tippi-Hedren-interview-Hitchcock-put-me-in-a-mental-prison.html).

* How 'Diane Kruger has revealed that Quentin Tarantino insisted that he strangle her himself for a scene in Inglourious Basterds.' - [link](http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a172650/kruger-quentin-strangled-me-on-film/).

The spitting on in OP's article from Thurman herself...

Jesus fucking christ, unpopular opinion - Quentin Tarantino is one sick, sexist, angry, freak.

Very, very sad.

&&He did the right thing in that particular instance but I agree he probably knew more than what he lets on.

Kevin Smith didn't know, and when the allegations against Weinstein hit the news, he had a breakdown because he suddenly realized all these years that he'd been working with this guy who abused his power to sexually harass women and get away with it.

**Edit:**

And when Peter Jackson heard about it, and realized what Weinstein had probably done to Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino, he went to the media about it.&&For those wondering:

&&And Jennifer Jason Leigh (Hateful 8) is the daughter of the actor who died in the Twilight Zone set accident (Vic Morrow).

If a male star of similar fame said ""no"" to something, it's much more likely that the conversation would have ended there. It makes you wonder how many actresses who directors labeled  as""difficult"" were actually just women who said ""no"" to them when they demanded something on set.



In other words, it shows that these problems are about power, not just sex.&&Kruger talking about the choking scene with Tarantino

> Quentin said, 'He's not going to do it right, it'll either be too much or too little. I know exactly what I need and I think I should just do it'. I have to say it was very strange being strangled by the director.""

It's weird how nobody thought something like this wasn't appropriate back when Inglourious Basterds came out.&&> Dude ~~probably~~ furiously jacks off to those scenes.&&Dude definitely jacks off to those scenes.   Imagine the shit he has hidden away in a vault somewhere. &&This was brought up in a reddit thread a few years ago. I personally couldn't believe it and asked rhetorically ""shouldn't that be illegal?"" Of course Reddit practically worships Tarentino so I was downvoted to hell. Funny how people are finally starting to see how fucked up this stuff is after the actresses themselves start talking about it. Well at least something is changing public opinion. &&I feel like a lot of the stuff in his movies is just about his personal fetishes, the way he talks about Black people (pretty much implying he ""gets"" Black people because his mom fucked a lot of Black dudes) has always been creepy to me.&&It's more than a fetish. The foot stuff is a fetish. This, to me, shows a very sick and deranged view of women. He doesn't have a choking fetish, he has a choking *women* ""fetish"". He gets off on making women feel fear and disgust, by choking and spitting on them. Who knows what he does in his private life, but forcing it into his professional life under the guise of being authentic is absolutely wrong.&&You don't get to indulge your fetishes in the workplace, and it's very fucked up that anyone thinks it might be acceptable.&&Goddamn, why are all these people supporting Polanski? Is his fucking ""art"" really that good that they can just sweep away that he raped a 13-year-old girl up the ass while she was drugged and saying ""no""?&&I don‘t know why anyone still has an ounce of respect for her. She even defended Weinstein and sad it‘s time for forgiveness now in an interview. &&>Quentin said, 'He's not going to do it right, it'll either be too much or too little.

This sounds like a Dennis Reynolds quote in a Sunny episode. What's really fucked up is that it is real, and this is who QT is - a psychotic asshole. &&And people dismiss it bc “he’s an auteur,” as though his weird fetish for authenticity justifies abuse.&&A creepy asshole, if you will.&&And then there's From Dusk Til Dawn, where he wrote a scene that let him [suck beer off of Salma Hayek's toes.](https://youtu.be/dSK5Ud6k7ys?t=3m9s)&&You're quite right.

Be it for civil rights or the movement in this thread. I don't fault people for it, it's just damn hard to not have it either derailed or loosing steam.

I really agree with your last sentence. In this culture of ""let me tell you how wrong you are"" there's no space for conversation as you say. I value comments such as yours. Thank you. &&I’m not sure what you mean about being “in public, earnest and wrong.” Does that mean speaking without fear of criticism? Because I don’t think anyone on any side of any issue gets that anymore. But if you mean speaking without fear of viral shaming/pile-ons, I agree to an extent. &&What? Really?&&In my country there is another movie director who was like that. Director Kim Ki-duk is being sued for slapping an actress.

> According to the committee, the actress started working on the production of Moebius in early March 2013. She says the director slapped her three times in front of the crew, which Kim stated in a press release was in order to direct her performance.

> She also accused the director of forcing her to take hold of an actor’s penis when it had been pre-arranged that they use a prosthesis.

He also almost killed another actress but at least he didn't try to hide the accident like Tarantino did.

> Filmmaker Kim Ki-duk stopped making movies for a while following an accident on the set for the 2008 fantasy drama Dream. Actress Lee Na-young nearly choked while filming a suicide scene without proper safety equipment. Fortunately Lee wasn't critically injured, but Kim shudders to this day when he looks back.&&Well shit. 

He might be next to go down in flames. 

It would kind of make sense that a man who design sadistic movies that are very misogynistic against women, what himself be somewhat that way too... Just also cliche&&Wiggle your big toe. &&[deleted]&&Yeah. The unleashing of Pandora’s box so to speak (# me too) has erased my respect for a lot of people in show business. And now, upon reading how Tarantino abused his power as almighty director, he belongs to that pile of human shitbags as well. Smh. 

It is said that power corrupts, but actually it's more true that power attracts the corruptible. The sane are usually attracted by other things than power. -David Brin

&&Look - there is a lot of psychological/sexual stuff going on in the 'dramatic arts' - people getting cast because someone on the production end is 'smitten' with them, on-set 'affairs', actors trying to seduce directors to get a job...up to a POINT its  pretty 'normal' and nothing to get upset about. But after that POINT when lines are crossed its another story.

I would not 'condemn' Tarantino for casting Thurman because he was smitten with her and hoping she would reciprocate his feelings because even though its sad - it does not cross the line of unacceptable behavior. Even if he had shots made of her feet, eh, OK.

His choking and spitting on her is gross and approaches the grey areas of unacceptable. 

If she did not want to drive the car and he made her anyway - that IMO more clearly crosses a line, and the fact he would not let her see the footage is pretty bad.&&This is probably  the most open secret in Hollywood that he has a foot fetish.&&Occam's razor.

Miramax owned Tarantino as much as they owned Thurman. The difference was Thurman was subjected to sexual harassment and assault, ontop of Tarantino's hopes and dreams.

Weinstein is clearly a well versed psychopath, able to navigate social cricles witth ease and feign any emotion necessary to suit his whims. I'm sure he could manipulate Tarantino as easily as he has women. 

Tarantino and Thurman together could have made life brutal for Weinstein, so he made sure their friendship was always in jeopardy. 

In terms of the car crash...unnecessary risk, Tarantino's obsession with reality/truth is selfish and it caused grievous harm to Thurman. There's a difference, in my mind, of negligence versus deliberate attempt to do harm. 

In either event, Thurman's had a rough run of it and deserved better. &&Excellent point. I think a lot of people forget or aren't aware of how much a studio or record label control the content they distribute and people that are creating it. That said, it was interesting how she specifically mentioned Tarantino and not Miramax in regards to asking for/receiving the footage.&&But couldn't Miramax still be sued by Thurman, or sue Tarantino for giving her that footage, regardless of Weinstein being forced out? The company itself didn't cease to exist just because Weinstein officially left it.&&Yeah it looks like the car accident was after the spitting and choking. ""With four days left, after nine months of shooting the sadistic saga, Thurman was asked to do something that made her draw the line.""&&Since the car crash happened with four days left in filming, I find it *extremely* unlikely that they spent those last four days filming two entire scenes, including one action scene.&&I read that as the author setting up how meaningful it was that Thurman said ""no"" to driving the car. She had said ""yes"" to being spit on and choked on, so she did not have a pattern of being overly cautious or disagreeable on the set. &&Regardless of whether it happened before or after, it’s such a sad read :( &&Does Roth have a history with this stuff too? Or did you just throw his name in because of his type of movies?&&James McAvoy's face and his ""enjoying?"" comment, are so spot on on how bad the whole thing sounds.&&Wow. **That** is fucked up.&&James McAvoy's body language changes completely during the course of that interview. Even his little interjection of ""Enjoy it?"" When QT is trying to describe how he felt is telling. &&Her daughter maya is an up and coming actress. I’m sure she’s thought long and hard about ways to protect her moving forward. &&Uma Thurman's movie hits after Kill Bill?&&As far as I'm concerned he should be in jail. &&>He's still currently in a ""rehab facility"" in Arizona.

(I hope)&&He's just saying that Q hasn't really ever hid that he's a creepy fucker. &&That's a quick ticket to getting blacklisted though. &&When you put your film above your friend's safety.

I also wonder if he didn't ask because he knew the railroad would have told him no. The railroad probably would have been fine with a smaller bridge or somewhere with no bridge, but that thing was massive.

I assume the film never got released.
&&I remember reading about that accident, sure it came from William Hurt actually. The director had applied for permission several times to film there but had been told no, it wasn't just that it'd be cheaper this way, it was straight up a director breaking the rules and telling everybody it was fine.

Don't think he cared.&&And dated Mira Sorvino from 1995 to 1998. The plot thickens.&&Exactly. He asked her HUSBAND for forgiveness and then turned right around and started doing all the degrading stuff to her during filming himself, like choking her and spitting on her.

>“When they turned on me after the accident,” she says, “I went from being a creative contributor and performer to being like a broken tool.”

>Thurman says that in “Kill Bill,” Tarantino had done the honors with some of the sadistic flourishes himself, spitting in her face in the scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing it and choking her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is on screen doing it.&&Totally, even says in the article Tarantino would compare his relationship with Uma to the Hitchcock example, and that was hardly healthy.&& Imagine all the freaks that have been validated because they make money. It's been that way since the dawn of time.

And we are only seeing a tiny infinitesimal sliver of reality for a lot of humans. &&When I found out he has a foot fetish, and therefore includes foot shots in his films, I suspected. It's like slipping in porn only he enjoys into his films. Gross. Don't include your personal jack  off material in films for public consumption and don't make your employees make it for you. Ick.&&Tarantino has flat out admitted he knew about Weinstein’s assaults. He also dated two of his victims. &&The parents watched their kids get chopped up by helicopter blades because Landis refused to listen to his advisors who said it was unsafe.&&From the wiki article:
>Film director Steven Spielberg, who co-produced the film with Landis, broke off their friendship following the accident.Spielberg said that the crash had ""made me grow up a little more"" and had left everyone who worked on the movie ""sick to the center of our souls.""With regard to how the crash had influenced people's attitudes towards safety, he said: ""No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now than ever before to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn't safe, it's the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, 'Cut!'""

That makes me think more highly of Steven Spielberg. Back in 1982 no less.&&Wow, I never knew that! Such a tragedy.&&Holy shit, that's interesting. Good trivia, anyway.&&It annoys me that this one is brought up as a cutesy story about the production of *The Hateful Eight* because I always just saw it as being just juvenile disregard and lack of respect for other people's property.&&

>Quentin said, 'He's not going to do it right, it'll either be too much or too little. I know exactly what I need and I think I should just do it'

This sounds like a Dennis Reynolds quote. &&In a vacuum you could argue that it was so they could do it and be done. Not having to put the actress through multiple takes of being choked. But with all other context, strange as fuck.

Also as so many others have pointed out - why **his** hands, his spit (EWWW)? Why not Madsen's or Waltz during the two 'choking' scenes? He hired these actors, does he think they can give an authentic performance? (granted, Dianne Kruger blacked out apparenty - too far erm... **YEAH**!).

I may be way off here, and I hope not as I've always got the 'impression' that Kurt Russell is just a decent, humble human so I don't think he would be so.....negligent. Unless you mean QT might have known it wasn't the prop guitar sorry?

Putting them through hell to get a ""real"" reaction instead of letting them act.&&Or he would be making some Max Hardcore type of porn. &&According to the [trivia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/trivia) on the IMDB page for the film, he actually really choked her till she fell unconscious. 

His stated reasons were that he didn't think Christoph would choke her hard enough, or would choke her too hard.

I ***love*** Quentins films, but it does strike me as a bit odd that he is such an expert in how to choke someone 'just right'.


Edit: [Found a clip of him talking about it.](https://youtu.be/rQ7GbBkmIm0)

[The scene in question.](https://youtu.be/opt5zMqrc-g)
&&Same for when she's barefoot in Pulp Fiction when Travolta's character comes to pick her up she walks to the room barefoot and it's all shot of her feet till the next scene when they are in the car.

I dunno if you can also mention his scene in Dusk till Dawn (for which he did the screenplay for) the part of Selma Hayek doing the strip tease dance on the table and pouring beer down her leg to her foot & putting it in his mouth could be his add on to the scene as well.

Rather telling & disturbing that he does this scenes for his foot fetish.&&He was on some afternoon talk show (Oprah or Tyra) where they pulled women out of the crowd to have him rate their feet.  &&i do think harvey is waiting for stuff to die down so he can sue rose mcgowan, she had a non disclosure agreement and still talked on twitter. course he'd lose the suit cuz that was an illegal contract to ask someone to sign, stay quiet on sexual abuse. maybe a lawyer told him not to bother.&&Yeah that exchange really creeped me out. And the comparison to a sex scene, while said for the funnies, was pretty on point. &&Understandably; the dude's a giant, disheveled goblin.&&He basically says that most films that have choking scene are ""fake"" choking and he doesn't buy it so he asked if he could actually choke out the actress to make it more ""real"" looking. He also says that it had to be him to do it because it was ""on him"" but that they had a stunt guy watching to make sure it was safe. Why not just have this trained guy do it I'll leave up to you to decide. &&>I'm sure with two major actors for parents she'll have a concerned eye watching her at all times.

Lol, sure worked for Carrie Fisher.&&But also, since I was able to...
Enjoy it?&&QT really seems like a bit of a sadist. &&QT gets defended by his fanboy army, but he's always been a huge, selfish asshole. 

Good movies. Douchebag person. &&It's like Uma says in the article... directors don't like to hear ""no."" Someone like QT? Even more so.&&[deleted]&&Idk, a part of me thinks Cruise is just insane enough to think he's invincible.&&To me, it's not even having a background in stunts or driving, it's that she didn't want to do it in the first place. If she was on board with it from the get-go, then the accident and its repercussions are on her.

Sure, I appreciate when an actor does all of their own stunts, but not if they were forced to do something dangerous like this against their will. &&If it had been a normal car on a normal road that would have been one thing but Quentin wanted her to drive some shitty convertible in a winding road surrounded by trees at 40 mph. I'm really disappointed to read this article, I thought he was better than that and that he had a good relationship with Uma. &&On top of the training, there's just a world of difference between an actor wanting to do their own stunts, and the director insisting that an actor do stunts they don't feel comfortable with.&&And I'm guessing she hasn't been able to get a SAG card.&&It seems to be his style. Tarantino's hands are the ones seen on-screen choking Diane Krueger in Inglourious Basterds when it should have been Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa. &&Certainly sounds like that's the implication&&Hey what do you know, maybe Patrick Bateman wasn’t imagining all that horrific shit after all.&&That's what I wonder about Bill Cosby.  He was giving women some heavy doses.  If one had a bad reaction or an interaction with another drug - even something prescription, which Bill wouldn't know about - she could die, easily.  Or just an accidental overdose.  He had shady people supplying the drugs so I'm sure he could find some to dispose of bodies.

This is all just speculation but it's certainly possible.&&He actual worked as an usher at a porn theater called the Pussycat Theatre lol&&And he would insist on personally choking the actors.&&Not that odd. You are talking about a dude with a serious foot fetish who uses his movies as a way to indulge said fetish. Obviously he just like to choke people too.

Kinks are fine, but don;t bring em to fucking work. &&Wow dude, this does not sound so funny now... &&Well before that scene in From Dusk 'til Dawn, there's a lot of focus on Juliette Lewis' feet&&How the fuck does that even come up?

“Oh, we’ve noticed that you’ve taken a liking to women’s feet, how about rating some of the female audience member’s feet?”&&That should be common knowledge if you've seen ANY of his films.&&He insisted on, and became, the one that choked her with the chain from Gogo's spike ball thing. He smiled as he did it. Tarantino is a piece of human shit. Fuck that dude in his asshole, no lube.&&People have a hard time separating the art from the person.

Roman Polanksi for example is a despicable human being but I will wholeheartedly say he's produced some of the most enthralling movies I've ever watched.

Something about Hollywood culture makes them act indestructable, they think they can do anything in the world and get away with it, because 'showbiz'.&&He's not the one bleeding money while the shoot is delayed.&&Eh she was working and might have felt she had pressure to agree. Even if she did  really want to do it there is suppose to be people that say you can’t because you’ll get hurt.

I can want to do a stunt all I want but if another company is paying and insuring me they should stop me unless I am properly trained.

No training, not stunt.&&I was in a similar position last year. I let my actress jump out of a driving car. She insisted in doing it. Just a few inch and the wheels would have crushed her foot. I thought I was going to faint.
A sane person doesnt want this responsibility!&&No, she was established ""way back in the day"" and is still working in the Scream Queens show that aired a while back.&&It is a *lot* of directors style to do that. From Tarantino hands here to Mel Gibsons hands nailing Jesus to the cross. It is a *thing* that is widespread. I.E. hidden hands behind the movie kinda thing.&&Yeah but that's an accident. It sounds plausible also but I'm talking about purposeful.&&Unless you work on kink.com&&I know, it's just a bummer that he continually gets grosser. &&Not really. Making sadistic films doesn't mean you have to be a sadist.&&I didn't know that he had done that in Kill Bill until I read the article. I knew that he was the one who strangled Diane Kruger in Inglorious Basterds until she blacked out. So he won't put a stuntwoman in for his lead actress and ""friend"" to preserve their safety, but has no problem providing the stunts when it comes to yoking up women. You said it right- Tarantino IS a piece of shit. &&Those are Steven Spielberg's hands picking maggots out of the guy's face in Poltergeist.

**Notable Box Office Stories:** 

* **Black Panther -** Well, that was....wow. If someone bet that Black Panther would have a bigger three-day opening than the last Avengers movie then I'm not sure if they are a time travel or really have their finger on the pulse of the US. Black Panther utterly destroyed its opening weekend and broke several records in its wake as the film opened to #1 with a massive $201.7M. That makes it the second highest opening ever for the MCU (only behind The Avengers with $207.4M) and the fifth highest domestic opening ever. It also makes it the #1 February debut, demolishing the record set by Deadpool with $132.4M. It's also the biggest opening ever for a solo superhero movie and the biggest opening for a debut superhero movie (I know the protagonist was in Captain America: Civil War first, but the classification of this film as the start of a franchise still counts). Black Panther also had the fifteenth highest international debut of all time with $169M, despite not opening yet in China or Japan. This is not only the biggest opening weekend for a film made by a black director, it will become the highest grossing film by a black director ever in just 4 days when it surpasses the lifetime domestic gross of Fate of the Furious ($226M). If all that wasn't enough, this film received an A+ rating on Cinemascore, only the second MCU film to do so besides The Avengers. And let's note that The Avengers had a opening weekend multiplier of 3x which if Black Panther repeats means were are looking at a domestic haul well over $550M. Just...wow.

* **Black Panther (cont.)-** So how did this happen? Well the most obvious answer is that Marvel truly created an event. Major black celebrities, social media trendsetters, and even black churches urged people to go see the film opening weekend. This really was viewed as a major cultural moment for black representation on film. But besides that it seems the film really appealed to a wide demo, with over 61% of the audience this weekend over the age of 25 and 45% of the total audience was women. Not to mention a well reviewed concept album by Kendrick Lamarr for the film coming out right before and the film becoming the best reviewed MCU/superhero film ever on Rotten Tomatoes with a current score of 98%. There were attempts from racist trolls to bomb the review scores on IMDB and RT and even try to spread fake news that white people were being attacked by black people going to see Black Panther but their attempts didn't even put a dent into the opening weekend. The timing was also just perfect, with top films that were over two months old before Black Panther's release. The film really felt like the perfect storm of cultural relevance, hype, and great word of mouth. 

* **Black Panther (cont.)-** This incredible weekend debut is a reminder why black directors and representation matters, especially for major blockbusters. Underserved markets are very hungry to see themselves on screen. It's also worth noting that while black audiences were the major drivers of this weekend that $201.7M was not all them. Clearly with numbers that big you have to reach a very wide audience. That so many people could embrace a film whether it represents their cultural/racial make-up or not is telling that a lot of the views about demos and niche audiences in Hollywood are old and outdated. I'm really sad to be leaving this series (just temporarily) right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more, but I'm glad I could cover this weekend because it's one for the box office history books. A cynical mind can certainly see this as another notch in the Disney corporate machine belt (and hey you are right, this does mean now Disney has 8 of the 10 best opening weekends ever) but for whatever intentions corporate had what the audiences experienced was a big middle finger to old Hollywood that would reject this film's existence just ten years ago. And now it's opened bigger than Captain America: Civil War, it will make more domestically than Justice League in just 4-5 days, and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018. Black Panther is going to prove diverse stories don't just matter on an emotional or social level, they matter on an economic level in a way that no one can possibly ignore or dismiss anymore. 

* **Early Man -** Look the two films opening against Black Panther knew they were counter-programming but I don't think even they expected results this bad. First up is the latest from Aardman Animation (the claymation studio behind Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and Chicken Run) and the first film from director Nick Park in a decade, Early Man, which opened horribly to #7 with $3.1M. Now to be fair to Aardman their films have never been major openers (Flushed Away is their best domestic opening with $18.8M) but this sets a studio low for the company who's domestic receipts have been dwindling as their last film The Shaun the Sheep Movie opened to just $4M in 2015. Things aren't looking good for the longtail either as the film scored a B on Cinemascore, likely due to the deceptive advertising. The film is not so much a day in the life of a caveman as a caveman era football match movie, which doesn't seem to be translating well to US audiences. The film wasn't exactly a big hit in the UK either, scoring a measly $10M so far in that country. Early Man just feels too weird, too much of a personal project for Nick Park and in age where even extremely well reviewed stop motion films fail who needs a middling reviewed extended football joke when most people don't even like the animation style to begin with?

* **Samson -** Oh Pure Flix, please never ever stop even if your latest flop Samson opened at #10 with $1.9M. The film touted as PF's biggest budget film to date and boasting such white hot stars like Jackson Rathbone and Billy Zane was an attempt to move PF from their more modern tales about faith in the modern world to telling actual biblical stories. However, once again critics derided the film and it's now the worst wide release opening for the company as well as in the bottom 200 worst openings of all time. But don't worry about Pure Flix as this March sees the release of God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, their hotly anticipated third entry in the God's Not Dead Cinematic Universe (or GNDCU). I imagine with that film eeking out a profit this is the last time we will see Pure Flix trying to stretch themselves like this again, and instead go back to their low budget, high reward modern melodramas about faith. 


* **Oscar Movie Round-up -** Not too much to report this week other than **The Shape of Water** managed to pass $50M domestic this weekend where it was #12 with $1.6M.

*As always /r/boxoffice is a great place to share links and other conversations about box office news.*

*Also you can see the archive of all Box Office Week posts at /r/moviesboxoffice.* ","**Films on follow list with updates**

* **Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle** - In what is still the craziest box office run ever, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has now passed $900M worldwide worldwide, a 10x return on it's $90M budget and means the film is in the top 50 worldwide releases of all time. If you predicted that 6 months ago you are officially a witch and you should please help we win the lottery.

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **The Greatest Showman** - Speaking of insane runs, the little $84M circus musical that could sadly dropped out of the top 5 this weekend after 8 straight weeks, but it did manage to make $5.1M at #6. The film now stands at $154.4M domestic which is more than the domestic gross of La La Land, making The Greatest Showman the 4th highest grossing musical in history. In other news, nothing makes sense anymore but I'm enjoying it!

**Notable film closings** 

* **Daddy's Home 2** - Despite coming out at possibly the worst possible moment for a film to be released with a problematic lead, Daddy's Home 2 was not tanked for it's inclusion of Mel Gibson as the film closed to a solid $104M domestic and $180.6M on a budget of $69M. Despite the possible repercussions of coming out at the start of MeToo movement and the film moving away from the post Star Wars weekend (which Jumanji took are rode so well), it still managed to pass $100M but came nowhere close to the $150M domestic haul of the first film. Still it's a pretty solid scorer though with each film carrying a budget of $69M (that has to be on purpose) the dwindling returns may not put much faith in a Daddy's Home 3: Revenge of the Daddy. 

* **Father Figures** - Wait, is this a real movie? [*googles poster*](https://cdn.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Father-Figures-poster.jpg) Okay that is DEFINITELY not a real movie...it is? You sure? Well I guess so cause it closed to a very bad $17.5M domestic and $23M worldwide on a budget of $25M. But it doesn't exist so doesn't really matter. Yeah sure, like a movie would star Glenn Close AND Katt Williams. &&So, The Greatest Showman is now the 4th highest-grossing musical in history? Even when it isn’t number 4, it still finds a way to be number 4.&&I can't believe Justice League had a budget of $300 Million.&&> I'm really sad to be leaving this series right as Black Panther about to blow up the box office even more

Do you mean this is the last of these write-ups you'll be doing?

**edit** nevermind, I just saw this part: 
> Just a heads up I will be out of the country for four weeks so sadly no Box Office Week during that time.&&Such a shame about Early Man. I haven't seen it myself, but it hurts seeing Aardman struggling so badly after losing Peter Sallis.&&DC execs right now:

Sheila, get someone from diversity in my office right now, we need to jump on this black superhero thing while it's hot.... How fast can we make a Cyborg movie? While we're at it, can we replace Ray Fisher with Kevin Hart?&&Future headline: ""Agent Coulson"" smashes box office records. At this point Marvel has a licence to print money. &&In 4 days, Black Panther is going to make more money than Justice League made in its entire run. Who would have believed that could happen a year ago.&&Don't mind me... I'm just here for The weekly Greatest Showman update.&&I only wish for Aardman to have one hit in the States. &&Jumanji and The Greatest Showman just keep chugging along, scooping up money. Fun runs to watch.&&I had no idea Samson was a thing until I looked up movie times at my theater.  &&The 15:17 to Paris might be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Really feels like Clint Eastwood wanted to pay some guys to retake a vacation they took a few years ago and film an action scene on the train. The actual attack is really tense and kinetic and effective but the rest of it is just comatose. &&>...and despite opening in February it could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018.

I wouldn't say ""easily."" There's a behemoth with Infinity War coming in May.&&[deleted]&&You can read my latest piece on The Numbers called [What Gives a Marvel Movie Legs?](https://www.the-numbers.com/news/229020830-Analysis-What-Gives-a-Marvel-Movie-Legs) And no the answer isn't good diet and squats. Hope you enjoy it!&&Wow this is insane. That’s over double early predictions for the 3 day weekend and 404m worldwide already!&&Going to be interesting to see how much they pour black panther into the marketing for Infinity War now&&[deleted]&&B-list superhero making $200m+ on OW. Marvel studios is on fire.  

WTF is DCEU doing? They freeze.&&I work at a movie theater. Black Panther was obscenely popular. And at least at my theater, it was a busier weekend than Last Jedi's opening.

Edit:
Some numbers for friday/saturday
For Last Jedi we sold 4800 seats
For Black Panther we sold 5100

This is for a 6 stadium theater with 3 212 seat and 2 112 seat stadiums. We generally have 4 or 5 showings in each one normally, but we did a few extra for both movies.&&I think what a lot of people that love comic books in this sub don’t realize most people don’t, my parents love going to the movies and they love these movies.. it doesn’t have to be true to the genre or appeal to comic guys because the vast majority aren’t too worried about that. In no way am I criticizing anyone here I just think if a movie is legitimately good like black panther, average people won’t be turned away because it’s comic based &&I really don't get the Early Man UK flop, it's an absolutely great film.

Having said that, I can 100% understand why Americans would just not get it at all. It's very much a British film for British people, and most of the jokes are pretty specific to British football tropes.

Having said that, I haven't laughed that much in a good while. It's just a stupid football movie with a caveman setting that knows it's stupid, knows it's dumb, and just runs with it.

It's not a deep film, it's not a layered film, it's not a complex film. It's a dumb farce, and I love it for that.&&""It could easily be the #1 biggest grosser of 2018.""

Dude, Infinity War comes out in May. The culmination of 3 phases of MCU movies. And it also looks to have a large Wakandan involvement based on the trailer. An epic 10 years in the making. I would be very surprised if this doesn't top the MCU box office. &&Black Panther was so great. Impressed that it was able to beat out Age of Ultron for opening weekend gross. After Thor 3 and Black Panther, Infinity War is getting great lead-in. That opening weekend is going to be nuts probably. &&I saw three elderly African American women on Friday talking about how excited they were to go see Black Panther - when is the last time that demographic was tapped, especially for a superhero/action movie? Probably never. 

To boot - it’s the only Marvel movie since Winter Solider that’s actually let its story and characters flesh out and be a complete package. This thing was top to bottom awesome. &&Such a shame about Early Man. I saw it and thought it was lovely. Admittedly, I have a real soft spot for Aardman works, but I thought the movie was pretty funny, excellently made, and even though it was just about as run-of-the-mill underdog-sports-story as you can get, it played it very well and everything was adorable. Sucks to see it languish like this. I'm not even a soccer fan and I wasn't perturbed by the focus.&&I’m a huge DC fan, prefer them over Marvel but I can bet you that Black Panther probably didn’t have half of it’s movie scrapped and millions of reshoots. WB needs to take notes already. &&I liked Black Panther. My friend said that the African accents weren’t good except for a couple people. I cant attest to that.  Except Forest Whitaker sounded like he had a Boston/Brooklyn accent when saying Black Panther. &&/u/mi-16evil

Could you talk about the crazy weekend that China had this weekend? 

* Monster Hunt 2 opened to $190M (which is actually underperforming a $200M+ estimate due to poor WOM) - Highest OW of all time in China, beating Fate of the Furious's $184. Single Biggest day in history as well with $85M on Friday alone. 
* Detective Chinatown Vol 2 opened to $154M
* The Monkey King 3: Kingdom of Women opened to $80M 
* Operation Red Sea opened to $70M 

This is $490M+ in one weekend, the largest single box office weekend ever for both US or China. And there were no major Hollywood openings at all this weekend to boot. 

For reference The Force Awakens OW is the number 1 weekend ever in the US and that weekend only made $305M. China's previous record was $224M EDIT: 2016 Lunar New Year and they more than doubled it. 

Black Panther may have opened to $201M, but the next highest film was only $17M. In comparison, China's weekend would be the equivalent of having the following four films open and all make their OW at the same time. 

* Avengers Age of Ultron ($190)
* The Hunger Games ($152)
* Star Wars Episode 2 ($80M)
* Finding Nemo ($70M) 

This I think is the biggest Box Office Story of the weekend, even moreso than Black Panther's success. This just solidifies that the future of the movie industry will be in China, or at the very least heavily influenced by  the Chinese market and their demands. &&Looked through this thread before posting anything.

I haven't seen *Early Man* yet because the previews ruined it for me.  The first previews made it out to be this interesting culture clash kinda thing, which I was all for.  Looked fantastic.

Then the longer preview came out, and I realized it was going to be a sports underdog story.  And now I have no interest in seeing it.

Anyone who has, I'd appreciate another view.  But eish.&&Jumanji is about to be a billion dollar movie and justice league is not.  Talk about your M Night plot twist&&Awesome, was waiting all weekend for your write-up. This is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before.

What's the chances it can stay above 100 mil next weekend?&&Really happy for black panther, I thought it was fantastic,  it thoroughly deserves it. Gonna see it again this week if I can.

EDIT: Did three billboards cross 100 million WW this week, or was that last week?&&I've seen BP twice, once in a mostly black area of Newark NJ and another in a mostly white area of rural Pennsylvania. I could not believe how similar the reactions were in both audiences. The crowds were simply amped the entire time. 

Also, I have to say see it in IMAX if you have a chance. Some of the IMAX shots did not transfer well to the traditional aspect ratio. The first tribal challenge and the final Wakandan sunset in particular looked like ass on a normal screen and very good in IMAX. Hopefully they get it cleaned up before the home release. &&Wow really happy to see Black Panther doing so well - for a lot of different reasons.

But oh boy the inevitable Reddit backlash is going to be absolutely insufferable for this film. &&I think it's worth mentioning that *Black Panther* was not just a smashing hit because it had a target demographic that it nailed down, but because it had a genuinely cool premise.

I've sat out of the last three Marvel movies, in part because it's starting to all feel familiar. But *Black Panther* offered something not just unique to the franchise, but unique to recent cinema: an awesome blend of African tribal cultures and futuristic Sci-fi technology. I would buy a ticket for any movie that manages to do that well.&&I'm so sad that the best movie to come out so far this year has been making such little money. Everyone needs to see Paddington 2.&&I'm so happy for Black Panther. I can't imagine how pleased the cast and crew are with this well-deserved success. You could *feel* how enthused the actors were through the screen. &&[deleted]&&Man DC really need to rethink what they are doing. Black panther at its best is a b tier character is making more money (and a better movie) than fucking batman and superman.
&&I knew this movie was going to be popular but god damn. I can't even find tickets near me yet. &&So worth watching? I'm really struggling with super hero films at this point. Damn the hype was real about 6 years back when they really started but struggling to get up and go to them any more.&&Well deserved success for Black Panther. It was an amazing movie and, like you said, it wasn't just about getting black people to show up. Everyone I know was super excited for this movie regardless of their demographic.

Turns out films with minority casts can still be successful as long as you make sure it's a good movie. Who'da thunk?&&Usually high box office receipts don't influence my decision to see a movie, but I'm feeling an exception in this case...&&Black Panther deserves every penny Coogler did an amazing job &&When there's nothing but shit movies being made and the only thing decent are superhero movies, it doesn't surprise me that these movies make so much.&&I really need to see black panther ugh&&I saw this in theatre and somehow bought tickets where the seats moved and vibrated with the action. Every time someone hit their staff/spear on the ground I almost fell out of my seat! 

It was awesome.  

The girl power in this movie was so unexpected and fresh. In the casino when they threw their shoes and wig off the women in the theatre hollered. They really get it!

To this day I have no idea why they decided to punch their diversity card with a weird, semi-humorless version of Cyborg. I guess trying to grab black viewers with minimal effort or insight as to what black fans actually want? I mistaken idea that Teen Titans viewers were super attached?

I think anyone who has seen Zak Snyder’s previous films would have believed that. &&Power of Marvel + Interest of different kind of superhero = Making almost as much $ as Star Wars... wow&&Greatest Showman and Jumanji were crazy this weekend as well. They barely dropped against a 200m opener. Ton of spillover business from BP I’m guessing. &&As much as I love Arrdman movies this film was never going to be popular in the states just because it's entirely based around european soccer references. Opening night for Black Panther certainly didn't help either haha &&Chicken Run was a huge movie. Everyone in my classes loved that movie.&&Very bad release date though&&They could have just pushed it back a week, but nooooooooo the studio just had to send it to die. Granted a movie about Cavemen playing Football that serves as an allegory for English Football rivalries probably wouldn’t play anyway. &&It was never gonna work out for Early Man. Bad release date, bad marketing and in all fairness the movie itself is not up to par.

Also stop motion in general doesn't do well, it's a damn shame.&&I wonder what UK critics will think of it. Aardman films are born and bred British humour, we all grew up loving them and the quaint Britishness of it. I honestly am not surprised that it doesn't do well in other countries as we have a very unique sense of humour. To be fair though, football-centric jokes are not for everybody and the marketing in other adverts was... terrible. I had no idea it came out this weekend till reading this thread.&&Was Wallace & Gromit and the Curse of the Wererabbit not a hit? That movie is fucking awesome and I remembered the theater being packed. And who doesn't like the animation style? I could watch Aardman claymation all day every day. &&Was Jumanji really that good? I had doubts when it came out and I suspect I'm too late to go see it, but it's been getting surprising reviews. &&Say the trailer not too long ago and it looked Terrrrrrrrible. I kept sitting there thinking, people are getting fired for this. The trailer bored the life out of me.

Like, he won't spend much on re-takes or re-writes. He makes a movie, gets it out with as little bumps in the road as possible, and tends to make a decent profit even though the films are a bit rough around the edges.&&I haven't seen 15:16 to Paris yet but I was afraid it would be just like this. 

I was impressed that Sully made a movie out of a few minutes of crisis, but Sully did it by focusing on a longer lasting issue. The ""event"" in Sully happens right at the start as a preface rather than a climax. I was hoping 15:17 to Paris would follow that model :/&&Haven't seen it, and probably won't, since that's how I felt about the previews.  Like the central moment looks interesting and such, but the preview too is this long life story with a bunch of traveling and such, bookended by this train attack.

And forgive me, but ""the real heroes"" seems like a gimmick that's more likely to disservice a movie than benefit it.  There's a reason professional actors are the ones usually acting, and not people who lived a given event and are now asked to recreate it in what are usually *very* artificial environments.  Not to say that non-actors can never act, but it's a rarity, an exception.&&Legitimately the worst movie I have ever seen. If you haven’t already, DO NOT go and see it. &&[deleted]&&Uh, are you forgetting that solo comes out this year??  Box office about to be smashed like titanic/avatar levels. 


Lmao,  just kidding that shit is going to bomb so hard. &&The moment when only Marvel can out-perform themselves. &&>Like an antelope in headlights.&&Thank you for consistently posting these threads.&&I'd suggest that the multiplier is basically an indication of *unexpected* quality, which is easy to pull off when you're a new franchise but harder when you have established your baseline. The extension of that would be that sequels have worse multipliers in general:

Series | Original | Sequel | Sequel^2
|--|--|--|--
Iron Man| 3.12|2.44|2.35
Captain America|2.72|2.73|2.28
Thor|2.75|2.41|2.56
Avengers|3.00|2.40|
GotG|3.53|2.66

You can still pull off a surprise and increase the multiplier when a sequel is unexpectedly good (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok). However, if it's the case that people's expectations are raised, you should see multipliers generally trending down while the opening generally trends up.

Series | Original | Sequel | Sequel^2
|--|--|--|--
Iron Man| 102|128|174
Captain America|65|95|179
Thor|65|85|122
Avengers|207|191|
GotG|94|146

I'm ambivalent on Black Panther's multiplier, though. I don't expect it to be Wonder Woman level. That was a breath of fresh air from the DC Comics wasteland. The cultural pull of Black Panther is also for a smaller segment of the population than Wonder Woman. Fathers could bring daughters to WW and that's two more tickets; you won't have that same effect with Black Panther. 

Black Panther got *so* much hype and so many good reviews that we're all expecting it to be great and it's not going to catch people by surprise. There's also a rush to see it early because it is viewed as a cultural moment, which will inflate the opening numbers and decrease the multiplier. If I had to guess, I'd say probably 2.5, maybe a bit below?

I don't think Marvel will care about the distribution of the box office take because... well, a 2.5x would be $500M domestic and that's more than enough to justify sequels with cash left over for the hourly money fights I'm sure they have. 

&&I was very surprised there was no Infinity War trailer before my Black Panther showing.&&""...and get this man a shield!""&&Agreed, I actually thought he was the best part of the film.

So many other Marvel villians are cookie-cutter and 1-dimensional. Killmonger was great. He had purpose.&&Like an antelope in the Headlights&&[deleted]&&> They freeze.

I see a lot of people saying this phrase. What is it referring to?&&I actively dislike comic books (just the format of them), and I love comic book movies! They take what I *do* like about them (characters, plots, the fact that they can reboot and completely change the story, different timelines etc), and put them into a format i can dig, movies. I don't like reading one sentence of dialog per page. If I am going to read a book, I want more words than that, lol.&&This is why I've always said Marvel could make a MCU movie about an original character and if it was a good product it would still be a huge success. It would take the hit of ""Oh why does an OC get a movie before Moon Knight or Blackheart"" but it would still work.&&I think it's because it's a soccer/football movie marketed as one about neolithic/chalcolithic times.  

I imagine there are many who'd be into the latter but not the former.&&The thing is that the audience seeing Black Panther are a combo of regular mcu moviegoers and people seeing it as a larger cultural phenomenon.  My female cousin for instance who doesn't even know who Captain America is,  or Iron Man is,   wouldn't stop SnapChatting and posting about being at the premier. I'm not sure if Infinity War can capture that.  They'll need to really sell the Black Panther angle for ads. &&I think AoU suffered from middling reception.&&Age of Ultron had the Mayweather v Pacquiao match on it's Saturday, which hindered that days gross. But still, this is a monumental achievement for Black Panther. &&> three elderly African American women... when is the last time that demographic was tapped

Phrasing!&&I just saw it today at a morning showing and there were tons of elderly people there! You could tell they were really excited and a number were even dressed up for the occasion. It was pretty heartwarming not gonna lie&&I read almost all DC, but man, I watch the Marvel movies.

Still waiting on some kind of apology for Suicide Squad.&&> My friend said that the African accents weren’t good except for a couple people


African here. This is a big understatement.&&He sounded a lot like he did as Saw Guerrera in Rogue One.

Edit: Wrong movie.&&Just note that it's a big holiday weekend in China, for those not paying attention. &&This is very interesting, I would like to hear more about it. &&High, so many people at work (me and a group of friends included) couldn't even attempt to see the movie this weekend as tickets were sold out everywhere. &&It'll be tough. The best comparison will likely be The Avengers since similar opening and Cinemascore. That dropped 50.3% second weekend so it's possible but it will be tough. I wouldn't count out anything for this film at this point though. &&I don't know about 100 million but this movie should have pretty great legs&&The best part is we are guaranteed a badass sequel with the same cast and director hopefully&&I think Three Billboards crossed $100 million last week.&&I saw it right out side Oakland which met the location title with a huge cheers. There was even a community commercial for basketball courts before the movie. It was unexpected.&&I can't reiterate the IMAX experience enough. My first watch was in IMAX and second in a regular theater and I couldn't believe the dip in quality in certain scenes. For the ancestral land, the rich purples of the sky were incredibly gorgeous contrasted with the pitch black fur of the panthers. Unfortunately it wasn't as breathtaking in the non-IMAX setting.&&Well it's already started. The Reddit contrarions are already playing their greatest hits:

""Critics only liked this movie because it's a majority black cast.""

""I don't get the hype. It was good but it wasn't Citizen Kane. No onee actually thinks this but I'm going to keep saying it as a means to deliberately obfuscate how people actually feel about the movie and attack an opinion no one actually has.""

""The movie sucks because people are too excited about it. I don't actually assess the *film* in any critical way. I'm just going to lambast people that like it to a degree that I don't approve of.""&&The backlash against this movie has been in effect for a long time for lots of different reasons. People are even creating ""false flag"" events where they are saying black people are attacking white people in the theatre to deter people from seeing the movie.

Also look at how many 1/10 rating this movie has on IMDB.

I'd say Ragnarok does a good job of subverting expectations, really worth checking out. I honestly preferred it to Black Panther.

Homecoming is cozy, familiar, well-executed stuff. Nothing crazy radical but still a great film. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, at least to me, felt like a lazily written retread of the first film. &&Look into Afrofuturism&&Worth noting that the last 3 movies (Thor 3, spiderman, Dr strange) are the most different and my favourite of the MCU. Completely different to the other films&&I think they all had a contact high from Serkis. &&That's what I've been trying to think of a way to describe. Everybody on screen *felt* enthusiastic for their roles and the story they were telling. They put their all into it, and it showed. &&Would not put it past Marvel/Disney, at this point. And part of that is because they've made Wakanda a major part of IW's trailer promos, well before we knew BP would be a major hit.

I expect Marvel to push that message even harder in the next couple of months -- if you want more Wakanda, get your butt in the seats for INFINITY WAR.&&Infinity War is going to smash.&&DC would be good if they actually built up their characters. Give each hero their own proper story, and make us care about what happens to them before throwing them in a team-up movie. Can't really care about Cyborg when we literally only get a half an hour to learn about his character. 


&&not a b lister anymore lol&&To be frank, if you're looking for something that completely subverts the superhero genre and surprises you, this isn't for you. 

It's a pretty standard superhero fare with some complex, relevant themes dropped in there - as well as some fantastic performances across the board. &&Me too. I had zero desire to see BP but everyone that has says it’s one of the best super hero movies and the numbers tell that as well. Taking the kids today. &&What's always crazy to me is that he's just 31 years old! That's so much talent at such a young age!

That meme died last year&&The thing about The Greatest Showman is...&&What are we, some kind of Fantastic Four?&&Say that again &&100% missing out.

Honestly was an absolute TREAT in the theaters.

I love musicals though, so I am biased. Never Enough, gave me chills similar to how i got chills when i got to hear Idina Menzel sing Defying Gravity live at the pantages theater.

This movie is so fantastically beautiful, and just flat out fun. Which, its a movie about a circus. A lot of hate it gets is for being unfaithful to the facts, and taking liberties, and having VERY cliche/cheesy scenes... but IMO that is kinda the point, and felt very purposeful to me.

The movie is about a man who basically made a circus by selling fantasy, based on half truths, that gave the world an escape.  It would be a disservice for the movie itself to not do the same, taking a very ""meta"" approach to the content.

The songs are catchy, the dance numbers are entrancing, the cinematography is splendid eyecandy. You just have to be willing to accept its a musical about showmanship, so you should expect that treatment of the content.   

As soon as the credits hit I was ready to get back in line and buy tickets to see it again. And the theater was packed yesterday when i saw it.&&I legitimately only went because my wife wanted to see it. I ended up really enjoying it! &&If you want something with depth, you can ignore it. If you want something that's beautiful with some good songs but no substance, give it a shot.&&My wife and I loved The Greatest Showman (despite not caring much for the Hollywood autofellatio that was La La Land). However, you have to pretty much ignore that PT Barnum was a cosmic dickhole in real life and just take the movie for face value. The music is phenomenal, the story and characters are a lot of fun and Hugh Jackman is just amazing in it. &&[deleted]&&They should have left it in. Just completely blind side the audience. No explanation at all. Just Superman have a mustache now. Because that's what happens when Kryptonians ""die"". They probably would have made more money. I know I might have watched it.&&The most sure way to fuck-up is start doing one thing, and completely change it halfway through making it. That's some true incompetence at WB. The mind boggles. Someone is afraid they'll lose their job and freaking out, resulting in utter self-sabotage of the DCU.

Meanwhile, Marvel has everything planned 10 years ahead and sticking to it. &&Is someone else going to be taking over for you during those weeks or not?&&Not great, eh? I still expect his movies to be good, just because his early work is so fantastic. I was planning to see it but I'll probably just be disappointed as well.&&I'll take your word that it's not great, but this line from OP just baffles me:
> when most people don't even like the animation style to begin with

Who the hell doesn't like Aardman's style? Their entire studio is built upon its charm. I mean I'm considering seeing a mediocre sports movie just because I know it'll at least be fun to watch the crafted sets and characters...&&DC wouldn't know how to capitalize if a damn Shift key was glued to their fingers...lol&&That's a DC movie I would actually see.&&OMG Static Shock was everything. As a kid I didn't even realize how truly diverse it was until I checked it out again as an adult. Black lead with a gay best friend, Asians, Hispanics, the music, the urban culture, school shootings, etc. It was so ahead of it's time.&&Yes. They want to push Cyborg, but Static is their most culturally significant black character. &&*Featuring Steve Harvey as Gizmo.*&&So that's it huh was he in some kind of suicide squad?&&Will Smith is so popular that he's probably thought of by the general public as more a triple AAA actor rather than a 'black actor'. &&> It’s why I was amazed they got Wonder Woman so right.

They probably just thought it was ""some dumb girl movie"" and actually let the director and writers make an actually good film. &&> Still think they could easily have nabbed a good chunk of my generation by making a John Green Lantern movie.

For that matter, for our generation Cyborg is and always has been a Teen Titan. It was weird to make him a founding Justice League member.&&Considering how badly received the last Green lantern movie was, I can't blame them for dragging their feet with a reboot.&&To be honest, that basically exactly what they did with Guardians of the Galaxy. &&I really, *really* wish I could get into AoS. I'm a huuuuge Marvel fan and an avid browser of r/MarvelStudios. For some reason, I binged 3 seasons of AoS and just couldn't get into it.

Edit: I should clarify that I love Coulson and Ward, but I found myself not caring for any other character, and that was the issue.&&Doctor Strange beat Justice League&&2 good movies beating a not so good movie. Seems normal to me. &&Both *Thor 3* and *Black Panther* reviewed really well.

The kind of film you go back to see.&&Wouldn't that imply that MCU was being over confident and does in fact freeze?&&I've never believed in genre fatigue. People will pay to see good movies. 

The Divergent series for example didn't struggle because it was late for YA, it struggled because it sucks.&&Yeah holy shit. I think Justice League made over $657 million worldwide. That's very horrible compared to even their movies. Wonder what will happen to the DCEU?&&I think with superhero films we are seeing people mainly want something fresh and creative. People saw Wonder Woman cause it was the first female superhero film done well but they didn't see Justice League cause it felt like a weak retread of Avengers. &&People have bad movie fatigue.&&Or when you let Zac Snyder direct a 4th film after DC fans beg you to please stop.&&I finally got around to watching JL this weekend. I put it off for so long because I had heard/read so many bad things. And... yeah, it was bad. Almost Suicide Squad levels of bad. I don't get it. How does Marvel knock it out of the park almost every time with these obscure heroes like Ant Man, Guardians, and Black Panther, and DC can't make a Justice League movie work with three of the most popular comic book characters in the world?! The CG is bad, the dialog is meh, the stories are subpar... As more of a DC fan than a Marvel fan, it is really a bummer watching movies based on DC characters. (Although Wonder Woman broke the trend of suck and was surprisingly good. Rewatched that this weekend as well and even it had CG issues I just don't see or notice in Marvel films though.)&&Also proves that black people went to see it &&With one of the coolest costumes of any superhero.&&I work at one of the two theaters in our area, and we had a ton of spillover from BP being sold out. Mostly Jumanji and Greatest Showman, but 12 Strong and 15:17 to Paris also did well with it. 

Fifty Shades continues to sell out down here too. I can't figure out why. Then again, I still can't figure out why people like the books or the first two movies. But I'm not their demo, so I guess it makes sense. &&> Opening night for Black Panther certainly didn't help either haha

I actually ended up seeing Early Man only because black panther was sold out when we went to see it haha&&Yea, I went in only knowing who made it. It was really great, but from my own opinion on it, it was good *despite* the soccer not because of it. If the others I went with knew before hand we might not have even gone.

Just... sports ball movies are not an enjoyable thing to me and most that I know.

I hope it does well for them in long-term and international, since it was still a good movie and I want to see more sheep/gromit etc.&&""But I don't want to be a pie!""&&“The chickens are organizing!” Is a line still used by my family all these years later&&The world cup is this year. They should have released it around then and market it as a soccer film.&&I really want to see Early Man but choosing between it and Black Panther (because budget and time constraints) was a no brainer. Black Panther was a lotta fun. &&It's exactly what it should be. fun family adventure movie suitable for all ages. cast works well together, it's a new script with a new take on the original jumanji film, it was highly entertaining....and it has the the Rock

will it win any awards? no. but it entertained me and the rest of the theater for 2 hours.
&&The camera quality looks cheap, like a high-budget porn film.&&Didn't even purchase a human baby for American Sniper.

That was the prequel&&Man, this movie doesn’t just not start with the attack, it starts with the dudes in middle school, then military stuff, then European vacation, then train attack.&&I dunno, I saw Trouble with the curve and it just seemed like a bitter counter-argument to Moneyball (that Amy Adams was inexplicably dragged into)&&>Jingoistic

Have you seen Flags of our Fathers? That is a critical a film as you can make without being Michael Moore.&&I don't think it's gonna bomb, it's just gonna make normal-marvel-movie money.&&It’s kinda like when Shuri wanted to upgrade his EMP things and they had that little exchange. 
“They work just fine! Why upgrade them?”
“Just because they are functional doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be improved.” 

I think that shows why Marvel is so successful now. They could’ve easily made movies like Thor 2. Thor 2 was bad compared to the other MCU movies but it still made insane amounts of money and they just turned it up 10 notches with Thor Ragnarok. &&Yeah, same. I guess they didn't want to show that all of the characters make it out alive right before they show the movie.&&He was so nuanced. Probably Marvel's best villain yet.&&Its a phrase from the Black Panther movie.&&It was also ""just"" a sequel to The Avengers. It didn't really provide anything exciting and fresh compared to The Avengers or now Black Panther. Infinity War should bust past that by bringing in so many new characters that it will feel like an event in the same way the first Avengers was.&&Oh right, then Avengers III is going to be have an even bigger opening weekend than I thought. I had a small feeling maybe the hype for Avengers was reduced after age of ultron, but no.

Think it's going to break the opening weekend record?&&I’m starting to really dig the Marvel movies, Black Panther was a character I’ve never heard of until Civil War and I’m hyped for this movie. Suicide Squad was a disaster &&Yea my friend used words like horrendous and such. My friend said M’Baku(Mountain tribe leader played by Duke Winston) had a pretty good accent. Which other actors had good accents? Also which accents were notoriously bad?  &&Once of the boxoffice shows I watch on youtube said that they are keeping foreign movies out until the holiday is over which is why Black Panther hasn't opened in China yet.&&Same here, I don't know if there was a single not sold out show in NYC lol&&This is true, there were over 100 showings in my area over the weekend and I barely squeezed my wife and I into the latest Sunday IMAX showing that still ended up selling out. I watched countless people get turned away while I was in line. &&Live close to fairly big metro area,can confirm there's a show every freaking 40minutes and every single one is sold out.&&Marvel had better offer Ryan Coogler the moon to stay on. More Black Panther, and money to fund whatever passion project he wants, a win/win for everyone.&&Black Repanther &&Coogler dropped in on Opening night at the Grand Lake theater (the theater he went to as a kid). Mad respect to him. Always enjoy a bit of love given to Oakland in movies. Hope we get a couple shots from Antman and the Wasp since that's also Bay Area related. And they legitimately were able to film there. Kinda sad coogler didn't get a chance to film in Oakland as well, but the tribute is dope.&&There was literally an askreddit thread where a week ago, where a guy said Black Panther is the most overrated movie of all time, and it hadn't even come out yet(got like 700 upvotes). 

That backlash began before it came out.&&So brief context here: I'm a black African male, who's been a comics fan since I was a child. So none of this is motivated by race or being out of touch with what they were trying to portray in the movie.


Black Panther is a good movie, but no masterpiece. It has a different setting, and some good visuals, but it has its fair share of weak points. I've had lengthy debates with my friends about this movie since Thursday, because I went into it as a film fan first off, and a black African second. That allowed me to be more objective about the movie, and to assess it on its own merits. What I came away with, was that it was ambitious and well-timed, but outside of that, nothing about it particularly stands out. It doesn't break the Marvel formula in any transcendent manner, and it's by-the-numbers for vast stretches.

I hope that, when the conversation around its social and political standing has died down, people can look at it more objectively. I fully understand what the movie means to people, but I would also like to be able to say it's standard Marvel fare without being flamed for it.&&I'm seeing a lot of this stuff already and it's maddening. Meanwhile, I feel like the film isn't getting enough credit for being really fucking ambitious. Black Panther throws a lot into the mix, things that would easily drown other movies, but the vast majority of it works. 

People say how they want different and original feeling movies and Black Panther is like a buffet of concepts. To me it's like the reverse of TLJ. That movie tried to subvert the franchise, but most of it was ineffective and fell flat. BP subverts the Marvel formula, but pretty much all of it works. Now it's like, since this works Marvel can do fucking anything. &&Internet racists are the most pathetic impotent people on the planet&&I've heard of it recently! It was actually mentioned in a Reddit comment on what of the *Black Panther* trailers. It's disappointing that there are relatively few examples.&&I got contact high just from watching him XD&&Blud fam intensifies&&#wengerout&&They can't use Efron in the UCL since he already played with Highschool Musical, so now they're down a striker&&They always try to sing it in?&&The Fantastic Showman &&That's F4ntastic news&&I agree, I do typically like musicals too though. Granted I will say it's very predictable, doesn't cover the real barnum, and nothing we haven't seen before. Like you said cliche at times. 

That said, it just does its job well.  It doesn't try to be anything other than an enjoyable musical, hitting the typical plot points, and it works if that what you expect. Reminds me of a marvel movie, if you like the genre and don't expect something deep and groundbreaking you'll probably like it. &&On the flip side, the Stache is looking amazing in mission impossible... I’m honestly hyped to see cavil in a different role for once. He was amazing in Man from Uncle.&&/u/mi-16evil do you want one of the other mods to raise your baby in your absence?&&It was pretty much just a sports movie&&It's a good movie for kids, and there are some great wordplay. Was just expecting something different. 
As for the animation, I agree with you. Idk why OP said that. I'm a huge fan of that kind of animation. I'm a sucker for those. &&> Who the hell doesn't like Aardman's style? 

Since stop-motion movies tend to do fairly badly or just okay I would say most people.

I could never figure out why they moved him to JL from TT, but they had an all new Teen Titans team at the time also. &&Oh God season 4 is fantastic. They started doing ""pods"" where the overarching story focuses in different things while still maintaining a larger story so they avoid villain of the week. Season 4 had ghost rider, Life Model Decoys (androids) and a ""what if..."" Storyline about if each character had changed their biggest regret,  and it's like classic marvel comics. Maybe try hopping back into season 4 once you feel up for more binging, they really made some of the best television I've ever seen.  &&Tilda Swinton's Inception fights were worth seeing twice in theaters.&&Guardians of the fucking Galaxy beat Justice League. &&Black Panther beating a movie with Batman and Superman in it isn't surprising? &&If JL was released a few years ago, it probably would have done a lot better even if it was exactly the same movie. The genre as a whole has higher standards now, and it's still impressive previously unknown characters like Black Panther are not only meeting those standards, but exceeding it. &&They're not talking about the quality of the movies. They're talking about the characters starring in the movies. You have Marvel heroes who were completely unknown before their movies kicking the scrap out of a team up movie featuring two of the most famous superheroes in history. &&[Like an antelope in headlights?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhumans_(TV_series\))&&Still gets the girl in the end tho&&As I see it, it should be called ""the end of genre hype"" instead of ""genre fatigue"". When a new genre gets in vogue there is a lot of people to go watch all the movies that follow that genre. There is a unfilled need to see stories be told like that so even though the movies aren't that great they fill a cultural void.

""Genre fatigue"" kicks in when that void is filled and people get more picky about what specific movies they choose to see. So you can no longer make a guaranteed profit of a shit movie.

This is a pretty big aspect of the concept in my opinion anyway.

&&Hey that reminds me, anyone know if they ever making that final movie, or mini-series thing... are they ending it?&&I think Aquaman's success or failure will say alot. Wonder Woman 2 is safe no matter what.&&It's moving forward. I'm cautiously optimistic for Aquaman.&&>didn’t see Justice League cause it felt like a weak retread of Avengers.

man this would have been such a weird sentence 15-20 years ago. &&> they didn't see Justice League cause it felt like a weak retread of Avengers.

DC is rushing to play catch-up.  The execs wanted instant Avengers and thought if they put all the ingredients in a blender MILLIONS. 

If they had copied the entire sequence idea and started with a few one-offs, like made Wonder-Woman the start of the series, then had a forming the Justice League thing, with initially Lex and Bruce being on the same side.  ""Mister Wayne, Bruce, humanity has a problem and it's only you and I that see it.  Earth has a protective guardian, an American ... God.  Unstoppable.  Invincible.  Immortal.  What happens if ...""  

""... if he decides to rule us instead of protect us?""  

""Exactly.  What happens to Justice if we live under tyranny forever?  Are we Kryptionian slaves?  One man in a bat costume can't stop Him, no matter how hard you train, Bruce.""  

The Nightmare / Injustice sequence could have been run as inside a simulator showing ""what if He snaps?"" and if not its own movie (which would be fucking amazing) should have been more than a snapshot.  

Also Aquaman should be a musical. &&No, they didn't want to see Justice League because every movie before it (excepting WW) was bad and a mess, and they expected (rightly) JL would be more of the same. There is no ""safety"" to the brand whatsoever now, while Marvel Studios could put out a Squirrel Girl or Quasar movie and people would inherently trust the movie to be absolutely enjoyable at a minimum.&&Which makes me wonder, how long can Marvel keep introducing new stuff? Granted, they've got plenty of characters left in the barrel especially if the Fox deal goes through, but eventually those D level characters' lack of quality will start to show, right?

And second, do you reach a point where the MCU is just TOO expansive and it starts causing problems?&&fifty shades is kinky porn but mainstream, so a bunch of (mostly old) people that have been taught kinky porn is a horrible thing can watch it without feeling bad about it, and they don't care that it's a horribly abusive relationship because who cares, it's porn, but they also don't notice it sucks, for a porn, because they don't usually watch kinky porn

it's also an erotic thriller, and they straight up don't make those anymore, in the '90s fifty shades would have been one in a thousand, but today it has no competition for what it offers&&I wasn’t interested in the first movie at all. I watched it in the background of a new year’s eve party. But the second had an actual storyline (even if incredibly unbelievable) and appealed to the rich, mysterious, thinks an average woman is special, super hot, caring “daddy” fantasy that women naturally love to swoon at even if it’s not what they’re actually into romantically. &&> spillover from BP 

heh&&Same, went in with my father... Didnt know about the soccer element in it... Still enjoyable tho ! &&I don’t like gravy! &&This quote made me realise I really need to watch this again.&&Ooof, that was a terrible miscalculation on their part. That would have been a much better plan. &&Completely agree! I was entertained the entire time, the actors worked wonderfully together, and I left smiling. It’s definitely a movie I wouldn’t hesitate seeing if what I wanted to see was sold out. Saw it with my friends (mid 20’s) and little brother who is 8. All of us were laughing. &&No, you're misconstruing it. The first baby couldn't make it, the back up baby didn't show. So he filled in with a doll.&&Usually you can't legally purchase human babies.&&ah, no wonder they took so long to get to the train part&&> That was the prequel

Which was such a strange decision. I don't think it was at all necessary to spend two and a half hours focusing on a ticket clerk letting passengers know the 15:16 to Paris may be slightly delayed. &&So its basically a biography of the three dudes? &&That wasn't an Eastwood film, he acted in it but he wasn't the director. &&I don't think any MCU villain has had better last words than Killmonger did. That one hit hard.&&Infinity War benefits from being marketed as the ""climax"" of the current MCU&&I really can't think of any accents that were good. The inconsistency is what made them unbearable. I dunno how to explain this but it basically sounded like they borrowed accents from different areas of the continent for different dialogues for the same character. You can clearly tell whether someone is from West,East,South or North Africa just from how they enunciate. So the accents were already messy to begin with, and then they exaggerated them. I'm fairly certain this comment won't make sense to you because I don't know how to explain what is second nature to me. &&The best accents were M’Baku (he basically had a Nigerian accent which is probably why he was my fav), Nakia, Okoye, and W’Kabi. Basically all the actors with African parents (minus Winston Duke). Leticia Wright was okay too.

The worst were Angela Basset and honestly Chadwick Boseman. I was also surprised how bad Forest Whitaker’s was considering he played a pretty convincing Idi Amin. 

&&Klau's accent was spot on, it sounded like the Afrikaaner accent in S.Africa.

I wasn't a fan of T'challa's accent, he didn't quite get the accent I believe he was going for. 
&&Couldn’t get tickets for Thursday or Friday in NYC, thankfully we were out of town in Cleveland for the weekend and were able to catch a Friday later showing as soon as we landed.  Will def be watching it again in NYC this week if I can with the wife.  &&Yeah he is going to negotiate a major pay-day for himself for BP2. Coogler now has the ear of every major studio in Hollywood. Also he's 31 and I hate him for how crazy successful he is, lol.&&To be fair,  700 isn't that many upvotes for an Ask Reddit post.&&I literally just got done watching it. I think you're right. Some stuff they did great, some stuff not so well. The jokes we terrible. Visuals were awesome. The giving the villain screen time and to see his emotions were awesome. 

[My favorite part was when is in the after life talk to his father after he loses the challenge. His father tells him it's time for him to come to the afterlift and BP rejects that and gives an uplifting ""we must help people"" speech that really touched me. His decision to take Wakanda in a new direction shows that he is ready to be his own King.](#spoiler)&&Kilmonger was a great villain and was not by any means whatsoever following the Marvel formula. If there is anything I wasn't that impressed with it was probably the CGI at some points. Also I think the final fight had too much CGI just like in Wonder Woman.&&There's no doubt that part of this movie's success is because it represents a group that is underrepresented in Hollywood. Same thing can be said about Wonder Woman. I personally felt that movie was lackluster and overrated, but I am biased towards Marvel anyways.

As for Black Panther, I definitely look forward to seeing it. Much like the cosmic MCU movies, it seems to have stunning visuals, add to that a political dynamic that differs from most Marvel movies and what seems to be a humanized villain (as in, we actually get to see emotions and sympathize with his motivations) it looks to be great. However, contrary to opening weekend numbers, I'm not going into it expecting it to be the second greatest Marvel movie of all time, as I do understand a driving force of that is it appeals to a wider audience.

As you said, I would definitely like to talk about this film and others like it based on its cinematic merits, rather than the sociopolitical landscape of our culture when it came out. &&I agree with your assessment. I'm a white European male and I thoroughly enjoyed most of the movie, *especially* the African 'stuff', but it still badly dragged at the 2/3 mark.&&[deleted]&&I'm a big fan of Afro-futurism, and I genuinely think that Black Panther is gonna be the shot in the arm that kicks it *hard* into the mainstream.

That's one of the reasons I think BP is already gonna be a cultural touchstone, not just because of it's resonation with Black audiences, but because it's going to be the movie to push a really interesting genre into prominence, and I'm hoping that it helps anchor Afro-futurism in people's minds.

Quite possibly, BP does for that genre what the Avengers did for superhero team mashups.&&Only someone with an immense knowledge of Bond films could possibly take over. ;-)&&To add on here, it definitely was just a kids sports movie about cavemen. Which would have been okay if I didn't think the movie was something completely different. But... oh well. I still laughed like a kid, and had an okay time. Not their best movie, at all, but it isn't the worst thing they've ever done either. &&they do caps and shift though&&Yeah, I plan on going back eventually because I love me some Ghost Rider, and I feel like I should finish it so that I'm completely ""in the know"" for the MCU. I work from home, and unless I'm working on something that's sound-sensitive, I usually have a show or movie playing on TV. It's just a matter of eventually ""feeling up"" for it. I'm seeing Black Panther tonight, so that might push me over the tipping point again.&&I felt like Season 3 was the weakest since the first part of season 1, but Season 4 was *really* good. &&Those mirror world scenes were nuts on LSD.&&Yeah, but guardians is great. It's easily one of the best in the MCU and it did great in the box office too&&People clamour for movies with talking raccoons and trees though. It's the classic Hollywood formula.  
   &&I think that's largely because Marvel spent years building up good will.  DC did the exact opposite: spent years creating poor adaptations, movies people didn't like generally.  It shouldn't be too surprising then that people wanted to avoid DC movies that continued the bad trends while Marvel continued the good ones.&&Batman vs Superman killed any hope I had for justice league. Everything has been so predictably formulaic and ""serious"", it's just not fun to watch anymore.&&Not even a little bit to me. Audiences don't live in a complete vacuum and Justice League did poorly because people watched some of the films leading up to it. I'd say one could argue that this current iteration of Batman and Superman are departures of the characters and currently nobody cares about them. I don't think I'd see a single film with either of those characters unless a full reboot of them is done. 

People also saw Black Panther in a huge movie (Civil War) so it was established that this iteration wasn't a shit character. &&After a string of bad movies (Green Lantern, Superman Returns, Suicide Squad). It's not surprising at all. &&Relatively unknown characters make for better movies.  I know who Batman, Superman, Wolverine are, and a movie about them needs to fit in that already established narrative, which sucks from a creative storytelling standpoint.  Black Panther - heard of him, vaguely remember him from my comics-reading days in the 80's.  So a filmmaker doing Black Panther movie now has a lot of creative room to make a good movie with a good story rather than a picture show of what I already expected.&&It's simple really. People trust MCU to put out solid movies. DCEU has lost the trust of the public with their movies and how they handle the characters. &&Are you finished? &&Let us all as a collective human being try to forget that this thing ever existed, just like nick cage ghost rider &&that makes sense. It's sorta like how the first live action alice in wonderland film made a ton of money coasting off the 3-d hype from avatar, despite being a mediocre movie.&&Agreed. Superhero films will do fine as long as they’re good and offer something new.&&And consider that superhero movies have massive appeal across so many demographics. There's a reason why Disney bought Marvel - superheroes are fun for all ages, pretty much forever, unless media culture just changes and kids stop liking superheroes.&&Also does help marvel tries to make its movies of different style. &&Yeah, I think you nailed it. Same thing happening in video games right now too with the Battle Royale genre. Frankly the games in that genre are just not that good, but they're the only options we have at the moment so they're seeing tons of success.

&&I think the lead actress left the series because a TV movie wasn't what she signed up for,  so they're in limbo right now. &&Plus that one I think takes place during the cold war. Definitely gonna see that one!&&I mean it's being directed by James Cameron and Vinnie Chase will be great in the lead role. Really high hopes for this movie.&&Aquaman was one of my favorite things about Justice League. Can't wait to see the trailer.&&Hell even just 8-10 years ago. With just Ironman under their belt, Marvel still was kinda on the ""hmmm that's interesting"" list while DC came out with The Dark Knight. Justice League was potentially still on the table as something awesome in the future while Avengers was more a pipedream. &&It's unbelievably disappointing that DC hasn't figured out live action movies yet. I grew up watching Batman and Superman TAS, both of which were surprisingly mature and complex for a 30 minute cartoon production. Now DC is kind of a laughing stock. I was so pissed off after Man of Steel.

Sure we got Nolan's trilogy (which for the most part was great), but it's continually ridiculous that DC hasn't figured it out and we're like 10 years into this superhero movie craze.

Edit: I know X-men & Spiderman were at the start of the 00s (and Batman/Superman movies were even before that), but Iron Man in 2008 really feels like more of the catalyst for the ""Movie Universe"" concept that is burning me out right now. We had superhero movies before 2008, yes, but we didn't have a new one every seemingly 6 months.

Edit2: I was so pissed off after Man of Steel that I haven't bothered seeing the other DC movies. All of which (save Wonderwoman) have gotten worse reviews, so I feel like I made the right decision.&&**The world is changing.**&&It is absolutely insane the little kids want to dress up as Black Panther, Captain America, & Iron Man instead of Superman, Batman, Lantern, or Wonder Woman. 

DC screwed up hard. &&It's because the DC movies are bad (with the exception of Wonder Woman). Zack Snyder is a bad director who's overall asthetic is too dark for a superhero movie, can't tell a story to save his life, edits poorly and, his worst sin, favors cinematically beautiful moments over the cost of everything else. &&I'd pay double to see squirrel girl in the MCU.&&I mean when Marvel threw Guardians 1 at us, Hooked on a Feeling was a really, really cocky choice... That was a damn accurate assessment as well.&&[deleted]&&The thing I didn't like about WW was the final battle which I suspect JL would be mostly focus on. Black Panther also had a pretty disappointing battle at the end.

Most of these superhero movies tend to have a final battle choreographed by a six year-old playing with action figures.&&Two pronged response to a two-pronged question:

- There are very few characters that Marvel couldn't adapt to movies or Netflix. Remember, Iron Man was B-level, at best, and the Guardians of the Galaxy had speculators legit worried people wouldn't turn out because they were practically nobodies to the mass audience (also: Remember that *Howard the Duck* is running around in space somewhere). As long as the Marvel Formula keeps up (for good and bad), there's no reason to think that a character's comic history or lack of notoriety will be a problem. (Hoping for Moon Knight to land in the Netflix side, myself).

- Expansion, however, is a very real concern, even before factoring in what they may do if the Fox deal goes through. I can only think that there will be two approaches to it that keeps the problem in check: (a) Keep the X-Men separate, and (b) not be afraid to complete character arcs/kill them off over the course of the MCU. We'll get a real answer to (b) with Infinity War.&&Marvel makes genre movies that contain superheroes.   Winter soldier was a spy thriller.  Ant man was a heist.  Guardians was sci-fi.

I'd say marvel can release 1 movie per month if they keep the genres diverse and budget based on genre.  &&It's not even kinky. It's what a repressed person imagines kinky looks like. They do some light bondage, the occasional spank, then they take the bonds off and do it missionary.

Apparently most of the sex scenes are missionary with his pants on, and the lead actor has a no nudity clause in his contract. For a ""steamy bondage thriller"" it sounds unbelievably chaste.&&I miss a good erotic thriller, sadly Michael Douglas got too old. That erotic thriller throne has been left unseated for over 10 years now. &&It holds up &&What did the babies already have plans or something?&&""Usually"" &&Not with that attitude you can't.&&Dramatized biography except they spend a comical amount of the runtime doing vacation stuff that doesn’t matter.

Other than all three of them meeting up in Germany and them deciding to take the train to Paris, it’s literally like 25 minutes of them just on vacation saying nothing of value.&&So much that I think Ant-Man and the Wasp *may not* do that well. Oh who am I kidding, it'll still top Ant-Man's gross as a result of spill-over hype from Infinity War.&&[deleted]&&Na, it makes perfect sense. Its like when people try for a generic European accent by just throwing together French and German accents with some coughing noises.&&It's honestly insane how consistently good he has been so far. Fruitvale Station has a 94% on RT and made 17.4 Million on a $900,000 budget. Creed has a 95% on RT and made $170 Million, BP has 97% on RT and made over $200 Million opening weekend just in the US. He is 3/3. He will probably be able to direct whatever movie he wants after this.

EDIT: I know he is not doing Creed 2, I was wrong, you do not need to keep telling me.&&Good news is i think he had a great experience with Marvel, so he's likely to return after a few more projects. Given the sequel probably isn't going to be made for at least a couple more years, he has time for at least 1-2 different projects before he will need to revisit the franchise.&&> Visuals were awesome

I loved the setting and concept of the visuals. But I thought the CGI was a little off. Some of the animation looked unnatural and cartoonish.

&&Not the OP but here’s my take. 

Spoilers ahead:

The villian in this film is the one that goes on a hero’s journey. From Killmonger’s perspective, this story is actually really similar to Lion King, the ultimate Hero’s Journey. He finds his father dead one day with wounds suffered from his own brother. Years later, he returns to his home land and kills the current king by throwing him off a cliff, reclaiming the throne. Sound familiar? 

But once he comes into power some of the Wakandans realize that his politics are way too extreme so Nakia and Shuri and Angela Bassett revive T’Challa and stop him. 

Cut out that last part, and it’s a very clear Hero’s Journey. I don’t think Marvel has ever attempted something like that with a villian, but it certainly worked. 

In contrast, BP himself had a mostly inward journey. His inner conflicts about Wakanda saying in hiding or coming out of the shadows are his main arc in the film. &&The Marvel films, since Iron Man on forward, focus on building a traditional origin for the hero in a standard 3 act format. They purposefully don't focus on villains and keep a standard girlfriend/mentor/sidekick supporting cast. They tend to ground themselves in a particular subgenre. They have a rep for being more jokey than serious. The heroes also don't change much and there's little in the way of stakes. The villain comes and goes with little fanfare. There's little to ponder about and are mostly spectacles of action.

Black Panther bucks most of this: 
It's not an origin. Most of he flashbacks center on the villain and the movie does a lot to develop his motivations. The film is more of an ensemble piece with the title character not even present for large chunks of the film. A few different genres are mashed up in this here to the point it feels like a completely different move in parts. It borrows from Bond, Game of Thrones, and all sorts of other media. Aside from a couple jokes from the more excitable characters, Black Panther is mostly dead serious. T'Challa changes the whole philosophy of himself and his nation. The villain changes the entire course of history for what may be the entire MCU. Black Panther gives you *a lot* to think about after the film and has some important things to say about race and politics, but without being preachy. There's also a strong emotional core to the film that we haven't really seen in a Marvel movie, or maybe any superhero movie. &&What if they think George Lazenby is the best Bond?&&I recommend it. Initially I was sceptic about the Ghost Rider, if done wrong it will ruin any scene or episode due to cringiness. I was expecting them to get it wrong actually. They fucking nailed it man. The character arc is excellent, the actor is phenomenal, the special effects and transformation into GR is effortless and, frankly, they couldn't have done it better even if they had a movie budget. Perfect. And the story in Season 4 is extremely fast paced and it takes you to some places you never thought you'd go. Highly *highly* recommended.&&I agree.  Personally the whole inhumans Storyline was alright,  but I don't think HIVE would have worked if he wasn't played by you-know-who. I also felt the astronaut was a waste of a character. &&Dr Strange in 3d and on lsd was one of the wildest things I've ever seen. I lost track so many times of what was in the movie and what was just in my mind and I loved every moment of it.&&But barely anyone knew who Guardians were before the first movie and Justice League is the fucking Justice League. &&I was escalating the previous poster's comment. Dr Strange is one of those ""That's really a comic book character?"" types of characters, but the comic world knew about him easily. Guardians of the Galaxy were so far in the unknown that even some comic book fans had to google them. If we're going by tiers, Dr Strange would be on a B or C tier. Guardians of the Galaxy were on a Z level tier before their movie.&&>Yeah, but guardians is great. It's easily one of the best in the MCU and it did great in the box office too

Yeah it was a good movie, but they point is that the comic that it is sourced from was a total third-tier book. No one give a shit about Guardians until the movie came out.

That's also why I'm kind of surprised Black Panther was pushed so hard. He's not as low level as the Guardians were, but he also wasn't anywhere near a top-tier character prior to the movie coming out.&&Guardians is great but it was basically an experiment by Marvel.  They took a comic with about 12 fans throughout the world, gave us a movie where none of the characters get an origin story, and watched what happened.  It was basically a 200 million dollar gamble that paid off greatly. &&There's also the way Marvel put the time and effort into world-building that DC simply didn't. For example, before the first ensemble Marvel movie (*The Avengers*), the Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America had all had their own stand-alone movies, Black Widow had been an important secondary character in *Iron Man 2* and even Hawkeye had a number of cameos - not going into any great detail about the character, but at least enough to make you go, ""Hey, I've seen that guy before.""

Whereas with the DCEU, there was *Man of Steel*, *Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice* and *Wonder Woman* before *Justice League*, which brought in *three* new major characters in the form of the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.

See the difference?&&Also I think they did an excellent job of marketing Guardians as a funny, slightly more light-hearted movie. The MCU in general has been really good at adding the correct amount of humor to the movies (especially with some of the small interactions between Stark, Thor, and Cap - shwarma sticks out to me the most lol) and they used Guardians to elevate that even more. On the other hand, like tons of people have commented, all of the DC movies have been rather dark (there was some humor - Wonder Woman's interactions with the outside world for example) but on the whole they've been dark - it worked in the Nolan trilogy because he really went in on the darkness of the Gotham and Batman as a character, but he did it really well cause of his directing style.&&And it came out right after Thor 3. Both of which did worse than Jumanji, incidentally&&I've seen every Marvel movie, and I never even considering seeing Justice League. The Snyder DC movies I've seen just seem so joyless, and that's pretty much the exact opposite reason I want to see a superhero movie. There's a place for grim, dark, introspective superhero stories. But not for the tentpoles movies of the franchise.&&That's the problem with Superman.  

How do you have struggles when you're an invincible immortal alien with unlimited power?  

Superman's problems are how to relate to the humans he's chosen to spend his life with.  That's why he's friends with Bruce, because Bruce is Kal's relationship with humans distilled into a rubber suit.  

And Kal's aware, painfully aware, that he'll win any fight with Bruce.  He'll be friends with him, they'll fight together, and one day Superman will be Batman's pallbearer, unchanged, while his best friend falls to the wrecking ball of time.  Then he'll adopt another human, I guess.  &&I think that's a huge part of it. A big problem people had with Man of Steel and BvS was ""That's not how Superman is supposed to act!"".

Whereas with Iron Man, who's quite a bit different in the comics, most people say ""Wow, RDJ *is* Tony Stark"" because they haven't seen anyone else portray him.&&**""DELETE THAT FOOTAGE""**&&Are you donnnneeee&&Avatar may not be the best movie, but it is definitely the best 3D movie. With the exception of Gravity, no other movies have made good use of 3D.&&True facts. Thor: the Dark World was a very different movie than Thor: Ragnarok, and Captain America: the Winter Soldier was a very different movie from Civil War.&&holy fuck can we just have all our Wonder Woman movies be war anthologies? I am so okay with that.

Plus you could do an overarching theme of war never changes, or even going full existential and saying *people* never change either and her efforts are for nothing.&&The director and cast line ups for the upcoming DC films are great. I just hope studio bullshit doesn't get in the way again.&&Really? I hated Aquaman in Justice League, seeing him go from serious to dudebro was absolutely jarring. They should've cast Jason as Lobo instead. &&> DC came out with The Dark Knight

More like Nolan came out with the Dark Knight and he needed DC's permission to do it. If DC was half as involved as Marvel from the beginning, their universe (if you can even call it that at this point) would probably be doing much better. 

They want the darker, grittier universe (why, I have no idea, you have Superman and Wonder Woman), and Nolan made the darkest, grittiest mainstream superhero movies, but they were asleep at the wheel and that trilogy was gone before they could make anything out of it. &&I disagree... Iron Man was made with Avengers in mind. Of course if Iron Man flopped, the project may have been pushed back or canceled but was in the works from the start of Iron Man. Think something like 2005 Marvel had set it's eye on a possible assemble movie.

Warner in the other hand pretty solid in doing stand alone movies. The Dark Knight trilogy was meant to be stand alone and Warner never made any attempt to trying to connect it's movies. 2011's Green Lantern is a stand alone movie as well... no intention into bring in it to the wide world.

Warner was planning for years a stand alone Superman movie. Man of Steel was to be that movie... until Avengers Happened and just smashed box offices. Than they shifted slightly to make it the first of the ""DC Cinematic Universe"". Warner is just reacting to what Marvel is creating.&&Their biggest obstacle is that they're not letting the uniqueness of their characters shine through. I don't want to see DC's version of Iron Man or Thor; I want to see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Flash. I want the complex relationships that reflect decades worth of some of the most influential material in comic books. I want a fresh take on the action, and the characters and their personalities. I want my Superman to inspire hope, my Batman to be a slightly unhinged master detective, my GL to be a happy-go-lucky fella who can still get serious. If they followed the formula of the animated universe, they'd be successful. As it stands, they're trying to make Marvel movies, but, like, darker and with more slow motion. Who does that even appeal to?&&Couldn't agree more. It's a shame these mostly awful adaptations made as much money as they did, because if they had flopped like Justice League did, WB would have gotten the message alot sooner and we could've gotten a much stronger reboot ala Spider-Man: Homecoming immediately following TASM series. But now we're stuck with a universe where only one film was decent, instead of one that could be great from the outset and continue to get stronger with each new film.

I miss the days of Nolan's Batman trilogy where DC films were actually my most anticipated releases of their respective years. Now, it's the complete opposite. &&DC had a big hit with a ""revisionist"" superhero story with Nolan's Batman trilogy, and revisionist takes can be appealing when they exist briefly in contrast to the more classical takes, but ultimately what most people want out of superheroes is heroism. They want adventure and fun and heroic individuals inspiring regular people to heroism. Marvel nailed that understanding early on. DC has been shackled by some early success with ""dark gritty"" revisionist takes and hasn't been able to pull back from that. Honestly to some degree I think DC's own fans are hobbling them a bit too. Too many of the fans they're listening to are 40-somethings rather than the young people that comic books were always meant to appeal to.

For example, Logan was fantastic, but part of what allowed it to be fantastic was the history of less grimdark Wolverine films before it. It works gorgeously as a standalone but if you tried to make a franchise out of that version of Logan I expect interest would peter out quickly.

The classic DC animated series (Batman, Superman, Justice League) did a great job of balancing sometimes somber material with the heroism and fun people expect from superhero stories, and with grasping the nature of which heroes lended themselves more to one way or another. A grim dark knight Batman works, a grim Superman only works for a little while before he needs to be the symbol of hope again.
&&Well it obviously doesn't help that DC doesn't have control over their media adaptations and the people in charge over at WB just see pay checks and a chance to tell bible analogies or whatever. Not to mention others have a hatred in the source material, just adapting the Justice League pilot arc would have done wonders but whatever chance JL was fucked from the moment that they had to follow up BvS.&&I’ve said it before I’ll say it again, I liked Man of Steel but it shouldn’t have been the first Superman movie to set everything up. They should have had a movie setting him up and having him be all happy and then done Man of Steel to make him see that it can’t always be good times.&&**It's time we change too.**&&Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...and ***Mordor***.&&We're getting a [New Warriors show](http://deadline.com/2017/07/marvels-new-warriors-cast-milana-vayntrub-squirrel-girl-derek-theler-1202126199/) with Milana Vayntrub as Squirrel Girl.

So disappointing.

I think the 3rd act of BP played out very well. Not perfect, but much better than WW in that respect.&&honestly, a netflix series that leans into Moon Knight's mental problems (like Punisher did with PTSD) would be amazing. Having a series a la Fight Club where there's a not-so-reliable narrator would be a fun thing to try out. The latest comic run, while not my fave, has been experimenting with this quite a bit.&&Howard isn't exactly just somewhere. Remember, The Collector had him. Which might have been my favorite part. Marvel made enough money they're willing to acknowledge Howard the Duck does still exist and isn't even enough to scare them anymore. 

They definitely do have a problem not killing anyone so far though. The size of the Infinity War cast shows that. If they don't take the opportunity to kill off most of the first generation there they will be very limited in growth. 

At least a few of Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, Cap need to die, and you need the next generation, probably led by Black Panther or Bucky as Cap to take command.&&Not sure about Moon Knight as a TV show. So far, my opinion on most of them has been meh. Although if there's a character that would work with the grittiness of the Netflix series they have, it'd probably be Moon Knight. &&Exactly, frankly almost all of the MCU properties were not really A-level. I read comics most of my childhood and I never thought of the Avengers as more than a second-rate Justice League. The X-Men were what I thought of as on-par with the Justice League. Even Iron Man and Thor and Captain America were kind of jokes. I'd never even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, and Ant-Man and Doctor Strange were nowhere near A-List either. The Hulk might really be the only A-list character at the start of the MCU, and ironically his movie is considered one of the weakest. Marvel's real A-list properties (Spiderman, Fantastic Four, X-Men) had all been sold off to other studios who didn't want to let them go. Marvel basically was forced to make a cinematic universe work without its A-list heroes and they have done a great job so far.
&&1movie per month is too much, each movie needs a few months to stay in theaters to make the most money&&That's one of the most important things that keep Marvel fresh. Civil war had elements of political thriller, Ragnarok was buddy comedy, Spiderman is kinda coming of age movie and then you have Dr. Strange which is closest to Marvel formula but still differs from others by its visuals and magic elements.

That was a clear intention by them made sometime in phase 2 to prevent superhero movies fatigue. &&My buddy and I were just talking about this. Marvel movies are almost like ice cream. They all are generally the same thing, but have a different flavor to them. Everyone will have a different favorite, but there will be some that are decent go to's. &&It's not even rated the equivalent of R in France. 12-year-olds are allowed to see it. And no one cares.

Black Panther making 1.7B confirmed&&[deleted]&&Not to mention, Killmonger is one of the best representations of the idea that “we create our own monsters.” Even if someone does something good, great sadness and even evil can come from the result. And that in the eyes of Killmonger, as in the eyes of so many who have sought to overthrow power in history, they believed they were righteous and righting a great evil visited not only upon them personally, but upon their people as a collective identity. This is extremely humanizing for a villain. Thanos likely will not be able to have this kind of human backstory. Killmonger is a villain that currently exists all around the world.&&You framed it like he wasn't a bad guy until the power went to his head. His goal was mass genocide the whole time, and to get to the throne he stole stuff and killed people, so it's only similar to the heroes journey if your definition is somewhat vague. 

Also BP himself really didn't have much of a journey in the film, I mean he did, but it was never emphasized in the way you would normally emphasize the MC's struggle. Like at the start of the movie you could tell he didn't know what to do exactly, but then a number of events occur that aren't really related to his struggle, or if they are they aren't actually shown to be making him struggle. Instead he eventually just kind of decides. His journey just felt awkward and I doubt most people even realize he had one at all in the movie.&&I feel like Black Panther had tons of good ideas, but it didn't quite get the payoff it deserved. It felt very constrained to tell a story that fit before Infinity War and didn't leave any loose ends.

Obviously, spoilers to follow:

The premise being split into 2 films would have been better, Rise of Killmonger and Redemption of T'Challa. 

The pacing wobbled between too fast and too slow. We end up with a gratuitious battle at the end to try and encapsulate all the strife between factions, but it ends up feeling stale and drawn-out. The motivations of the Pro-Killmonger side weren't well established in my opinion, as they seem to align with Traditionalist *and* Imperialist ideals simultaneously.

I think the rest of the leaders would have fallen in line more realistically if Killmonger had killed one of them in the council room for standing against him after he becomes king. As is, they kind of complain a bit, then don't do anything.

Regardless, the film had tons of interesting worldbuilding, characters, and locations. I am very much looking forward to seeing Wakanda again in Infinity War.&&Killmonger was a great villian.  I'm hoping he shows up in other movies. :|
&&I found Killmonger to be an *almost* sympathetic villain, but ultimately not.

He grew up poor. His father was killed and he was abandoned as a kid by a people and a nation with the power to change the lives of people like him around the world. Instead they hide away and do nothing. Killmonger wishes to claim the throne and the power of this nation and use it to change and improve lives.

So far so good and so honourable. A perfectly sympathetic (also he's a mass murdering psychopath who wants to commit genocide)... Well never bloody mind then!&&>The film is more of an ensemble piece with the title character not even present for large chunks of the film.

definitely. if anything, Wakanda was the main character of the film more than T'Challa&&I agreed with you all the way up until that last sentence. I think Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Spider-Man Homecoming had a strong emotional core.

Your other points were spot on, and I never thought about how much Black Panther deviates from the other Marvel films. The fact that there are strong female characters in this movie was another trend that BP bucked from the Marvel formula.&&Then they can sit down in a corner with the other three people who agree with them.&&You people go to the movie theatre on LSD? I can barely sit on my couch for 45 minutes at a time. An hour and a half in a theatre with a bunch of people I don't know would kill me.&&> Guardians of the Galaxy were on a Z level tier before their movie.

To me, this is absolutely perfect. The GotG crew were basically Z-level nobodies in-universe at the beginning.  

""Hey, you know what? There's another name you might know me by. Star-Lord.""  

""Who?""&&Putting Rocket Racoon as a playable character in Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 a few years prior was a pretty smart move as well. Definitely piqued my interest in the character.&&If it were not for the Disney Spider-Man cartoon I would not have know about them prior to the movies.&&At this point it's like Fiege is taking dares on who he can make huge.

Coming next summer: Alpha flight: Battle for Canada, Ka-Zar's Savage Land, Adam Warlock, Novacorp - Firelord&&Fuckin Jumanji. One of those ""what the hell, did I really end up enjoying that?"" movies.&&I think that Superman was doomed to fail because of how hard the leaned into him being Kal-El and Superman first and second and Clark Kent in a very distant third. 

The thing is that Superman as a character is only difficult to write if you think about him in terms of being only Superman. 

Clark Kent is the identity he was raised with Kansas is his hometown and metropolis is the place that adopted him. Clark Kent is not the disguise it's the person. 

Batman is the opposite Batman is the identity and Wayne is the disguise. Batman studies humans like their a different species. Batman seems to save people and act as a hero based on ideals and philosophies. He never seems to be a part of the world he is helping, and more importantly he doesn't have any interest in being a part of it.

On the other hand Superman lives in the world that he saves and is intimately connected to it saving people is something he does be cause he can and wants to. He doesn't have a lofty goal or duty guiding him. He has friends, family, a job and a home that is sometimes at risk.

That's why the DCEU seems so weird and disjointed. They focus so much on Bruce Wayne and Kal-El and approach the stories in that manner. Think of how much Bruce Wayne is in each movie, and how much the ordinary life of Clark Kent is ignored.

For me it all stems from a terribly misinterpreted reading of the Dark Knight saga. Snyder didn't realize that the work was a critique on its subject matter, and basically built the DCEU on a foundation that's intent was to warn writers about doing the things Snyder would attempt to do.&&See: One Punch Man&&The stuff you just put in your post? I would love to see play out in a superman movie.

People make a big deal about superman being invincible, there are plenty of enemies that have kicked superman's ass, several of whom were squandered as opportunities in BvS. A Kryptonian supercomputer in Zod's ship? Slap a vindictive AI on it and you have Braniac. A multiple amputee who hates Superman + Kryptonite? You have the makings of Metallo. Genetically engineering a Kryptonian clone to fight Supes? Sounds like ingredients for the eradicator.

Aside from the above superpowered enemies, superman isn't (or at least doesn't have to be) immune to everything. A batman vs superman fight would have been much more interesting if batman didn't have kryptonite, and just had to use what he's observed of superman to develop countermeasures to his powers and ways to actually hurt him.&&The current run of DC rebirth has [an *amazing* Superman/Batman (and Lois/Catwoman)](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Batman-36-DC-Comics-Universe-spoilers-5.jpg) story.&&I mean, they tried really hard in Man of Steel to make turn the ""unlimited power"" aspect into a compelling plot but instead it just made Supes look like a bit of a prick.&&Bruce Banner/The Hulk is essentially invincible and immortal with unlimited power.  Banner explained how putting a bullet in his brain as Banner didn't kill him.

You still watch him struggle and feel connected to the character.  &&> With the exception of Gravity, no other movies have made good use of 3D.

Life of Pi&&I think that a lot of movies were ok in 3D, but not substantially improved. I liked Toy Story 3 in 3D, they had 1 or 2 cool effects with slinky dog etc., but it didn't detract from the story. Overall I think 3D is a fad. It doesn't make it far more immersive, I think that we will get VR movies rather than 3D ever becoming the main way to watch films.&&You're forgetting about sharkboy and lavagirl&&Love both cap movies _hate_ dark world but love Ragnarok.&&Yeah, like God of War. That would be awesome!!&&>war never changes

Wonder Woman/Fallout crossover confirmed?&&They didn't need DC, they needed someone like Kevin fiege. Someone who can both mind The lore but also not strangle the creative talent. Who can balance what makes sense in a movie and can help distill characte 're down to their most compelling elements. 

DC leaned on Snyder for that and he was awful at it. Couldn't find balance; changed characters to be contrary to the things people cared about; chose what he thought was cool over what would be compelling; and built movies by thinking up 'cool' scenes then working backwards to build plot around set pieces. And WB had the worst sort of executive meddling strangling non Snyder talent.&&> They want the darker, grittier universe (why, I have no idea, you have Superman and Wonder Woman), and Nolan made the darkest, grittiest mainstream superhero movies, but they were asleep at the wheel and that trilogy was gone before they could make anything out of it.

Basically, they let Zack Snyder have free reign for way, *way* too long. Man of Steel was divisive, but still generally an okay start. 

Batman v. Superman was a hot mess and when things started to go downhill. It should have been clear at this point (maybe even as far back as MoS) that fans don't want a dark, edgy Superman; and that Zack Snyder doesn't know what he's doing. But they kept going anyway.

Suicide Squad...happened? I have no idea why anybody thought it was a good idea to roll a villain movie this early on in the universe. I have no idea why they thought going with Jared Leto's Joker was a good idea, especially less than a decade out from Heath Ledger's award-winning performance. I know why they did reshoots, but that somehow made it even worse because they basically sacrificed anything resembling a style and thematics to create something universally acceptable, and failed.

Wonder Woman. Finally, a ray of light. Unfortunately, it was so divorced from the rest of the universe that it really just spawned it's own franchise as opposed to fixing the DCEU mess. But we had hope, and as we all know, rebellions are built on hope.

Justice League is where it became clear that the experiment had solidly failed. Zack Snyder is *still involved* despite not having been able to output a well-received movie yet, only leaving late in production due to personal issues. Amazingly, however, him leaving seemed to make the movie *worse* as Whedon reshot a significant portion of the movie in an entirely different style that made it plainly apparent that we were watching the Frankenstein's monster of two different people's work. Add to that the fact that we had to origin story out three characters who hadn't appeared yet outside of a couple of ten second GIFs along with resurrecting Superman (who's dead for literally no reason other than Zack wanted to superglue a shitty Death of Superman adaptation to the end of his other movie) *and* establishing and defeating a threat in your standard team-up movie plot. And Warner Bros. in their infinite wisdom decided that BvS' running time was the problem, so all this had to be done in under two hours.

Is it any wonder that it didn't work? Justice League could have been a good film, and was possible even a decent one despite all of this, but it had every possible card stacked up against it.

Now look at MCU Phase 1. Only one more movie than the DCEU, but it accomplished so much more. Iron Man 1 establishes Tony Stark and gets things rolling. The Incredible Hulk starts mopping up the previous terrible Hulk movies and reestablishes him (though Hulk winds up getting recast later on). Iron Man 2 furthers Tony's story and establishes War Machine, Black Widow, and more SHIELD stuff. Thor establishes Thor, Loki, Hawkeye, and starts teasing the plot elements for Avengers. Captain America establishes Captain America, lays the groundwork for HYDRA and Bucky's return in Phase 2, and sets up the rest of the groundwork for Avengers. And then we hit Avengers, and everyone is already introduced and most of the plot elements are already in play. It's a master class of how to properly build up to a team-up movie.

Which makes the DCEU even *more* disappointing. They have the damn answer key and still somehow failed the test.&&They reacted extremely poorly. I really liked MoS and the darker tone, but they needed more movies to flesh out the universe before mashing all the heroes together. WB fucked up big time&&> 2011's Green Lantern is a stand alone movie as well

It wasn't meant to be, it was supposed to be the launching pad for the movieverse but it was received so poorly that they scrapped the idea. 

>Warner is just reacting to what Marvel is creating.

This is especially true for Green Lantern, they followed the Iron-Man formula to a tee. Take a well known, but not the most popular superhero(Iron-Man/Green Lantern), give it to a quick witted actor(RDJ/Ryan Reynolds) who can define the heroes personality in a way that they wouldn't be able to do for the more popular heroes. Have the origin story tied to the military in some kind of way and voila, this should spell out the formula for a good movie, right?&&> I want to see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Flash. I want the complex relationships that reflect decades worth of some of the most influential material in comic books. I want a fresh take on the action, and the characters and their personalities


I think you jut described why Marvel was at a huge advantage. The general public didn't have a perception of what Tony Stark should be like, so they could basically tell RDJ to just do his thing and use his acting chops to define the character. This is also why movies like Ant-Man and GOTG end up being huge hits, the actors could just have fun and defiine the characters as they see fit.

This is not something that you can do with Superman or Batman, there are pre conceived notions by the general public of how those characters should be.&&>Who does that even appeal to?

Zack Snyder.&&>  master detective,

Why is this forever just not a thing?&&I like the fight scenes a lot more. They feel more real, more powerful and visceral. Thats not enough to save an entire story line though...&&They want the money Marvel has made, but they're focusing too much on building a universe instead of making good films.&&>Too many of the fans they're listening to are 40-somethings rather than the young people that comic books were always meant to appeal to.

This has been a problem since the 80s. “Comics aren’t just for kids” mutated into “comics aren’t for kids.” There’s a few all ages books, but most of DC is meant for old fanboys who demand something new but don’t actually want anything to change. 

I gave up around the New 52 because the “everything’s reset unless it sold well” continuity was just too much to figure out. DC was also making it clearer than usual that they didnt give a shit about female readers, so it also wasn’t worth trying to get a handle on the latest Event That Will Change the DC Universe Forever (I’m aware there’s been another Final No Takesies Backsies Crisis on We Mean It This Time). &&**So that’s it, huh? We’re some kind of change squad?**&&> Milana Vayntrub

Her name is AT&T Girl damnit. &&Yeah, but Marvel TV has a much bumpier track record than Marvel films. IMO.&&I think that was a direct response to all the chatter when they first announced it on their upcoming slate, which was basically “Guardians Of The Galaxy: the Marvel movie that no one is asking for” (especially for the people who basically though it was taking up a production slot that could have gone to *their* preferred Marvel IP). It’s easy to forget now how many people were predicting that GOTG was where the MCU train was finally going to derail.&&You weren't watching closely enough in Guardians 2, I gather.  &&Yeah, I'm not worried about them running out of creative juices so to speak as I am worried about them just straight up having too many characters they're trying to make movies out of all at once. 

Kill Cap, give Bucky the Shield and you can fold Black Widow into those movies and do their comics relationship on the big screen. Iron Man doesn't need to die, per se, but I fully believe you could have him step away and just make him a side character in Spider-Man or even just a mentor to younger heroes in general as the sort of ""first"" hero they had. Hulk and Thor together as a team is a fairly money idea after Ragnarok and I could maybe get my Planet Hulk/World War Hulk in Avengers 5 or whatever. 

They don't need to necessarily kill everyone so much as I'd like them to sort of compress it. &&Black Widow is unlikely to die, but the rest can go.&&Moon Knight could be amazing if they don't fuck it up. They'd have to go all in.&&Hell, they we're doing it in phase 1 towards the end. Thor was Shakespearean drama, and Captain America, a behind-enemy lines war movie. They've obviously gone much more diverse since, but they were clearly taking steps for longevity after 08. I'd be curious to see when they brought on their continuity and planning teams. I'd venture to guess it was prior to Iron Man 2.&&This is a much better way to put it. At the end of the day ice cream is still ice cream and marvel movies are still marvel movies let's not pretend that eating a chocolate ice cream is the same as having a chocolate cake or that winter soldier is the same as a political thriller. &&>Don’t forget there’s CGI pubes in it.

Why?

&&I thought Ant-Man was great... am I the only one? Lol&&But the Russo Brothers knew while making Infinty War that Ant-Man 2 would be next so I’d say Feige asked them to probably give him good lines and moments so he could be one of the standouts in such a crowded film, and therefore, lead in to Ant-Man and the Wasp.&&Also Iron Man 3 was really cool in that it was really the first ""post team up"" superhero movie ever in Hollywood. You get to see that character basically try to get back to his regular life after almost fucking dying in New York and that was a really interesting character arc.&&What worked for Killmonger and Zemo (and to an extent, Vulture) was they were relatable.  You understand their motivations because it's not outside the realm of possibility for the average person to imagine.  If someone were to kill your father, family, or business, and then walk off like some sort of champion of goodness, you would boil with a need for vengeance. &&Marvel's Phase 3 villians have been the best Marvel villians yet.&&Killmonger was a tragic flawed hero. He escaped from the hood using his own excellence to carry out a black panther (the radicial group) style revolution to liberate his people. His killing of fellow blacks was to highlight his determination and sacrifice, albeit flawed. 

This movie wasn't about Black Panther, it was about Wakanda and its role in the world. He didn't need a journey, he was simply an active observer till the fate of the nation/their people was decided.&&But keep in mind that he learned his political views from his father. From his perspective, he was just carrying out his father’s wishes. Similar to Simba. &&I found Wakanda's weaknesses--that they were so submissive to their culture--to be a strength for the film. A true utopia is boring. In this way, the outside world with its clashing culture seemed superior to Wakanda.&&>I think the rest of the leaders would have fallen in line more realistically if Killmonger had killed one of them in the council room for standing against him after he becomes king. As is, they kind of complain a bit, then don't do anything. 

Their monarchy is self-enforced and reliant on culture. Just as Okoye said ""My allegiance is to that throne and whoever sits on it."" The rules of the challenge stated the only way to end that fight is if someone yields or someone dies. And by those rules, Kilmonger was presumed to be the legitimate King. Even if they didn't like him, they would follow him based on their rules 

And W'kabi's clan is only loyal to W'kabi. They go where he goes, fight where he fights, and is loyal when he's loyal. So they only had to establish W'kabi's motivation, which they did well enough. He was frustrated by the throne's complacency. He was willing to accept the isolationism for most accounts, but they couldn't even bend their rules for the sake of revenge? That's what got to him and the movie didn't need to show any more of that. If they did, his climax wouldn't have made sense. Think about how it ended:

""Bae, would you really kill me?""

""Yeah""

""Damn... Screw it. It's not worth it. I give up.""

If they had really laid it on thick and stressed his frustration his frustrations with the crown, would that have been an acceptable ending? No. But it was acceptable for what it was. He saw an opportunity to serve under a king he'd prefer and he took it. Once what he'd have to sacrifice became too great, he backed out. &&Yeah, this last phase of Marvel is more about stepping away from some of the tried and true. They're letting the directors decide where to go and let things develop from there.&&Who are the two that aren't George Lazenby? &&Because of the anxiety or just an urge to move around? Personally I get super locked into things when I'm tripping.&&Yo a great soundtrack can do a ton for a movie. &&And each film makes over $700 million&&The Breakfast Club element actually worked well, and the casy was seriously great.&&Just looking at the cast tells me I will like the movie, I haven't seen it yet, but I know I will enjoy it.&&> For me it all stems from a terribly misinterpreted reading of the Dark Knight saga. Snyder didn't realize that the work was a critique on its subject matter, and basically built the DCEU on a foundation that's intent was to warn writers about doing the things Snyder would attempt to do.

 This is perfectly said.&&I literally have a tattoo of Burton's Batman emblem on my arm and you know more about Batman than me. Are you.... Batman?  
Either way really fucking good write and you nailed it.  
Batman said it himself-  
  
>	If Clark wanted to, he could use his superspeed and squish me into the cement. But I know how he thinks. Even more than the Kryptonite, he's got one big weakness. Deep down, Clark's essentially a good person... and deep down, I'm not.&&>Think of how much Bruce Wayne is in each movie

True. Compare to how much Batman is in each Nolan movie, versus Bruce Wayne.&&VR will never become the main way to watch movies. It would lack the artistic direction and carefully done cinematography of standard movies. Genius' like Roger Deakins set the stages of scenes so we don't have too. VR puts too much trust in the viewer, imagine in Schindlers' list if the viewer completely missed the girl in the red coat because they were stupidly looking about at unimportant scenery while key events were being played out somewhere in the 360 view. Who would bother watch a comedy in VR either.&&VR will be very difficult to direct a users attention like they do in films. I think the format will only be useful for movies which specifically are made for it. 

Sort of like early 3D. &&It would also be an appropriate reason for her to spend every movie yelling ""ARIES!!""&&Yep. People don't understand how much of a genius Feige is. Just look at Star Wars. Also a Disney property, but this new trilogy is a mess. It's fine if you liked the movies, but it's pretty clear that it wasn't the same vision behind TLJ and TFA.

It's extremely hard to intertwine different movies, with different writers, producers and directors.

Not only that, Feige created some strategies, like doing the villain of the first movie a ""copy"" of the hero, that just work. It worked so well for Black Panter.&&Who needs story when you can have slow motion and jacked dudes on screen?&&Yeah... Warner is just fucking it all up. MoS I kinda liked as well... I had by problems with it but I at least was entertaining [for me] (which in my opinion os the most important thing in a movie).

BvS in the other hand... holy shit... that was a complete mess. Both me and my date went to watch wanting it to be good (It was like 3 weeks after released, so I knew the internet mood about it but didn't actually got any spoiler) but we spend the whole time making fun of the movie... which was the best part of all... and made worth it my money.

So far WW is the only one I really liked... again... have some problems... but by far the best DC movie Warner has made since The Dark Knight.&&I think Marvel is just better at casting. RDJ could do his thing because his thing was still basically Tony Stark without the robot suits. Chris Evans makes a great Captain America because he can slide so easily into our expectations of a wholesome patriot hero. Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man because he's an acrobatic, kinda nerdy teenager. They've all got acting chops that bring something to the table for all of their characters, but they all still fit within comic fans' expectations for those characters too.

Edit: I think to some extent, Marvel's real advantage is that their characters for the most part have a baseline of a realistic, relatable character. The world is full of nerdy kids who want to be something more, people who are weak who want to become strong enough to defend what they hold dear, adults who face or have faced issues of alcoholism and regret their past mistakes. There aren't a lot of people who actually relate to unhinged detective, an all-powerful alien who has to push back against his own power, or an Amazon queen, so those characters need a lot more love and work to make them something people can feel a part of themselves in and love. DC can do wonders in longer-format media, such as comics and TV series, because they have the time to focus on how Clark Kent feels like an alien and outsider, and movies that focused on these characters in a human light would probably do better. What we get is movies that want to jump straight to where Marvel is and focus on the action, rather than taking time for us to see these characters as *characters*, trying to rely instead on their iconic status.&&I don't think that's quite it - we can use Spiderman as a counterexample. He's almost as big as Superman or Batman, and the public has some pretty common pre-conceived notions of Spiderman, many of them off base (thanks to the aged-up / angsty versions in the preceding movies.) Homecoming still nailed it despite straying from the Spidey that audiences have grown to expect. 

I don't think Batman or Superman's previous incarnations are directly weighing them down. I think it's just that DC fundamentally fails to make its characters likable. DC films seem to assume audiences already like the ideas of Superman or Batman, so they don't bother with making us like *this particular* Superman or Batman. On the flip side, every single Marvel movie takes care to add in early moments of levity (often at the hero's expense) which grounds and humanizes them. It doesn't matter that it's the first or third Thor or Iron Man movie, or the sixth Spider-man movie in 17 years - every single film gives its hero a little bit of humor, has something not go the hero's way to check their ego, to remind us that they're human.&&>This is not something that you can do with Superman or Batman, there are pre conceived notions by the general public of how those characters should be.

I get what you're saying, but the problem isn't that the characters fit preconceived notions. It's that they're bland. You can have an archetypal character that is still interesting to watch. &&They're not even focusing on building a universe, they're just trying to rush the ensemble together as quickly as possible so that they *have* a universe.  They're basically trying to skip straight to where Marvel is now without the 10 years of build up.&&> It’s easy to forget now how many people were predicting that GOTG was where the MCU train was finally going to derail.

GOTG was when I realized that Feige was a genius. They'll be writing books about that guy.&&When I saw the first Guardians trailer, my reaction was ""Well, looks like Marvel has jumped the shark.  Guess they couldn't keep this up forever.""  I had absolutely no idea who these characters were, and it just looked absurd.  Then I go to see it based on word-of-mouth alone, and it ends up being one of my two favorite MCU movies (alongside Winter Soldier).

So when they announced an Ant-Man movie, my reaction was basically ""Oh, ok.  That should be fun."" instead of ""What the hell are they thinking?""  The success of Gurdians meant I wasn't going to doubt them, no matter how absurd the next movie seemed.&&I feel like they fucked up Iron Fist on his own show, but I did like him more on the Defenders.  Hopefully they un-fuck him up as his show goes on.&&Thor was Shakespearean drama not because Marvel wanted it, but because it was directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is a phenomenal director. He also directed or starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare's plays, including Henry V.  
  I think the genre/quality of the movie depends on who is directing it.  

&&I must force everyone else to bare the burden of this knowledge so I don't have to alone.&&No, I thought Ant-Man was awesome, and his feature in Civil War was also great, but I’m just saying that Iron Man is undeniably more popular than Ant-Man.&&But part of the reason the Marvel villains also tend to suck is because 'vengeance' is usually a pretty one-dimensional motivation. Like, it can be a driving motivation but you really don't want that to be all that they have to them. Inigo Montoya (From *The Princess Bride* for the few who don't know) was vengeance-driven but he had a lot more going on than that. 

 I don't think any Marvel film has done a villain whose motivation was ""I think I can really make the world a better place, I have a plan for implementing it, but I'll have to break a few eggs/do some unethical shit to achieve it."" One where they ultimately want the best for everyone and not just themselves.

We *technically* got some of that with Civil War, if you consider Stark to be an antagonist in the film.

90% of the the villains' motivations are selfish, ""I want what you have,"" ""I want you out of the way so I can win,"" or ""I want revenge on you,"" and the ever popular ""I want to rule this city/planet/universe.""

I *get* why that's the case, but it does cause the Villain characters to come across weaker.&&George Lazenby's mum and George Lazenby's wife&&Both. I have to change things up a lot or I start getting into negative thought loops that slowly freak me out. The one time I was able to watch a movie all the way through was Holy Mountain, and I think that's because that movie itself changed so much it was like a little change of scenery itself every 15 minutes.&&It was also a great soundtrack with relevance to the movie. The songs made sense and very integrated well. For an example of the opposite you have suicide squad, with a great soundtrack, but obviously just because that was the trend at the time.&&It really is one of those movies that's just fun. It doesn't try to be anything profound, no pretentious Oscar bait, writing that fits well, and actors that look more like they enjoy it rather than just doing work. &&People also seem to forget (which, given it's author, is somewhat understandable) that the story which BvS is most heavily based on, The Dark Knight Returns, I supposed to be a satire and commentary *on* the whole idea of Batman being this semi-fascist psychopath.

People see the character of Batman in TDKR, and wrongly assume that it's written as ""this is how batman should be"" instead of ""This is *not* what batman should be""&&There is a ton of Bruce Wayne in the Telltale games and it works really well, it's all about the writing.&&""Not only that, Feige created some strategies, like doing the villain of the first movie a ""copy"" of the hero, that just work. It worked so well for Black Panther.""

I agree and personally I think that it worked better for Black Panther than it did for any of Marvels previous movies. In films like Iron Man 1, and Antman 1; the copy villian just wanted to make more money by stealing technology or something. While Dr. strange finally started having the copy villian with an actual goal ( besides money or power) and gave the copy villian a desire to summon some demon (Dormamu) to destroy the world or something. However, the Black Panther film actually gave Kilmonger a real sub plot and motivations that were interwoven into the story of the movie. And tied it together so that it made sense that he'd get a copy of the BP suit. I hope Marvel continues making villians with compelling backstorys like this in the future.&&Agreed 100%. MoS definitely had issues, but holy fuck, BvS. Just about the entire movie felt like an amalgamation of scenes without coherency. It needed more time and it was fucking three hours long! Batman and Wonder Woman were the highlights of that movie, but as a whole it was just so bad.

WW, like everyone else, is my favorite DCEU movie and it's so sad that it has to be a part of this shitty universe.&&Man, I suddenly remember the quote about the difference of Marvel and DC Comics.

>*""Marvel is about humans trying to play God. DC is about Gods trying to be more human.""*

When put that away, it's obviously way easier to empathize with Marvel characters than DC ones when it comes to movies. This is not withstanding the decades of excellent characterization from the comics though.&&Yea the whole DCverse felt like I was sitting in a WB board room with the executives saying ""we want our money now."" Say what you want about Marvel, but at least its clear they care about the source material, the characters, and the fans. &&You wanna know the really sad thing? It took Marvel four years to go from the first Iron Man (which came out in May of 2008) to the first Avengers (which came out in May of 2012).

DC went from Man of Steel (June of 2013) to Justice League (November of 2017) in a *longer* time period, and somehow made it feel rushed and convoluted. &&The worst part is it only would have taken 2 years to get there. Do a good Batman, Superman and Wonder woman movie. Then do Justice League. Oh and make them fun. Not depressing, bleak garbage. It really isn't THAT hard. 

The tone Snyder was going for would have fit standalone Animated movies better.&&I have to agree. In my opinion, Iron Man started all this hype; nevertheless, the sequels were disappointing. Marvel Studios still making big moves tho. I really like where they're going.&&>I don't think any Marvel film has done a villain whose motivation was ""I think I can really make the world a better place, I have a plan for implementing it, but I'll have to break a few eggs/do some unethical shit to achieve it.""

I'd argue you see a bit of this in Black Panther. Killmonger's main motive his vengeance, sure, but he's also driven by his (and his father's desire) to make the world a better place for their people. His means of doing are just fucked up.&&Suicide Squad was a perfect example of DC wanting the money Marvel was making and thinking just teaming up a bunch of misfits with a crazy soundtrack was going to be enough. And it worked to a degree. The movie made money but it also ate mooseshit and if they do a sequel theyre gonna find out the hard way audiences dont like being suckered.&&Not only that, but the villain changed T'Challa forever. For that reason, I don't think he can be easily forgotten. The villain and his thoughts were part of the actual character development of the protagonist, instead of just being an antagonist to teach the hero about hardship or whatever. &&♯""We have an un-structured universe, but we need cash now...""♩&&All of Marvel's movies led the way to the Avengers. In those four years DC has given us one film that didn't have anything to do with the JL (Suicide Squad) and one that actually destroyed goodwill and anticipation for  the team-up (BvS).&&Because between Iron Man and Avengers we got   Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America. And between MoS and JL,only BvsS.&&Well Marvel made sure each of the 4 major Avengers had at least 1 movie first. They made sure Black Widow, Hawkeye and Nick Fury were all introduced beforehand. And they made sure Loki was established and his story known before Avengers even started.

Meanwhile DC made a movie about a group of B list characters that had nothing to do with Justice League, and introduced 3 of its heroes and its villain all in the JL movie.&&Yeah, his main motivation is to help the disenfranchised. His anger and his thirst for vengeance are what cause his actions to undercut his motivation. In the end, T’Challa decides that Killmonger was right, but T’Challa acts on that motivation in a more positive way. &&",2018-02-19 11:25:31
Im currently recreating movie frames in 3D. Prisoners (2013),29926,7wehbf,https://i.redd.it/ybisjea6p7f01.jpg,1231,1518192915.0,,"OP posted a follow-up: https://redd.it/7wk7dq&&Dude this is amazing. Honestly my first thought was somehow using it for VR applications, like, ""hey, wanna walk around your favorite movies? Well now you can!"" &&Done in the free open source program Blender.
What ideas come to mind when you see this regarding technology or art-installations ?
How could i expend on this in the future ?&&What the frick ?! Thats well made.&&How long did it take you to make this? It's impressive!&&Do a spin around or something in the model and make gif out of it to show in addition of the screenshot. Fantastic work tho&&For those not getting it: The picture below was digitally manufactured, is not real and that's why this is so impressive&&You've only got 13 rows of the light bricks on the floor in the center of the room, but the actual shot has 14 rows. Also, the table one over and one up from Jake shouldn't have a soy sauce bottle at it, and the table just beyond has the container of red chopsticks in the wrong place.&&Really interesting exercise for 3D learning.

Roger Deakins was brought into the production of Wall-E/Rango to help them frame shots and light them realistically, which is what gave those movies a unique look. 

I think this is a really good exercise for people learning 3D! Keep it up!&&you should post it on http://hyperrealcg.tumblr.com/
&&Would you be able to show it from a different angle? &&I'm looking at 2 nearly identicle images. I don't understand what's supposed to be impressive.&&This is really good. You could make it super good if you made a gif of a camera movement inside the model landing on the movie frame.&&Op people are having too much difficulty understanding what you actually did here. Try to do some renders with shadeless materials and flat lighting just to give proof of your work.&&As someone who has eaten breakfast in that very room 50 or 60 times... I can honestly say that I am blown away. I have stood in that exact spot... It's weirding me out. &&Am I the only one that can’t tell the difference between the two? Is something wrong with me?&&What's up with his arm?&&DC should hire you. Can you remove mustaches?&&Share your other work please. Very impressive.&&Honestly cannot tell the difference between the two. Good job!

This might sound weird but: I want a recreation of [this scene] (https://youtu.be/_PanQ3g7j5E) in The Mask. Specifically the moment where Jim is muffled screaming at 1:17.

I don't know why but, take the music out and the concept of it being a comedy and I feel it is a very sinister looking moment. Especially if it is a wide shot of his entire apartment while he's in that pose.&&It looks different? &&[deleted]&&It'd be pretty sick if these were VR compatible to walk through one's favorite movie scenes.&&You obviously have good observation skills next to the technical skills. With these kind of skills you could do really well in architectural visualization. 

As for feedback, the only thing that stood out to me is that the ceiling looks a little too clean compared to the original, other than that it's a fantastic job!&&This is crazy. The render looks almost exactly like the photo. Frankly, if it weren't for the sugar packets on the table, I would totally have thought you were bullshitting and posted the same picture twice. But I wouldn't have even seen the sugar packs if I hadn't zoomed in to see the finer details anyways. I'm blown away. &&Why?&&You are so talented &&That's neat. To people asking ""what's the point"", if OP has/wants a career in VFX this is good practice. Even if he didn't look like a turd, we all know Doomsday is CGI because that's a fictional thing. But you'd be surprised how many real-world things are done with 3D rendering nowadays - for instance, a ton of shots in Wolf of Wall Street. When I watched it I had no idea any of it was fake (except maybe the [lion part](/s ""real lion, not really walking around freely"") of course), because artists spent a ton of time recreating real life. The best CGI is what we don't even notice.

Speaking of which, the only parts of OP's render that jumped out to me are the lighting and plants. Great job dude. Edit: just noticed a coloring error next to Jake's arm.&&I really want to rewatch this movie because of the incredible acting performances but just the thought of watching it again chills me to the bone. Such a creepy movie. &&Do I need a 3D monitor to see the difference ? It looks like the same pic except the lights seem brighter and the plants greener&&Hey buddy. Why turn a 2-D image into a 3-D model, only to display it as a 2-D image?&&Are Gyllenhall and flowers full 3D models?&&This is great! I don't work in light/comp (so my input is probably wrong), but I feel like the lights are tad too intense or they should fall-off more. If you a/b the lighting on the tables/chairs, you can see what I mean. Also causes the shadows to get washed out in your render.  The spec and/or reflectivity is also a tad strong on the seats. Makes them feel like they are hard plastic instead of leather or something else. Could also be the model, seeing how the chairs in the render have a flat top, instead of a more cushion look.

Sorry, needed a break from work and just spout stuff as I saw it. Really good work man!&&I keep crossing my eyes but nothing is happening ....&&Thanks for making me nod my head for the past 2 minutes. Everytime I thought I saw a mistake, I'd look up at the original and realize that it was a near perfect/perfect recreation. 

Goddamn OP!&&What the fuck. This is incredible! I finally understand all the people that tell me ""man I do not have the patience to do what you do"" (I'm a nail tech and I do a LOT of nail art). I'm always like, I enjoy it...lol. But now looking at this I'm like ""man, I do not have the patience to do what you do..."" Lol.&&very impressive!&&Is this all hand modeled and textured?

Even if it isn't it would still be completely nuts, but if it is then congratulations on being able to recreate reality from scratch.&&The chairs in the CGI are wider on top than the originals. But seriously that's super impressive!&&Very well done :-) I'm very impressed. 

One thing I don't know if you've been informed about: it seems you haven't made the plate and food between his body and arm &&Not in school currently but I would be a sophomore engineering student. I have done very minimal work in CAD and I recently got a 3D printer I would like to be able to made models for.&&Send your resume portfolio to every VR / AR company working - can almost guarantee somebody's looking for your skillset.

Really great work yo, good luck!&&I am wondering with all the reflections on the seats and windows, did you manually put them there or did they just automatically align with the ones in the movie cause all the angles and lighting was recreated perfectly? &&Now put it in VRChat XD&&Currently having to do similar stuff for assignments and I actually kind of hate it.  I'm an animator, not a 3D artist.&&Fuck. That’s truly impressive!&&As a VFX artist I find this very cool !&&I can’t tell the difference at all&&Looks the same&&Madskills. 10/10.&&Looks good. But why?&&I'm sure I'm at the bottom here, but just wanted to say awesome job. This isn't easy!&&Damn, you fucking nailed every shader. Everything looks exactly as diffuse or as reflective as the real materials.&&Cool, looks good.

Also happy to see Prisoners being mentioned. Jake Gyllenhaal definitely does not disappoint in that movie.&&What’s the point?&&[deleted]&&Y tho?&&This is a weird ass hoby and I love it&&My only “complaint” is the lights and reflections around the windows are too perfect in the render. The reflections seem to have no opacity to them, and there also doesn’t seem to be any tilt to any of them where they aren’t perfectly level in the original. It’s one of those things that you can’t unsee once you notice. 

That’s just a minor complaint from a nobody on the internet. Great work, nonetheless. &&you are a madman&&It just looks brighter?&&This looks exactly the same to me. Is there something wrong with my eyes?&&But why?&&Can someone explain what this is. Like I'm 3 years old though.&&It might be impressive if you use this in a game or something, but just from that image I cant tell what you did.&&When you put them side by side, I can notice some of the reflections are not “realistic” enough. But if you just show the rendered image, I probably wouldn’t suspect that’s not a real image at all.&&PROOF we live in a simulation! &&That's insane ! I can't imagine the time it took you to do that. Do you use already existing textures or do you do it from scrap ?

Congrats ! &&That is awesome, excellent job! &&Amazing&&This is unreal! Is that a raw render or is there a fair amount of post?&&Imagine the porn&&only difference I can see if that the tables reflect more off the windows than in the actual still. Very cool that you were able to do this all digitally though, it looks great!&&It looks fuckin' awesome, but the lighting feels a little off. I feel like the seats in the render are reflecting too much light.&&[Great! Now you can visualize moving a table!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWIbc44H_WY)&&Do you recommend Blender for non-artists or for those looking to teach themselves? This looks like an interesting skill I might try to learn.

Oh, and fantastic work, by the way!&&I love this movie. Great work!!&&Incredibly well done.&&Can you post a wireframe?&&Really impressive work. As someone just getting back in to blender, I am both jealous and impressed! Can you recommend some of your learning sources/tutorial series you’ve used?

Also, what rendering engine are you using?&&3 hours at how many samples? 

I think you'd get an even better result if you put a bit of diffusion on the glass, in the original the reflection of the lamps in the windows is a bit distorted but very clean in the render. A bit of blur on top should help&&It looks like in the render you applied a film grain texture to the objects rather than the photo as a whole. I think going forward it would be better to apply the texture afterwards to get more uniform and consistent coverage. &&Wow this is incredible! I'm curious how long it would take to model an outdoor scene? If you are taking requests I would love to see this shot  from the end of dunkirk (http://prntscr.com/icjzva). I'm not really familiar at all with 3d modelling but I would imagine that water and sand would probably take less work?&&You need to soften the edges on your tables and work on compositing.  some depth of field and some kind of subtle chromatic abberation.  &&Next time you post switch the pictures so the render is titled as the screen shot and vice versa. Nobody will be able to tell the difference &&what would this kind of art be called? and how did you learn/where do I start researching how to learn this?&&Looks amazing. Just a small feedback, I noticed my eyes got stuck on the lamps, his back and the reflection on the tables.&&Should've reversed it to see if anyone could tell the difference&&As seen on tv&&Amazingly done!

Reflection on fan blades could use some help if you get bored. :P&&Looks brilliant dude. The only thing that stands out to me is the lighting on the chairs being brighter and less 'shaded' I guess would be the word I'd use. Like the whole object has a higher contrast of light than the rest of the environment. There's also seems to be some odd artifacting in some places but apart from that, superb.&&Still waiting for them to do movies in vr . Can you imagine watching Harry potter sitting at the fucking table next to the main three while dumblefuck talks?  Just looking around in vr.... &&Nice work. I'm curious about what you did with the windows? Is the original image still being used as a background? What's going on through the glass?&&This is amazing! The plants on the walls look a bit out of place, though.&&I would never be able to tell the difference except for that menu clipping into the table behind the guy. &&Pretty soon people will just post regular pics of mundane things, claim it's CG and people will just believe it. &&I used to use blender.

Great job man.&&Are you like a crazy person?&&Something weird is going on with the chair on the lower right... and its cushion / table leg.&&Can you post a screenshot of this unrendered, Id like to see the raw version too&&We’re living in the future. &&Would love to see the camera moving through the scene&&How did you get the man accurate?&&Is the actor model modeled in blender, or is it a 2d object only viewable at this angle ? &&You’ve got a few empty sugar dispensers there&&You should post from another angle to prove it's a true 3d render&&I don't see a difference &&Looks amazing. I also did 3d modelling myself and I know how hard the lighting can be, but in my opinion the lamps are the one thing that stood out to me as not perfect. Otherwise it really looks stunning.&&As a fellow 3D artist and Archvis guy, your lighting is spot on and so are your textures.

(Wip) Rear Window VR
https://vimeo.com/174593730&&Prerendered stuff like this and real time rendering (which you need for VR, gaming...) are actually super different.&&This was a concept used in Ready Player One, cool stuff&&As a 3D game animator, I often thought of building ""interactive paintings"".  General locations from my life that you can just walk around in.  

Now that VR is a thing, these interactive paintings become a much more compelling concept....&&You can enable people with VR headsets to walk around them, or use them as their home environment which they can play around on our launch their games etc from. 

I don't know how to myself but I am sure it can be done.

&&I do this kind of work for a living.  Photo-realistic interiors to showcase different types of products such as flooring, wall covering, furniture, drapes, appliances, light fixtures, windows, kitchen cabinets, counter tops etc., the list goes on and on.  Also incorporating 2D photography of products into digital scenes.

There has been a relatively recent shift from traditional photography to recreating everything digitally.  Over 80% of the images you see on Ikea's website and print materials are 100% digitally created, the same goes for many other companies as well.

The reasons are multi-fold:

1. It's cheaper (no shipping of products, building a set, location fees, no crew, etc.)
2. It's faster (no location scouting or prop shopping and no limited time window to shoot)
3. It's easier to edit or simply change hundreds of SKUs and hit render vs. switching and photographing hundreds of products
4. Prop replacements are endless and literally seconds away by downloading
4. You can do things impossible with traditional photography (such as recreating a location that would be impossible to install a customer's products or even creating an environment that doesn't exist)

Even high-end designers (those folks who make furniture, lighting and textiles you see in Architectural Digest) 
who have long argued that traditional photography captures their products better are finally coming around and making the transition to full digital creation of their products as well.

20 years ago it was mostly cars and cellphones that were created digitally.  These days products of all kinds are being created digitally and the trend is continuing to expand.

That's a very well made and rendered scene.  The plants could use some work though. You could well have a future in digital product production.  If you have any questions just ask.&&Why go through all that work for that scene dont get me wrong its amazing, but why not like a scene from you favorite movie, and an exciting scene.

The only real difference I can see is that colors are slightly more vibrant on the tiles and chairs in the render&&Use in combination with deep fakes and have 360 room scale movies with Nicolas Cage in every movie and every role.

But joking aside, very cool!&&I like that you're thinking about how it could be adapted. We're just scratching the surface of the cool stuff we'll be able to do in the future. If people have 3D captures of themselves (which is possible with some low grade 3D laser capture devices), they could swap themselves or their friends into a scene. This would be like a high-tech version of those wood boards that have scenes painted on them and you go and stick your face in the cutout to make it look like you're a cowboy or whatever.

You could use it as a portal to other significant moments in the movie. As an example, I'm 99% convinced that most of the movie Fight Club can be distilled down to the scene where Jack finds his power animal. If a scene were central to a movie, you could have different parts of the scene connect to other important parts where objects pull up those movie scenes. (For example, you could have a scene from inception where the main character is spinning his totem, if you interact with the totem, you could see scenes of him and his wife. Maybe there are plane tickets in his pocket and you can see the scenes of his travel to Mumbai or home, etc.

I have other ideas, but I'll stop here cuz homework.&&This is incredible. The only thing I can even tell that's different are the plants. They look too vibrant. Beyond that it looks exactly the same. Keep it up!&&Well this might be off track but why not try a low resolution game ready version so you can jump inside in VR? &&I do IT at an Architecture Firm and I can tell you this is for sure good enough. This is outstanding. Are you self taught or did you go to school?&&I think of how cool it would be to explore 3D stills of your favorite movie in VR&&In Ready Player One, one of the challenges the protagonist faces is something called a flick-sync.

- The same way you cant just show a different angle on a normal movie cause you would see all the trickery like flags, reflectors or lights. 

Yes:
If i put a lot more effort into it, model the whole room, model the character and texture him entirely, adjust the lighting etc. you could show a different angle.&&I was confused at first too, but then realized what was going on. The picture on the bottom isn't just a copy of the image above, OP made a 3D version of it. Look at the plants, or the lights. The entire scene was recreated in Blender in 3D. In theory this means you could have the 3D file that OP used and make a VR simulation where you can walk around this room and see everything as if you were living in the scene.

&&There are actually lots of VR experiences based on movies. There was a fan made VR recreation of the office from the latest Blade Runner movie on Steam (until it got a cease and desist), fans are working on a complete recreation of the [TNG Enterprise ](http://stage-9.co.uk/)(which also has VR support), there's an official [John Wick VR game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/382360/agecheck) with set pieces and characters from the two films, Ubisoft has made a [multiplayer Star Trek VR bridge command game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/527100/Star_Trek_Bridge_Crew/) that supports cross platform play and recently got a non VR mode. One more particularly neat Star Trek VR game is [the free Enterprise Experience ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/6l4f9j/enterprise_experience_v115_available/), which does an excellent job of accurately replicating the scale of Star Trek ships.

The impressive part was they didn't just grab the top image and apply some effects to it, they went out and remade every individual item in the scene within Blender and matched the dimensions, positioning, colours, textures and lighting to the original items in movie still. Because its done exceptionally well it looks like the still has been copied.

2)Import this scene (let's just say as it's blend file)
3)Throw in the steam VR camera and voila.

In reality the issues would be lighting and materials, as baking (a method of kind of gluing the colours to the objects) aside exact replication of the materials (the colours you see on the objects in the scene) from blender to unity will require adjustment &&Could you point us to some examples, and/or anything showing the process from start to finish (condensed, obviously)?

I spent a few minutes zoomed in *trying* to spot differences.

It's incredible work with a ludicrous attention detail, and it's of something you don't see a lot of-replicas of movie scenes or any scene is very cool and requires a huge attention to detail that you posses.

&&I work as a 3D artist in video games. This is stunning work and clearly a lot of time went into this. Well done.&&When you mentioned light interacting with materials, it made me wonder:   You've created a 3D scene that presumably you could walk around in, however I'm certain that the lighting was designed for shooting a particular shot and perhaps there are light sources not in the frame which affect the presentation of the shot.  How do you account for that, or are you specifically looking for shots to recreate which appear to use the natural light present within the frame of the shot?

I want to walk around the threesome scene from Wild Things, please. &&Unfortunately, scenes like this are rendered in a ray-tracing engine. These engines take minutes to hours to render *one frame*, and allow for extremely realistic reflections, shadows, ambient lighting, and transparency; all things very difficult for raster engines to draw efficiently. While a scene like this *could* be modified for real-time rendering in VR, parts of it would not look nearly as good.&&doing a 3d render is very different from a live world you can walk around in. For one thing, a 3d render is an image which took a pretty long time to render, where as a world (like in video games) is rendered in real time as you walk around hence why games have things like ""FPS"". The primary difference why games can render in real time vs why images like this take a long ass time to render 1 frame, is lighting and texturing (arguably, lighting more than texturing). The engine that can come closest to rendering in real time something that would look like this (even remotely close) is the unreal engine. 

For an example, i recommend you check out the Paris apartment demo located here. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6PQ19BEE24

This is the youtube video, but you can actually download the demo and walk around in it yourself. &&Likely very hard to do. Geometry, textures, and materials for renders is very different from geometry, textures, and materials needed to run at 60+FPS needed for VR. Usually when you go from movie models to games you just start over for this reason, only using the original model as a reference. &&Great.

Like you can be the people who are in the background of scenes and you see it from a real perspective. wow&&It’d be pretty ridiculously time consuming and expensive to recreate all the animation and events going on during the whole movie or even just a 3 minute scene. But I think it would be a really dope,  and more importantly achievable VR application to recreate select frozen-in-time scene environments from a movie and let you explore them. Say, synced with a smartphone while watching the movie that would give you a notification like “Would you like to pause and explore this scene in VR?” when one of the 3D created scenes is on screen. Even just something similar to the google street view app where you move your phone around to see different angles and pinch zoom in on things would be really neat.&&Dibbs on 13% of the moolaw your zany ideas produce &&I just imagine a world like Ready Player One where one day we can experience anything in existence, in full haptic gear. &&Sitting in the diner with De Niro and Pacino from Heat.

I'm a freelance illustrator and when backgrounds get really complicated with perspective, etc. I just usually make a super basic (_SUPER BASIC_) 3D model and use that as a plate to draw over for my perspective.  In many instances I have to go back and re-make the whole thing because the model of what's in my head doesn't actually fit well into a composition's borders when it goes into 2D.

Technically skilled people can be just as important as the ones with the crazy ideas and you seem to imply that it’s negative and then dehumanize him by saying he will just be a tool for someone else. That’s shitty. I’m in architecture, I similarly see people who are great technically and people who are great creatively, and incredibly rarely, someone whose both, so I totally agree that it’s a rare feat, but there’s no reason to be so dismissive of someone looking to learn and improve their technical skill... 

I’m assuming you didn’t mean it that way, maybe I’m having a moment of over sensitivity, but it’s so frustratingly common for people in creative fields to be unnecessarily dismissive of people because they have a different focus...

Can't wait to see what you come up with. &&CAD and blender are differdnt programs for different purposes. For blender watch all of blender gurus tutorial series.&&There are loads of tutorials on Youtube for Blender. I find that just running through a few tutorials is the best way to begin learning a new program. 

I think the first Blender tutorial I ever did was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtO9maU709k). Starting with stylised stuff can be an easier introduction for learning the basic controls. 

Good luck!&&I do CAD and 3d rendering as my day job, If you're just in it for a hobby check out fusion 360, its free for hobbyists and is a pretty decent piece of cad software. You can also check out places like lynda.com for learning resources.&&I use Blender, but most of these tips apply to every software:

* Start small. You're not going to pull off something like OP in your first week. You're going to suck. Get over it and keep practicing.

* Most 3D software can do many things, which is why newbies get overwhelmed trying to do everything. Nobody will hire you because you're just okay at everything, so be great at one thing. Maybe your texturing skills aren't perfect, but you can still be a fantastic modeler. Maybe you just can't get the hang of modeling, but you're really good at compositing. Maybe you're crap at compositing, but you have a head for animation, etc...

* Don't get hung up on tutorials. They're great for learning the ropes, but learning how the tools work is more important than learning specific objects.

* MODELING - Making an entire scene is cool, but learning to create single objects quickly is more useful. Pick a random object and set a timer for one hour. If you can't finish it in an hour, figure out why. Which parts of the model are giving you trouble? Try it again. Then try to halve your time. Then halve that time.

* MODELING - Learn what edge flow is, then look closely at the model you're most proud of. Fix it, it's terrible.

* UNWRAPPING - Sucks. It never becomes fun. You still have to do it.

* TEXTURING/MATERIALS - Nothing in the real world is ever truly clean.

* ANIMATION - You need to learn how to draw, or at least sketch. You can animate in 3d without knowing how to draw if you try hard enough. You can also drive a car with your feet if you try hard enough. Don't be the person who drives with their feet.

* RENDERING - Is an entire field of study that many artists will never need to know. It is also expensive. Don't invest money in amazing hardware unless you're absolutely sure it's worth it. Instead, learn how to optimize your render for even the slowest potato. HINT: You shouldn't have the entire scene in a single layer.

* Finally, read the friggin manual. Some people say Blender is confusing. Those people have not read the manual. Again, you don't have to know everything, just the parts you use. Bookmark it. It solves 90% of the problems newbies have. The other 10% can be solved with a Google search.

Can you sell credits? I have a lot of spare power. Site looks like its hugged right now btw.&&Fun fact: The original Toy Story from 1995 took about 4 hours to render each frame.

[Here's Toy Story compared to Kingdom Hearts 3, running in realtime on a PS4](https://youtu.be/tkDadVrBr1Y?t=1m46s).

So it's taken us slightly over 20 years to go from Toy Story at 4 hours a frame, to 30fps/60fps or whatever KH3 runs at on a modern console.

As OP said his render took about 3 hours, if we go on a similar scale we could realistically hope to be running something like that in real-time in probably around the same kinda time of about 20 years, maybe slightly quicker - especially on a high-end PC compared to a console.

[Though also consider people are using Unreal 4 right now to render shit like this in realtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXouFfqSfxg)

VR does require a lot more power though, as you're basically rendering from two viewpoints instead of one, and you want to maintain a good framerate to avoid motion sickness.

Unreal engine 4 is insane.  I can’t wait to see it fully unleash somewhere close to that in gaming &&I'd never think to look as closely, so no&&Different person here:
OP's work is *really* good. At first glance, I couldn't tell them apart. However, there are some tweaks that would make it look more real. These are picky details from a casual observer (not a 3D artist). Essentially, some of the reflections are inaccurate in OP's 3D render. Most of them are great, but the harder you scrutinize, the more you can tell which image was a photo and which was a render.

What gave it away was the stripey pattern wood-grain on the side of the tables - too much contrast, and too bright. It's more muted in the original. 

Conversely, the white chair rims don't have quite enough contrast. The 3D render makes them look like a silver metallic colour, rather than painted white. Generally, some of the reflections are off. Most of them are spot on, but there are enough that aren't quite perfect. This render could easily be good enough for a variety of purposes, but it's not ""hyper-realistic."" It is still very good though! &&This reminds me of a movie set. The only thing that matters is what's in the shot.&&What is the purpose of the ‘black flag’?&&COULD YOU DO A RENDER OF A NUDE BEACH?

Most of the models are pretty geometrically simple.  Most complicated shape in the scene by far is the human character, and we don't even have to see his face.

Matching everything's position and the camera perspective was likely one of the bigger challenges, as was getting the lighting and materials just right.&&lighting. in this scene.... lighting lighting lighting lighting &&was wondering about that&&Typically, Unreal tech demos usually end up in production games roughly 3-4 years after we first see them, and games like Battlefront have already been using some pretty amazing tech on the visuals using photogrammetry (which I'm pretty sure the Unreal footage I linked was using too).

Games engines still often cheat a lot, especially when it comes to intensive operations such as lighting, but they're getting really clever at that too. Some lighting you see in games will be pre-baked, which can take hours to calculate upfront, but can then be used in realtime. Only drawback is once it's baked, it's set. You can't change it but you can get some really professional-looking results with it. It works great for games where you're not concerned about time of day changing.

But games with day/night cycles are also looking crazy impressive. Check out any time lapse videos of Forza Horizon 3 to see the kind of lighting we can currently get even in an open-world game. Also some of the mods people are using on games like Skyrim and GTA5. Some of them run like ass even with an amazing PC, but there are plenty out there now which look incredible at playable framerates.

Every so often a new game just comes along that completely raises the bar on a technical level, without even needing extra horsepower. People love to bitch about consoles and their lack of power vs PC, but it's due to these restrictions that developers keep coming up with ridiculous optimisations and new trickery that allows them to push these machines to their absolute limits. Just check any console launch titles versus end of life ones.

Even now, Forza Horizon 3, and Horizon Zero Dawn on the X1 and PS4 are leagues ahead of what we had at launch on both consoles.&&Technically it is based on a scene shot in a movie set, so given similar light parameters and material composition, it would only make sense to recreate some aspects of the set that the film crew used to create the scene.

Let's say my favorite movie is 'Big Fish', but my favorite Tim Burton movie is 'Edward Scissorhands'. 

'Big Fish' is the better movie between the two, but the one that is full-on Burton style is 'Edward Scissorhands'. 

You can make a similar statement saying my favorite movie is 'Schindler's List' but my favorite Spielberg is 'E.T.' You exactly know which is the better film, but it might not be the film you think about when you hear the name 'Spielberg'.

I don't know, I'm just trying to make a point for the guy. Even in the case, he was just being sarcastic, I myself do these considerations from time to time.&&Impressive work.

Plus, I think if you had to split Tarantino i to two stylistic groups, it'd  have Fiction, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, Death Proof on one side, and Basterds, Django, Kill Bill, Hateful Eight on the other.

I think serial killers are *incredibly* interesting, and I enjoy reading into them a lot, but it seems in terribly poor taste, and even slightly disconcerting, that a movie studio is lionizing this man -- a man who tortured, raped, murdered, and stripped his victims of their dignity.

It is important that information about Bundy and other troubled men (and women) remain available to the public and to remain a topic of discussion. However, making a major motion picture that headlines an A-list movie star -- who attained his stardom on the backs of a young, Disney following no less -- delivers the wrong message and cements Bundy further as a (sexy?) pop culture icon rather that what he truly is -- a disturbed human being who's own selfishness and debasement for sexual gratification led to the excruciatingly painful annihilation of many human lives.

Imagine a movie starring Jake Gyllenhaal as the gunman in Sandy Hook or Orlando Bloom and Tom Hardy as the Boston Bombers or some other Hollywood heartthrob standing in as the shooter in Las Vegas, Parkland, Orlando, etc.?

The more you know 👍&&Do you listen to My Favorite Murder? &&I feel like a lot of the interesting stuff is going to be on the dialogue which obviously can't be shown through an image.&&Ted Bundy was only 42 when he was executed. However he started his brutal murders when he was in his 20's. So I don't think you could really call him a middle aged man. &&[deleted]&&I don’t think middle aged means what you think it means&&But they also are not inspiring anyone to watch it in the first place.&&Same with Hidden Figures, he was just racist Sheldon. &&It’s kind of like Jesse Eisenberg with how he’s always talking fast and he only ever seems like one character &&*The Normal Heart&&The Normal Heart? &&He barely said anything in a Normal Heart. He was just, random gay guy who didn’t die. &&The only time when he wasn’t Sheldon was in Garden State. Mom banger.&&Even Glenn Howerton from Its Always Sunny. Guy can't even get a different TV show without people calling him Dennis, let alone movie deals. It's too bad too - he's a Julliard trained actor, I think he could have really good range if people could let go of Dennis for a little while. &&So it's Ross in Band of Brothers?

Okay Easy Company, pivot! pivot! pivot!&&You should watch American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson&&Well, Parsons is so far getting a lot more work than those other guys got.

&&I just imagine how hard it must be to pretend to be _that_ racist. He’s such a nice guy in person, that it was almost distracting to see him be mean lol. 

I also remember him in the garden state. While it’s still nerd like, it’s more... lower class? Trying to get by? &&It's kind of funny: I'd argue that the main Harry Potter actor *least* affected by Harry Potter syndrome is actually Daniel Radcliffe.

At this point, I don't even really see Harry Potter anymore when I look at him. As has been said, he takes such interesting/weird roles and just fucking *goes for it* to the point that he's done a good job of disassociating himself from Harry.

Emma Watson, on the other hand, is pretty much always Hermione to me in everything she does. Tom Felton is always Malfoy. Rupert Grint is always Ron. But Daniel Radcliffe is pretty much whoever he happens to be playing at the time.&&[deleted]&&True. But I'd like to mention Daniel Radcliffe has done some amazing work after Harry Potter. He's really talented and diverse. &&Michael Cera syndrome.

I do think his background is appropriate for the subject matter of the film. However, directing actors, coordinating large sets, performing reshoots etc. makes things definitely different than directing a doc. 

Also, Blair witch 2 was not well received at all.&&I don't really believe in numbers, but yes, definitely at least twice a day. And that's really only counting while I'm awake probably.&&The reason people think the media shouldn't release names of shooters is because it gives the shooters exactly what they're looking for, fame/recognition. Which could in turn potentially motivate other disturbed people to commit similar acts. While I understand your point that we shouldn't idolize mass murderers I wouldn't say this movie is going to be an idolization. I think the reason they are making this movie is just like that OJ Simpson trial miniseries. This is a case that was very much in the public eye at the time and probably had a huge influence on popular culture. Also plain and simple a lot people are interested in violence and crime it's why the media focuses so much on it when these things happen. Hollywood executives are aware of that fact and are going to capitalize on it any way they can. &&So it's one small, interesting part of his life, rather than a full-blown biopic?&&Is this a joke &&Oops no Hetfield is the officer, my teacher's the sheriff&&Lol oh snap &&***ABSOLUTE HORROR!***&&Someone get Jim Breuer in here&&Ugh I just watched the YouTube clip of their recent show in Italy.

There's a reason they played ""sexy boy"" to introduce him on the last podcast on the left (which i highly recommend)&&[deleted]&&I think considering the content, It's a movie that people will have already made up their mind about for the most part. Anyone who was  going to watch it to ""find out what happens"" can do so on Wikipedia - there's an assumption that people know the basics of the story, and so they're deliberately not giving away what little detail remains. Most biopics take a similar approach - show a few shots of the stars as their respective characters, and not too much else.

I think a movie like this has the most to gain from their leads interpretation and portrayal of the characters, and showing too much of that ruins the appeal somewhat.&&>he was just regular Sheldon

&&This is making me happier than it should&&Allegedly that's why he was able to evade police in so many states.

Quite relaxing, if I do say so myself.&&It's supposed to cover many years I think&&Duh.&&What's his name?&&I cannot live!&&110% accurate. Kirk’s vibrato sounds like it has the confidence of a teen having sex for the first time.&&Metallica was never the cleanest band to begin with. I owned long years a early 90ies live bootleg where they fuck up the beginning of ""Blackened"" and it was mainly a timing error by Kirk. 
Its also rare to find a major metal album where they failed so hard with the production as ""St. Anger"". And its also not a secret that Jason Newsted lagged miles behind Cliff Burton regarding his technical abilities. 
It will never change that they are sometimes sloppy live, nonetheless its a great band. Their greatness is in song writing and how they defined a sound on their 2nd-4th album that was adapted and copied by probably thousands of metal bands all around the world. 
 
&&Kirk was never a very clean player, fam. Even in their prime. He's always used wah and speed to cover up for sloppy technique. Sounds more evident in that orion video because of the garbo tone on his guitar, imo.


With that said, still love them.&&It's all about throwing black beach balls into the audience now.&&No way?
&&It's true. And honestly their lack of really having an ""elite"", highly schooled musician in the band is part of their charm. Anyone with a couple years of guitar lessons can pull off just about anything they do. It's kinda what makes them awesome. They're the heavy metal continuation of AC/DC. &&No, but really. He actually IS the band. I’m fairly certain Hetfield feels like he’s herding cats when he gets his band mates to play along with him. He’s immensely talented. &&I mean isn't it an open secret by now that Metallica's entirely written by James and Lars? Pretty sure Kirk and Robert just come in and record their parts with Kirk making up a solo on the spot.

See: [Writing credits for every album](https://www.reddit.com/r/Metallica/comments/5bby5a/metallica_writing_credits_19832016/). Kirk has half of James'/Lar's credits, and some of them look like their from a ""We'll all get writing credit"" thing on Death Magnetic and St. Anger&&James is probably one of, if not the best rhythm players out there. Kirk knows the pentatonic scale and has a wha pedal.&&Looks like RDJ &&[deleted]&&Hail Satan!&&You want out of the cult already?&&Thank you! I got about 10 minutes into the JonBenet Ramsey episode and never came back. They were such assholes about it. Like, a 6-year-old died. I don't care how funny you think you are, the joke should never be *on the six-year-old who died.* This podcast gets recommended a lot on Reddit and I never get it. Even if I didn't think their jokes were in poor taste, I didn't think they were funny either. I think My Favorite Murder strikes a much better balance between humor and acknowledging that awfulness of the crimes.&&Man, all this hate for them in this thread is honestly making me pretty sad. Everyone's making them sound like they spend every episode solely on making fun of victims of terrible shit, when 99% of the time that's not the case. I've listened to every episode of theirs, some more than once, and I'm honestly having trouble thinking of many instances like that. Maybe 5 line-crossing jokes off the top of my head, but with 300+ episodes spanning hundreds of hundreds of hours, a handful of bad jokes really isn't that bad. I'm sure we've all said and laughed at horrible shit more than once in our lives. 

Besides, all three of them are well-known for being really sweet dudes, and I think it's pretty clear they don't make off-color jokes to be malicious about it but more to put a bit of laughter in a world so full of terrible things.&&This is how I felt when I first started listening to them.   I don't know what changed (maybe I got used to their comedy style, maybe they softened over time) but I can't get enough now &&Yeah that was my issue with that particular podcast too. Imo they're trying way too hard to be edgy or whatever the right word is. In the case you mentioned, yeah the fault is still with the dude who murdered her, not with the person who wanted to help. 

I much prefer podcasts like Gen Why for that reason, though I know it's also not everyone's favourite.&&You'll know pretty quickly if you like the humor or not.  All three guys have a specific role and one guy, Henry, is the designated 'funny guy' who goes into ridiculous impressions all the time.  Marcus the 'research guy' actually does an incredible job of research but a lot of people are put off by the constant jokes from Henry and Ben.  

They've done a lot of episodes so pick one that's on a topic you're already interested in.  The multi part episodes on famous cults or serial killers are their best ones.  The /r/LPOTL subreddit voted the Jeffrey Dahmer episodes as their favorite, so I guess start there.  The 5 part series on Jim Jones' People's Temple cult just wrapped up and is also really good.

&&i personally really like it, check out the series on aum shenrikyo if u want a jumping off point&&Glad I could help! 

I used to be confused about it but my Grandad taught me this way and I've never forgotten since. &&Bazinga&&Is it racist if he thinks *everyone* is beneath him?&&*laughing track*&&It's another one of the many, many reasons Batman v. Superman is unwatchable. Jesse Eisenberg doesn't even try to play Lex Luthor. He's just evil(er) Mark Zuckerberg.

He was *ever so slightly better* in JL's post-credits scene, but the casting choice was just so terrible to begin with that it can't really be salvaged. Fortunately, it looks like there's very little chance of the DCEU's current incarnation existing long enough to see him try again.

[Also this is obligatory](http://www.dorkly.com/post/76751/i-hope-the-batman-v-superman-trailer-was-a-misdirect-and-this-is-the-actual-movie)&&For me, it's that when he wants to get tough or serious, it comes off... just weird, I guess?

It's like he drops into a lower tone of voice and continues that fast-talking delivery, except with 50% more smugness.  I can't take him seriously because he cannot do any moment requiring gravitas without becoming irritating.

I don't mind him as an actor, but he has a niche.  He's made to play insufferable Silicon Valley types, so in that regard, he nailed it in *The Social Network.*&&Exactly. I'd love to see him tackle a dramatic role. He was on Fargo for a few episodes but even that was mostly comedic relief (in a twisted way).&&""Aww Juice, it's like you're not the Juice anymore, Juice!"" &&And yet... All I could think about was how Ross and Rachel were on a break while Rod Tidwell was taking off In a bronco. &&I think he got a bad rap in that series. Many members of Easy Company acknowledged Sobels training as part of their success. Sure by all accounts he was very much a prick and hated by his men... but he wasn't getting them ready for a walk in the park, he was sending them into a damn meat grinder of hell. But on the other hand every account given by the people who were there say that that's how it happened, so what can you do.

His death is pretty depressing as well. He tried to kill himself by shooting himself in the head and instead severed his optic nerve and blinding himself completely. He lived another 17 years then died of malnutrition in a VA hospital, where he was buried without any kind of service.&&Schwimmer is in the same boat. ABSURD money from Friends. I need a show...&&At this point, he’s not doing it for the money. &&Don't forget that he's also doing the narration for Young Sheldon (along with an executive producer credit).&&True. The beard helps too.&&But then they think he's Frodo. Can't win :/&&Maybe he should play Superman next!&&You should watch A Young Doctor's Notebook. It's on Netflix, it's really good. He's the lead in it and fantastic. It's probably my favourite role of his to date.&&Don't forget him in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency he was great in that. &&If you ask me, it has worked pretty well! &&Remember when he was naked with a horse&&That was Elijah Wood.&&Swiss Army Man was the most immature movie that I'm comfortable unequivocally calling ""good"". 


It's a fucking masterpiece, and I love how Radcliffe just goes for fucking whatever he wants, rollwise. &&Swiss Army Man is an awesome movie. It's quirky and out there so it's not going to appeal to everyone but I loved it. &&Swiss Army Man was the most bizarre and hilarious thing I’ve ever seen. And it was GOOD. 

My boyfriend and I also just watched Jungle and he did great in that movie too. Very enjoyable. 

He finally isn’t just “Harry” for me anymore even though I’m a major Harry Potter nerd (mostly the books though)&&Imperium 👍&&Will do.

I've actually got one called Beast of Burden that he did lined up to watch this weekend&&I agree that it’s my first thought but it goes away quickly and I don’t think about it again. 

Whereas watching Tom Felton in the flash all I could think of was Draco. &&Fun fact: Chuck Lorre (Producer of Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, etc.) also wrote the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song.&&The Paperboy*&&>And now I miss Matthew Perry. Dammit

British films at least try to hire based on talent and potential for a story rather than good looks. That's not to say that American films aren't well made or that American actors aren't talented, it's just that they generally have to be talented *and* good looking. &&My issue is despite the superficial label of “handsome” they share, they don’t resemble each other at all. 

Ted was a tall, skinny, pale, clean cut Washington type and in my opinion Efron isn’t pulling that look off in any of the stills that have been released nor would I have predicted he would. &&BOTANY&&Yeah, exactly. Could have been so simple and effective.

https://i.imgur.com/5Ilfnjf.png&&Yeah, something really conventional and forgettable like that would be much better&&I had to google it tbh&&Are you seriously leaving kill 'em all out of this?&&Whaaaa!? The Unforgiven contains, in my opinion, the very best guitar solo of all time. Shit gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it. Some mighty fine a-pickin' and a-singin'. Saw them live only a few years ago and was blown away how tight they still were. &&The joke here is ""wah"". As in Kirk's codependency with a wah pedal. &&Playing Hatfields rhythm and singing at the same time is fucking hard. &&Is this true for Cliff’s bass parts too? I know there fast at least. 

I think their current bassist Robert Trujillo is an academically trained musician. &&I've been playing for over a decade, and know a lot of people who play a lot better than me. Don't know anyone who can play the riffs he writes, down picking only (the correct way), while singing, and do it for an entire show. His right arm is bionic and some of the riffs he's written are literally genre defining. 

&&Hardcore death/tech/melodic/asinine music enthusiast here.....Hetfield's down picking is on par with jason richardson sweeps. He'a a fucking legend. &&What? No. Down picking like Hetfield is a life's work. My forearm is on fire after half a song usually. Playing their music correctly is extremely difficult. &&Hail Gein!&&To be fair it is a get out of cult free card. &&My true crime podcast of choice is True Crime Garage. They can be a bit crude some times but I don't recall them ever making fun of a victim.&&yeah Karen and Georgia definitely know how to balance humor far better than the lpotl dudes, i just wish they’d put more effort into their recaps of the murders. especially with georgia, it’s like she’s never read what she copy/pasted together before the podcast. really annoying. 

there’s also this weird dynamic of the last podcast dudes where it’s like they’re all trying to be the funniest, most outrageous one. strange, nerd machismo bullshit that really turns me off. it’s just not good. &&I don’t get the hate either. I’m not a huge fan of Henry but I was never offended by what they’ve joked about. I think they try to be pretty respectful of the victims. Unless I missed something.   
Sometimes es the way to deal with all the crazy in the world is to laugh about it.   Maybe some things were said in that “I’m uncomfortable with this so I’m going to joke about it” way. &&That's how i feel about it as well, as well as them making fun of themselves and almost every person in their family. They seem to have a statute of limitations since they were really good about 9/11&&[deleted]&&Baznigga&&'Penny comes jumbling in with a bra on 2.75 sizes to small and a laptop with wifi problems'

&&Maybe that's why the character sucked. He didn't know how to make Zuckerberg more evil, so he blew a fuse and became a Tex Avery character with a god complex.&&I'm honestly still pissed they made him Lex Luthor. I love DC, but what a disappointing movie.&&>It's like he drops into a lower tone of voice and continues that fast-talking delivery, except with 50% more smugness.  I can't take him seriously because he cannot do any moment requiring gravitas without becoming irritating.

I enjoyed his portrayal of Lex. I thought him portraying a smug, irritating douchecanoe with a rich-kid complex was the point?

&&[deleted]&&That happened to a dude at an AA/NA meeting I used to go to. Like, your life sucks so much that you feel you should end it, but all you did was make it worse. That's rough, buddy.&&that shcwimmer money!&&Yeah, as an actor you want to be a well respected actor, one of the greats.

Little Shelly is hilarious. &&It was Frodo in Swiss Army Man, right? &&Also, that play that he was naked in.&&Harry Potter And The Farting Corpse&&He's developed into a seriously talented actor.

edit: holy shit almost 300 upvotes for a reference, I need to know how to handle fame now

edit2: now its 300, great! <3 love u guys&&I was trying to think of a word other than evoke, because I knew someone was gonna reply with this, but I couldn’t think of one. I hate it when people try to be really verbose when talking about imagery or symbolism or whatever because it just makes them look like they’re full of themselves&&I actually disagree. I think in this still Zach actually looks pretty standard haven't-seen-the-sun-in-180-days Seattle pale. Although It's hard to hide that Zach's a hunk, this still makes it seem they did a decent job. He'd blend right in at my office... even if he might be stealing chicks out from under me.&&Easy to say and remember is the key.&&I know music taste is subjective and all but really? That’s not even a top 5 Metallica solo for me. Have you heard The Four Horseman, Fade to Black, Ride the Lightning, or Master of Puppets?&&Exactly. Some of his timing on his riffs and his vocals patterns are so hard to pull off. So many overlook that.

Late edit: A great example is Blackened. No idea how he sings and plays that song. That’s the real gift. Many times a lead singer will just add a layer of open chords if they play. &&Trujillo is a legitimately great bassist. He's not some Jaco or Wooten level guy, but he far outclasses any of the other guys in the band in terms of proficiency with his instrument.&&Ya, I think these guys are good musicians. They've far outclassed they're own skill as instrumentalists with their creativity and song writing.  From a purely technical standpoint, however, Trujillo aside, they're pretty weak, but they make up for it with grit and practice. The bass parts are also rather simple, speaking personally as a bassist I can play all of the bass parts rather easily and I'm years past being in practice. I'm a big fan of Metallica, have been since the late 80s, but I don't think there's any arguing there are many technically better metal bands out there.&&""Pulling teeth"", the bass solo on their first album, is not easy to play. Cliff was definitely a very competent player. It does not show so much in their regular riffing because Metallica has a habit that the bass plays very strictly along the rhythm guitar. &&Megustalations&&Hail ME!&&Are you kidding me? My favorite murder giggles about how they barely do any research... it’s a fucking huge disrespect. If I’m ever murdered my number one fear is them talking about me. Yes over the fact of being murdered&&Eh, as a long time fan (who is also getting sick of their shit, for different reasons), I wouldn't agree. 

Marcus Parks is a saint, so much research and dedication to the true crime world. Stays on topic and jokes aren't too absurd. Ben Kissel tries to be the straight man. Doesn't do too much research, but loves derailing the show for his go-to  (and sometimes shoehorned) dry humor. My problem is Henry, who does a lot of research and cannot resist interrupting and derailing any topic at any point.

I don't think the color of their humor is a problem. They make light the darkest moments in history. If that's not for you, True Crime Garage, Sword & Scale, and plenty of others tell the tales in more respectful ways.

Unrelated, I did not need five episodes on Waco followed by another Marcus Parks podcast randomly replacing this week's episode.&&Totally agreed. They all remind me of obnoxious American morning radios hosts. They really think they are so hilarious, I feel like this is how they increase their egos/get off.
I really prefer MFM, but totally agree about Georgia. She can come off as really immature and scatter brained. To be fair I think she and Karen do the same amount of prep, Karen is just better spoken and more of a natural.
You should try out All Killa no filla. They do great research and are really hilarious and crude. It’s very northern British (I think?)  anyway defiantly worth a shot!!! &&God and the sometimes hour worth of just BANTER before the episode. I really wish they'd have a time stamp in the description where the actual stories start vs them just talking about their lives.&&LPOTL and The Dollop both have the same vibe to them, and I really can't listen to either - and it's exactly as you describe. One-upping in the most obnoxious way possible. I just hit the fast forward button 30 seconds and pray that they've moved on. 

MFM is certainly more respectful of the victims and I appreciate that, but like you said, I wish they put just a tiny bit more effort in. The lack of effort makes them sound... dumber than I think they are? Like dumb on purpose, and it's sad because I'm sure they're actually really smart in a real conversation. 

If you can roll with supernatural stuff, And That's Why We Drink is another okay podcast that balances humor and true crime/paranormal stories. But, I get the same problem with them as I do with MFM. Sometimes they are just a little too umprepared. &&Casefile is hands down my favorite podcast. Any recommendations for something similar? &&Yeah besides how much of an unbelievable piece of crap the S&S host is, it's also way over edited and lazily done imo. I can easily look up full length 911 calls by myself. And the money begging, Jesus. 

Anyway, I like Casefile and GenWhy exactly because of how simple they are and the hosts have good voices for a podcast. That's not a given with many others either.&&Haha, Sword and Scale has good details, but the host is so insufferable when he breaks the fourth wall. 

Literally did one of those anti-youngsters rants and said ""if you don't know the definition of 'meme', then you're probably not a young male sitting in his basement staring at reddit"" or something. I know the irony that I am on reddit, but chill dude. &&Z I M B A B W E&&I rarely lol. But that made me.

Something about Radcliffe makes me enjoy and want to support his work, he just seems like a genuinely decent dude.&&Chuck Lorre used to be way more fun. He made Dharma and Greg, the earlier 2.5M seasons, and then somewhere around 2006 he became a huge cynic and everything he made was full of bitterness and sarcasm. Hell, I'd argue that TBBT could've been Reddit's favourite show if it were handled differently from the beginning.&&On the outside I am black, but on the inside I am a 35 year old white man&&I agree with you there.  At the very least he is the more experienced musician having been in successful bands besides Metallica. As a teenager I was a big Suicidal and Grooves fan and saw them quite a few times during the late 80's, early 90's.   In fact, in 1989 they (Suicidal) were supporting Metallica on their Justice tour and me and my buds stayed at the Knoxville Hyatt next door to the arena.. we were 2 floors beneath Suicidal and got to meet them in the lobby the night of the show. I remember because Rocky George's pants fell down as he stepped off the tour bus.  We tried like hell all night to get up on their floor but security guards were in the stairwells and at elevators.. but we had backstage passes (unfortunately, Metallica didn't participate in the fan meet & greet, much to everyone's outrage).  Man, those were the good days of metal.&&Lars has always sucked, though.&&Rewarding thread. &&Mmm...hot...buttery goodness...mmm...I’m not sure i can solve this case but I sure am tasty...mmm&&You don’t enjoy 30 mins of pointless babble and vocal fry?!???&&

'Bill & Ted' Star Alex Winter Says He Was Sexually Abused as a Child Star,28301,7ury1c,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bill-ted-star-alex-winter-says-he-was-sexually-abused-as-a-child-star-1081204,1880,1517584536.0,,"There is a reason 99% of child actors come out of hollywood fucked up. Sooner or later the dam is going to break.&&I'm glad other people are stepping forward. No one listens to Corey Feldman because he's so fucked in the head. Really there's a good reason he's fucked in the head and it sucks that more isn't being done to stop other kids from meeting the same fate.

EDIT: To all those ""He should name names without asking for a paycheck"" replies -

He already has. He spoke to the police when the incidents occurred. He even started again after pitching the movie because the movie is about more than his specific abuse. So far he has publicly named [Alphy Hoffman, Jon Grissom and Marty Weiss.](http://www.newsweek.com/who-alphy-hoffman-corey-feldman-reveals-name-third-alleged-child-abuser-710384) Apparently it's a more popular story to talk about how greedy he is because asking for money to make a movie had a much larger media footprint than any of his name drops.&&[deleted]&&This news made me cry. I'm a huge fan, obviously. 


I've always wondered if this happened to him because of two things he's said in interviews that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

1. During an interview about The Lost Boys (which happens to be my favorite interview of Alex), when asked if he hung out with the other actors while filming, he said that he did. However, although the Coreys and Jamison Newlander were younger than him, he hung out with them the most [""mostly to keep an eye on them to make sure they were okay.""](http://spectrumculture.com/2017/07/31/first-come-first-staked-alex-winter-revisits-lost-boys/)

2. In an interview--or maybe even in one of his AMAs here--he was asked what advice he'd give to child actors or young actors. He said the advice he'd give would be to their parents and the advice was something like watch your kids very closely because things can go wrong and go wrong quickly. I'll try to find that interview and post it. 

ETA: The second question was indeed from one of his AMAs. 


The questions asked by u/itsdavidthegreat: 



[**Q:** What are some of the biggest challenges facing child stars, and what impact does America's celebrity-obsessed culture have?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/c9nch69/)



[**Alex:** navigating the industry is hard at any age. it's especially fraught as a child. And the culture's obsession with raising up and tearing down celebrities is especially hard when that celebrity is young.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/c9ncjd2/)



[**Q:** Thanks for the response! One of my friends has a couple of kids who have been doing a bunch of acting lately - what's some advice you would give to an aspiring child actor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/c9ncp8o/)



[**Alex:** more to the parents than the actor. be there all the time. be sane. and be vigilant. when things go bad, they go bad very quickly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d6e4m/hey_alex_winter_here_from_bill_ted_and_downloaded/c9ncvq1/)
&&i want the children and more former child stars to speak out.

Cause odds are most of them go crazy or act the way they are because they were touched or harassed or whatever.&&This has happened since the beginning of Hollywood, remember the abuse that Judy Garland suffered at the hand of some producers in The Wizard of Oz. Why didn't anyone mention anything in this awards season? Because is not fashionable to talk about it? Is so fucked up that children still are being abused and everyone in the industry continues to be silent. &&Good on him for speaking out. I remember reading about how close he was to the two Corey's back in the day along with Brooke McCarter (who went on to become Haims manager). Always thought it was cool that the older Vampires were looking out for Haim and Feldman, now we know that they were genuinely protecting them from worse predators.&&[deleted]&&For those wondering what Alex Winter has been up to lately, [he's huge in the cryptocurrency / online privacy space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Winter#Technology_and_privacy_activism), and has been tapped as an SME in several documentaries.

What happened to him is horrifying, and I'm glad he is making the world a better place for the rest of us.&&People need to really stop fucking kids.&&Most heinous...somewhere right now Keanu is sludge hammering the guns out of the cement floor of his garage &&Just like every rose has its thorn...    
We love you dude and sending all the righteous vibes your way.   
Go Wyld Stallyns!&&So thats 2 of the Lost Boys?&&I can only imagine the molestation gauntlet Ariana Grande had to go through.&&One of the positive things about MeToo is people who said they'd never come forward feel like they can finally come forward. It's amazing, his abuser is dead and he *still* didn't feel like he could say anything for years. &&>The world of Bill & Ted is a very sweet and fun place to run around in.

Sounds like he was distracted by his character and the world his character lived in. That's not a bad thing. I'm glad he's sharing his story. &&So I clicked through on a link on the page, an it's Nicole Eggert saying Chachie abused her on the set of Charles in Charge since she was 14. And then I'm remembering some of the shit Joanie said about him on the set of Happy Days. Guys, I think Scott Baio just might not be a very nice person. &&“The problems aren’t going to get sorted out overnight, because frankly, these issues are part of the fabric of human nature, and they’ve existed since there have been human beings walking around on the planet,” he said.

“So it’s going to take time, it’s going to take mental health work, it’s going to take the capacity of society to listen to some very unpleasant truths about itself. And there’s no doubt that that’s going to take time.”

He is a most righteous dude.&&Time for Hollywood to face its child abuse problem &&Rewatching his older movies now is going to make me sad knowing how much pain he was going through back then. :(&&I recommend you watch An Open Secret, it's a documentary about this very same situation and the pedo/porn hollywood ring&&More people need to consider things like this before ripping these folks apart. The line of people attempting to destroy Britney Spears, Lindsey Lohan, and Amanda Bynes was unbelievably long. The lack of compassion for people in these circumstances is disappointing. The sad part is those that did it won't change their ways, even after learning of events like this.&&I think partly why he never acted after the second film, and why he's only coming back to the industry now and has been interested since a few years ago is,

because of the pervs. And now, they couldn't get him anymore.&&That is most unexcellent.&&And yet Bryan Singer is still allowed to make movies. Everyone wants to be a nice guy and talk about how tragic this is, but nobody wants to fucking do anything. I guarantee all of you will go see Singer's next film and not blink an eye.&&[removed]&&The new bill and ted should be about going back in time and saving the kids from Hollywood. Lol i know its fucking dumb  &&Ok.  Until literally this moment I thought Keanu Reeves’ counterpart in that movie was Sean Penn.

Literally my entire life up until this moment.

It’s a terrible horrendous thing about the molestation.&&If you are a male survivor.and are looking for information and support check out www.malesurvivor.org &&This is so sad. 

Just watched Excellent Adventure again for the 1000th time. That movie is cheesy and definitely of the times, but it fucking holds up. My 4 year old LOVED it.&&these days the question in hollywood should be who hasn't been sexually assaulted.&&People for years mocked other people when they brought up child molestation in Hollywood. And whats worse is the media labeled the likes of Lindsey Lohan and Amanda Bynes who were also molested as crazy. The media is a sack of shit and can burn in hell.&&I'm glad people are taking him seriously, but I can't help but notice the difference Reddit as a whole treats actors who admit abuse vs actresses.  It's rather depressing.&&At first glance of this article I was worried he was found to be a child molester. The alternative is not much better, but at least he's not molesting kids. Be excellent to each other.&&It's ironic how even after all these the industry is still alive.

Like, dozens of fuckers have assaulted small kids, and probably dozens of other ones will do the same, but who cares right?

""Hollywood's culture is changing"" my ass.

Fuck Hollywood.&&Not Bill Preston Esquire!&&I just went to listen to the whole interview - it's worth a listen. Very sad subject, but Alex talks about it very eloquently and insightfully. 

If you can access BBC iPlayer then it's [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09pkw8v#play) from about 01:07:21&&Hollywood is so messed up. What i find bizarre is meryl streep is acting as front for ""hollywood needs to get better"" but she supports roman polanski. She applauded a man who escaped justice on having sex with an underage girl.

Even Rose mcGowan did a movie with a child molester? Yet she said about Rosewood Lane ""Yeah, I still don’t really understand the whole story or history there, and I’d rather not, because it’s not really my business. But he’s an incredibly sweet and gentle man, lovely to his crew, and a very hard worker""

Now she's the face against hollywood perverts apparently.

I sound like a republican but i'm british and definitely not a conservative so can anyone tell me why or how hollywood would fix itself with the above? Are the above lies and i've fallen for fake news?

It seems as the million dollar man ted dibiase that morals only come into play then there is no money involved....everyone has a price and everyone's going to pay &&Hollywood is quick to tell the rest of the world how to live and how to act, yet they refuse to solve the issue of child molestation that plagues their entire industry.  Just like the Catholic church!&&Hey Kim, if push comes to shove, please nuke Hollywood.&&Once saw ‘The Cure’ which starred a young Brad Renfro & Joseph Mazello of two characters playing best friends, anyway I picked up on something through the movie I thought was interesting ; a red flag to say the least, out of curiosity I later did a search on Brad Renfro and I realised the guy died of an overdose.

EDIT: Originally said Brad hung him self which is incorrect, it was an overdose, apologies. &&Love how this is all coming to light now - When ""conspiracy theorists"" brought this out years ago we were called crazy..

Years and years ago there was a thread on bb/misc about the child rape and it got archived after 300 pages&&Damn, could we see a spin off where he uses the telephone booth to go back in time to seek revenge?&&That's terrible to hear.  Just today I was listening to an older Nerdist podcast with him and it was incredible.  [He made a documentary called Deep Web](http://alexwinter.com/projects/deep-web/) in which he talked to a bunch of heavy hitters in the Silk Road.  He has since become a huge privacy advocate. &&Bogus!&&This is the big story. Not to downplay what has been going on with women... but the dark secret is what is being done to the young kids in Hollywood.  It is still being shoved under the rug. Look at Corey Feldman. &&Damn, I hate pedos!&&...Bogus :( &&Bogus. Heinous.  Most non-triumphant.&&Hollywood is full of pedos.&&This news is most heinous.


Sad that Hollywood predators are taking advantage of children actors looking to make it big.&&Not so Excellent :(&&My father was abused by a priest. It ruined his life and our lives. He’s been dead for 20 years now because he drank and ate himself to death. The shame, the pain..... so angry. I feel so much for Alex and these victims. &&>Winter didn’t go public at the time, he says, because “there is a power dynamic that does put you in a position where you’re afraid for your own safety. So there’s that, on top of the taboo nature of being public.”

>Winter explained that the “lightbulb” moment in terms of talking about what had happened came over the last year, since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, saying he never thought he’d ever discuss it with the media.&&[deleted]&&Seriously. People have given child stars who end up broken adults so much crap, its about time people realize there is a reason SO MANY of them end up as broken adults, and that the well-adjusted ones are exceptions to the rule. Everyone needs to wake up to this, and not ignore it while we focus on #metoo. &&Read *Less Than Zero* by Bret Easton Ellis. Some notable child stars have said this book describes pretty well how their teenage years went. Same author as *American Psycho*, by the way.

This book put me in a funk for at least two weeks. Messed up.&&At least one of the Stranger Things kids will end up being a really damaged adult&&Child abuse in the whole L.A. entertainment industry remains the biggest beast to take down, but that campaign on sexual misconduct is helping, it seems.&&OK, this is total speculation - but you kinda just blew my mind, here.

ie- until literally just now, I *used* think that the reason that most childhood actors either ended up dead or totally fucked up on booze and/or drugs was b/c they just 'couldn't handle the fame'... now? Now I'm thinking that it's b/c most were sexually abused as children by executives in the industry. (ie- Hollywood positions of power are crawling w/ pedo's)

Yes, that's one hell of a conspiracy I'm laying out, and I have no direct evidence of the number...and I also *really hope* I'm wrong. Ack.&&Ever wonder why Keanu looks so sad?&&Even without sexual abuse, child stars don't quite have the ""regular"" childhood and enough reasons to be significantly different compared to ""regular"" people.&&Did its not just rape. They subject them to horrors. Pedofilia is the tip of an iceberg. &&""You're damaging an entire industry"" -Barbara Walters to Corey


&&Winter was in The Lost Boys with both Coreys. Winter was Marko in the vampire gang.&&Yeah it is amazing how many people just go “haha this crazy actor that acts like a kid said he was sexually abused as a kid so he is fucked up.” With out actually connecting the dots.&&Am I the only one who believes Corey Feldman about Michael Jackson?&&People listen to Feldman and believe him all the time.  Then amazingly the media turns it's back to him, and starts talking about something else in unison because you don't want to upset the fat cats out in Hollywood.&&other families' issues.&&I know people who have worked with him. I've heard stories for years but everyone has been too afraid to speak out. I once heard a person quote him as saying something like ""bring me the writer! I want to fuck him!"" When i asked what happened after that,  everyone looked at te ground. So, I'm very interested to hear where this is going to go. &&Bryan Singer? Whaaaa? But he has worked with Kevin Spacey on multiple...oh nooooooo

Additionally: I read through some of the comments on this doc a year ago and was shocked to find some people not finding anything wrong with it.

But since you mentioned Brad Renfro that reminded me an undeniable red flag.  Renfro later starred in Apt Pupil where a 14 year old extra accused director Brian Singer of asking him and other underage boys to strip naked for a shower scene.  There was a lawsuit over it which was dismissed for insufficient evidence.  I vaguely remember hearing about this at the time.  It seems most people wrote it off as a shakedown attempt by the extra's parents.   Given recent revelations about Brian Singer, it seems very likely it happened. &&What was the red flag, exactly? What did you pick up on that seemed wrong?  I loved that movie when I was young but I have not watched it through the lens of adulthood. &&It was Jonathan Brandis from Seaquest that hanged himself. &&No he didn’t, he OD’d&&Not excellent&&I do not think anyone needs to downplay anything to say that this is all bad.

Quite frankly this problem is never going to get addressed because people aren't accepting their responsibility in it.

We, collectively, enjoy feeling superior to others.  Whether that's displaying just how goddamn moral and enlightened we are, or looking down on Honey Boo Boo or Trump supporters or liberals or neckbeards or anybody else who we think are ""trash"".

Celebrity in the real world is no different from celebrity users on reddit.  Everybody likes them until they get a bit sick of them then the wheel turns and they get ate alive.  Same with young celebrities, more for women than men but it happens.

Maybe we're jealous or hateful or that insecure about ourselves that we absolutely need to watch fall from graces to remind us that they aren't *really* better than us? I don't know.

But what I do know is that we all do it.  I do it, you do it, the person reading this does.   The only difference is the target of the dehumanization rather than the effect.

We're too quick to judge, too quick to nail our colours to a mast, too quick to think we've got it all figured out when really we don't know anything about anything and are venting into the ether.  &&her dad was a terrible cocaine addict

Hi! &&Afaik Culkin has not said anything about being abused.

She was really fucked up at a young age because her mother put her in situations completely inappropriate for her age, including lots of drugs. At least Drew seems to have come out the other side relatively unscathed.

From her wiki page:

>In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was already a regular at the racy Studio 54 as a young girl, smoking cigarettes at the age of nine, drinking alcohol at age eleven, smoking marijuana at age twelve and snorting cocaineat age thirteen. Her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was in rehab at the age of fourteen,[1][4] and spent eighteen months in an institution for the mentally ill.[22] A suicide attempt, also at 14,[contradictory] put her back in rehab
&&This is well documented as having happened for the entire history of child stars in Hollywood. A good example of someone who actually spoke about it - most didn't, of course, or we wouldn't be in this situation today - is Judy Garland. 

> They'd give us pep pills. Then they'd take us to the studio hospital and knock us cold with sleeping pills. After four hours they'd wake us up and give us the pep pills again. That's the way we got thin. That's the way we got mixed up. And that's the way we lost contact   

(Edit, didn't include the second part of the quote at first)

> 'No wonder I was strange. Imagine whipping out of bed dashing over to the doctor's office, lying down on a torn leather couch, telling my troubles to an old man who couldn't hear, who answered with an accent I couldn't understand and then dashing to Metro to make movie love to Mickey Rooney'. 
 
The thing that's so brilliant about this is that it serves so many purposes. It makes the kids reliant upon the studio people, it makes them feel like they're complicit in something bad - of course they know taking so many drugs is bad, but it's expected of them - which bonds them even more. Not to mention if you need a lot of emotion from the actor, you can just speed them up as much as you like. There are a lot of freakouts on screen that are basically real, and that were encouraged by the studio. There's a reason pimps like to get their girls hooked on something they can supply. It's the same reasoning. &&The character 'Sarah Lynn' in BoJack Horseman reminded me of Lindsay Lohan.

It's been strange to me to hear the gossip for years about *women* on Epstein's private island stocked with kids doing just as much as men, but for some reason female abusers are not only uncommon in the current wave of scandals, but the ones who **do** get outed get ignored.


Think back on it. You know you've heard of at least 3 women in power abusing people in this whole thing, but can you name any of them? Or have you already forgotten who got accused?&&Barbara Walters is a bitch&&Because she was friends with Weinstein. &&Because people with less integrity go farther. They're willing to do dirty stuff to get ahead. Sad but true&&That's her style. Like when she asked Lewinski if she thought anyone would ever want to take Monica Lewinksi home to meet his parents. I don't think it's meant to be as harsh as it sounds. Like, it's not ""how dare you try to do this"" but rather ""do you really grasp the implications of what you're doing right now?""&&If him talking about being raped damages the industry, then the industry deserves to be damaged.&&Feldman stated that Michael was one of the only ones that DIDN'T abuse him. I really do think he saw himself as a Peter Pan, he honestly just wanted to play with kids and be a kid, nothing nefarious.

What child molester admits in an on-camera interview that he has kids in his bed and has milk and cookies, etc. In his mind he was legit having sleepovers like a typical kid would have with his friends.

Also all the sensationalized supposedly creepy ""child porn"" he had was nothing more than art books that you could buy in any bookstore that the prosecution tried to twist as evidence and the only actual porn found was stuff like Hustler, Playboy...stuff regular straight males would have. It's why he was found not guilty because the evidence actually made him look like a normal guy not a pedo. Radar Online who leaked the supposed incriminating police document was found to have doctored it and added in pages that were not in the real document to make it seem more sensational. They did Michael dirty after he wasn't even alive to defend himself any longer.

There are still people I come across that regurgitate that Radar story about Michael having a secret vault with ""kids heads pasted on adult bodies"". Radar and the rest of the media that spread those lies should be ashamed of themselves. &&Couldn’t agree more.  And At the age of 5 he was already being forced to rehearse for crazy unrealistic, and unfair amounts of time each day. Since his childhood was taken away I personally think that’s why he had the never land ranch to be around what he never experienced &&Thank you! I’ve almost never met anyone who agrees with me on this. If an adult acts like a child, not because they never got to be one, not because they want to fuck them (necessarily). &&Thank you !!  I always maintained this even when he was alive. He wasn’t a pervert. I suspect he was likely completely asexual. But he was SO fucking damaged by being put to work as the goose that laid the golden egg that he literally grew up not knowing how to be a person. It’s why he had such a close relationship with the home alone kid.  He went through something similar and they bonded over their messed up childhoods as their parents’ dancing monkeys. He maintains a fiercely loyal relationship with Paris after MIchael died. No one agrees to be a godfather to their rapists kids.  I always believed Feldman too. Ironically Feldman has also always maintained the Michael Jackson had never done anything inappropriate or that could have been construed as sexual interference. He was just practically brain damaged so he was social stunted. It was like his development stopped the minute they shoved him on that stage and he stayed a 6 year old forever. 

No one could understand why he had such a connection to the Peter Pan story ? Why he called his house neverland ? It was the place where he never grew up. 

It’s like no one has ever even heard of psychology before. You’re right on. &&Another comment I made in another topic was how men 50 years ago were probably molested or abused and were ashamed or encouraged to not talk about it. Thus containing their sorrow which would erupt on others like their wives or friends. Completing the cycle. Maybe if men and women alike could share their frustrations it would go a long way to insure our future children don’t get abused as much or in a perfect world, at all.&&I sometimes mention being raped on reddit and without fail will get at least one response telling me it's impossible for a man to be raped by a woman.  We are still very much in a time where male victims (as well as women, children, trans, prisoners) are mocked.

edit:  As I have come to learn, a simple comment like this can attract some of the best and worst people on reddit but I don't have the mental fortitude to deal with the negatives at the moment, so I'll be disabling inbox replies.  &&He called out many Hollywood actors who had sexually abused him, but still says that Michael Jackson was never one of them. 

Apparently, Michael Jackson was just so emotionally stunted in terms of development (having had no childhood) that he befriended kids in Hollywood. The accusations against him came from a non-Hollywood child, many years after he started these friendships with child actors. The thought is that it was a ploy for money. 

I believe Corey Feldman's account of his personal relationship with Michael Jackson, but that doesn't exactly mean I don't believe his accuser.&&Summery is that Michael Jackson was pretty much the only positive influence he had as a child star. Never was sexual or abusive, helped a bunch and was always a very good friend to him.&&And he could dance like some kind of weightless robot space wizard.&&Of course she did.  She would rather protect her job, than help protect future child stars and expose those who would do them harm.&&And like that... he's gone.&&I forget specifically where i heard this but it was said that Corey Haim was abused on the set of Lost Boys.&&[This is probably the (pretty decent) article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-reasons-child-stars-go-crazy-an-insiders-perspective/) by Mara Wilson (Matilda), herself, on child fame.&&That's because Michael truly loved children and wanted to help them.&&Maybe because Michael went through something similar. He had a rough childhood&&The Jackson accusers straight up admitted they lied. It's a shame people keep believing it. I honestly don't think there's any actual evidence he ever hurt a single kid. &&I was in an arcade bar, and there was this Michael Jackson video game. Guys in suits kept kidnapping children and you played MJ going around saving them.&&Lots of people labeled Michael Jackson as a predator, but I honestly think he was protecting kids like Macaulay. None of the claims against him ever stood up and most of the stories about meeting MJ were about how ridiculously amazing his house was. He knew better than anyone how it felt to be abused as a child.&&This is very odd. And opposite of what I would have thought. &&The older I get, the more people seem to be able to debunk the allegations of him being a predator. It's sad this man made a place that was meant to not only bring joy to kids, but also serve as some sort of catharsis for his own childhood. This really is sad.&&My god I got so sad and depressed when I read her wiki bio. Poor girl... &&I read an article about her, this is what stuck out for me.
Of all people in the cast of Wizard of Oz, the *Wicked Witch* was the only one who tried to help her. One day during a lunch, she noticed Judy Garland was the only one who wasn't eating and tried to give her food, only for someone to snatch it away and scolded her to not do it again. 

I often wonder why anyone wants to get into acting, but then I remember... *some of them didn't have a choice in the matter* &&Commonly called grooming&&Yeah.  It was sad.  What's sadder is that's too many home situations.  I'm not going to say these days because it's more talked about and now seen as a bad thing.  &&I'm a contributor as well. I got to speak to Alex about it at the 2017 Annie awards. He is such a HUGE Zappa nerd, and an incredibly nice guy.

There was an askreddit thread a couple of months ago, where people were asking what can you absolutely not stand. Of course one of the answers was the cash me outside girl, with everyone being completely unaware that they were collectively bullying *a 13 year old girl* who was being exploited by her mom and Dr Phil.&&Me too, no matter who you are your life never feels “easy” and the torment that celebrity brings with it is not something I have ever envied. People seem to imagine it as being “loved” or “adored” but it’s mostly like being stalked. Natalie Portman recently talked about the public’s reaction to her in The Professional, and she’s my age so I really felt for her having to grow up with that kind of attention while I was just doing school stuff.&&I thought she was Eleven.&&ITs all about that paycheck. Her agent negotiated it, nothing weird about it. She'll get a larger cut than just being an actor. The adults in the room jsut spin it as 'shes giving us a perspective adults dont have' or some other bullshit you come up with when someone tries to shove a child into adult business.&&tbf I see this as a good deal, a lot of child stars are fucked over money wise so she should be able to collect royalty money or whatever for decades to come.
&&Sometimes a 'Producer' is basically just an investor.&&Not much of a rumor, id say 99% of child actor parents do this

I don't know if it is just the accent, or how they carry themselves because of established culture, but it's really interesting.&&> It's going to be Millie or Finn, I guarantee it. It's awful to say but they're the ones getting the most attention so odds are high it'll be them. 

I feel like we're playing molestation bingo.&&Finn looks like he's going to end up okay if I'm being honest. I don't think he's going to shoot into the A-List the way Millie's agents clearly think she will. I think he'll have an Elijah Wood-esque career; doing Indie's and cult TV shows that makes him happy and occasionally coming out of the woodwork to play a supporting role in a major feature... I think Radcliffe went down a similar road after Harry Potter.

Millie is a real issue, imho. Even David Harbour came out and criticized how she & her parents were handling the fame. I mean, recently aren't TMZ obsessing over her relationship with some Vine star? No kid should be scrutinized like that. &&It's the kids *not* getting heaps of attention that are vulnerable. Predators target the weaker kids for a reason. &&Finn has a big brother to keep a close eye on him (besides his parents) &&What did she do?

Edit: I hate swipe keyboards (fixed a wrong word).&&What did she do to Ricky?&&She has gotten some very good storiws out of people, but it's always been REALLY obvious to me that her goal is to make people cry on camera so she can sell the drama.

Check out her interview with Stephen Colbert.  He deflects a lot of serious stuff with jokes, and she presses and presses about his family  (the death of his mother, if I recall) until he gets choked up. 

Even worse: Courtney Love.  She did an interview a little while after Kurt's death.  After asking about heroin use and the other personal but expected questions, Barbara straight up asks if she blames herself for her husband's suicide.  Then when Courtney says yes and starts to cry, Barbara turns out the fake sympathy and is like, ""Oh, no, Courtney...""  It really creeps me out. &&Barbara Walters seems like kind of a cunt, because she *is* a cunt.&&Marion Zimmer Bradley - Sci-fi author. She raped and molested her own kids.

Sadly, her case is more Jimmy Saville than Harvey Wienstein. &&Which women are you referring to?&&Give us names. I really didn't hear about this&&I too figured, maybe naively, that she was making an observation on what the repercussions of his accusations would be, rather than condemning him for speaking out.&&No sane person can disagree with this&&I personally know two different people who spent time with MJ at Neverland, one as a one off and the other in an ongoing close friendship. Both have only wonderful (if sometimes a little odd) stories about him. I’m not saying that is definitive proof that nothing occurred there, but it’s good enough for me to make a judgement call.&&Not many people read [this](https://floacist.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/gq-article-was-michael-jackson-framed/) at the time of the first allegations against him, unfortunately.

Everyone's argument is always, ""well, if he wasn't guilty, why did he pay off the victims family?""
HE didn't, his lawyers did. He didn't even know they agreed to the settlement until it was done,  because he was on tour. 
If they went to trial, that tour would've been cancelled, and therefore a lot of money would've been lost. Everyone just wanted Michael's money. Even those that were supposed to care about him.  He donated ALL of the profits of ENTIRE tours to help children. All he ever did was try to make people happy and help anyone he could, and we destroyed him for it. 


Fun fact: that father of Jackson's first ""victim"" committed suicide a few months after Michael died.&&[deleted]&&Didn’t the accuser and the dad admit it was just for cash ? &&Considering the sheer number of children that have spent considerable amount of time with Jackson and the amount of time that has passed, the fact that they're has not been one credible accusation is pretty compelling.&&Makes sense, MJ suffered similar abuse, he saw other child actors and didn't want them to suffer the same so did his best to offer help and advice.&&That sounds extremely consistent with what I've read from the other kids that spent time with MJ.

It's really shitty what happened to the guy. I remember being so upset with people for defending him ""just because they like his music"" or whatever. It's worth looking over again now that a lot has been de-sensationalized, especially if you think he was let off the hook because of his fame. No, he wasn't right in the head, but he didn't hurt kids. It just didn't happen.&&Yes that's the one! Thank-you!&&I think he just wanted to give kids the childhood he wasn't allowed to have but he was vilified for it. &&Poor Michael :(&&Same here man.

He has a stroke or aneurysm, and there's a 911 call where she wouldn't even touch him because his convulsing body grossed her out. I fucking hope he knows that some people understood his plight.

She's an amazing comeback story though.  &&She has a family and her own production company making films a while back. She seems to be doing ok.  The alternative is ongoing substance and mental problems until she dies young. Unfortunately that happens to a lot of child actors.&&Compared to Lindsay Lohan, at the same time frame Lindsay is still in the thick of it while Drew was starting to recover.&&She absolutely did that, too. Her mom was a real peice of shit.  There is a reason Drew got emancipated at 15, got away from her toxic mother and completely turned her life around. I can't imagine having a parent like that.&&It’s scenes like this that make me think Seth know a loooooot about what happens behind the scenes and really, really wants people to know it but is very afraid of something. &&> which is what she's been diagnosed with post breakdown

Has that been confirmed by any reliable sources? All I see are gossip rags and a denial by her lawyer.&&There’s an episode of Intervention about a young troubled girl who received a mid-diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Is your baby fine with antiquated heavy machinery?&&Can you inform me on the Bruno part? I'm not up to speed&&A lot of people site her father asking for 100k for an agency to sign her as soon as Stranger Things got big, but in my opinion you don't really need to do much speculating other than knowing the following things:

Watch her interviews. She is totally coached and trying to act like an adult. 
She is in the modelling industry and regularly is posing in photoshoots and wearing red carpet outfits that aren't necessarily revealing, but make her look much older than she is (going on 14).
While she was filming Stranger Things 2, she would wrap shooting on Fridays, and then fly overnight to Comic Cons (sometimes as far away as South America) and work all weekend signing autographs and posing for pictures. Her parents only eased up on her schedule once she was so physically exhausted she was unable to do one of these events and it made the news.

I know all this because I was a big Stranger Things fan for the past year but seeing the way they're managing her has basically caused me to lose a lot of enjoyment of the show. From what I've seen, the boys' parents are much more responsible although I think Hollywood + kids is dangerous no matter what.

Edit: Of course I'm rooting for her to turn out ok and hate to be so pessimistic, but I just feel like several things about her career so far could be potentially damaging. The way the ""celeb gossip"" outlets write about her is *very* weird imo. They talk about her, and recently her romantic life, as if she's an adult.&&Whew. That's a horrible hole to be thrown in as a child, but it's amazing to see the progress she's made climbing out of it. She just comes off as so *relieved*.&&She said that the cast of modern family saved her.  And that they are her family now.&&That could be true, but it was also the content of what she was talking about. I forget exactly what she was saying in the video I was watching but it was some philosophical talk, or a subject you wouldn't normally see a kid talking about. I feel like to be a good actor at that age you have to have an emotional intelligence that is above your physical age. &&All the HP kids turned out decent espeically Dan, Emma and Rupert considering the immense amount of paparazzi they had on them.

&&Yeah, this kind of discussion I see (on this site in particular) where people are prophesying and making speculations on which kid is gonna be fucked up makes me about as uncomfortable as the sexualization shit tbh.

 I guess it's hard NOT to do it given the current climate of the industry, but i just think it's kinda weird.&&It’s like a really sad Fantasy Football.&&What exactly did Harbour say? Kinda interested to hear about that. Do you have an article or tweet or something for reference &&I think Finn is gonna be fine. He and his older brother are both becoming semi-famous at the same time (Finn obviously being more famous), which I imagine makes it easier to reach out about shit. They have a youtube channel and they seem like super well-adjusted kids, if not a little weird.&&[deleted]&&I think the odds of Finn successfully  transitioning into adult roles are extremely slim. His face has distinctly female features which is wonderful for child actors but almost always ages into an awkward look. It's a common affliction faced by boy actors. &&Exactly right. And it makes me wonder how many of the background students in X-Men 2 were sexually abused. The director, Bryan Singer, was deeply involved in a convicted Hollywood pedophile ring called DEN, or Digital Entertainment Network, which was pitched as something between cable and YouTube before the internet had the infrastructure to support streaming video.&&Cory Haim and Cory Feldman weren't quiet kids in the background dude. Hollywood predators are a whole different breed&&> Finn has a big brother to keep a close eye on him (besides his parents)

That's not a guarantee of protection. Look at Larry Nassar, he was doing fucked up shit with the kid's parents in the room.&&The kind of predators that people are talking about here probably aren't going to be deterred by older siblings (although I'm not suggesting that I think he's been a victim)&&She basically [outed him on TV during an interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH6IpkZz2Cg)&&Holy shit, I did not know that. I just read up on it, thanks for posting this. That's horrible, but good to be informed about.&&[deleted]&&Holy shit, I read that book as a 13 year old (22 years ago), didn't know anything about the author and haven't ever gone back to any of her other books, so I never thought to look into her.

It's insane to think she was completely OK with abusing kids, and that I was the right age when I read the book to be ""of interest"" to her.&&Wow, this is crazy. Just put Mists of Avalon in my Amazon cart. Ugh. &&Female teachers have been reported weekly for years. But the kids they molested were ""lucky"", if the teacher happened to be hot.&&If so, I wish more people knew.&&I read a long thread like this in one of the main posts about Feldman coming out again and talking about everything and being like ""see this MeToo movement? This is what I've been saying happened to us all along. Except we were children""

And there was this whole thread where someone had said ""didn't he hang out with michael Jackson"" and people started talking about how MJ's dad had abused him, forced him to watch him have sex and had used his children to attract women and exposed them to all kinds of drugs

So when MJ grew up he had some developmental issues(deprived of a sane, happy childhood) and hated what stardom had done to him, and had seen the evil and corruption of ""grown ups"", so he made a super fun wonderland(called Neverland after the mythical place where kids don't grow up in Peter Pan). 

It was that thread that finally convinced me MJ had done nothing wrong, combined with finally hearing someone give all the evidence about families lying about their children being abused by MJ in orderr to get money

If you watch one of Dave Chapelle's new comedy shows on Netflix(WATCH them, they're fantastic) he talks a bit about this. It's a long joke but this is how it starts: Basically he's saying when these kids came to Michael Jackson's they were impressed. Michael Jackson wasn't trying to trap kids, he was showing off. He had a monkey, he had cotton candy machines and videogames and was trying to be the cool fun popular kid he hadn't been able to be because of his abuse at the hands of his father. So he was basically a little kid in the body of this man. Not literally as is the case with some mental illness but in a sense.&&That's pretty tragic. &&i go both ways on capt beefheart. its like 20 seconds of glory followed by a minute of strangeness. and back and forth. he reminds me a bit of sun city girls in that aspect. &&One of the very few perks of being a fat kid. &&Lmao dude go do an afternoons worth of looking around and you might not find proof but you will find that Hollywood stinks like shit. Isn't it strange that as actress after actess ""comes clean"" about being raped, the media seems to push all of these child stars also making claims to the periphery? Until all we are left with is MeToo and everyone feels we solved the problem and suddenly, we forget about Cory Haim warning us about pedos. Or Alex Winter...&&Do they show up in 30 minutes or something? What does Rachel Ray have to do with it? Am I missing something here?&&Like RZA said:

I saw one of his later movies, and he was by far the best actor in it - in fact he was the only person in the entire film that was truly natural and believable. I'm so sad that no one in Hollywood noticed his deep talent and tried to create serious projects tailored especially for him and his bona fide strengths. RIP GC.&&I started drinking and weed at 11, lsd and a little coke by 14, full on coconut by 19.    
The cops aren't always involved, hell even my mom didn't notice for years.  Some kids get pretty good at hiding that shit.   

My kids are getting to the age where I have to start telling them about the mistakes I made in the hopes that they don't make the same ones.  I buried way to many friends and only by sheer luck did I not get killed myself on several occasions.    

Shit's scary.  &&no doubt Drew is doing well now. But her experience has still drastically changed the trajectory of her life and has affected every thing she has experienced from then on. We say she is doing well, but that's relative to how she was. Making it out unscathed is absurdly generous thing to say considering more than 1/3 of her life (the only thing ANYone has) has been spent dealing with this shit that she didn't ask for.

Making it out unscathed means without suffering any injury, damage, or harm. That's not what happened.&&Talk too much and no one will want to work with you.&&Surely Mila Kunis has told him some shit&&Oh he knows a shit ton and makes the comments about it that people just take as jokes.

The Oscar nominations when he announced the best actresses and said ""Congratulations, now you don't have to pretend Harvey Weinstein is attractive""

Then the Family Guy episode with Stewie running through the mall screaming ""Help, I just escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!""

He's friends with lots of famous people and actually listened to what they had to say and knew they gained nothing by saying what happened to them.&&From a link someone provided above:

[""Feldman said last week there are six men in total that he suspects of pedophilia, including an “A-lister” who he fears might kill him.""](http://www.newsweek.com/who-alphy-hoffman-corey-feldman-reveals-name-third-alleged-child-abuser-710384)&&I think it’s more that anyone who actually pays attention knows. He’s just got a voice to say it out loud, which he did at an award show about HW a few years ago. 

I like the believe Seth is a good guy, even if I don’t dig his comedy all the time. &&I just saw one where Rob Schneider hires illegals at Home Depot to choke him in the shower. The next exposé??&&If he was afraid he wouldn't have made the jokes.

Simple fact is that he can't come out and make accusations on someone's behalf, especially if they aren't willing to say anything themselves.

It would be his word vs theirs and given he wasn't the victim..&&What episode is that, do you recall? &&How is there nothing on Schneider tho? I’d be SHOCKED if he didn’t rape anyone. I’d be very relieved too. &&With as much talk is thrown about him but no allegations so far it'd be weird if he ended up being over if the good ones who genuinely cared for his talent and never did anything wrong.

When the Spacey/Singer stuff started coming out, basically everyone in the gay community confirmed they had heard all of the stories about their parties and guys who were too young.

Not sure why the hate boner is so high for this movie. It's a movie about giant robots fighting interdimensional monsters. There's worse things in the world to hate.  NO FUN ALLOWED apparently.

No, it may not have the atmosphere or the aesthetic of the first film, but I don't see that as a reason to slam the film before anyone has seen it.&&What is Genji doing on that thing? &&So they replaced Guillermo del Toro with a random director whose never made a movie before... yeah I'm probably gonna pass on this one&&I thought this was Street Sharks for a second and got pumped.&&I’m super excited &&The monster's eyes look like the headlights of the Prius.

But I kind of wish they would have just hinted at the Kaiju's appearance and let our imagination do the rest.&&it does look like it belongs in the transformers franchise somehow. &&Pretty accurate &&What made the first one so good was that Guillermo Del Toro was directing it so with that came the awesome story and grittiness. 

I don't see Uprising being nearly as good as the first but I won't know that till I see it for myself but based on the trailer.. hoo boy I'm not sure.&&That’s an interesting way to describe a movie &&I honestly thought this movie had already come and gone. I had no idea it was still unreleased. &&I think the problem is people are going into this thinking it's a 'good' movie.

Nah. Tie the high horse up at the door and enjoy 2 hours of **giant mechs punching each other**&&I want so badly to like this movie though! I'm trying to stay cautiously optimistic despite what the trailers have been conveying. &&Try requesting it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TextlessPosters/&&https://i.imgur.com/nLN5x89.jpg Not mine, it's further up.&&Another comment offered it already. Check it out, looks good.&&Everyone is upset with this one because everyone  that made the first movie good is now no longer involved in the project on any significant level, and it shows, big-time.&&I am super on the fence with this movie.  I loved the first one, and from the trailers this one looks absolutely nothing like the first one.  Aside from the concept of giant robots.  I was surprised at first about how these movies look nothing alike until reading some comments that none of the crew from the 1st is being used for the sequel and now it’s kinda making sense.  I will still remain hopeful and I will still go see it, but I’m bracing for a let down.&&The trailer killed the hype for me. The choice of music, no old actors (though I like John Boyega), Eastwood junior (who has never been involved in a decent movie) and ,as someone pointed out, the robots are moving too fast which takes away the sense of them being HUGE. 

On the other hand, I absolutely hated Thor Ragnarok before it came out because trailer made it look like a rip off GotG. It turned out to be on of the best Marvel movies for me. I would very much love to be wrong about this one too. &&>Not sure why the hate boner is so high for this movie. It's a movie about giant robots fighting interdimensional monsters. There's worse things in the world to hate. NO FUN ALLOWED apparently.

Why is this take always trotted out for Pacific Rim, but never the Transformers franchise. And I say this as someone who hates the Transformers franchise, and also thinks Pacific Rim was bad and doesn't care at all for this one either.&&Because the color palette, apparently.

Also, do people really remember the first one? It was fun, but it really wasn't a great movie. Robot fights, sure. But everything else was meh. 

I know reddit has a huge boner for anything superhero and sci-fi action, but man, people really act like the first one was such an amazing movie that can't be lived up to.&&The funny thing is everyone hated on the first movie  when it was just a trailer. I can't tell you how many people thought the 2 pilots concept was stupid&&I don't like that they added a kid to it&&The fact this movie ignores how the first movie ended irks me something else. Can't look past it.&&Looks like Reinhardt and Pharah &&It’s Rein’s body, Genji’s head and Pharah’s arms &&Asking for heals probably&&Del Toro left the movie because he finally got the money rolling for Shape of Water. Of course things have changed with somethings with the movie but Del Toro was developing it for himself. It's just sad he can get money for Pac Rim 2 but has to scrape funding together of 19.5 million for a movie with now 12-13 oscar noms.&&I'm a big fan of del Toro, and really enjoyed the first Pacific Rim, visuals were gorgeous and I loved overall story (though it took me a few tries before I liked it - it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, I wish the script had been worked on a bit more, and I felt like the characters were a little flat/miscast). 

I'm gonna with-hold judgement until I see what people are saying *after* the film actually comes out, just to give the film a fair chance. 

But, yeah. I'm not optimistic and I won't be watching uprising in cinema. Pretty annoyed that they removed del Toro.&&You do realize he's also written and directed a ton of stuff dating all the way back to Buffy, and one of the most well written tv shows in Spartacus, and Daredevil, right? It's not like there haven't been directors who have written and directed their own movies without having ever really directed one. Do you think they just pulled this guy out of their asses? Lol&&We need Street Sharks vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right now.&&That’s what I was thinking. &&I fucking love Guyver! I used to rent the original anime and even the terrible movies at Blockbuster in the '90's. Fucking brutal.

Del toro left the project coz the same chinese consortium put the sequel ""on hold"". Djawadi was apparently never contacted for a repeat act. Just mismanagement from the top&&I think it's the underdog effect. If Pacific Rim had been a box office success, people wouldn't be as eager to praise it.&&If nothing else, it fills a niche. That alone ought to give it some very dedicated audience. It just so happened that lot of those people also visit reddit.&&The acting is comically bad, and nothing makes sense.  
  
The monsters have poison blood so they can't shoot them from afar with missiles, cause blood would get in the water. So they build giant avatars to punch them to death, but still always end up cutting or exploding them anyway. Suddenly the poison blood doesn't matter anymore.  

The whole ""drift"" thing is incredibly contrived.
 
And why would anyone still live in a coastal city when gargantuan sea monsters constantly attack? One attack is like five 9/11s. 
 
&&Made me think of MST3K. We need the movie to be an episode of MST3K tbh.&&They abandoned the poison blood thing like 5 minutes into the first movie. They should be using drones and missiles, but they're not even trying to make sense anymore.&&Do we?

Robots punching monsters is fun. You probably aren't alone but you're certainly in the minority.&&Sounds like your friend is a liar&&No kidding. 

That's pretty badass. &&I have mine framed in my theater next to my limited run Mondo TFA poster. The Pacific Rim poster has the more dignified frame.

It just feels cluttered to me, there's too much going on. I like this poster of the new movie a lot more, it just looks much more clean. Granted I have used Photoshop for around 3 years and I've always preferred a clean and neat style.&&I've only noticed it over the past couple of years.&&The IMAX poster for Attack of the Clones is better than the movie itself.&&I think they’re at least more stylistic than they used to be.&&Seems to be easier to complain about lack of movie attendance...&&From the gang called Mechas With Attitude!&&I can't believe we don't have one yet&&Don't let the dream die.&&I'd say closer to the best Evangelion Movie we'll ever get. &&Maybe it's because I literally just finished my 4th watching of the NGE series yesterday and rewatched Pacific Rim last week so it's all very fresh but they literally have nothing in common besides they fight giant otherworldly creatures (NGE can be easily argued it's not really otherworldly beings since they are children of Adam who was here before lilith).

Edit: Guys I'm not some professional anime expert just some random internet jackass with an opinion

Edit2 electric boogoloo: 
Here's a link with Del Toro himself denying the crap about NGE and PR1 being remotely related or inspired by

Not saying that /u/DemIce didn't do a great job, though ❤️

Edit: There's also /r/textlessposters, but again... a lot of compressed ones. &&https://www.moviemania.io/phone&&There were a few different kaiju in the first. What I really want is just more screen time for them. Last movie it only seemed like we saw each one for a couple seconds. I wanna absorb it&&Probably the giant fighting robots&&Because the robots and monsters don't look huge and heavy anymore. In the first one it took like 4 seconds for each hit to land but god damn it was a mass of metal smashing into the face of a monster it still had impact.

It looks like now they've made everything faster, like its all lighter. Like regular people fighting but just scaled up in size. Thats not what I want to see in this movie. Thats what they do in Transformers.

I want to see a huge robot slowishly lift up a fucking boat and smack it into the monster.&&It's basically Transformers minus jump cuts, shaky cam and slow motion. If you can ignore the story, this will be great. I mean... big metal thingies fighting each other... and you can actually see what's happening!&&Whenever someone mentions these three in one sentence: Transformers, power rangers, and the Cloverfield monster? 
They must be talking about Pacific Rim.&&I can actually tell all of the robots apart, so, no. Not Transformers. This is what Transformers wishes it could be. &&It’s so strange. The premise of Pacific Rim is so retarded and so much of it was straight cheese, but it just worked somehow. I’m so sad Del Toro isn’t directing this one and that coupled with the trailers has me doubtful this will have the same magic as the first one. &&> What made the first one so good was that Guillermo Del Toro was directing it so with that came the awesome story and grittiness

Personally, I thought what made the first one so good was the amount of screen time devoted to giant robots and kaiju. It felt like there was very little time wasted with none of those on screen.&&Grittiness? What was gritty about it? I mean the cities were dark I guess but the robots were all jumping g around and shit without a care in the world. &&Sweet. &&This is definitely the place to request for quality ones - mine needs manual TLC to fix a few areas (where the 'S' was is particularly meh).&& I love the first movie and I'm not upset that gdt isn't returning. Would I have liked to see him back? Absolutely. But it's not happening.  Even if this film isn't great it doesn't tarnish the first film.   There's no reason for the vitriole towards this movie.&&Does it really show though? I just went and watched the trailer and some parts make me skeptical but I think everyone is judging it was too early, it'll probably still be a good extension of the first film.&&It's not that they move too fast, it's that they are too light and move like people&&>I know reddit has a huge boner for anything superhero and sci-fi action, but man, people really act like the first one was such an amazing movie that can't be lived up to.

It's a superhero/sci-fi movie directed by the guy who's the odds-on favorite to win Best Picture and Best Director this year. It's fair to say living up to it would be a tall order.  &&As a fan of the first movie, I know it had some serious flaws and problems but what made me love it is the feel it gives.  Huge heavy ass robots fighting large aliens.  I'm not hating on the new one at all and It might be a really great movie but it just feels like a different movie from the first one I've watched. &&The thing that set the first one apart for me is that it sidestepped a lot of the formulaic action movie tropes - like the two leads were male and female and *didn't* bang at any point, all the characters had flaws that were believable and not just there to further the plot, there was real and effective worldbuilding - and of course the feel and soundtrack of the film were unique and memorable. Yeah there was a plothole or two, yeah Charlie Hunnam acts only slightly better than a cardboard cutout of himself, but at least it was different and you got to see a giant robot hit a giant monster with a ship. Which isn't usually my bag, but this movie *made* it something I enjoyed.

The trailers just don't give me a lot of confidence that the new one has any of the elements that made the original different.&&I think for me at least its cos it looked like it was straight ripping off Evangelion.

Enjoyed the movie in the end, though more so for the designs and action than half the characters.&&From one of the trailers, there's a reason for that. They aren't ignoring it, [someone on Earth ~~appears to be working *with* the kaiju~~ let the kaiju in.](#spoiler)

Edit: wording&&> Del Toro left the movie because he finally got the money rolling for Shape of Water.

he left because Legendary got bought by a Chinese company and put the project on hiatus with no start date. he already went through that crap with MGM and the Hobbit so he went with the film that was actually greenlit to be made.&&[deleted]&&TV is nowhere near the same thing as a 150 million dollar box office movie&&They should bring back that franchise.&&Didn’t the first one do really well in the box office if you look at the world wide instead of just the US?&&People love del toro and del toro loves people and when you watch the first movie you feel that.&&
>And why would anyone still live in a coastal city when gargantuan sea monsters constantly attack? One attack is like five 9/11s. 

So... 44.5/55?

&&you sound like the man to write the script&&Look at that. CONTRAST OF SCALE. It was mentioned a hundred times from the blu-ray extras, that Del Toro wanted normal sized objects to be next to the jaegers at all times, to show how gigantic they are. It’s even true in the original art poster.

This new one looks like he could be 5 stories tall instead of 100. How can they miss the most important detail? Arg.&&Look at this rich asshole. Has his own movie theater.

My friend must have been misinformed when we started watching it. &&Yeah, pretty sure the jaeger designs are all styled after military nautical and aeronautical vehicles. Like how Striker Eureka looks a little bit like a jet fighter in terms of its aesthetic.&&Interesting to know. I suppose the design and creation of the movies is dependent on what inspiration the individuals have. Who knows what they could have been thinking about. &&Whoops.  Darn inpainting stuff (which I used for the most part).  Fixed: https://i.imgur.com/AxYjoNd.jpg  
Edit: helps to link to the right image.&&I don't see it posted there yet, but that's an awesome resource :)&&Kaiju CGI time is *expensive*.&&The problem is weight.  Pacific Rim did a really good job making the robots *feel* like they were skyscraper sized, with deliberate and powerful movements.

Everything I've seen so far from Pacific Rim 2 seems to have a much lighter feel to it, like a video game.  I hope they pull it off but I'm worried.  I loved the original and I want this to be good.&&Nailed it. &&But you know what? That's all I want to see from a movie like this.

Don't give me some half-assed love story or entire scenes of Shia Labeouf and his parents arguing over his masturbation habits.

Nah, fuck that. What I want from a movie like this is scenic towering robot reveal porn and massive phallic machines and monsters smashing each other to pieces with intermittent bits of plot weaved in so it's technically a story.&&No, no. Just can't put my finger on it...&&Nah probably something else. Setting maybe?&&Probably misses his old glasses&&[deleted]&&John Boyega apparently complained about how slow the first Jaegers in the first one was. Which leads me to believe that he completely misunderstood what made the first movie good.&&As far as I can tell, no one is criticising the first film. They're just upset that GDT and Ramin Djiwadi, arguably the heart and soul of the first film, are not returning. Every promotional material just feels like a commercial for toys of the new robots instead of something being made for the pure spectacle. It feels like a commercial rather than a love letter to kaiju culture. That's what people don't like about the new one&&Pacific Rim 1 set itself apart from Transformers, Power Rangers, etc by virtue of its aesthetic and the portrayal of the jaegers themselves as giant, hulking, weighty machines.

Pacific Rim 2 feels like the new Power Rangers movie from the trailers. 

So the magic that made the first stand apart so much has been snuffed out for .. what, exactly? The vitriol isn't coming out of nowhere dude.&&you mean people shouldn't be upset when they see only burgers on the menu from the same restaurant that got them one of the best steakivess of their l? then later when they find out the management has changed the whole kitchen staff and entirely removed the steak station they should calmly go ""maybe the burgers are good"" when they really just wanted steak?    
i was impressed by the transformers floaty ""overly complicated"" aesthetic too...once. after pacific rim it was pretty clear where they cheap out. this movie is ALL about cheaping out.   
&&It's a continuation. There are certain expectations stemming from that. Such as being somewhat truthful to what made the first movie good. Not throwing most of it out of the window.&&I agree that they were better slow but in universe fast robots make sense. Striker Eureka was pretty quick and every machine in this film is at least one generation newer than that.&&Far too light. Fast as they are, what I noticed was the lack of sound (may have been removed for sake of soundtrack) from the thing actually moving. Even Striker Eureka had a lot of piston sounds when it moved, and plenty of crashing when it destroyed the pavement it was walking on in Sydney. 

It's like you can make a Model S as silent as you can, but you can't scrub out the road noise, because while the car is futuristic, everything else around it still conforms to reality.&&The whole aesthetic is very different, too. Everything is shiny and new, compared to everything being scratched up and worn in the original. Also things like their interfaces being all virtual and having holograms for everything as compared to the original where they were strapped into big clunky mechanical things that they physically moved. Just noting that that really changes the feeling of weight for me.&&I loved the first Pacific Rim, it was so much more than the big set piece monster movie I expected.  I am now watching NGE for the first time and holy shit did they straight rip off a lot of that (I know not all aspects are unique, and a lot are broader Mech-anime tropes, but some of the elements of PR are really close to NGE).&&>I think for me at least its cos it looked like it was straight ripping off Evangelion.

Lol. What? I'm hyper-critical of the marketing of PR2. It looks awful. But nothing about the film is ripping of Eva...? &&Oscars are literally a marketing gimmick nowadays. If anyone besides the people that fund movies care about them, I feel bad for them.&&Honestly, these days it's not as different as you might think (Spartacus was not a cheap show). 

He's certainly more qualified than half those young directors from youtube getting the same amount of cash to make big features - and i don't see anybody complaining about them.&&Asia loved the hell out of that movie. It did mediocre in the US. I liked it cause it was straight up cheese with giant robots and monsters. That was fun. &&That's really sad. 

It's beginning to look like this new movie is pretty watered down compared to the delicate creation of Del Toro. &&5 stories? He could be 5ft, fighting a dog in an alien suit.&&Shit man, he could be a dude in robot armor for all we know, looking at this poster.&&[deleted]&&Happy cake day&&Happy cake day. 

Also, I’m imagining a theatre room with a tv screen like Michael Scott’s when he first got his new condo so I’m not at all impressed. &&Pretty sure it's just a TV set up in his extra small bedroom &&It's a study with a relatively big TV, two recliners, and a surround sound system. It's awesome, but it's just a thing I've been working for over the years with piecemeal things here and there.&&What?  Did he give you a Septim?&&Fair game, if I seemed aggressive I apologise, I didn't mean to.

My favourite set of IMAX posters are the *The Force Awakens* ones, wish the *The Last Jedi* IMAX poster was as good.&&That is... beautiful&&You are extremely lucky. That is a really rare poster. I’d love to add it to my collection.&&I'm not a rapper.&&Mmmm, kaiju say

Wha-wha-wha-wha-what  Kai JU say?



&&Kaiju has wares...&&If they have the Evangelion units (like in the book) I’m going to lose my mind right there in the theater&&If it goes according to the book, it should be with IIRC.&&The fact that I'm a casual anime viewer who had a near-weeb phase in my youth and I have no idea what that is probably explains that.&&Gundam Thunderbolt or 08th MS Team could work well. Make it look like battlestar galactica.&&Maybe you should rewatch both your loose description is pretty broad and acts like they have more in common then they do. &&>weird psychological shit

In Pacific Rim? The concept and execution of the Drift is completely different from NGE's stuff with Instrumentality, AT fields, and the general theme of pushing other people away that NGE had.&&You linked the original.&&But it’s GLORIOUS!&&It went from Gundams fighting monsters to EVAs fighting monsters&&I rewatched the trailers for the original and now for this one and holy shit you're absolutely right. The original robots looked like they weighed a billion pounds. Every step seemed labored. Every punch looked like it had the force of an asteroid. Now it looks like they are made of Styrofoam and suspended by wires floating all over the place.&&Good god look at that scene in the trailer where it flashes to them all powering up and coming together, looks like a fucking cheesy cheap Power Rangers/TF spoof.... nothing like the 1st. I mean look at how dark and gritty even the 1st movies trailers looked and the film replicated that feel. 

All the trailers for PR2 just keep making it look more and more awful.... ugh. But they did say thats what they wanted, that anime feel, and personally I could give two shits less about anime and no clue why they'd want to drastically change it so much from the 1st to that..... give me PR2 in all its dark and gritty form and an R rating, not some cheeseball looking film where the Jaegers are moving like they just snorted coke and did speed. 

And jeeze, who the fuck chose the awful score mix up for the trailers, shit is awful to listen to lol. They got rid of the guy that handle scores for GoT etc for whatever dingbat now, that song made me want to stick a knife in my ears &&Notable that del toro isn’t directing this one &&i think its gonna be a mess&&Way to say what I said just now but you clearly said it like an hour before me. But.... same. &&From the available trailers, though, it doesn't seem like they've made them THAT much more weightless.

More nimble and agile, sure, but is it not believable that some technological advancements would be made in a universe set an entire generation after the first installment?

From what I've seen, the movie seems to subscribe to a reasonable amount of power scaling.&&I don't think they pass a screenplay in Hollywood unless it's got at least 2 boring b-plots no one cares about, and some kind of love quarrel with the main character(s).

That way, they can sell movies, *without even making movies*. It's genius, really.&&Might as well just look at videogame cutscenes on YouTube then.&&God I hate this sentiment.

So you're saying you don't care at all, that you fundamentally misunderstand everything that makes a movie ""good"" as long as it's shiny and big?

As though you honestly enjoy [Atlantic Rim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVpQmZmKNmo) as much as PR?

No, of course you don't, for the same reason Transformers 4 is horrific compared to the original. But why? It has big robots fighting, isn't that what we want?

No, there has to be a baseline level of competence and structure in addition to visual spectacle, which should also be done well. It's the same reason you don't compare a nice sandwich to the cold, white-bread ham & cheese soaking in its own juice on the gas station shelf.

There comes a point where the story and structure suffers to much, and the visual aspects fall so flat, that it no longer has the excuse of ""palatable action."" 

We'll all enjoy an easy, fast food burger - we don't want 5-star steak daily - but no one wants to eat road kill.

And if you're chowing down on a dead cat in the gutter insisting ""it's just junk, can't you enjoy it once in a while!"" then I don't know what to tell you.&&well said&&I mean... There was in the last movie too&&Wtf John Boyega&&Djiwadi isn't coming back either?......man :/&&That's exactly right. Those jaegers were our ""own"" mosters, big, slow, brutal fighting machines that punched Kaijus right in the face. Only negative was that ridiculous Australian accent. Five years later I still have a man crush on the marshall.&&I guess its true, I looked at both trailers and the new jaegers move about as fast as striker eureka did. That scrap jaeger the girl made looks really stupid and it moves way to fast.&&My main takeaway from the trailer at least was the giant hologram map and the command center setup. Though the Japanese girl (sorry I forgot some of the names the names, its been a while) feels a lot like Rei and the final part in the alien dimension feels VERY Eva/Gurren Lagann.&&Here's the thing though, NGE rips off a lot from older mecha, especially Gundam, Space Ideon and Mazinger with some Devilman in it. Even the whole Eva is a beast based on something alien and ancient comes straight out of Ideon and Mazinger (which was a favorite to GDT)&&You know GDT did not watch NGE before making PR, right?&&PR1 not 2.&& Thank you!

Evangelion does have faster robots that move unnaturally for their size [...because they aren't actually robots...the robots move supernaturally fast because they ARE supernatural and all of the weirdness is intentional,](#spoiler)  but even then the EVAs show their weight and size when they smash into things or when they get knocked down.

The Pac Rim 2 trailers haven't really shown enough yet to make me feel like they were able to get that weight down.  &&Not sure how's that bad considering all 26 episodes of Eva and the movie outclasses like 90% of the Gundam franchise.&&The Jaegers are way too big, and don't do nearly enough flying around dodging shit, to compare to Gundams in my opinion.

I wouldn't exactly call the mobile suits in Gundam 00 weighty. Or some of the mobile suits in Gundam IBO for that matter.&&Other way around, Gundams are fast and mobile.&&I am a fan of anime and this is not what I wanted from PR2. Please don't blame this on us we weren't asking for it.

Basically I can be happy with a competent story with amazing visuals and sound.

Just don't let the story detract.&&Is this a copy pasta?&&wtf i hate John boyega now&&Noooooooooooo

Even if the movie sucked, I was looking forward to that soundtrack. I still listen to the first one regularly.&&Also picture this. We didn't really get to see how fast Striker Eureka actually is since its always waist deep in water, save for a split second when its on land. Also the Scrap Jaeger is tiny, like the size of the other Jaeger's feet. &&Yeah, I acknowledged that, which is why I mentioned ""mecha-anime tropes"".  But, at least in the west, NGE is probably the most popular mech anime among anime fans (although Gundam is probably more well known among people who don't watch anime.

He just couldn't figure out how to do it faithfully without making it creepy.  He knew the press would accuse him of making a film that promoted child exploitation.

He was smart not to make it.  There's just no way to do Eva live action without it being extremely creepy in that respect.

MSG had fuckin Char prancing around with hilariously bad animation.  Some of it was heavy but lets not forget Amuro going full Lu Bu against Conscon.

Just watch Votoms if you want an actual real robot show.&&This is so strange to read because I liked the first PR so much specifically because it **wasn't** like anime from the way the mechs were designed and the film was... well, filmed. Anime mechs have a tendency to be lightweight and fast, as conveying weight is very difficult, especially in animation. Meanwhile PR went for the most realistic yet entertainingly hammy experience. &&Haha no not blaming you guys, I mean the director, studio etc, they said they wanted to go this route/feel for the movie..... for god knows what fucking reason lol. &&Del Toro never saw Evangelion. &&It’s not even out yet lmao &&Did he abandon it though? From what I understand they studio wouldn't let him do/film what he wanted with his story and that's why he's basically not a part of it except for producer in which he said he was a hands off producer and not involved, and that he had other stuff going on and didn't have time for the time frame studio wanted, hence bringing in a whole new group for thr film. 

Whats odd is DeKnight is the director, and Daredevil show was brutal and dark and gritty..... you'd have thunk he would have carried that over to PR2 &&[deleted]&&If only they re did the whole halo franchise like the halo 2 anniversary cut scenes &&It should be.&&I made the theme my alarm music for like a year after the movie came out, because who doesn't want to wake up to that? Start the day out **pumped**.&&No I'm pretty sure that scene with eureka on land was about as fast as it gets. Also why would a jaeger made out of scrap and old parts be faster and more agile than the big jaegers made with government money?&&Yeah, I saw that, should have mentioned that in my post as well. I guess the only thing I see that's similar to NGE is the Stacker/Mako and Gendo/Rei relationships. But I grew up with old mecha anime so maybe that's all I see.

With Gundam, it's a little bit hard. The old stuff is good if you're a big fan already. Some stuff from the 80s/90s is a hit and miss. It mostly tries to be too deep but you can tell they are out of their elements sometimes.

You should try Iron Blooded Orphans. That's the newer series that finished airing last year and it's on Hulu. It was definitely a breath of fresh air and it really goes for deeper themes that work and make it stand out from other series.&&> Regardless, the influence of mecha-animes in general is undeniable

I don't think it was ever attempted to be denied

Do you have the source for this? Because it seems...questionable.&&that clip actually kind of proves my point.  Yeah, the Evas themselves are moving crazy fast for something that big, but the show isn't hiding how big they are.  Every step is shattering the ground and doing tons of damage to the city around them.  It's strange and unnatural for something that big to move like that, but the show makes it pretty clear that the Evas themselves are strange and unnatural.

Compare the EVA movement to that episode that has the nuclear powered robot... the robot is clunky in a way that the Evas are not.&&I’ve seen the running clips several times (and the whole show once) and it’s still one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen.

Because scrape Jaeger probably used last gen tech but was also super tiny, small enough it only needs one pilot, moving all the mass is a big factor in speed. 

edit: Yep the scrap jaeger was built from destroyed jaegers, so technically it does use their tech. &&Maybe because it's smaller.&&For real though, I have noticed people apologising often recently for things like tone, humanity is shining through! 

(apologies for my meming, have a nice day) :)&&Tell that to anime&&These are more Robots vs Monsters, which is pretty different than Robots vs Robots.

In the RvM style, in my opinion, it’s important to show a kind of vast difference between the mechs and the creatures. Everything is supposed to be larger than life, characters being pushed into buildings, various different creature designs with different defense mechanisms (flying, acid, shell, fire)

RvR is similar but because they’re both mechs it’s more about style, evading, sometimes martial arts.

I just think when you have a mech v monster feature, the two should feel different, which I really enjoyed about Pacific Rim, it was like Godzilla creatures versus Big O. Heavy, purposeful moving mechs, and various more organically moving creatures.&&Yeah that or an Armored Core game.&&[Mechwarrior 5](https://mw5mercs.com/) is actually coming out in the near future.

It made you realize there was a brutal war going on and there are grunts on the front line and not just super pilots fighting other super pilots in one of a kind Gundams.&&Didn't know Bernie fought in the Delaz Conflict&&None of that scene is really the kind of mecha weight i'm referring to. &&>The faster more lightweight mechs tend to fall under the ""Super Robot"" genre while slow and weighty is usually under the ""Real Robot"" genre.

What anime harbors the ""real robot"" genre? Because Gundam, to my knowledge, was oriented around flying/space battles? &&Damn, i had to re-read that first part of your comment three times.&&The movie was awful, but the TV show blew it away. All those marvel/DC TV shows have a bit of cheese factor to them especially Netflix variants, but DD was very dark and gritty, and far more violent than the movie, made the movie look like a G rated version. It was the grittiest of all those TV shows in that Marvel/DC universe. 

When I say cheesy with PR2 it's the cheap looking CGI in the trailers, and even the actions scenes especially them coming together in that one scene screams Power Rangers from 20 years ago lol. Even the trailer music score sucks ballz, they got rid of the guy that handled scores for GoT for whatever dingbat came up with that shit trailer score. 
&&Yeah, they always came across as more like a brother and sister to me. No kissing or anything. &&Still, not really.

The Robots vs Robots is more common on the real robot genre. Because in that, the robots are more of a natural evolution to tanks, and are mass produced.

In fact. One of the key tropes of the Super Robot genre is that it's the only one of it's kind, created by a genious our spawned from pretty much nowhere, to fight an alien menace. That can be monsters or aliens with their own mechs. But it's more likely to be against monsters than the Real Robots, that are heavy like you are saying.&&THEY'RE BRINGING IT BACK BABY LET'S GO FROM&&Wish From would take what it's learned from Souls and make an ""Armored Souls"" game&&Wait, where is there implied statutory rape?

The Evas are weird because they move light and fast, which is exactly what I was criticising PR  Jaegers for doing.  In this case though it's ok because the show goes out of its way to emphasize how big they are AND how weird it is that they can move so gracefully&&When they're in space yes. Several of the Gundam shows have done a good job of showing the Gundams to be fairly slow while on earth. I know both the original and Wing for instance shows the mobile suits as maneuvering slowly when walking around (only the Gundams move fast when using their thrusters). While they probably still move faster than they would in real life, they aren't doing spinning kicks or cartwheels or anything like that. &&They are neuro linked for God sake and know everything about each other's life and mental state.

How Denis Villeneuve Created the Most Complicated Sex Scene of All Time - Blade Runner 2049,26919,7yf7wq,http://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/02/15/blade-runner-2049-how-denis-villenueve-created-the-most-complicated-sex-scene-of-all-time,1344,1518970824.0,,"“It was also, according to Villeneuve, probably the most complicated sex scene ever filmed, with work taking place over a full year from initial choreography to completion.”

So yeah uh Ryan we’ve got a very complicated love scene we have to shoot for a year. Oh with two women. Here’s a million bucks by the way.&&I liked it, even though I was immediately reminded of Her. What was so admirable about it was how the sync wasn’t perfect. It would’ve been so easy if they’d just made the sync perfect and had Ryan Gosling interacting with Ana de Armas. That would’ve been the simple and lazy way to go about it. I’m glad Villaneuve went for the complicated and visually interesting approach &&That scene was both weird and impressive all at once. 

I was thinking, *”What the fuck am I watching?”* and, *”This is pretty cool”* at the same time. 

Tis the Denis Villenueve effect. &&I’m pretty sure Tommy Wiseau created the most complicated sex scene of all time&&I don’t know, some of those Sense8 orgies seemed like a pain in the ass to shoot.  &&That writer doesn't watch enough movies...

https://gfycat.com/NeatCapitalArcherfish

NSFW&&That scene was a technical, visual, and philosophical work of art.  
The first time I saw it I had two thoughts, ""how did they do this?,"" and ""Story wise, there isn't a single 'human' in this scene, they are all synthetics.""  
Just think about it, a digital synthetic¹ knew it's physical synthetic² owner fancied another physical synthetic³, so she¹ set up a playdate, so synth² could fuck synth³ while she projected herself¹ over the physical synth³.   

Three Wallace 'products,' paying and playing with each other. All *playing* human. God that movie is a masterpiece. &&Pretendin as if that gian orgy in Purfume wasn’t just as impressive&&That scene was amazing&&Wait, that was a sex scene?&&Nothing compared to Japanese porn.&&I did like this scene, and the similar scene from Her, but I'd also like throw in the sex scene from Anomalisa. Not only is it extraordinarily realistic, uncomfortable, and revealing about the two characters, but it is also somehow accomplished this by being done with stop motion puppets.&&Had the surrogate scene in Her not have come before hand, I would agree&&THIS is the most complicated sex scene of all time. 

https://youtu.be/bL1vajUJybI&&With all due respect to the article writer and Denis Villeneuve, [this scene from Reanimator](https://www.xvideos.com/video768292/barbara_crampton_in_re-animator?pl=11769905&plname=my_favorite) is a more complicated sex scene, for sure. 

**WARNING NSFW, XVIDEOS LINK**&&Look, I love it too, but most complicated ever is a little much, no? &&Strange, I don't remember DADV in BR 2049...&&So the house bot got the sex bot in order to fuck the bot that kills other bots?&&I think it's a close second to the bit in MacGruber where he's having sex with the ghost. &&Correction, this is the most complicated sex scene of all time.

Edit: or even The Shape of Water. They were fucking jazzercizing in the water and having osmosis-gasms &&Lets not put ign onto the front page people.&&We're reaching circlejerk levels that shouldn't even be possible&&>THE MOST COMPLEX SCENE OF ALL TIME

I liked the movie a lot, and that scene, but...lol @ that headline. 

I'd say Anomalisa had a far more difficult time, and they did not hold back at all. Complete stop motion puppeteer work from start to finish, and somehow managed to feel uncomfortable and incredibly realistic. &&[deleted]&&Nonsense! The creator of the most complicated sex scene was me back when I was seventeen! Have you ever tried to undo those weird hooks on a bra!? It's like there was a damn Rubik's cube back there!&&I really liked this scene (reminded me of Her but still thought it was a nice evolution of the idea). The movie still has some old fashioned tropes. The fact that the replicant and Joi are mean or competitive with each other the next day seemed to ring a little false. &&I am bothered that making-of featurettes such as this are not included on the BluRay releases. Some years ago you had all this on there. :/&&I too liked *movie mentioned in article* for *reasons stated by others* I can't wait for their next work let's hope its in *trending show or comic* next, that'd be so cool. &&All I know after watching that scene is that we better have top people working on a Mackenzie Davis combined with Ana de Armas clone.&&I would argue Sense8 on Netflix has the gold medal for most complicated sex scene. &&It's a little late to be pulling out the marketing big guns for this movie, isn't it?&&Honestly not that complicated. Keep the camera angles in the same exact position. Record the parts of Gosling and the chicks separately. Súper impose them while lowering transparency somewhat.

Also, I guess kissing = sex now.&&All time? 
Simply put: 
OVERRATED &&.... Of all time 😂😂😂😂😂&&gonna go a completely different direction to everyone else and say that as an average moviegoer, this scene was incredibly pointless and seemed just to be there for some sort of critical acclaim&&Who did you guys think the amalgam of Ana de Armas and Mackenzie Davis looked like?&&great movie, but that scene was just painful to sit through. All the scenes with hologram T&A were pretty awful. &&""most complicated sex scene of all time""

well the bar was pretty low, wasn't it?&&[deleted]&&I'm all for some more Blade Runner 2049 circlejerking but this scene has been discussed so much in this sub. We needa move on.&&Seriously. Just look up **the bronze**. Best most complicated funniest sex scene ever. Team america levels of complicated.&&I love that despite the technological advances of the time, they were smart enough to show the imperfections. Which in my mind, made it perfect. && That two-and-a-halfsome was awesome. &&Must be forgetting the sex helmets from Demolition Man. &&[deleted]&&The funniest thing is that there is zero sex whatsoever in the scene.  &&Yes! I hate how perfectly everything works in futuristic movies.  I'm sure certain tech becomes fairly perfect but everything has it's problems and I love seeing something so awesome and futuristic looking having problems.&&I'm so glad they have both carved out their own spot in this weird little niche. I love both scenes for how different they are and how positive they are, about a scenario that a lazier or less original sci-fi movie would turn into a pessimistic scene.&&> I liked it, even though I was immediately reminded of Her.

Same. It kind of took away from the scene, which is a shame. In a vacuum the Blade Runner scene is incredible, but because of how similar the scene was in Her I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd already seen it done before. 

Instead of finding it as mind-blowing as it could have been I was left with ""oh that's cool"".

&&I found it very touching in a sad way. Like most of the film I guess.&&It was a cool scene.

But I was thinking ‘this is not what this guy needs right now.’ He was smack in the middle of an existential crisis and was returning home after a long day to mull things over and then his hologram gf decides to buy a hooker?! Lol! 

That having been said, I prob would have smashed too. &&I was most impressed by the implication that his hologram wife purchased a hooker without him knowing. How did she get in contact with said hooker? How did she pay her? Did she use K's money to pay the hooker?

Such a mesmerizing film.&&Does it count as a deep fake?&&I thought it was so beautiful. Like the ai doing so much for him to be together was truly making me think ""what makes a human a human"". Of course later on we see she's just programmed like that &&I decided that I would never again watch a film with my dad and my friend's dad without checking *why* it was rated R.&&""what the fuck is going on.

In all seriousness, it really was a great scene but the emotional factor was orders of magnitude more significant than the technical one. At least for me.&&Great movie overall&&Calling it ""The most complicated kissing scene ever"" wouldn't get as many clicks.&&Right?

Give it time to catch up&&I feel like Patrick Swayze dancing with Whoopi Goldberg really paved the way though&&The two scenes are similar in concept - an AI using another person to embody themselves physically, but that's about where the similarities end. 

The article is about how the scene was filmed - having the two actresses super imposed over each other and how they were able to do that. The complications are in how the scene was filmed, not in the concept being filmed. *Her* didn't have to tackle that at all as only one actress is on screen. &&[Ah, so Joaquin Phoenix fucks a phone in Her!](https://vimeo.com/68417359)&&That was definitely on my mind when watching it in theatres. Conceptually the scenes are pretty similar (but then again, normal sex scenes are dime a dozen, so, not much worth complaining that two sci-fi films overlap in this one respect)&&The first scene where they're having ""sex"" and it just cuts to black is better imo. Very innovative way to make something that could have been goofy very touching, almost &&But it's still a much more technically impressive scene, it may have the same themes as her but the way the scene is shot was obviously much more complex.&&god damn, thank you for reminding me of this. Whenever I mention this movie I bring up the cat scene but I forgot about *this* masterpiece.&&How is that scene in any way complicated?

They didn't even need sfx for it.&&*OF ALL TIME*&&Well, it took a year to complete and the scene is only a few minutes long. It's certainly fairly complicated. Anytime someone uses an absolute (*most* complicated) people are going to object, but it is very complicated. &&There’s only one actress during the sex scene in Her, though.&&Why not?&&I'm honestly ok with it in this case. BR2049 was a movie made for its fans. They could have easily thrown in a bunch of explosions and one-liners to bring in the general audience but they decided to let everyone do their thing, which is kind of rare these days.&&Wow, your comment is the most redditish of all time!&&I don't think the article is that bad, but some of these comments are that extra step forward making me embarassed&&r/movies is now r/bladerunner2049&&I wouldn't say most complex of all time, but certainly one of the more complex scenes I've seen in awhile. The dichotomy between emotion and sex represented through his connection with Joi and the sex with the hooker absolutely should spark some critical analyses on the feminist undercurrents that that (I personally think) this scene is full of. Interesting stuff !!!&&I agree, it was cool. But I doubt it was that complicated to pull off, even easier because they WANTED visible error. So the actors didn't even need to have the exact same motions.&&Helped setup the emotional pain of losing Joi and a stronger connection for later scenes with the hooker. &&I don't think it was pointless at all. Aside from being visually striking, it made many contributions to the overall story. It showed us Joi had much more agency than was previously implied, acting outside of Joi's knowledge to hire the hooker. It also implied that Joi legitimately cared for K. She really wanted to be enough for him, and to be 'real' for him. It also played well with the pervasive existential themes. It raises questions like 'Can Joi be considered sentient?', 'Does having a physical body make Joi more real?', etc.&&I know people who saw it and didn't realize it was a follow up&&Pfft I could have finished in one minute&&Maybe they were all procrastinating.&&You have seen Brazil, right?&&“Fuck! Even in the future nothing works!”&&Exactly why I liked it. Took me a few seconds to realize they weren't going to sync perfectly, but when I did I was like ""yeah that makes sense"", given the ""tech level"" of other things in the movie.

Might they eventually perfect the predictive heuristics and sensors or whatever and make the syncing near-perfect? Sure. But not likely in this near-future dystopia, and would having this imperfect feature in the meantime keep people from using it at all? Not a chance.&&Wait the one in Her ends up with everyone crying, what do you mean positive?&&Just positive? You didn't find that scene in Blade Runner to be emotionally complex and uncanny?&&I haven't seen Her, and I found the scene amazing. Not just because of the acting, but because so many ""future"" ideas are recycled across sci-fi, and this one felt genuinely new.&&Yeah I choked up at that scene. &&I really liked the parts where Ryan Gosling is staring silently into something. They should've made those longer.&&Like how they find the child and you just have to assume the child is going to be caught/killed within 24 hours of the film's ending?&&Like alone time with uncle Chester?&&Well it was more like he could be intimate with his hologram girlfriend for the first time, and in that light it could be a much needed respite in a difficult time. The hooker was just a necessary medium, hidden behind the holographic appearance.&&A threesome w/Mackenzie Davis and Ana de Armas? Deep Philosophical questions can wait. Goddamn being Ryan Gosling must be awesome.&&It definitely seemed like something that only introduced *more* problems, not to mention that it was extremely inappropriate for a virtual girlfriend to arrange on her own.&&Well she and the hooker 'met' in the past, the hooker even comments K's taste in women when the hologram plays the little music tone in K's pocket. So it stands to reason that the ai used the contact the hooker gave to reach out. As for payment it was probably K's money unless the hooker did it free of charge to plant the tracker. 

Edit: A lot of people are saying the AI is just a item and while that's true (depending on your interpretation) it's an item snooping on K through most of the film. The same way Google knows which stores you've been to today the AI knows where K is and what he's saying and hearing at almost all times. &&How did she get in contact with the hooker? That's a great question, I'll email an escort from backpage.com and ask them how it's possible for their customers to contact them from home. But we may never know the answer.&&This implies two possibilities: one, prostotution is legal, and K's tailor made Joi simply satisfies her master using all the tools available to her, like a good computer; or two, prostitution is illegal, and Joi overrode her programming to cater to K's needs as only she saw how, proving she is more than simply a program.

If the second possibility is true - that she truly is a freethinking sentient person, then when K stares in anguish at the holo-Joi towards the end, he's not accepting Joi's false promise of true love - he's realising his Joi *was* special, and whether by nature or design she had fallen in love with him and even died because she wanted to stay close to him.

And if that's the case - then K's self sacrifice is even more powerful. Joi showed him what true humanity was, and emulated what she did, by putting himself in harm's way so that two people father and daughter could be together.

Back to the strange three way - its aftermath. Note Joi's cold demeanour towards the prostitute. Out of K's earshot. ""You can go now."" Joi is jealous. Jealousy again implies personhood.

TL;DR: Joi arranged the threesome likely because she is fully sentient, ""human""&&Siri and Apple Pay in 31 years is going to be awesome. &&Obviously she communicated with her through a blockchain and payed her in cryptocurrencies.&&Smart contracts.&&>How did she get in contact with said hooker? How did she pay her? Did she use K's money to pay the hooker?



I think a company that is making virtual gf/wife for emotional needs would have thought of all that too. K's virtua GF didn't do anything special for him, it's all it's standard programming. It's probably very common in movie universe then we think.





  Also pretty much fits with K's theme of everything about him being normal.&&I haven’t seen the movie yet, but that sounds like the almost sex scene they had in Her. No holograms, but Samantha (the ai) basically got another woman to have sex with her boyfriend while she fed her lines. She was hoping he could pretend the woman was actually her so they could have a “physical” relationship, but needless to say it didn’t work out well.&&You’re under the assumption she was an actual hooker, which we don’t even know for sure that she was. &&Iota&&m2m purchases . iota buy now.&&It counts enough that reddit would ban the majority of my subreddits &&That's what made the k's entire anti climactic realization all the more powerful. not only the new epiphany he experienced turned out to be a lie but his only source of comfort and affection turned out to be one as well. these are all things he logically knew were fake but in the end there's a difference between knowing and understanding something.&&See I didn't take it that way. Well not exactly. Yes Joi was programmed to care for her owner. But does that make it less genuine? After all human couplings at some level are just two beings following their biological imperatives. The question then becomes is Joi sentient? Is she making these decisions on her own? Or is she following some script? I don't think the movie answers this. I think it leaves it intentionally ambiguous. But we shouldn't write off that she might be because then we'd have to question K's sentience. If we accept that replicants can be sentient we must accept that other sentient machines are also possible. 

I took the scene more as a bittersweet reminder to K that his one source of companionship and solace had been taken from him too. A moment of remembrance and longing that is at once very human but also very alien. This being experienced by a being who is at once human but also very alien.&&What I kept thinking was how humans looked down on replicants for not having a soul and replicants looked down on AIs for not having a body. A sad, existential pecking order. &&[deleted]&&It was pretty innocuous though. &&My friends and I would rent crappy horror movies in highschool, then come over to my place to watch them. We didn't research them, but went off the cover art, description on the box, and title.

We picked [one movie up in particular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Spit_on_Your_Grave) because it looked like your normal crappy horror movie. 

... it wasn't. We researched our movies after that one.&&That reminds me of when I first saw(or started to watch) Zardoz.

Sure, there were some missteps along the way, but it is better to go out swinging than trying to bunt your way on base.  &&Apparently xhamster were on about picking the show up for a 3rd series, but I don't know if anything else has been said apart from their interest being declared. &&I love the orgy scenes lol. I think it does a good job of depicting how this is something that is occurring through a mental/emotional link between them all. And they're kind of beautifully shot.

I like that instead of being individual sex acts, its just a *roving mass* of sex. And I particularly like the depiction of sexuality between the cluster as just like... all-inclusive. Considering that you could liken ""sex"" between the cluster to masturbation, it makes sense that there aren't any lines of like ""oh well these characters can't interact because it contradicts their sexuality"". Nope, just everybody going at it willy-nilly. &&>Some of the orgy scenes

You mean there are more than one?!&&I agree that that caught me off guard, but damn do their powers really come together by the end of the season. And not in a sexual way, but a badass action-y way.

Okay, sexually too, but you get the point.&&Nothing could prepare you for the later sene where you watch 8 babies being delivered.&&Was that in the first episode or the Christmas special? Either way I didn't mind it at all.&&It's just a goopy dildo - seen one, seen em all.&&Brb going to watch sense8&&That surprised me but definitely sold me on the show that they included that insert shot&&Wait there are dildos in a Netflix show? And I haven't watched it yet? 

Sign me up!&&They're all connected, so if one is having sex, it arouses the other 7, and then all of a sudden it's an orgy. An inner brain orgy. &&Kinda complicated to explain...

The show centers around 8 folks from around the world that are mentally linked.  That can talk to each other, feel each others’ emotions, and even control the bodies of their linked compadres.  In the sense of the orgies, it involves one of the linked people getting it on and all of the other people “tuning in” to experience it simultaneously.  It is represented visually by all 8 connected people intertwined in a big undulating mass. 

It makes for pretty neat visuals, but I gotta imagine those were really weird days on set for the cast.  &&Why not? &&This is really the only possible reaction to something like that.&&Say thank you, you ungrateful swine!&&my penis is strangely aroused &&5 MORE MINUTES OF THIS AND I'M GONNA GET MAD &&I wish this was the creature in the Shape of Water.&&""it's definitely interesting""&&[deleted]&&Movie is called The Untamed, released 2016.

You're the fucking weirdo. &&Only some of them can, apparently.&&That's problematic to define. At no point is it explained what a Replicant really is. Yeah, they're not machines in an android sense, they're 100% biological. They're also indistinguishable from humans to such an extent that you need a complicated psychological test to identify them.

But, the same time, they're *made*. They're built. The first movie has a guy that just *makes* eyes. Do you still get a human if you build it out of parts? The artificial eyes are nearly identical to human eyes, but they're not human eyes. What do you get if you build a whole body from parts that are identical to human, but not human? You get a person that is identical to a human, but is not human.

Doesn't make them not a person though. I think it can be argued that humanity and personhood can be separated.

edit: You know what, this makes me think more about the role of Joi in the movie. Replicants are apparently artificial humans with bodies identical to that of a human (hardware / wetware), but lacking the human mind / soul (the Voidt-Kampff being a psychological test of empathy). Joi does not posses anything resembling a physical human body, her hardware being fully machine, but psychologically acting like a caring, empathetic, selfless wife. Does the human body make the Replicants a human or person, if their mind is not human? Does Joi earn personhood, despite not having a body? This kind of makes K and Joi two broken things, trying to complement each other.&&Yeah but they also do touch upon the concept of soul, when Robin Wright says that killing replicants is easier because they don't have soul. So it's like, whether they really are human or are designed specifically to be more human than human.&&We watched that film in highschool english... very awkward time for the entire class but also kinda cool.

Has anyone figured out why this song was used in particular? &&No, she comments on K's taste in women because all of the AI girlfriends look the same&&I may be wrong but I assumed the melody (Which was from Sergei Pokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"") was the trademark of Wallace Corporation and played on every device.

""Understood, ordering tin cooker.""&&Seriously, ffs. It's 2018, not 2049, and this question already has a simple answer. AI of that level is not going to have a hard time using the internet to contact and pay a sex worker. &&lol, I think most people still assume prostitution is this underground business or something.&&How far do you intend to follow this chain of inquiry? Planning to go undercover? This may get expensive. You may need to consider crowd sourcing options.&&2 options. 

1. Hooker was spying on his place because she was told to by two different people.

2. Joi was with him in that stick and can see so she went to the one prostitute that didn't seem put off by working with a Bladerunner.&&[deleted]&&Bingo.  Through the film, I knew people would be saying 'myeeh, she's programmed to do anything for him.'  That never quite sat right with me - Joi, sure, was an AI.

She had a base code that she ran off, and in time she'd adapt to the customer.  But didn't Joe/K, also?  We don't see anyone saying Joe/K is 'programmed' to give a damn.  Don't all *humans* have a base code we run off?  Ours just takes a few decades to compile before we're ready for solo-running.

You've pinpointed one of the moments that made me decide Joi was as human and fallible as everyone else in the film - she was *jealous.*  I don't mean to piss on all those sex-positive peeps out there, but once you've had a threesome there's no going back.  It is just as often the death knell for a relationship as broadening of horizons - and Joi is trying to get this whore who fucked *her* Joe the *hell* out of there before he feels anything more for her.&&>	when K stares in anguish at the holo-Joi towards the end, he’s not accepting Joi’s false promise of true love - he’s realising his Joi was special

There’s a very important detail in the scene that bolsters this interpretation. Throughout both movies, eyes are a central symbol. They’re in the opening shot of both films, a replicant can be identified (or exposed) through their eyes, Tyrell dies by having his gouged out, and Wallace is blind. Rachel’s recreation in 2049 has the wrong eye-color. Even an exact, cell-for-cell copy of a person is not that person. And in the scene with K and the advertisement, the holo-joi has blackened/blank eyes. His Joi was unique, an individual with an ‘eye’-dentity. &&Although, a smart robot may also know that expressions of jealousy sells her love for her master. &&I agree that K has learned self sacrifice from Joi to a degree, but it is not from this selfless threesome scene. 

It was when Joi demanded K to transfer her to the hologram stick and wipe her backup, knowing now she could actually died. This also showed Joi most likely have full sentience, since she wants to live and die like a real person would. 

Or maybe Joi really is a program that gives whatever her user desires, and K's desire is to be real. And ~~Apple~~ Wallace programmed all Jois to take risks so all users need a yearly upgrade.&&I'm not so sure it's that simple. I think it's more supposed to make you question what makes a human human. The whole point of the Blade Runner movies is making people feel uncomfortable about this, as in either you rush to say that these androids (/human hybrid)/AIs have zero conciousness because ""that's how they're programmed"", and then you realize that we too are programmed through our genetic code, it's just an ambiguous and random programming.

So not necessarily saying that his experience wasn't a lie, or that she was a being acting entirely of her own free will and not according to a program, but that the film wants you to be unsure whether there is some spark of life in him and her; at what point of complexity does something stop being a simulation...&&>The question then becomes is Joi sentient? Is she making these decisions on her own? Or is she following some script? I don't think the movie answers this.

You can ask the same question about yourself, or me, or any of us. We don't even know ourselves. Joi builds on the theme of Blade Runner - does being built on an assembly line, like a replicant, mean you can't be ""real""? If so, says who? How do we know they're real?&&Yeah, my parents are super-puritan when it comes to sex, but if I told them ""just wait it out"" they'd probably find the scene pretty interesting.&&You are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose you are my rose...&&That's just how people from New Orleans have sex.&&So hilarious how he was explicitly told that he needed to move lower, but insisted on doing it in the same position anyway &&I don't know. I think Lito and Hernando seemed very considerate of each other. They probably took the time to limber up.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

&&Consens8&&No doubt, this was what I liked too, at times I could feel a sort of ""agenda"" trying to be conveyed but the overall message of individuality, while swinging for the fences was great.&&If it is continued I hope it doesn't interfere with continuity of the ""conclusion"" that Netflix shows. Either way, leaving me where they have with Wolfgang is fucking killing me. He's my favorite. &&Dont get me wrong, it's not that I didn't like them or could do without type of thing. It just caught me so off guard the first time lol. Like its 2 people then all of a sudden like a hand comes out of left field, I think it was Wolfgang(favorite character) who first notices and is in like a shocked state and then the whole squad is in on it and I was sitting there like ""whoa wtf just happened!"" But it becomes a moment of say total euphoria for the whole group no matter who's with who they all are in on it and that's the part that makes it better for me, rather than 7 people getting off on one person like some porn video.&&Sure, there are many. If I'm not mistaken the ""Christmas special"" (most recent episode) had multiple orgy scenes on its own. &&Really liked the concept of the show and a lot of the plot, but man the Wachowski's are absolutely stark raving mad, and their heavy handed moral message, and gratuitous sex scenes messed with the pace and flow of the story. 

And this is coming from someone who appreciates a bit of gratuitous sex in movies.   &&Sun is so great!&&I tell my friends that Sense8 is a great show, but that it has at least one scene that will make them uncomfortable and it's probably different for everyone. For me it was the giving birth scene. :P&&I only watched the first episode.  But that scene would've been hilarious in a Christmas special.

3) The actress doesn't look Japanese.   
4) And she's not freaking out.

Two alone would raise eyebrows, but this has meets all four criteria. A rare feat indeed.&&When they invented the internet, I wonder if they foresaw sentences like this &&> But, the same time, they're made. They're built. The first movie has a guy that just makes eyes. Do you still get a human if you build it out of parts?

well, think about it like this. if i get a heart transplant, am i still human? if i get a pig heart, am i human? if i get a lab-grown heart, am i human? if i get a mechanical heart, am i human? i think we'd probably agree that in *all* of these cases, yes of course i'm still human.

but where do we draw the line? how many parts can come from somewhere else, before we're not human anymore? it's kind a ship-of-theseus problem.

i think these cyber-punk, post-human kind of movies are meant to make us think about these kinds of problems. and i think the real conclusion we should be drawing is that born, or synthesized from parts grown in a lab, we're still human.

and i don't even think the psychological aspect is necessarily innate. they're just programmed that way -- like, *classical conditioning* programming. they raise them to be sociopaths, treat them like objects, and they're at best a few years old anyways. i'm pretty confident that an older replicant that somehow passed his expiration date, and wasn't raised as a replicant, would pass the voight-kampff test.

rachael nearly *does* in the first movie. tyrell says that giving them memories, a past, compensates for their lack of emotional experience. she goes about four times as long before deckard figures it out, and even then, it's pretty subtle.&&or the soul business is what they tell themselves so they can justify atrocities.

fundamentally, blade runner is about slavery. we've been telling ourselves for millennia that slavery is okay because the people we enslave are ""sub-human"".&&Can't fathom what your thought process during Paddington. &&At the same time though what's most is that it's a film about family, and doing the right thing.&&I don't know why the one song had to involve a motorcycle engine revving up.&&Nope, none of the actors are comptuter generated here.

What they did is that they filmed using multiple cameras at once which allowed them to calculate a 3d depth of the scene. They then combined the two shots by selecting the actress that was closest to the camera in each pixel. This requires a lot more effort than just doing it using regular tracking equipment or a specialized set.

I once had to pay one ten bucks to get directions to the highway. &&Yeah, if I slept with a hooker and she said ""Oh it's my treat"" I'd be suspicious as fuck. I'm not that good at doing the sex.&&I don't know the specific reason, but it works to reinforce a theme throughout the movie of K being a wolf in sheep's clothing.

In part, the sheep's clothing is quite literal: he wears a sheepskin jacket. He's given an origami sheep (itself a double reference, referring back to the original book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?). He's frequently called a ""good boy"" or ""bad dog"" by Luv and Joshi, terms often used to reference dogs. He's a Nexus-9 and goes by the name K -- K-9, or canine. I think there were a few other things. I'd assume the musical choice was at least partially intended to continue that theme.

EDIT: I've thought a lot about what the purpose of the theme was, and I found a potential answer that I like. It's informing us of the type of replicant K is. Replicants are obedient and subservient in timeframe of 2049; they are ""sheep."" K, a replicant, is obedient and subservient but becomes progressively more independent and individualist (in turn, making him dangerous) -- he looks like the other ""sheep"" but is being revealed as a ""wolf.""

EDIT2: Also the wolf/sheep thing works because K's job is to hunt down and kill other replicants. Making him the wolf to their sheep. That's probably far simpler and easier than my first thoughts on it.&&It's the theme where Peter walks out into the meadow:

> Early one morning, Peter opened the gate and walked out into the big green meadow.&&The point being the hooker knows about the AI girlfriend and visa versa. The little pencil thing K carries her around with allows her to be there with him at all times more or less.&&When I first got a phone with the functionality, I said ""ok Google, find hookers near me.""  It gave me a bunch of escort service numbers.&&TBF you probably need a tin cooker anyway.&&It's also cute that someone would get hung up on their AI assistant / gf / IOT fridge having broad/general purchasing authorization. &&Probably paid with bitcoin&&No, no, no. Where would she get the prostitute's address, and how would she be able to purchase a stamp and seal the envelope, never mind hold the quill and dip it in the inkwell and to put the pen to vellum!?!?!?

Pish tosh, sir! And surely she would need a proper introduction to said hooker by a trusted third party! For decorum's sake, if nothing else!

I will entertain no further futuristic ramblings! Good day to you, sir!

I said good day!&&[deleted]&&Y'know prostitution has been legal in Canada basically forever?  It's only streetwalking and the keeping of bawdy houses that are illegal, ads in the back of the newspaper for ""independent contractors"" have never been illegal, solicitation is, but that's why you don't advertise the sex work part, the accepting money part is perfectly legal.&&Good call. For real answers I’ll probably have to interview a few of them in person; a motel room for privacy is called for.&&You mean translucent not opaque. Opaque is the opposite of transparent. &&Also, whenever K is around another woman (Luv, the hooker) that little musical chime always plays. Nothing else seems to happen, it's just Joi being like ""hands off bitch, he's taken"".&&That's the whole point of her character. If one fails to humanize her, and compare her to Joe, they wasted 30 minutes of screen time. Personhood is the core theme of both Blade Runners, and of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. What makes someone, someone? We see humans who live only for their purpose, like machines: The girl locked away making memories, or John Isodore, or Wallace. We see machines acting human, Phil Resch, Joi, K, [Deckard](#spoiler)

Hell, one of the main issues in the first movie was distinguishing between replicants and humans. It's a reality where there are machines ""more human"" than some actual humans. &&Out of K's earshot though?&&Posted this below: 

“What I kept thinking was how humans looked down on replicants for not having a soul and replicants looked down on AIs for not having a body. A sad, existential pecking order. “

The fashion, architecture, video games, the letter-writing job, the constant sound commands, even the way people react to tech and to each other.&&kinda spoilers but I watched it a while ago so i'm forgetting but i believe part of the point of the film has to do with isolation especially with the advent of technology. Although the end is a hopeful one&&I'd like to see what happened in the world of Her one year later. I mean it was like what, a few weeks in and the AIs develop some super AI and then take off on their own. Who knows where that leads.

I think a big part of the movie was how lonely and isolated everyone had become despite how crowded the city was, which is why the AIs were developed in the first place - to provide companionship. 

It's not a terrible future, but I wouldn't call it ideal.&&Not to mention that it's a future with no belts!&&Interesting&&[deleted]&&Is that what we are calling chlamydia now?&&I never knew Google and prostitues were in the same business&&She wasn’t a hooker though. Just horny. &&Which scene was that?&&The payment to leave at that point is very expensive&&Podrick is well endowed, sure, but Tyrion is the one with the magic cock.&&Some marketing material or other talked about his sheepskin jacket. I forget where it was revealed. I remembered seeing it brought up here and I didn't think much of it until I saw some discussion after I watched the movie.&&Well just like amazon knows my address or google assistant knows my contacts. I would think the AI who is connected to everything K does would be able to make a phone call or whatever. &&Someone needs to make a bot for this phrase&&Where do I sign up for this service, asking for a friend.&&Buttcoin&&Like the blizzard in LA.&&anyway how’s your sex life&&I’ve never seen this show or heard about it. And your description has me all sorts of confused...&&And edible too!&&It is actually an unofficial remake of the 80's film Possesion. Which has a very similar scene.&&I'd say things like the videos of people actually getting decapitated and stuff are NSFW8 and there's a step that strains the imagination above that, then there's one final step that's so horrible you could never imagine it until you've seen it.&&It's definitely a very off-putting sound. I wish they had only used it in the actual flight to LAPD, and maybe once more instead of the repetitions during the street-level scene with Mariette.

I still felt the sound added to the world though. It felt like both a part of the soundtrack and a part of the film's universe. The original score did this, but it was mostly more subtle and a little less...nightmarish?&&Yea, it's twisted and fucked up. The movie is about tracking down the guy who did that and is sharing the memory of it out on the black market. It's actually a good film directed by Katherine Bigelow, and the act being that horrific is important to what the film is trying to say. Takes place at the turn of the century from an early 90's perspective, though, so you have to appreciate the technological aesthetic that brings.&&Exactly. And he's enjoying himself doing it, and she is forced to  experience his pleasure at exactly the same time as she's experiencing the horror and agony of being murdered in this way, and can see what's being done to her body through his eyes, as well as feel it. Really gut churning scene but as said above, quite integral to the plot. Amazing film.&&From his point of view. Including how he feels about it.&&

murderception&&I think it's so she can experience the murder *from his point of view*, but I could be wrong.

It's not like I'll ever watch that movie and find out.&&[deleted]&&And efficient public transportation in LA. But that existential crisis wrecked me especially as I was unemployed at the time. &&And 70s porn 'staches.&&Not true. Phoenix's character was not isolated, he took her on dates and introduced her to his friends. Her helped him get back into the world and out of his depressed isolation. The film was about moving on from past relationships, this includes his ex wife and both him and Johansson moving on from their current relationship together. I find it so strange how people have added this idea that Phoenix's character is in an unhealthy relationship with Johansson. It's a positive relationship that helps both characters grow, too the point that they have to move on from each other to continue growing themselves.&&Indeed&&I'd say humans as well, but something to note is its not really the same AI b/c it learns from all your shared history and interaction and presumably adjusts itself to better suit you as it goes.&&I think he’s talking about the girl Eggsy fingers at that music festival. &&If I recall correctly, it's not really sheepskin. It's all synthetic material made to look that way partly to stay in theme with the fact there are no/so few real animals left in the world but also so the coat wasn't too heavy during filming and waterproof in the rain.&&That's not the point they are arguing.  It's that the hooker and the AI didn't meet each other before.  AI saw the hooker when she was in the device he carries.  Hooker knows AI from ads.&&Titcoin&&I've been sticking $30 in pennies up my ass for the past 11 years! That's 3,000 pennies a day; 21,000 pennies a week; 1,092,000 pennies a year! To date that's 12,012,000 pennies, 8 times the population of Nebraska. Those pennies were in my ass! You think you're better than me? Oh, you're not better than me. You handle my ass pennies everyday. You pick up my ass pennies for good luck. You throw my ass pennies in fountains and make wishes on them. You give my ass pennies to your little daughter to buy gumballs with.&&And apparently the extinction of pizza.&&This, for me was my favourite line. How in the hell do you just casually ask about someone’s sex life as if inquiring about the weather...

Way to go Tommy &&The shows interesting, but there's a shit-ton of shoehorned sex&&My thoughts exactly&&So it’s like that one episode of Black Mirror with the Black History Museum? The part with the doctor?&&Ohhhh this makes sense now&&Yes I agree with that. But that doesn't mean the film doesn't warn about the dangers of isolation in our future (maybe not exactly because of technology), check my other reply just now &&[deleted]&&It is the same code base, but everyones is different once they take it. Just like your phone or computer is a codebase clone, no two system are alike for very long.&&When hooker is leaving she makes jab at Joi's software limitations.&&Not necessarily, the advertisement called K ""not a regular Joe"" after his girlfriend gave him that as a ""unique human name"", showing that she isn't actually very unique at all. She's programmed to be that way for everybody, his wasn't any more special than the others, that was the point. &&Idk, I mean sure humans would use it a lot, but im really thinking it's more implied for replicants. The need for feeling whole with someone, probably isn't going to come with a lot of human contact when humans hate you. AI just fills that role perfectly.&&That whole thing was weird an unnecessary imo&&I guess synthetic sheepskin is actually even more apt, don't you think?&&The hooker didn't meet the AI, but the AI met the hooker then hired her later.

They phrased it weirdly, but that's what they're conveying. He didn't say they had a chat. They didn't grab a cup of coffee and talk about synthetic boys.&&Nutcoin&&This is such a good reference. You're a very upright citizen. &&Seems like it, but one step further. &&Neat, I totally agree with that, I forgot about the job.&&[deleted]&&But the world sees K as a ""SkinJob"". He doesn't have a chance with real women. This is  one of very few options for him to find companionship. 

If an AI is programmed to want to serve the customer and it gets to do just that, isn't it fulfilling it's purpose? She isn't a living woman who should have agency and her own ambitions and needs. For me the morality ends there. 

When K says ""You don't have to say that"", he's saying she doesn't have to say things that Wallace programmed her to say. He's telling her she has options. 

K knows that he and Joi are similar. There is no part in the film where he wishes she was something else. He genuinely loves her. He buys her an upgrade so she can leave the apartment. She also seems to appear to him at her own discretion. 

It's not a master/slave dichotomy in my opinion. They are both slaves, but they have each other. I think that's kind of beautiful.&&Nobody gets to choose who they do or do not love, so what is the difference?&&Just like any living organism. RNA encoding, but then environmental variables adjust the coding in the fly. &&So she's basically a Furby is what I'm getting from this&&Ya I'm conflicted about whether the a.i. was somewhat aware and could learn / grow / love.  I mean, if you concede that an android can why couldn't that be applied to  a.i.? 

Something I noticed,  (Spoiler ahead!) 
The a.i. shouts 'I love you!' when  she realizes she's gonna die which was heartbreaking, but I did notice near the end when the hologram says 'I'm programmed to tell you what you want to hear baby' or some such.  So I was left wondering if love is all K wanted in life and the a.i. picked up on it, or if she had grown to love him.

&&I just realized Joe seeing the Holo-ad is like the Little Prince seeing the rosebush and realizing the rose he loved was common. But in the end the Little Prince realizes his rose is unique because he loved her and she loved him back and that is what made her special, even if she was identical to other roses.&&It was only in the script for the, ""I thought everything was bigger in America joke""&&Indeed! Do Androids Wear Synthetic Sheepskin? Yes, it would appear they do...&&Exactly. The ai says ""i could tell you liked her"". The ai reached out to the hooker. &&",2018-02-18 11:20:24

And then [Beckinsale from a 2016 episode of Graham Norton](https://i.imgur.com/Ceo8f8A.jpg).

I mean don't get me wrong, she's real pretty throughout all but man, she got way hotter with age, it's crazy.

I dunno if Salma Hayek is hotter now than she was in Desperado, I think she's more just maintained a plateau of being really pretty and being a vampire that doesn't age or something.&&Men and women can both get hotter as they get older.&&No, some women definitely age into hotness that goes beyond just that default youthfulness and evolves into a whole other level of striking. It's usually the ones that have incredible bone structure waiting to be revealed when the baby fat leaves their faces. The confidence and presence that age brings can be very sexy too.

There's also the fact that it's not just straight guys who get an opinion on this. A lot of lesbian/bi women find women over 35 extremely attractive in a much higher percentage too.&&It's the hair in this pic.&&>I can’t really imagine anyone thinking that 51 year old Selma is hotter than she was at 25?  I am seriously curious because I hear people say this a lot about women. 

25 year old Selma was a hot chick in a sea of hot chicks. When I was a teenager I thought she was pretty but no way I'd have picked over some of the girls in my town.

51 year old Selma is head and shoulders hotter than the big majority of 51 year old people. She's the definition of MIlF or GILF. 

And to put a male spin on it, 21 year old Keanu was a good looking guy but 53 year old Keanu is a level of attractive and fit that most of us won't be anywhere near.

So relative to their peers, these people are hotter in their 50s than their 20s. 

Edit for relevant side rant-Some of us have fetishes and actually do prefer older women to younger girls. I'd take a fit 40 year old over a fit 18 year old because there's just something about this that's exotic and rare. I can't even watch teen / college girl porn anymore because it bores me. But that's a rare exception I imagine.&&I have the theory that it appears that way because they have learned over the years what works best for them. Be it how they do their hair, makeup, clothes, etc. At 25, they didn’t have that figured out as well maybe?&&She’s got the Julia Louis Dreyfus thing where she somehow does actually keep getting hotter. &&I really do think she's hotter now than 20 years ago, but to be fair I do like older women. 🙄&&If you have a thing for older women then yeah, she's hotter now&&It's a site about porn that's taking place inside bathtubs&&I've always loved him.

Nothing to write home about [in the Xena era.](https://jacksonupperco.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/xenachakfuries.jpg), she always reminded me of a more androgynous Demi Moore.

She's just now beginning to show her age, but when she walked onto the set of Battlestar she was somehow unrecognizable and gorgeous at the age of 37 having been out of the limelight for a decade. 

I think it's three things: her face thinned out, her blonde hair looks ten times better, and the bangs did her no favors. She's rumored to have had minor work done, but her from 20 to 40 was some [princess diaries shit.](http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201673/rs_1024x759-160803113938-1024-movie-makeovers-princess-diaries.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=100)

[Mrs New Zealand](http://flawlesslawless2010.tripod.com/llmrsNZ.jpg) was definitely attractive, just a bit plain looking.

I wouldnt mind a reboot like 20 years from now or a spiritual succesor that stuck to the first season type stuff. &&I've watched the whole series twice... I always say it gets worse towards the end, but honestly it was still a fun binge watch.
