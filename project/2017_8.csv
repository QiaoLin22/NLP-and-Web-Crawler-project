First Image of Josh Brolin as Cable in Deadpool 2,101692,6s68f5,https://i.redd.it/pihzcon43cez.jpg,4524,1502119584.0,,"Brolin posted a picture of the full costume on his Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXf2zL8BJ9F/?hl=en&&Significant lack of feet.

Yep,seems legit&&Is the dude shooting Infinity Wars 2 and Deadpool 2 at the same time?&&Brolin:  Thanos and Cable

Ryan R: Green Lantern and Deadpool

Ben A: Batman and Daredevil

J.K.S: J. Jonah Jameson and Commissioner Gordon 

Who am I forgetting????&&*From the official Marvel Directory, the time-traveling Cable (the adult son of Cyclops), is “a mutant whose physical attributes have been enhanced to superhuman levels. His principal mutant powers are his vast telepathic and telekinetic abilities. He can employ the latter to levitate objects and to create protective force shields. He must continually employ his telekinetic powers to prevent the techno-organic virus from affecting the rest of his body. His techno-organic left arm and shoulder possess even greater strength than his entirely organic ones. Cable’s techno-organic right eye can see into the infrared portion of the spectrum.”*&&Brolin walking to the bank these next couple of years. Good for him.&&Josh Brolin kinda blows my mind. 

I was a kid when he was a teen in The Goonies. 32 years later he seems like he's 60 and is a serious badass in every role he does now. &&You know how promo pics of characters always look better in motion? This looks awesome *now*. I can't wait to see how he looks in the film!&&Would've loved to see Michael Cera get it, but Josh Brolin looks ok. &&Hoping Deadpool makes a Goonies reference.&&This is a slightly weird observation. I don't know if it's the haircut, but Josh Brolin's face looks so...slim?&&Looks like he's taken notes from Till Lindemann&&[deleted]&&Whoa nice&&Where is Keira Knightley? #NotMyCable&&This dude is literally playing thanos and cable, in two huge blockbuster movies. He's about to get a whole lot richer.. &&All I gotta say is:

BODYSLIDE BY ONE&&Second image: http://imgur.com/a/p1wKX&&I think he looks awesome. I love the eye and the scars.

[EDIT: Also, higher-res version here.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGovov0WAAAMMVa.jpg:large)

EDIT 2: [Second picture!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGo0-69XkAAeBqS.jpg:large)&&Don't shush me, Cable. IM EXCITED OVER HERE&&Man, I was really hoping that it would be Keira Knightley playing Cable&&Looks cool, but I expected more blue and yellow and maybe bulkier.&&[deleted]&&Mickey Rourke would have been good for this too.&&I'm so used to Cable being drawn by Leifeld that in my head, he's 9"" tall and weighs about 528 lbs. carrying a gun just as tall and with pouches upon pouches all over his body. Oh and like 76 teeth in his mouth. &&Dammit I was hoping for Keira Knightley.&&That is one weird looking Vector.&&Amazing actor? Check. Amazing character? Check. Amazing sequel? It seems pretty inevitable at this point. &&The face photo looks great, but I'm not really a fan of the full body design. It just looks too... bland? generic? I don't know, something feels off.

With how well they managed to make the character designs look on the first Deadpool, having them look close enough to the comics without being too silly, I was expecting that trend to continue on the sequel but it seems that they're taking Cable and Domino on a different direction.&&Sai blade mark above his right eye.&&This pose reminds me of Death Stranding.&&Needs more pouches.&&Reminds me of the Doom dude &&Rob Liefield must be devastated to see his creation presented with remotely human proportions.&&That's not Keira Knightley!!&&*MOTTO PANNUKEIKU*&&He looks so good! I'm so excited for Cable.&&""Who the fuck is that? He's a man out of time! Who the fuck is that? He's fucking Cable!""&&Isn't Cable supposed to be Jean Grey and Cyclops son from the future that's come back to now or has that been retconned?&&That's a haircut you can set your watch to!&&So basically Deadpool is doing X-Men and the whole X-franchises far better than the actual X-Men movies ever did

And why?

Attention to detail and intelligent casting, just like what the Avengers did.

Bryan Singer cast whatever pretty boys he was fucking (or wanted to fuck) without caring much about really capturing the character- that's how we got what's his face as the 19 year old non-russian colossus, or the guy who played ice man, or the kid playing pyro, etc. etc.

Can't wait to see what Deadpool does with X characters where they actually take their time&&Whomever is charge of the costumes for Deadpool needs to do the X-Men. This is amazing.&&Needs shoulder pads as big as his head and at least twice as many pouches.&&[Is it parody?](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/1/12/Cable_1992.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20101118072816)&&And there's a giant gun, and lots of pouches. All we're missing is 374 teeth in his mouth.&&How does Liefield even get away with this shit&&Haha glad I wasn't the only one to think of this, even the ""full body"" image doesn't have them!&&Thighs as thick as a normal person's torso.
 &&It would be hilarious if they found a way to occlude his feet in every shot, having ridiculous props and things blocking the view. Kind of like Ms. Bellum's face from the Power Puff girls.&&It's possible. He may even be done with Avengers because that's only voice acting and maybe some mocap &&Schedule is not a problem when you can time travel.&&You had me excited for a moment then, I thought he was going to be Cable in both but then I remembered.&&I would have thought thanos would be more mocap than anything else, meaning he'd be doing pretty much mouth tracking and voice work - much like spader did with age of ultron.&&Evans as Human Torch and Captain America&&Halle Berry: Storm and Catwoman

also Brolin was Jonah Hex so he was already in this club long ago.&&Lawrence Fishbourne is Perry White for DC and recently took a role with Marvel, ~~idk who~~ Goliath&&Tilda Swinton as Gabriel and The Ancient One&&Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips and Two-Face&&Tom Hardy: Bane and Venom&&Chris Evans for Human Torch and Captain America.

Michael Keaton just now for Batman and Vulture.&&Aaron Taylor Johnson: Kick-ass and Quicksilver&&I noticed the Harlem city councilwoman in Luke Cage is the same same as some mom who blamed her son's death on Iron Man in Civil War

Edit: changed mayor to councilwoman&&Don't forget Ryan was also in blade&&Michael Keaton: Batman and Vulture&&>Ryan R: Green Lantern and Deadpool and Deadpool&&Brolin also played Jonah Hex (DC comics character) &&Michelle Pfeifer: Catwoman and The Wasp&&Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross and Karen (spidey AI in homecoming) &&Brolin as Jonah Hex...  

Well, we can go ahead and forget that one.&&Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury and The Octopus.

(I really hope no one gets the reference. I pity people unfortunate enough to have sat through ""The Spirit"")&&James Marsden played Cyclopes in X-Men and was Richard White (not a superhero) in Superman Returns.&&The part about him having to use his powers to keep his virus in check is a huge part in the Cable and Deadpool comic. At one point he no longer needs to do this and basically becomes the second coming for the world. &&His full name is Nathan Christopher Charles Dayspring Askani'son Summers&&Oh so he's like Trunks from DBZ?&&[deleted]&&You know when I was a kid, I liked cable because he had a shiney eye and big guns. I thought his eye made him a better shot. 

I wasn't allowed to read comics, so I just made guesses based on covers. &&He's the child of Scott and Jean, right?&&More like taking a helicopter or whatever mode of transport he chooses considering the amount of money he's likely to make.&&Well, yeah, cause Mikey let the air out of his tires.&&He's like a new and improved Tommy Lee Jones...fuck MIB 3 did that already&&Dude just gets better with age. Pumped to see him in this role. Cable was one of my all-time favorites.&&Loved him in Sicario and No Country&&Same with James Brolin...they both look good for their ages.&&I can't think of a more crusty badass than he played in no country.   Well, expect the guy who played his nemesis.  &&The costume team behind Deadpool is really on point.&&Exactly...all though I think Deadpool has always had good promo images&&I read ""porno"" and I agreed with you. &&I wonder if he seriously beefed up, grew a beard and shaved his hair off if he could actually do a tough guy role.
  
Edit: photoshops pls&&Idk, I'd rather see Michael Cera play Shaft. &&Or a thanos one&&The only thing that could make this movie even worse than the first is if they take all of reddit's writing suggestions &&He's been in the gym like mad man for the role. If you lose body fat your face is going to look skinnier. &&This is why: https://www.instagram.com/p/BXPgFboh_2q

https://www.instagram.com/p/BXUgDQzBR2c&&As a Till fangirl AND a Cable fangirl, this pleases me.&&If he fires a huge jizz cannon at a load of people that'll confirm it.&&Calm down Mr. Liefeld.&&Wait ... is this not Kiera?? 

Sigh. *zips*&&First. as Jonah Hex(DC)

then, as Thanos(Marvel)

now, as Cable(Marvel)&&Love that his gun is actually dialed up to 11.&&Where are his giant shoulder pads? And he needs like 50 more pouches. Also his hands aren't mysteriously obscured by smoke.&&dig the detail on the cybernetic eye
&&Dude's got an analog dial on his gun. Does it go to 11?&&... Is his gun dialed up to 11?  Yup, it sure is.  
  
Loving that gun!&&i was actually hoping for knightly as domino &&the bulk required to portray Cable would require a arnold schwarzenegger at its peak. &&I mean Josh Brolin is a [pretty bulky dude](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXPgFboh_2q/?taken-by=joshbrolin).&&[deleted]&&Oh shit 

Mickey rourke would have been perfect &&Vector receiver + Thompson stock + M203 grenade launcher + Barrett muzzle brake + M4 tri-rail = Hollywood doesn't know how to come up with original guns.&&Just need them to cast Walton Goggins as Kletus Kassidy in the Venom movie and were set.&&I think the outfit looks to classic. Almost like a Vietnam War Era uniform.... Doesn't necessarily scream future soldier. &&I know what you mean, it looks well thought out and really matches the character detail wise in that it has pouches and such, but the overall package seems to lack style. The plain undershirt  for example seems practical, but he usually wore more stylized stuff. I think it lacks the flair he had, but captures the main idea.&&I think we can all forgive them for not going full Liefeld though.&&In the comics, that scar was caused when the techno organic virus entered his system as a kid.   &&Sai don't have blades, they're basically big nails used to till soil.  &&Thanks &&Exactly. And half of the actors he picked look the same, and exactly like him.

&&All the casting​ of Marvel was done by one woman, don't remember her name now.

She's very good, all the actors she casted were born to play the roles, especially RDJ, Holland, Evans and Hemsworth.&&I really enjoyed the uniforms in First Class, but that's the only time they got it right.&&And an absolutely massive crotch.&&Needs a sternum and pecks that jut 2.5 feet out from his body and then tapers to 25 inch waist.&&Surely it's a dig at Liefeld &&His work is passable at a glance and he always meets his deadlines. Plus, his style was pretty representative of the 90s in comics. The dudes are just masses of muscles and the women are just tits and ass. His layouts are also full of energy. 

He's also not all bad, people just like to pick on some of his worst drawings. (although he really does love to draw women with completely unrealistic body proportions for some reason)&&His stuff is goofy, but I find that there's a kind of weird charm to Liefeld. &&Apparently he was a work horse that would just crank books out.&&Infinity War 1 wrapped, I think part 2 starts later this week or next. He'll definitely have some work to do, even if it's limited.&&Mocap can be done by anybody, and the voice acting he can do in a couple of weeks after DP2 shoots as part of post production.&&[deleted]&&Yeah but you still can't save Harry's parents, just Buckbeak. &&I wouldn't be surprised if Deadpool refers to Cable as Thanos in the movie.&&That's not impossible. 

I still believe that in 5-10 years. Likely when Fantastic Four gets back to Marvel and they succesfully work them into a Galactus/GotG crossover utilizing the new Avengers and the new GotG. 

While Sony continues to make gobs of money off of licensing Spidey and company back to Marvel/Disney. Plus the Incredibles drive a new round of Disney Superhero cash cows.

At the same time a new market for ""girl"" heroes starts to need to get tapped ESPECIALLY post Captain Marvel. She-Hulk joins the New Avengers along with Hawkeye (girl variant). Marvel/Disney will want Invisible Woman.

All the while eyeing the most famous ""girl"" heroes sitting in the X-men stable of Jean Grey, Rogue, Storm, White Queen, Jubilee, Psylocke/Revanche, Silver Fox, Lady Deathstrike, Spiral, Blink, and more. While cursing their limited selection still left of Squirrel Girl, Mockingbird, and Kamala Khan (assuming she doesn't get swallowed in the Inhumans show).

They'll fold. Like paper. 

I still believe!&&S. Lee: Every Marvel Film Ever!!!&&Spader was still on set for a lot it, in a mocap suit with a stupid hat that marked where his ""eyes"" were. Like Alan Tudyk in R1, he's still doing the acting, but he gets to wear super dark shades.&&Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch and Killmonger.&&Evans was also in Losers and Scott Pilgrim, the dude loves his comic book adaptations. &&And Lucas Lee&&To be fair forgetting Halle Berry as a Catwoman is probably beneficial for everyone's sanity&&They never made a Catwoman movie. Halle Berry just made a movie about playing weird basketball after being meowed at by a cat. &&Goliath&&He'll be Bill Foster in Ant Man and the Wasp.&&Fishburne will be [Dr. Bill Foster in *Ant-Man & The Wasp*, familiar to comic readers as the hero Goliath.](#spoiler)&&Bill Foster aka Black Goliath, in Ant Man & Wasp&&He's Goliath/Bill Foster in Ant Man 2&&So good as Gabriel&&[deleted]&&Men in black is a comic as well right? &&Plus they made some Mad Max comics... if that counts.&&Kinda ironic he became the very thing that have him power&&Michael Keaton; Batman, Vulture, Birdman. &&Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch and Killmonger too.&&Evan Peters was also in Kickass and Quicksilver... &&It wasn't the mayor of Harlem but your right about it being the same actress.&&She was a city councilwoman. Harlem was her district. There is no mayor of Harlem because Harlem is not a city, it's a neighborhood.&&Black Mariah&&Best part of Blade 3.&&Birdman &&and Hannibal King&&_Brolin as Jonah_

_Hex... Well, we can go ahead_

_And forget that one._

Mom is the god damn pheonix and his dad can channel power out his butthole.  His uncle from his dad side is also an omega mutant.  He's like Michael Jordan and LeBron James have a kid somehow....&&So like Deadpool having to heal cancer 24/7. He has to telepathically halt a virus from spreading 24/7? &&Been out of the comic loop for a while and i believe Cable was the first and, at the time, only Omega level mutant until they retconned other mutants' power levels.&&So I guess he got confirmed.&&what's sad is that i could recite his full name upon request, and yet i regularly forget my bank account password.
&&Deadpool often throws a Gesundheit in there.&&He's like if cyclops and Phoenix had a baby that grew up and traveled back in time to a different dimension where Phoenix didn't happen yet and just went balls to the wall with deadpool.&&Future Trunks, you mean. At this point he's an entirely separate character than regular Trunks&&Thanks...movie is now unwatchable.&&Scott and a genetic clone of Jean created by Mister Sinister, but he was partially raised by Scott and Jean when their psyches were projected into the future. X-Men origin stories tend to lean towards the convoluted side ...&&Becoming the real-life counterpart of the guy he played in Wall Street 2.&&The Thanos copter&&And he aced it, his TLJ impression was spot on.&&TIL Brolin is Hollywood's Whisky. Sounds about right.&&Just realized he was the task force leader in Sicario wow&&Loved his character in Sicario.

Brolin is easily one of my favorite actors working today.&&I always see Cable as being a broader body. Thicker neck and a boxers face. The 90s cartoon version of him is still strong in my mind. More of a Ron Perlman kind of face...but ugly. 

Brolin looks amazing within this isolated context though, the costume department is great...but he feels...small. Like its the wrong body type or something. I can't imagine Brolin's strength against the fingers of a sentinel like the cartoon depiction of a steroid driven linebacker with cybernetic enhancements. 

This dude instead looks like he just came back from a tour of combat in Space Iraq. 

So I'm fine with it...but it's not the Cable I personally remember. &&[deleted]&&Michael Cera can't look tough, it's impossible.

I would 100% see a Michael Cera action blockbuster. &&....... I seriously doubt it. 

Maybe if he beefed up, grew a beard, and became a completely different person he might be able to pull it off. &&or a Jonah Hex one&&There's definitely going to be a quote that goes something like ""At least this country is okay with old men."" And then deadpool winks at us.&&Now, see I really liked the first film. But I agree with that second part. Everyone on Reddit has really bad writing suggestions.&&Unless you're pounding HGH, then your head balloons into a pumpkin like Barry Bonds. &&He was going to the gym like a mad man way before this though. 

He was already muscular in Old Boy, but they tried ridiculous stuff, like making him drink soda and eat some chips before the shoots, so his body would've looked like the weak businessman(?) it was supposed to before the prison workout. &&It looks like Thompson combined with a Kriss Vector, with a grenade launcher to boot.&&We can't see his feet so it's all good.&&Not cybernetic. It's a vestigial mutation from his dad. If they stick to the text, that is. But yes, looks good.&&Wish his eye had a more prominent scar like the of xmen show had.&&Zoom in.  It does. :)&&Didn't she already have a movie called Domino?&&With the feet of Oscar Pistorius.&&I imagined someone big like the Ron Perlman, Hellboy type big for Cable. Hell, I think Ron Perlman could've played the part anyway.&&All it's missing is multiple bayonets.&&That would be fantastic casting. Goggins just has the look to nail a role like Kassidy.&&What about this look ?

http://comicsalliance.com/files/2014/06/XMen003.jpg&&Truth be told, his comics outfit is fairly ridiculous. Here he looks like he can fit in among normal people well. &&More poop face please&&Needs to be bulging the whole movie too&&For the poor uniformed, Liefeld was infamous for having a terrible sense of anatomy and proportion.  He'd draw people with shoulders that could crush mountains and carry a house but with size six feet.  


&&Thing is, he was legendary with the Bullpen when I interned at Marvel in the late '90s for his ridiculously inconsistent art.

From someone who remembers the early days of Image comics, this is difficult to process.&&His worst is pretty damn terrible and his usual is just plain bad. Most guys working in comics, when they're having an off day, nobody is really going to notice.

I honestly don't know.&&It's that 80's-90's stank&&They could schedule it so that they don't shoot his scenes for avengers 2 until after he is done with his scenes in deadpool&&2 starts today as far as I know&&> Mocap can be done by anybody

And your chin looks normal!""

Or reference an action he does such as punching someone really hard.

His dad is Cannonball?&&Yes, the whole situation is **paradoxical** -- a concept/story that would make an awesome 'Cable' time-travel paradox movie. It's an interesting read if you're intrigued. 

Basically, Cable is the son of Madelyne Pryor (a clone of Jean Grey) and Cyclops. Mister Sinister was QB'ing this whole situation in an attempt to eventually use & manipulate their powerful offspring (Cable) into destroying Apocalypse. Sinister knew that the son of Jean Grey and Cyclops would yield an insanely powerful mutant. Inevitably finding out about this, Apocalypse finds and infects infant Cable with a deadly techno-organic virus. 

To save Cable from dying, Cyclops sends him thousands of years into the future. In this future, Cable is cloned (in case he can't be cured) -- and this clone was stolen and raised by Apocalypse as Stryfe. Cable has to use all of his awesome power to keep the virus at bay. He eventually learns to control and leverage his abilities -- and a lot of his story involves him hopping around (time-traveling) in an attempt to kill Apocalypse. I think I remember reading that something like 90% of his 'resources' are used to keep the virus from taking over and killing him; and even at that, Cable is still an extremely powerful mutant (one who eventually *defeats* Apocalypse). 

The whole **paradox** revolves around the fact that Cable had actually infected Apocalypse with the techno-organic virus during a battle far in the past (while he was time-traveling with the goal of destroying young Apocalypse). This is how -- years later, Apocalypse then infects infant Cable with the virus (the same virus he was given by a future time-traveling Cable). Cable would have never been infected with the virus as an infant if he didn't go back in time and give Apocalypse the very virus that Apocalypse then gives him.... It's a trip and a true time-travel oriented paradox. 

**Far Past**: Cable travels back in time and gives Apocalypse the Techno-Organic Virus

**Cable Birth**: Apocalypse gives infant Cable the Techno-Organic Virus 

**Cable-Future**: Cable uses a large part of his powers to keep the virus at bay. He then time-travels in an attempt to kill Apocalypse 

**Far Past**: Cable travels back to a time before he was born and before Apocalypse ever had the Techno-Organic Virus. Restart ""cycle"". &&> balls to the wall with deadpool

butt stuff?&&> just went balls to the wall with deadpool.

Say that again, but slower?&&What’s even more amazing about his character is when you account for X-Man(Nathaniel “Nate” Grey). He’s basically cable except for he didn’t come back, instead he stayed and grew up in age of apocalypse before escaping and having his own set of crazy adventures. Really great series back in the 90’s. One of my faves.&&They've always been separate. The only time they've resembled one another was in GT and that's not canon.&&MIB 3 is when Brolin instantly became one of my favorite actors. I was so insanely skeptical about that whole movie, but Brolin was PERFECT, and now MIB 3 is quite possibly my favorite MIB.&&MiB3 is a tad underrated. it was a lot of fun. &&Just remember,  people thought Hugh Jackman didn't really look The part for wolverine.

ONSLAUGHT!!!&&Same for me.

I was pissed when they didn't cast him as Batman, but fortunately Affleck defied all expectation.&&Agree, I expected very little going in and was pleasantly surprised.  Brolin's TLJ impression was perfect and the story was coherent enough.  Jemaine Clement made that movie for me though, he was great.

Edit: Jemaine, not Jermaine...the NZ accent always made it sound like he was leaving off the ""r""&&MIB3 should have been the only sequel. I liked it so much more than I thought, based on the garbage that was MIB2. It does something clever with the premise, unlike so many sequels, by throwing in the time travel element. And, it had a ton of heart, which the second one lacked. Clever, charming, funny, well-written and well-acted. A truly worthy sequel to the original.&&That ending that revealed the reasons why Tommy Lee Jones has always seemed so stern was kinda heart breaking too. It also goes someway to explain why they took a shine to Will Smith's character in the first movie rather than just wiping his mind too.&&Great twist. Fantastic performances, especially from Michael Stuhlbarg. My only real gripe was Jemaine not taking the role seriously enough. Felt like he was joking around half the time. Which is weird because I love Jemaine.&&There's also the fact that a lot of the character body types from the 90s are physically impossible. Especially a lot of Liefeld's work&&I tried

He's significantly more powerful than her, too.  But because of the techno-organic virus he contracted, the *vast* majority of his power is spent constantly keeping the virus in check.  Thus why he relies on guns more than his actual TK.&&Seems like it:

I think the guy is saying it glows as some sort of connection to cyclops, which might also be true, as I think sometimes they say it glows when he's using his powers, but with other authors it always glows. Technically he's always using his powers to keep the virus at bay so I guess both are true there too.&&Thick McRunFast!&&I said the same thing.&&""Accidentally"" &&hey you guys read that same article from last week&&I believe in previous movies, Marvel has done a lot of the performance capture in a studio, but not all of it.

Torch says something to Thing about how no-one will ever love him and then Thing threatens to murder Torch.  It wasn't fun banter back and forth it just came off as cruel and then an actual threat.&&Username checks out&&Its named after a comic.&&I'd like one for Jumper too&&Did a better job at it than Jumper&&I say this all the time.

It won't work! Back to the 90s with you!&&This is a parody account. How are people not getting this? &&I worked at Blockbuster back in high school, and I can confirm it was not nearly as fun as these Tweets make it sound.  

My favorite memory from my time there was actually my last day. My Manager, who was a true joy to work with, sent me out to pick up her lunch, as she usually did. On this fateful day she had a craving for Little Caesar's breadsticks and she gave me exact change to pay for it, so off I went. Upon arriving I paid for the food and was asked if I wanted dipping sauce at an extra charge. My Manager had given exact change so I assumed she ordered what she wanted and declined their saucy offer.  

After getting back and delivering her food, she quickly discovered that there was no dipping sauce and began to question me about it rather aggressively, as if I had plotted against her in some form or fashion. I explained that she gave exact change and I had no money on me to cover the additional expense. At this point she began to explain to me how stupid I was and pointed out that her boyfriend was a big, tough guy who could kick my ass. I don't recall exactly what I said but I know it wasn't improper for the workplace. Regardless, she felt the appropriate retort was to grab movie cases from the shelf and begin throwing them at me. Thankfully, I was rather spry in my youth so I was able to dodge the projectile attacks with only minimal effort. Unfortunately, I was also rather shortsighted in my youth so I began throwing movie cases back at her in response to her unprovoked assault. I was asked to leave shortly thereafter, and was fired via a telephone call that evening. I learned from a former co-worker that she, too, was let go following the incident when the District Manager reviewed the surveillance tape.  

In fairness, I was a terrible employee and deserved to be fired for a host of other reasons that I won't get into here. &&""For the last time, our movies are organized alphabetically by year of release. Its not rocket science folks."" -BB twitter

Which means in order to find a movie you have to know two pieces of information instead of only one, the name. Needless to say, it makes it makes it more difficult to find the movie you're looking for. &&The idea is that they are organized by the *spelling* of the year of release.  So a movie released in ""Nineteen-nintety one"" is before those released in ""Two thousand two,"" but after those released in ""Nineteen ninety six.""

Talking to my buddies who have been in GS management for 15+ years brings back so many memories of watching RS burn itself to the ground. &&They seemed so cool and laid back in the 90s. I interviewed with them in 2005 or so and they had me competing with other applicants to ""sell"" bullshit in the room like tv remotes. They said most of the job was trying to sell people on plans and services and shit that I didn't even know blockbuster did.

It was like a room full of shitty 19 year old used car salesmen.&&They spent three years chasing me down for just under $0.80&&Oh man I worked at a Hollywood Video towards the end of the video rental days. 

It had long since stopped being about the movies. 

The Assholes in Suits really thought they could save a video rental store by pushing magazine subscriptions like a youth sports team or something. 

Then the candy and soda mark ups came and we were pushed to basically force people to buy 8 dollar 16oz sodas. 

Then the bullshit punishments started. Oh you didn't sell 100 subscriptions to Motherhood Magazine? Nevermind we slashed your hours already and you only did 60 transactions all week, here have more slashed hours.  

I eventually quit (which was their goal I'm sure) when I hit 6 hours a week spread over 4 days. No shit 2 days of 2 hours and 2 days of 1 hour each. 
Insane. &&Haha yeah they were the worst. I worked at Blockbuster for 2-3 years and I remember as we were sinking (and it was obvious) they had new t-shirts printed like 6-7 times with some stupid new initiative. Like we are clearly spiraling and they are over here wasting money on new tshirts noone cares about.&&I worked there when I was 19. I was told to wear khaki pants. I did. I was told they were inappropriate because they were not men's pleated khaki's (Dockers) but women's slacks that I'd still at this point in my career consider appropriate for business professional setting. I'm female.&&Funnily enough, the same thing that happened to Blockbuster may happen to GS soon.&&When did it go to shit?  I worked for Software Etc., one of its precursors, back in the Neostar era and at least the two stores I worked at (on opposite coasts) were decent places to work.

Of course, back then it wasn't exclusively a games store.  I was there during the period when it started to go that way and the clientele definitely shifted.  We had console games on the right, everything else on the left, and there was a huge difference in the people who browsed one side of the store vs the other.

Electronics Boutique (later EB Games) was one of our main competitors but we didn't have them locally so I didn't see much of them.  What little I did see gave me more of a Gamestop vibe and I assumed that's where the culture came from.&&I worked at BB in Dallas for years. It was one of the most fun jobs I have ever had but corporate BB was a total shit hole. They did not care AT ALL about the ideas we had to bring in more business. It sucks because their answer to netflix was actually really fucking good.
It was the same online delivery service and you could return movies through the mail BUT if you brought the movie back to the store we would mail it back for you and you also get a free movie at the store. Shit was dope and no one gave a shit at all.

&&I stopped going to Gamestop because I don't want to spend 20 minutes telling the employee I don't want to sign up for shit or pre-order games I didn't come to buy. So fking pushy every time I have ever been to one. &&I thought it meant all the movies were organized into sections based on the year of release and then organized alphabetically within each year &&Like your navy jeans&&Love the pizza and movie model. Marcos pizza is incredible &&Huh my city isn't low income and we have a family video. We are a college town though so that probably makes sense.&&There are a couple in the Pittsburgh area still. My buddy used to work there and told me a big reason they're still in business is because they own the building and not just lease it. There have been ones that have closed but they then lease the building to the new business. I'm going to delve deeper on this now to see if I'm just talking out of my ass.&&You know it's gonna be them flamin hots&&[deleted]&&Ellipsis cost less in data than characters it seems. &&I still got my blockbuster polos lmk lol&&>  We may not be what we used to be but neither is Michael Jordan.&&""No one has said anything about our new mulch.""

She said, ""No...just with you.""&&Look at you, mister read more than twelve&&That should really be yourmomjoke.exe  
  
Mom Joke just made me start thinking about what a Mom version of a Dad Joke would be, and given my parents... it would be a very flat attempt at a dad joke.

Being in my 30s now, its a lot like being a kid again. Plus they run awesome promotions all the time like buy a large pizza, get a free movie or something. It's a great place. I'm glad they're making it. &&The dead cat bounce of nearly every blockbuster closing probably helps. &&They have 777 stores still open?! Wow. And I thought it was interesting that Blockbuster still maintained a few stores.. &&My city (Frisco,Tx) has several Family Videos and it shocked me when I moved here that they were still in business. Across the street is a new subdivision with ""houses from the 400s to 1,000,000"". I always thought it was a front of some kind but they do have a full plaza so I guess the real estate things makes sense. &&That one is one of my favorites.

I worked there for a few years, too, and I went out of my way to find films for people that were really hard to get a hold of otherwise. Order them from the internet from different countries and stuff, bring them into stock...

I had fun working there, to be honest. I worked at one of the busiest stores in the company though, so I got my ass handed to me often enough busyness-wise.&&My husband is, yes. Funny how that single statement screams military lol.&&That's the Blockbuster I normally go to.   That town is weird and the mall is amazing, it has five stores, one of which is a Safeway, and it's clean but nothing has been updated since the 70's so it looks like a tiny Dawn of the Dead mall.  &&TO be fair, that's not the worst thing someone working for Subway has ever done...&&There's a creepy Dairy Queen like that near me too. We always thought it was weird he only hired hot high school girls, and when my ex got hired there she confirmed the guy was insanely creepy&&That's...bizarre. You could argue he's sexist against both sexes since apparently he treats them both like crap.&&That's really weird. Is he trying to turn it into like a Hooters kind of place? Because Subway is not a Hooters kind of place.&&I don't know what that fool is talking about? The only good parts of the movie where the boob parts.

And when the guy hits the propeller and won't stop spinning.  &&Propeller Guy is hands down the best part of the movie. Whoever put that sound effect in deserved an Oscar. &&You mean this part?  https://youtu.be/XKaFjCUH5DM&&I saw it in Edinburgh, in a cinema that had a somewhat urban clientele (ie they were rough as fuck).  Place was packed out, we sat through the whole three hours, and finally Jack and Rose are floating around in the water and it's all getting very emotional.

""This is a right load ae shite eh?""&&That was 15 years ago when I was still in school.  I've had 3 jobs since (I'm still at the 3rd).  I left all of them voluntarily and on amicable terms.  &&I worked at Blockbuster in 99/00.  Being able to name a movie based on the littlest of information was great.  I had someone call and ask for the movie with the song that went ""uh.. dang dang daang ding.""  It was Deliverance and he was trying to sing dueling banjos.

Trying to sell Dish and rental packages was ridiculous. I felt like all we did was harass the few customers we had left. &&It's true.  The cashiers all used to be nerdy guys who could be counted on to answer literally any question you ever had, and otherwise stood quietly behind the counter reading or watching T.V.

I think people who lived through that era will eventually have a bit of nostalgic thirst kick in and wouldn't mind going out to rent movies from time to time.

The electronics components were definitely the most indispensable part of them, but they were also a great stop for random audio components or even some basic computer components like in a pinch. They were perfect for ""oh shit, I forgot to buy this"" when doing a project. They were the 7/11 of electronics stores.

They were really struggling with an identity and market that could keep them afloat near the end though. I remember about 5-10 years ago when they practically turned into a cell phone store. It was basically the only thing earning them a profit. I actually did buy A Samsung Galaxy S3 there after they started re-adding regular electronics. At $100 less than the AT&T next door no less. Granted I had to go to the AT&T next door to get them to validate my upgrade. It was kinda weird. &&[deleted]&&Seriously RadioShack of the past sounds awesome. I'm a big DIYer and electronics nerd and I've only walked into a RadioShack once in my adult life.

The director is a former stunt man and stunt coordinator himself too, so he must feel especially awful. &&That's so sad. Everytime I head about deadpool everyone is so happy and excited and it must have been so cool to be a part of it and now for this lady it ends in such tragedy. I feel so sorry for the family and friends. What a nightmare.&&Man, that sucks. No matter how much work you put into it, something can always go wrong.&&It's very sad when anyone loses their life while on a job. Hopefully they'll release more information about what actually went wrong on the stunt so that safety precautions can be taken on any similar stunts in this movie or others.&&A friend of mine was on set, she said she was pretty certain the actor had died the moment it happened, take that as you will :(

Coincidentally the film was shooting today at a location where two men were run over by a bus, one killed, just yesterday. My brother, who also drives a bus, was first on the scene yesterday and arrived back at this same corner as this woman was being loaded into the ambulance. 

A terrible 24 hours for sure...

Edit: not ""ironically""&&How do actors and producers continue with a scene after something like this? Do they retake the scene with another stuntman? Do they trash the scene? It would suck to be the stuntman to have to attempt something someone else just died doing.&&To all who ask ""why is it so special that actors do their own stunts?"" This is why. Even trained professionals can die in a freak accident.&&Stunt performers are some of the most underappreciated performers of our time.

If they do their job perfectly, you never know they were involved...&&Those who know more about film production than I do, how rare is it for stunt performers to die during production?&&Being a stunt driver is no joke, these people literally put their lives on the line for our entertainment. I'll make sure I remember her when I'm watching Deadpool 2.&&I'm 98% sure it was Dominos stunt double too.&&This just makes it all the more mind-blowing to me that no one was killed on the set of Fury Road&&Some [photos](http://imgur.com/a/4rxAz) from a group i am in.&&[This ad placement though...](https://i.redd.it/18k7l4q48rfz.jpg)
&&[deleted]&&All the people who are saying that they're boycotting this movie, you are fucking morons. Im sure that the stunt double would be very happy that people are purposefully not going to see the movie that she died in the production of. I know that if i died on set of a movie I'd want that movie to make a shit ton of money&&I understand that stunt work is dangerous, but it seems to me that this is happening with more frequency lately: this, The Walking Dead, Resident Evil, even yesterday's minor accident in Mission Impossible coming to mind. I just hope that studios aren't penny-pinching stunt safety in these movies now. :(&&[deleted]&&>She was loaded into an Advanced Life Support ambulance, which remained at the scene for about 45 minutes before driving off without its lights or sirens activated.

We're heartbroken, shocked and devastated... but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment. My heart pours out to them -- along with each and every person she touched in this world.&&Whoa, I read this as student driver. I couldn't understand why people were commenting things the way they were.

That's sad. There was a man this summer who was a stunt man that passed away too. 

A bit off topic but I wonder how skewed compensation is between actors and stunt actors? It'd be a bit more easier knowing that the surviving family is taken care of after such a unfortunate event.&&Deadpool being the kind of movie that it is, he could literally look at the camera and say, ""this one's for you *stunt woman's name*"" and do the trick&&Aw man. Terrible for them and their family. And shitty for the actors and crew. Must feel awful when making a movie leads to a tragic death. They all clearly love what they're doing but there must be some survivor's guilt I'd imagine. RIP stunt driver!&&RIP to this person, and I hope they get the tribute and recognition they deserve when this movie comes out for their hard work and dedication to their craft.&&Oh no.... Condolences to the cast and the family&&Goddammit. It's heartbreaking. Life is risky and people die young all the time, but the people who work on movies love their craft and do everything they can to make things safe on set. And why? Because it's all in fun. Making big stupid Hollywood movies is just a celebration of life and fun and art, which makes it all the more tragic when something like this happens. 

My heart goes out to this young woman's family who must be devastated. This isn't about movies anymore, it's about the hard, implacable facts of life, and I'm sorry that something so fun has suddenly turned into something so awful.

But I also wanted to be sure to say - as a movie fan, to this stuntwoman - thank you. Thank you for pouring your heart and soul into your craft in order to entertain all of us, to make us laugh, to make us go *holy fucking shit that was amazing!* with your incredible stunts, and for taking our minds off of our own lives and our worries for just a little while. You died doing what you loved, and all of us love what you did. Your art was our joy. And that counts for a lot. So thank you.&&This was the 2nd death in the same area in two days. I work at the restaurant in the square they were filming and saw it happen this morning, and was working when the first accident happened yesterday morning. It's really tragic and even worse that it is the second accident in two days. Thoughts go out to everyone affected by this.&&She was doing her 4th take of riding a motorcycle down a small set of stairs at the convention centre, which she was then supposed to accelerate away from. She lost control and went head first into the glass at the Shaw tower, and sadly was not wearing a helmet. 

Source: I'm a first responder for downtown Vancouver and spoke to a colleague who attended to her. &&Reports state that 2 ambulances arrived and eventually left scene without using their lights. This means that she was either obviously dead (brain matter exposed, decapitation, transsection, etc) or they performed CPR and got a pronouncement from a doctor (via cellphone) to terminate the resuscitation (as she was probably asystole and non-viable). The paramedics would have left the body on scene unless the coroner gave them permission to transport the body to the morgue. 

So sad to see see this. I'm sure we will see some sort of tribute in the credits for this lady. &&Stuntmen and women are the unsung heroes of the movie industry. They are literally putting their health and lives on the line for our entertainment and that I believe is very worthy of respect.  &&From what I heard, the actor's costume was such that the stunt driver couldn't wear adequate safety protection. Stunt people are trained for dangerous acts, but I think that costumes etc should be designed with protection in mind; not a cute hairdo or whatever.&&Expect a dedication once the credits rolls&&Jesus, crazy stuff is happening in Coal Harbour lately. Yesterday a bus tried to jump a curb and ran over three people and killed one.&&Thoughts and prayers go out to her family.

""Cute. well how about this, go throw yourself off that balcony""

&&I empathize for the families and everyone involved in this tragedy. I hope they include a dedication in to the film in memory of the stunt driver. Yes there's inherent risk with a job like this but nobody goes to work expecting to die.&&Yeah, that was my thought process. Deadpool is such a playful franchise, even when it's violent. It must really be hard to smile on the set after something like this.&&Looks like it was a motorcycle accident, which is a lot harder to make safe than other driving stunts. All it takes is a quick slip up and your body can fly into something that kills you. Really sad, but looks like it wasn't a massive mistake by the stunt crew or something, just the inherent danger of using a motorcycle.  &&Yeah, I'm honestly surprised I don't hear more about stunt people getting seriously hurt.

They must be doing a hell of a job with planning and safety considering there aren't that many accidents that I hear about.&&Hijacking your top comment. 
TL;DR
Female motorcycle stunt driver lost control and drove across Jack Poole Plaza and into an office window in Shaw Tower

She was loaded into an Advanced Life Support ambulance, which remained at the scene for about 45 minutes before driving off without its lights or sirens activated.&&Even if the audience forgets someone lost their life filming this movie, all the people who worked on it won't.&&Yeah, I wonder if they have a stunt 'bible' showing all the things that have gone wrong, or common things to look for?  Best practices, and the like.&&My first assumption was the fact that we (Vancouver) just got our first rainfall in ages, which tends to bring the oil on the street up. Makes everything very slick.

But as I said, just my initial assumption. 

I work up the street and didn't even hear a commotion... Very sad for the whole crew. &&My sister was on set and from what I've heard she just lost control of the bike and went through the Starbucks window. She just flew in from new York yesterday. &&It is likely she had some sort of life present. At least here in Va its policy to stabilize the patient before transport. I know it seems weird, but the best I can figure is its for the safety of the patient and crew. I had seen this happen at a mud bog a few years ago. A guy in the stands had a heart attack like 20 feet from where we were at. EMT was already on site too but they gave him cpr for every bit of 10 minutes before loading him into the ambulance.&&I'm a medic and what caught my eye was that (according to the article and photo captions) she was loaded into the ambulance which then didn't move for 45 minutes, and when it did there were no lights or sirens. That can be either a very *good* or very *bad* sign. Knowing the outcome now it seems likely they pronounced her death before even leaving the scene.&&Yeah, going through a glass window on a motorcycle, I don't think you have to be very creative to figure out the cause of death.

I feel awful for her family, and the people on the set. Stunt work is truly an underappreciated profession.&&>A friend of mine was on set, she said she was pretty certain the actor had died the moment it happened

That's what I gathered from the article as well. They didn't explicitly state it, but the sentence where the ambulance drove away without lights or sirens pretty much means they had already declared her dead.

In my jurisdiction, lights/sirens are only run for code red and code blue. Code green, yellow, and black are run silently.&&I work for the company involved  in yesterday's incident. Not a good day. Not a good day at all.&&I think it varies by set. I remember hearing in the past about whole scenes that were cut from movies because of accidents. I think other times the view is that the stuntman would have wanted to see the stunt in the movie, so they re-group, get it done and do a tribute to the person who was hurt/died in the credits. Honestly, I can see going either way with it. &&[deleted]&&I read that it was the 5th take or runthrough for this particular scene.&&I don't know but if I died doing a stunt they better keep the scene in the movie!&&I always thought Tom Cruise was so badass for doing his own stunts until I saw this Danny Trejo quote about why he doesn't do his own: 

>A stunt guy pads up and goes through a wall. That’s his profession. Every time the profession’s mixed, I don’t want to risk 80 people’s jobs just so I can say I have big nuts. I don’t want to say that. 

Then I realized it's pretty foolish and selfish to insist on doing it yourself.

Edit: This is officially the dumbest Reddit argument I've ever been in.&&Dont they take 10x times the precautions when the actors themselves do the stunts though?&&Its also usually way more expensive (at least insurance wise) if a star/essential element wants to do risky stunts. &&Who's asking that? Lmfaoo&&They get paid pretty damn well. &&>If they do their job perfectly, you never know they were involved...

Academy needs a category for best stunt team&&[Here's a list from wikipedia. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_and_television_accidents) Definitely not the first accident of its kind, but it's far from common. Very unfortunate. &&Read the story of the two kids who were decapitated on the set of the Twilight Zone Movie in the 80s.&&Camera crew out number stunt professional deaths by 4:1. Operating the camera is oddly more dangerous. Think it's due to lack of safety and equipment.&&Hopefully they dedicate the movie in her honor or something matching of her sacrifice in making it&&I am pretty sure they put their life on the line for a pay check &&Make sure to yell. ""Oooh this is where that one girl died!"" really loud when her scene come sup so everyone in the theater also remembers. &&Me too... They've been filming Domino on a Ducati.&&I thought this was some in-movie pizza advertising for a second...

&&Yes.  This.  

It was a motocross driver who has never worked in stunts before driving down a staircase as Domino... and because they wanted to see the afro, there was no helmet on the rider. &&It's mind blowing how few deaths happen to stunties, but the safety precautions these days are nothing to be scoffed at. They take it VERY seriously. No studio wants a stunt man or woman death, not even for the sake of their studio face but because there are real people behind these movies. No one wants people to die. 

[I worked in LAAX, Switzerland on this production.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWOANXNGrZc) The amount of prep that went into it was astronomical and he still crashes, but lives due to all the safety we put into place. Skip to 7:30. &&It was a desert, not a lot of things to crash on =/&&I work with him, he took this from the Shaw towers. Sad.&&Damn, that's comically unfortunate&&Is it happening more frequently, or being reported more often?&&But there's way more times where it doesn't happen. You just hear about the bad ones. &&I think it's more that audiences require more intense stunts to be wowed or impressed now, so this has led studios to create bigger and badder stunts to compensate.&&Don't forget the lead actor of the Maze Runner series got pretty seriously injured on set. &&It's not penny pinching stunt safety it's just penny pinching in general. The reason Vancouver gets so many films and tv shows is they are extraordinarily talented crew members but also the producers say they can get it done in a certain time frame which gets Vancouver crews the show but puts immense pressure on everyone to work as fast as possible (both to finish on time and not hold up production on an individual level). Stunts are always extensively rehearsed but there are always variables that can be unaccounted for as well as human error. You're still driving a car through a building, lighting yourself on fire or some other crazy shit, it's easy to think because of all the safety protocols that nothing can go wrong but it is a very dangerous job- being a film technician in general. &&I'd like to assume stunt folks do better than they ever have, it's just that the Internet era has allowed us to hear about it more.


Same with racial violence, it's going to improve if we keep talking about it, and it's incredible how much has happened behind the scenes.&&it was a woman.&&I saw someone say that awarding stuntspeople will start a wave of stuntpeople who will start to perform increasingly dangerous & reckless stunts to get the awards&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Pardon my ignorance but what is second unit? I love film production and always want to know more.&&I bet he'll feel guilty that he wasn't there, and that maybe he could have prevented it if he was.&&Kvothe: Okay!&&I can't imagine how they would resume this. It's not like they pick a new stunt person and just continue. I know it'll continue, but I can't see how, I'd feel rather uncomfortable just showing up for work after this. &&>All it takes is a quick slip up and your body can fly into something that kills you.

Or you could fly into something and get serious/permanent injuries for the rest of your life. You have to be a real badass to do stunts like that.&&Go to r/WatchPeopleDie.  I ride, but the things really are death machines.&&If it's who I think it was and she was outfitted like she was for last weeks motorcycle stunts they did, then it was even more dangerous because she was only wearing the Domino costume, no helmet. :(

Edit: Looks like it was a different person than the one last week, so I don't know the outfit situation.&&This is the 2nd serious motorcycle stunt to go wrong in the last year. I wouldn't be surprised if they start getting some stricter rules regarding bike stunts soon.&&Here's a [gif](http://i.imgur.com/wFWXbJE.gifv) of Tom Cruise faling a motorcycle stunt for oblivion. He insist to do many of the stunts him self. &&This is only the second time I've heard of a huge issue.  Look up Olivia Jackson and her injuries from a Resident Evil accident... 

>2 weeks in a coma, brain bleed, brain swelling, severed main artery in the neck, crushed & degloved face, several broken ribs, paralyzed arm, shattered scapula, broken clavicle, broken humerus, broken radius & ulna, with an open wound and a 7.5 piece of bone missing, amputated thumb, torn fingers, 5 nerves torn out of the spinal cord

Makes you wonder, if Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, and Jackie Chan all starred in a movie fight... who would win? 

The audience.
&&A bus went off the road the day before in Downtown. Left one person dead and several injured.
&&I was working in Shaw tower when this happened, looks like she just lost control. Long skid mark right before she hit the window. Prop guns were scattered on the road. Knew it was not good when the crew starting packing up. &&actually, rain washes the oil off of the road. But initially, like first 15 min of a downpour, it is very dangerously slick like you say.&&what oil is this? I'm confused&&Have to shock the heart into a stable rhythm before you transport, otherwise there's no point in transporting.  To the hospital at least.

source:  they worked on my mom for something like 20 minutes before they finally (somehow) got a stable rhythm and the worst week of my life ensued.

edit:  thanks for the well-wishes everyone, but sadly that story didn't have a happy ending, my mom basically spent a week in the hospital on life support before the family agreed to withdraw care.  ~14 minutes between heart attack and EMS arriving to the house, it was already a foregone conclusion.  Frankly it's incredible EMS was able to get a steady pulse at all.&&Driving off with lights off is a sign of loss of life; there's no longer any reason to hurry. I've seen it. &&News article said the ambulance left without lights/siren on, guessing they were just transporting the body at that point?

It also said she crashed into a window on a motorcycle, not hard to imagine the damage a thick pane of glass could do to someone :/&&Well given the cause of injury, I think you can narrow it down to a very bad sign. I don't think any of the best possible outcomes of this is to casually make your way to the hospital.&&First movie, motocross rider. And no helmet right into a massive glass window that fell on her. Reading between the lines it was massive loss of blood.&&I guess I am not very creative. I mean no disrespect, just ignorant here, but what do you think the ""cause"" of death would be then? To me, I feel driving a motorcycle through a glass window means the glass breaks and you just go right through. It's not like a wall or another car where there is a sudden stop. I would assume that the bike hit the glass before she did, so there wouldn't be to much of an impact to her body. Plus, being a movie set which is full of regulations, I'd assume the driver would have the highest level of body protection to protect against glass slicing her open.

Obviously there is something here that I am missing and your comment seemed the best to reply to to help show me what it is.

It's a terrible accident and I'm very sorry to hear that it happened.&&Can someone inform me what the different codes mean? &&I'm pretty sure if I died accomplishing something, my ghost would be pissed if they threw away the thing that I died for.&&It seems pretty coldhearted, but life goes on. They might take a day off out of respect, but money is being wasted every moment that they aren't shooting.&&Man, I would feel so guilty as the director who decided takes 1-4 werent good enough&&Well, when it's well executed, the end result of an actor doing his own stunts can make the movie that much better or genuine. When it's poorly executed, actors run the risk of shutting down an entire movie set for days, weeks, months or entirely in worst case scenarios.&&> Then I realized it's pretty foolish and selfish to insist on doing it yourself.

Until you realize that Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves do their own stunts because they're not only interested in learning the skills, but are also legitimately some of the best on set at the stunts

> Meanwhile, in December last year Tom opened up about doing his own stunts while appearing on The Graham Norton Show. 

> 'People do say no, but as an actor you bring everything, physically and emotionally, to a character,' he said. 'I’m able to do them (stunts). **I’ve trained for 30 years doing things like that.'**.

His gun training in Collateral [is so quick that it's taught in police academies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3mkYDTRwgw). 1.3 seconds, tactical gun draw. 

Keanu Reeves is also [amazing at shredding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpr8oqyjKIc).

Edit: Robert Downey Jr practices Chinese martial arts, which is why he's so agile in the Sherlock series.&&Depends if they are trained as well. Tom Cruise is as well prepared as the pros. Danny Trejo is talking about himself, not trained in the stuff, doing stunts&&Didnt Tom Cruise just get hurt yesterday filming for MI:6 during a stunt gone wrong?&&Especially when your multi million dollar face is on the line. *Thousands* of work-hours wasted with a chance of most, if not all of them, not getting paid for.

EDIT: I just figured it out. Tom Cruise's ~~cult~~ church promises him to be reborn with his old memories. I bet he expects to be an actor *forever*.&&I think it's drastic to say it's foolish and selfish. There is merit to both arguments; Cruise's approach means a more authentic viewing experience, but I guess it's nice knowing that stunt people are getting paid with Trejo's argument. That logic can be used for anything though; there are plenty of writer/director/producers who take multiple roles when one of them could have gone to an up and comer. &&For me, I can appreciate that Cruise does his own stunts. For me, when I see the main character jump on a motorcycle and flip down the extra dark visor, it takes me out of the movie because I know instantly that after the next cut, it's a stunt driver.

IE:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdIT7UPmH0g

Esp at ~1:34, Cruise's knee brushes the ground and he checks on it, but stays in the scene to keep going. That is just professionalism.

Compare to Daniel Craig in 007
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHRLX8jRjq8
Not saying Craig is lame, or anything, but it's always dark on his face or when he gets close the camera, it actually pans down away from his face. 

With Cruise actually on the bike with closeups, it provides much more entertainment value.&&The point is beaten to death by now I'm sure but I would argue that Tom Cruise doing his own stunts is not taking away too many people's jobs. The amount of people he hires as stunt trainers or consultants is probably comparable to a movie hiring a stuntman. &&Jackie Chan has always done his own stunts, IIRC and he's done some crazy shit down the years!&&You could argue that Tom Cruise has added stuntman to his profession then. He does everything.

Definitely, a pure actor shouldn't perform stunts. A stuntman probably isn't as good as an actor. But if somebody is willing to learn both, why stop them?&&Nah, he's just a pussy.&&Sounds nice but tom cruise doesn't owe any one jobs. He likes the thrill and it creates a better product.  Why can't he do what he likes?&&What if they enjoy doing their own stunts as much as acting. We're just gonna completely overlook that angle? &&Meh, Jackie Chan's career is based on him doing his own stunts. It's what makes him even more special. Idk if I'd call it selfish just because you want to better your career.&&Sometimes yes, sometimes no. But even with the 10x precautions, an actor is also 10x more likely to make a mistake that a trained professional would.&&Do they? I don't think I've ever asked or anything, I figured it was pretty run of the mill type deal, but do you have like an estimate? They deserve it though! Shit is no fucking joke.&&They very deliberately don't so as not to encourage people to one up each other to dangerous levels.&&>  Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2017). Stunt double Olivia Jackson was severely injured in a motorcycle accident on set in South Africa in September 2015, leaving her in a medically-induced coma for two weeks. During a high-speed motorcycle chase, she collided with a camera arm. **Among Jackson's injuries were cerebral trauma, a crushed and degloved face, a severed artery in her neck, a paralyzed arm, several broken ribs, a shattered scapula, a broken clavicle, torn fingers with a thumb that needed to be amputated, and five nerves torn out of her spinal cord**. Her paralyzed left arm was amputated in June 2016. Days after Jackson's accident, crew member Ricardo Cornelius** was crushed to death** by a Hummer H1 that slid off a platform he was operating.


What the fuck was going on in this movie set.&&""They Died with Their Boots On (1941). Three horsemen perished during the cavalry charge, one of whom was extra Jack Budlong, whose horse tripped as he rode alongside Errol Flynn. As he fell forward, he had the foresight to toss his sword ahead of him. Unfortunately, it landed handle down and stuck in place. Budlong was impaled on his own sword, and died in a Los Angeles hospital a few hours later.""

That sucks&&>Catch-22 (1970). Second unit director John Jordan was killed when he was sucked out of a B-25 Mitchell while filming a bombing scene. He refused to wear a safety harness while the plane was in flight.[43]

Holy fuck.&&holy fuck what a fascinating list.


 On the set of a publicity shoot that took place while filming, actor and comedian Harold Lloyd picked up what he thought was a prop bomb with the fuse lit but realized too late the bomb was real. It detonated, blowing off the thumb and first finger of his right hand and also temporarily blinding him. For the rest of his career, Lloyd concealed his missing fingers with a prosthetic glove

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WHY WOULD THERE BE A REAL BOMB WHAT&&I'm sure they will. It has to be so devastating to the cast and crew; you really get close fast in those situations even if you don't like each other. &&/r/ShittyLifeProTips &&That's the question.  In TV Wrestling (like WWE) it seems like Wrestlers are getting injured a LOT more than they used to, but I wonder how much of it is that WWE is finally allowing them to 'be injured' and take time off vs ignoring it and keeping on working.

It was somber for weeks after. Hell, I was feeling it yesterday while I was working. It lingers. Furthermore, if she was dressed like a character, imagine how it must feel talking to an actress in the same makeup.

After a few hours of rain, or once the pavement is dry (as it has been since yesterday) it doesn't affect the road condition.

Source: Ride a motorcycle and am from Vancouver. Roads were fine on my way to work this morning.&&Oil dripping from cars is a pretty common thing to watch out for on a motorcycle - even a small puddle can cause havoc from losing traction.  That is why you will rarely see someone ride in the middle of the lane, that is where the oil will be.&&How did you get through it? My mum died 2 months ago from arythmia followed by a stroke. The ambulance guys worked on her 20 minutes before they declared her dead. She raised my sister and me as a single parent so it has hit us hard. &&Nah, they bring patients without a pulse to our trauma center all the time. The major factor for determining transport is how long a person is pusleless. Sorry to hear about your mom's ordeal; hope she made a full recovery. &&Correct. Most sops state to work the patient on screen until you get a rhythm back. Unlrss certain circumstances like drowning or safety.  Studies show cpr in a moving ambulance isnt as good as staying still. And any immediate drugs and shocking medics can do in the field. &&As an EMT I would tell you not to read much into the status of a patient based on a set of lights being on or off.  Too many variables at play with both the pt and the crew to boil down to a yes / no.  

I almost always turn lights off when I enter a free flowing highway.  An ambulance can't safely travel much faster than normal fast lane flow and adding lights only makes everyone (pt, crew, other drivers) more stressed and yields nothing positive for pt outcome. One time we were transporting an older gentileman who had a stroke and as we entered the interstate I turned the lights off.  He was stable and we left them off.  Turns out his wife was following us to the hospital and made the same assumption on the entrance ramp that you did.  She came flying up to our rig in full melt down panic thinking he had passed on the way there.   Ever since then I five a fast ""if your going to follow me"" speech to family before taking off.  ""We are going to __ hospital. Don't follow me, take your time and don't turn yourself into a 2nd patient.  It will be some time before the ER staff lets you back to see them or has any news"".  &&Wow that's a powerful mental image I just got from your comment.&&I don't know what happened or what the Byeuji thinks happened. But glass is sharp. Going through a glass pane in real life is not like in the movies, you don't just crash through as it shatters into a million pieces. It basically just turns into a wall of knives. 

I knew a kid who just punched through a window on accident, he was seriously injured and almost lost his hand as a result.&&Yup! I'll try to be fairly simple in the explanation.

Green - ""Walking wounded"" aka ""Why are you even in the ambulance?"" You really could just drive yourself as a code green, if necessary.

Yellow - Pretty decent amount of injuries, but nothing immediately life-threatening. In my experience, this is the most common triage level.

Red - You're pretty messed up. Not dead yet, but that could change pretty quickly without immediate intervention. Need to get you to the hospital fast.

Blue - You're basically dead. Generally no heart-beat or respiration, but there is a chance of resuscitation. 

Black - Dead with no chance of resuscitation. Common examples of symptoms in the field include headlessness, rigor mortis,  burnt to a crisp, decomposition, or lack of vital signs following blunt force trauma.

Bonus: Code orange - mental health.

Disclaimer: Codes and qualifiers will vary by jurisdiction.&&Im just thinking about the XXX bridge scene where the stuntman died and they kept the original footage. He died for the shot, its his legacy. Use it.&&Yeah, Jackie Chan has always done his, what is really important is that the actor have the skills to pull it off. I don't care too much if an actor does or doesn't, just that nobody is killed trying to entertain me.&&As this incident shows, even when it's supposedly well executed and handled by professionals, something can still go terribly wrong. No plan is perfect.&&[deleted]&&Exactly. I'm tired of seeing this repeated, where as a reaction to someone thinking its cool, people shit on actors like Tom Cruise for doing their own stunts. It's the way he wants to work, and the movies may gain from it or not depending on your own opinions. But just because someone else doing it results in job security for them and others, doesn't mean its the only valid way to do it. 

A circus act would be safer if the knife juggler let someone else ride the unicycle. And there'd be one more employed unicyclist. &&>Keanu Reeves is also amazing at *[insert anything here]*&&Keanu Reeves stunts: shooting

Tom Cruise has been doing his own stunts for about thirty years now, he's as experienced as any stuntman out there.&&I know a stunty who works in the Vancouver film-industry. He makes 200k/year working part time.&&Base pay is near a grand for a day. Most performers make more though depending on the stunt, how many times they have to do it, and if their doubling. Now, keep in mind you get that pay no matter how long you're there and if they use you or not. I've been on sets where they brought in 6 stunts performers and used 2. The other 4 hung around for half the day then bounced. They still get paid for the full day. I've heard a story from a stunt guy who claimed he was paid $250k to jump a motorcycle through cars of a moving train. They did the scene, director came over and said it was great, but they wanted one more. Guy got another $250k. 



I worked on this scene. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0cMOeLWkec

The guys zip-lining at 1:05 made $3k a day. The guy rappelling made $1500 a day if I remember correctly. We filmed that for 7 days straight. &&You get alot for certain stunts.

I wonder if stunt-actors are a part of any union? If so, I'm sure the union would force the studio to include an insurance rider in the contract - then again, I'd guess stunt actors are probably not the type to have a lot of dependants outside of a spouse, so maybe they dgaf? Tragic, either way.&&Ah, cool stuff. Thanks for the info!!&&100% this. At my restaurant we had a young guy who was working his way to be a sous chef. He was a tough guy but worked hard and stayed professional. He always reigned in the rowdier cooks and helped them to take their jobs and development more seriously. He was an amazing trainer. Then he didn't show up for a shift and found out the next day that he passed away while taking a nap. He had a heart murmur and ended up having a heart attack in his sleep. At 27 years old.

The next few months were incredibly hard on the cooks he had formed tight personal and professional relationships with. I've never seen so many tough people cry as in the first week after we heard of his passing. It's now two years later, and though I don't manage that restaurant anymore, I know that three of those cooks are now sous, and one is on the track to be promoted. It was rough, but you work harder because it's what they would want.&&Yes, exactly this! Not returning would be throwing everything she had accomplished and had hoped to accomplish with this set in the figurative trash bin. Appreciating her hard work and carrying it through to completion seems the only fitting tribute the cast and producing crew could possibly offer her in remembrance.&&Agree 100%! It's absolutely tragic, and I feel for the people that have to continue making the movie, it would be hard to carry on after something like this.... That said, this stunt woman chose her profession and knew the risks involved. It would dishonour her memory if they didn't finish the film and make it outstanding. &&What about the stunt person that has to fill her shoes now?

I'm into vintage racing where most of the bikes are CB350s and the like, and people go down all the time. But race tracks are designed to have sand and grass on most turns so if you go down, usually you can get up and get right back on the bike, assuming it still works. Wearing good safety gear makes a world of difference as well.&&And that's exactly it.

My father used to ride and stopped after a bird strike against his helmet which sent him off the bike, then I also have a close friend who got hit by a truck and broke his elbow. Because of this I tend to be a bit more paranoid when I see bikes around.&&I've also heard about studies that suggest that even if a driver technically should be able to see you, they will look right through you without even noticing you're there.  It has something to do with us only seeing things that we expect to see.  I can believe it too.  I live in a city with very few bicycles on the road, and I find it difficult and nerve-wracking when I have to drive in a city full of bicycles on the road.&&If everyone, in both bikes and cars, drove like the world's top 10% most attentive, defensive drivers, there would *still* be crashes.

But bikers would still die way more often because they're in the open air sitting on a tiny piece of metal, and not encased in a cage that has been made safer and safer for three generations.  
So, ""Sorry, didn't check my blind spot well enough. I'll pay for your bumper and headlight."" becomes, ""Well, I just killed a guy.""

I've been hit once, after the recovery time, it was time to rethink things. Definitely a death machine because, you can be the safest rider, but the person behind you or around you, can potentially kill you.

That's because in China, if you help a person who's had an accident, you become liable. If they choose to sue you, you'll end up having to pay for their medical expenses. So people there rather let someone die than risk having to pay for the rest of their lives.&&You shouldn't.

Without derailing the convo too much, I got involved in kink (VERY involved in kink), found a girlfriend who was into it too, got back into an unrelated hobby (tabletop gaming), started self-teaching electric guitar like I always wanted to..

There really isn't anything you can do other than take each day one at a time and just wait.  Your mind will eventually scar over the memories, both good and bad.

You'll still miss her of course.  Every day.  But you'll get better at dealing with it day by day.

Not all stuntmen are actors and not all actors are stuntmen.&&To be fair, Jackie Chan is essentially a stuntman/performer who became famous on the big screen.  He is typically as qualified if not more qualified than many of these professional stuntmen.  When you get him to headline your movie, you are essentially paying for a big name stuntman.  If you get someone else to do his stunts, I'd ask ""What's the point?"".&&to be fair, i think he started his film career as an extra/stunt man and then moved up to starring. It also helps that he, like bruce lee, has added a lot of himself to his style of Martial Arts so a double would really dilute what he wants to show on camera.&&Jackie Chan has broken lots of bones on set and had to pause filming while heals enough to move around again. My favorite is when you can see his foot in the corner of a shot with a super huge foot because he's got a cast on his foot. &&The Trejo quote really put things into perspective for me, I've never really thought about it like that. &&I've always said Ted Cruz's physique was something to marvel at.&&Pretty sure his argument wasn't that an actor doing his own stunts replaces a stuntman job, it is that an injured stuntman is tragic(but a refillable position) but an injured lead actor shuts down production and affects the livelihood of the entire crew. &&It's not like this isn't considered, either. At this point it's a known quantity, and the insurance on production accounts for Tom Cruise doing his stunts.&&Smiling?&&Keanu also does lots of his own driving stunts&&> Tom Cruise stunts: hanging off the side of an airplane hundreds of feet in the air

But why?

He's prepared for decades to be athletic, and should something go wrong, it's *his* production company, *his personal* insurance policy, and only *his* life. 

He also hires the writers and directors (through his production company) so he's really the one responsible for every insane thing in his movies. It's not like he's just another actor asked to do yet another stunt. 

He's well aware of the risks. He wants this.

But sure, let's just have ""someone else handle it"".&&>  That is some fucking commitment by Tom 

In the last Mission Impossible, he did the car driving stunts... because he was the best driver they had on set. 

&&Gotta love when timing works out like this.&&But Tom Cruise has 30 years of experience doing his own stunts and is well known for his motorcycle stunts...   
   
[Tom Cruise crashes stunt bike on set of Oblivion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWmJUAVuhPY). Notice the tuck and roll? That is a professional stuntman right there.  
&&Fair enough. I think the point they're trying to make, though, is that Danny Trejo might very well, being untrained, risk the lives and safety of other people while performing his own stunts. Whereas, Tom Cruise, being _also_ trained to perform stunts with _years and years_ of experience, is at no more risk for injury of either himself or any one else than any other stunt performer.&&It does, and Tom Cruise and the other stuntmen do these things knowing the risk. It is not like Tom Cruise is trying to bolster his self image by doing something that involves the risk. It is pretty worthless compared to what he is already. I thought it was one of his personal philosophy things . I didn't get the impression that he was deliberately trying to put down the efforts of other stuntmen. &&Damn, that's a lot!

Norcos, Oxy. Morphine You name it, whatever got them back out on the field. 

I can't find the story right now as too much other stuff comes but there was a player on the Bears in the 80s that had a van full of drugs, and tons of laughing gas. Players would come to his van before games and practice to get high and go play, and that's why we have the 85' Bears team that was so dominate. &&It's a dangerous job, but someones got to do it.

- Pillowman&&As an aside, this is or at least was a significant difference in Hong Kong and Chinese action film production.  They developed what is effectively a specialized second unit director role called an action director, who basically directed and constructed the entire action sequence with input from the main director.  This has advantages - namely, that the person creating the choreography and constructing the scene is the same, so they are tightly interlinked without odd issues that sometimes crop up especially in editing.  They'll be very cohesive if they're good at it.  

It was also faster and sometimes cheaper, since it was all one group doing it all in a row mostly in sequence, important for the skin of the teeth productions of the old days in Hong Kong - where many action sequences were created in large part on the set, with shockingly little pre-planning by Hollywood standards.  

There are disadvantages, like in very complicated shots it can actually take longer, and monopolizes the time of the leads when they're in it.  But, there's a reason Hong Kong led the way for so long in action scene construction, and the role of the action director was a major piece in that puzzle.&&Fun Fact: The LOTR movies had up to 7 units shooting.&&That's pretty cool of Mr. Radcliffe. 

Also it made me realize that Tom Cruise does most of his stunts himself. Idk if it is because he doesn't want to risk someone else's life or he just wants to be a badass, either way it's kind of crazy given he in no way needs to do them nor would anyone blame him if he didn't. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for blowing up my inbox, I now know Tom Cruise ironically just got injured doing his own stunts for the new MI film.

A few days later, my friend and I were leaving his house to go see a movie. His mom said ""you be careful driving out there"", to which he replied ""I'm not my sister. I know how to drive."" She poked her head out from whatever room she was in and said ""you may not be as bad of a driver as your sister, but I can't speak for everyone else on the road.""

If they used stuntmen, the stunts would have to be shot completely differently, considering Jackie's facial expression often sells the ridiculousness of any given situation.

The end result would be ""action stunts"" rather than ""action-comedy stunts"".&&He hasn't been doing all of his own stunts for a while now.

[Just decided to build his own](https://www.archmotorcycle.com/).&&The argument seems to be based on the economic well being of co-workers. Tom is a professional and is equally capable of performing stunts safely. The greater immediate risk is that Tom is not replaceable as an actor. If he cannot carry on his role, it's highly likely the movie stops and people loose employment. An alternate view is that Tom doing his own stunts enhances his performance, thusly creating greater opportunity for employment in the future. I guess it's just what kind of moral obligation do you have to co workers. &&And to be fair Danny Trejo is 73 and didn't start acting till his 40's, let alone whenever he stared being in a position where his character had ""stunts"", while Cruise started quite young&&Was the guy who died on the Deadpool 2 set an experienced pro?

http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/danny-trejo-slams-actors-who-5595279&&[deleted]&&You should read up on Jackie Chan. He's gone on record in many interviews as saying that, after years of doing his own stunts --- and being injured doing them --- no insurance company in the world will give him coverage. As he's grown older, despite being one hell of a Badass Grandpa at the age of 60, he understandably has stopped doing 100% of his stunts, partly because he has been told that if he falls on his head one more time it will KILL HIM, also in part because in the Hollywood system, insurance for the stars is a must and, as aforementioned, he has a little trouble with that.&&It's my understanding that most actors don't even get the chance to do all their own stunts, whether they want to or not. As the producer of the MI series, Tom Cruise is allowed to let himself do all the stunts. I think for most films it's not worth the risk or, probably more importantly, the insurance to have actors do their own stunts. Tom Cruise seems to always get his way though.&&A stunt actor got paralyzed doing Daniel Radcliffe's stunts and now gets a chunk of Harry Potter royalties form Daniel.&&https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/2ufz9o/til_that_daniel_radcliffes_stunt_double_david/?st=J6CLBLPL&sh=5a70c98a&&She still looks pretty good for someone who literally got shredded to pieces!

You go, girl!&&TIL Cinderella had stunts
&& And drunk.&&The most terrified I've ever been while driving was when I went to change lanes and a guy on a crotch rocket blew by me 20-30 mph over what everyone else was doing. Flipped me off and gunned it into a wheelie at speed on the hwy, hell I still would've felt bad if I had killed him. &&>Those are the ones that are safe. 

>If you are riding under your ability. It isn't the speed that kills you it's laligaging next to other drivers as they will always veer into your lane. 

Edit: written in sarcasm font &&Get job. Get married. Raise family. Cry at graduation. Buy bike. Hit the road. Good luck! &&Pretty much. I had my spills and so did friends. Then one crash took a friend but I kept riding. Then another friend and I kept riding. Then a third serious and fourth ugly wreck and I kept on riding more leery than the times before. I had my companies running and kids but I rode on. But then the divorce started, then the ex passed away and I was the only thing to hold the kids straight and narrow. One loose pebble, one piece of scrap off a truck or one driver more concerned about the bass from their speakers than lane awareness and I would have many kids possibly floundering and taking wrong directions in life. In a blink of an eye.

Bikes sold, will never look back.&&In my early twenties I had a Yamaha Seca XJ650YJ Turbo and loved it. The freedom, the oddball power curve of a shaft-driven top-heavy turbo-charged motorcycle. There are faster, nimbler and lighter bikes today of course but somehow they seem much safer than my Yamaha.



A few years and a few near death experiences later (drivers who didn't see me, mostly) I thanked my motorcycle for some of the most intense adventures of my life and sold it.




Every now and then on holiday I'll rent a noisy little scooter and remember the days of playing highway tag.



But I will not buy another one one.



Maybe.


Now I have too much to lose.




I think I had the best of all possible worlds. I had my motorcycle and my youth at the same time. I wised up before it killed me and regret nothing. I know what I'm missing and I'm not missing a thing.

That opening scene from Ghost Ship still fucking gets me. &&Yeah, I wasn't talking about Tom Cruise but yes it does.

Just one of the many faceless henchman to fall to Bruce Lee&&The things is, I'm pretty sure Tom Cruise takes a lot of these roles specifically for the opportunity to do his own stunts. So it's debatable whether or not he is taking away their jobs because he probably wouldn't have taken the role otherwise. Honestly it's really such a niche things to worry about. If he worked hard enough to be good at his own stunts, and is fine with the risk it entails, that is perfectly fine. No one is entitled to Tom Cruises action scenes.&&maybe tom cruise should be drafted into making more movies for the sake of other people's jobs&&I mean, they finished The Crow.&&I wonder if it's like joining any industry union. &&Yeah I mean I don't think it's insulting or reductionist to say she's pretty god damn attractive in that photo.

The arm was paralyzed and both upper and lower bone was broken with 7.5"" piece of bone *missing* from the arm in addition to an open wound related to the breaks, the fingers being torn and nerves *torn* from the spinal column.

but at the very least you neeeed a helmet, and riding shoes&&Weird how different the headline would be if it was a producer or actor. &&And Tom Cruise is always focused like a laser because he got all of those thetans out of his body!&&He puts in a shit ton of work. Its pretty well advertised for PR reasons what he does to prepare for roles. Trejo is also in his fucking 70s. Cruise isn't a spring chicken but he won't be doing the same shit in 15-20 years either. 

This is also all relative to each actor. As Trejo himself pointed out. &&Also if it is publicly known that he does his own stunts, people have some of the responsibility when taking a job with him.&&Well I think there might have been more trouble if Lee was also a producer of The Crow, but I think you make a good point.  

They also finished the Fast and Furious movie after Paul Walker died.

Makes you wonder... would it have been a ""better"" or ""worse"" scenario if he had died on set doing his own stunts?  Does anybody claim it was irresponsible for him to live his life dangerously while making a movie?  Isn't movie production something that normally pales dramatically next to other concerns when an actor dies and leaves a family behind? 

It's also not an all-or-nothing issue; it's not like actors can't select which stunts they want to do.  

Like u/stonebone4 said, it's a really dumb thing to argue about because at the end of the day... you're really just arguing about how someone chooses to live their life.  &&Well you do have to pay several thousand in dues and have recommendations and credits. &&No no no, I was having Scooby Doo fruit snacks when I decided to rebel.

They're both his profession.&&Plus, it's everybody's own choice. Maybe Tom Cruise just likes the excitement of it and likes pushing himself. Nothing wrong with that. Whatever reason he or others may have. As long as the crew he works with is ok with him doing a stunt, why even bother hating on it?

So he just drives up to a group of kids that look like they need a summer treat and starts passing out ice cream for free lol&&I think it might also be a difference in child actors for TV vs. Movies. 

Historically, child actors for tv do not grow up into huge successes. They are flung into stardom because of a single role, which has to be thrilling. At the same time, there is a ton of stress put on the child because of the looming threat of the show getting cancelled, whether they realize it's stress or not. I feel like the fame would be somewhat of an addiction and once you lose it, you always try to chase it.

I may be way off (entirely possible), but I wouldn't think child actors in movies feel the same roller coaster of fame and the associated stress. 

(Disclaimer: I have zero experience and am I strictly speaking as an outsider)

&&I usually figure most child actors get crippling drug addictions instead, though.&&Sorry not really too up to date with this stuff. What happened with Emma Watson?&&I think they may be referring to the extent that the media tried to sexualize her and paint her as a party girl at certain points, things like that. Happens way more often with female actors vs males and often has a huge negative effect on them as they get older. She came out on top despite it all. &&Souls of the dead power the Xenu ships.&&Uh huh. Dozens of people have left the church of Scientology, including influential ex-members like Marty Rathbun. Cruise, for some reason, just WON'T leave. And won't use his influence to improve the plight of some people in the church, either. He's a great actor and a consummate professional but what the actual fuck on that whole scientology thing&&True story, the audits are just scann8ng your past life memories to check for outstanding contracts still bound by scientology.&&They used to be but not anymore, got over a cool mil refunded back to them too for a church school closing.

Tom Cruise likely lacks that experience.&&If Cruise has done all his own stunts in most/all of his movies, doesn't that make ""actor/stuntman"" his profession as well?&&> Plus, it's everybody's own choice.

The difference is in who suffers for those choices.

Daniel Radcliff's stunt double becomes paralyzed, but the show goes on. A stunt double can be replaced.

But if Daniel Radcliff has become paralyzed, what then?

Now, instead of a series based off of books, imagine this happening to the headliner on a one-off movie. Movie is likely canned, and hundreds become unemployed.

I'm not trying to minimize the tragedy, mind you, just stating that I agree with Danny Trejo. This is a business, and if someone who isn't qualified to do the stunts tried to ""look tough,"" they could jeopardize the employment of hundreds of people.&&Yeah, i feel like the people who do this kind of stuff go in with the mentality of ""If I do something wrong here im gonna either die or get fucked up for the rest of my life"", whether or not is worth it for the experience is up to whoever's doing it. If Tom Cruise thinks is better to do it himself cause its fun or he doesn't want to risk someone else's life let him go for it, If Danny Trejo thinks its not worth it at all cause he prefers to not risk his life for a 5 minute stunt then thats all right too&&C'mon Carl, I didnt mean it like that :(&&Radcliff looks so young, that must be from the first movie&&T:lr hurt person gets momey cause bad feels from magic movie.&&Well I mean if they go ahead with that Furiosa spin off.

It was never a plot point or a thing her character had to get over.

Spider-Man: $617,719,400

Wonder Woman: $404,008,376

Not that it matters with far more high-budget films coming out now than previously.&&What about Batman Begins and Iron Man? I'd have thought at least one of the would have surpassed the original Spider Man?&&What’s more shocking is how terrible Suicide Squad was yet had a $133mil opening beating Deadpool by $1 mil. &&r/raimimemes is not going to be happy&&""Superhero origin film"" is a category?&&Congrats to the team and Patty Jenkins especially, I hope she gets a great deal from WB while negotiating for Wonder Woman 2, she deserves it.

I don't see why everyone's trying to make excuses to belittle this achievement, can't we just be happy for them instead?&&isnt this forgetting about Superman 1978? $300 Million US in 1978 is about 1.17 Billion, adjusting for inflation. 

edit: and with no 3D, no Imax, a drastically smaller international box office, and launched in 821 theatres, to boot &&Why is this thread so fucking contentious?&&Honest question, is this adjusted for inflation?  Spiderman in 2002 was at $403.7mil and Wonderwoman is at $404mil.  

If it isn't adjusted for inflation, then Spiderman would still be on top.

Edit: also, Wonderwoman opened at 500 more theaters than Spidey.  That would have an effect as well.&&Comparing 2017 dollars to 2002 dollars isn't entirely accurate.

Adjusted for inflation, Spider-Man (2002) made $617.7M (domestic).&&So r/movies kinda isn't happy with this. &&No hate, but I still think Batman Begins is the greatest origin film ever made.

It was semi-obscure until TDK though.&&Well deserved for Patty Jenkins and all the cast and crew. Hope the negotiations for her to return for Wonder Woman 2 come through as I'm looking forward to what she does with the character next.&&I think domestically it is the highest. Spiderman is still the highest worldwide.&&Gal Gadot is awesome and I couldn't see anyone else doing a better job as Wonder Woman and taking the crown. &&For all the people mentioning inflation, where the hell was all this during guardians or Deadpool or Dr strange or homecoming? I may prefer spiderman to wonder woman but it's had an absolutely phenomenal run, inflation or otherwise. Besides the first spiderman was released when we didn't get any superhero movies so of course it was a big event.  We've already had 4 this year with 2 more to go. &&Generally, I don't like DC superhero movies much. I liked this one though. I thought the fight scenes were lined up well and the shots were done pretty ok. I don't like that people call it feminist trash or whatever, it's a decent movie. Enjoy it, fuckos.&&Funny what can happen when you put an entertaining story, a well written script, decent actors, and a competent director all in one place. It's almost as if most normal people don't actually care about the political messaging and identity politics the likes of Salon.com tell them they're supposed to care about, and just want to spend a few hours seeing a good movie. 

Looking at you Paul Feig&&Score one for the Amazon&&Even beat deadpool? Damn&&inflation. go by tickets sold&&Why is everyone asking about inflation?

This is the first thread about box office numbers where people have asked if inflation has been taken into account. This didn't happen when Deadpool was tearing up the box office. It's almost as if some people on /r/movies don't want this movie to do well and will find any excuse to belittle it.&&It's called inflation. Superman, Batman, Spider-Man and Wonder Woman are the most popular and iconic superheroes in the world. So every time they got their own first origin movie ever, they broke the record of the previous one. Superman in 1978, Batman in 1989, Spider-Man in 2002, and now Wonder Woman.&&Why has this been deleted from r/movies?&&But did it beat Aquaman? &&15 years of inflation later. Can we care about quality and not money please?

Edit: Yeah, the people far too invested in the success of a movie have arrived. No point trying to have a grown up discussion now. Especially now those who are missing the point about objectivity by spinning the usual 'Reddit is sexist' line have chimed in too.&&Meaningless if not adjusted for inflation.&&Was I the only one who wasn't impressed by Wonder Woman? &&Good!

Well deserved.&&*#1...gross..superhero...origin...not adjusted for inflation*

Let's call it like it is: the movie, while visually impressive, was not anything special, BUT it was an achievement to have a female led comic movie find similar levels of success as some of the headliners in the genre.

Why grasp for a such an unnecessary spin?&&I enjoyed the film but I still enjoy the first Ironman more. &&Can't believe the world doesn't have Randy Savage or ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper any more :(&&#We got threeeee minutes!

Would make everything way easier&&So when you correct for inflation, Wonder Woman makes 65 cents for every dollar Spider Man makes.&&I always find it deceptive when people talk about how ""such and such new movie is the #1 grossing movie of all time"" but when you look at inflation adjusted numbers it's not even close. Comparing 1930s dollars to 2017 dollars is apples to oranges.&&I'm skeptical of those numbers, to say the least. Every source I can find suggests that inflation between 2002 and 2017 was about 35%, which would put Spider-Man at under $600mm (right around $550mm). I have no idea what calculation BoxOfficeMojo is using for these numbers, but it's either outright wrong, or isn't a standard inflation calculation. &&everyone loves a dick measuring contest.&&Batman Begins: $205,343,774

Once you adjust for inflation WW does not pass the original Spiderman.
&&'Batman Begins' would be considered a flop if it pulled off the same numbers it did back then today. Even if it was a C-list superhero movie. Its' box office wasn't that impressive even then, but IIRC it either did good money on DVD or had too good of reviews, so WB saw a lot of potential. The fact that 2 Batman movies released before 'Batman Begins' were, hm, to put it lightly, not good - also helps.&&I thought so too.  I think Iron Man made more via sequels than the first and Batman Begins was the first Batman film after Batman & Robin so there probably was some residual hate (much like X-Men First Class after dealing with X-Men Origins and X3: The Last Stand).&&I think a lot of people forget how big of a deal Spider Man was when it came out. It was the first big movie after 9/11, it took place in NYC. It held up cops and firefighters and had a tribute at the end. The last quarter of 2001 was a really scary time for a lot of people. We never saw anything like it. Spider Man hit at just the right time. I saw it sitting on the FLOOR of the local movie theater as they would sell out the show and just keep selling tickets anyway because so many people were in line. &&You can see those numbers on the link that OP posted&&Well the names and Cast alone will draw an audience. You mention Joker and Harley as well as other known villains then tease Batman as well have Will Smith and others.

Spidey did it in era where comic books weren't the number one genre in Hollywood and before all these shared universes. &&I like how the top three grossing films of the last calendar year have female leads.

I sometimes feel like telling Val Kilmer to run before they turn on him. &&2 of the top 3 upvoted posts are congratulating them? &&Begins has such repeat value, I may not watch TDK but I always watch BB whenever it's on.&&Agreed. Spidey and WW were good but Batman Begins was one of my favorites. &&It was a super-hero blockbuster. It was never, in any way, obscure.&&Give me Cheetah and I'm there day one.&&The first spider-man is basically what paved the way for superhero movies today. It was the first superhero movie that smashed the box office and showed the studios that people will pay a lot of money for good, fun superhero movies. The MCU and DCCU owe a lot to spider-man.&&>Funny what can happen when you put an entertaining story, a well written script, decent actors, and a competent director all in one place.

I dunno, I feel like the script was incredibly weak. 

Theres really hard to remember some good dialogs, villains are comically underdeveloped and right out ridiculous, ares with those mustache and face in that  the final battle is straight out bollywood. Her home island feels like lazy written without any depth.

Also what was the final message, for a moment it felt like that we the people are responsible for the the world that we get and the evil in it, but then mustached Ares for some reason appeared. I guess we are really good and innocent, its just that one evil guy... story.

I dont really understand what people liked about it. Specifically. You tell me mummy I or II, you tell me indiana jones, you tell me iron man, you tell me national tressure. I know what I liked, I remember dialogs, I remember the villains, I remember the jokes...

What were the jokes in WW? I dont remember them. Villains? So little space for them that if it were not for bollywood vibe I would already forgot. 

This movie will not age well.&&Decent actor? Sure. I would give them more credit if anything. Competent director? Agreed. Entertaining story? Ehh sure. It definitely had some moments. Well written script? Can't agree there. Besides the obvious of the third act going off the rails, the plot was pretty strung along. Most of the characters aren't fleshed out and there isn't a lot of pay off. &&Then no movie will ever beat gone with the wind, that's not what hollywood wants.&&Based on Inflation and only using the original Origin movie (so no Batman Begins, etc.)

Spider-Man - 617.7M

Batman - 559.7M

Superman - 509.9M

Wonder Woman - 404.0M&&> Can we care about quality

Well Wonder Woman has better RT rating, RT top critics rating, RT audience score and IMDB rating score than Spider-Man&&And added revenue from 3d, Imax and 4d.&&We already talked about quality. It got 92% on RT and was heavily praised. Now we're talking about money cause this is subreddit to discuss movies and box office discussion is a part of that. We even have a weekly thread dedicated to box office numbers for recent films.&&These box office records are never adjusted for inflation. They are all meaningless. &&There are 7 Billion people on Earth, you aren't the only one.&&It was decent.  First act was actually great. Third act was crap. Which, sadly, seems to be the norm.&&First act was good, middle act was eye-rolling, last act was lazy. Overall, Wonder Woman is still better than its predecessors, and that's kinda impressive.&&Nope, most people I know thought it wasn't good. Myself included. Third act was a shitshow, they missed a great opportunity of having a great ending and fucked it up.


Also, loads of continuity errors, uninspired writing at some points, some very bad acting at points (especially in the London scenes) and generally just stuff that pulls you out of the movie and makes you think ""yeah, no"".


Still, is it *decent*? Ehh, it probably is. It's not horrendously offensive, just really frustrating. And it's the best DCU movie by a pretty good margin (Batman Dark Knight trilogy isn't part of it, right?), even if that's not saying much. Wouldn't ever consider watching it again, though.&&It is massively overrated. It was an average superhero movie with waaay too much slo-mo and CGI. &&Da Maniac loves ya&&We're all alive because of Macho Man.  He stopped the Rapture.&&Wait a minute, when did Macho Man Randy Savage die?&&#BOOOOONESAW IS READYYYYY&&**I gotcha for threeeeeee minutes!** &&Come on my face, brother &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&And now 53 minutes later it's the top comment if sorted by ""Best""

My the times they are a changin'&&Can't launder tickets, only money.&&Damn population growth&&When you adjust for inflation you basically are. 

A ticket costs about 50% more these days than it did 15 years ago when Spiderman came out, so... about 50% more people saw Spiderman than Wonder Woman.
&&I actually agree this would be a more interesting number. It also removes the motivation for 3d movies.

Only problem I see is I pay ~$23 or ~$12 or ~$3 depending on when / where I see it. Opening weekend tickets makes sense to compare, unsure about lifetime. &&For one thing, any industry wants to always be breaking records. So, they want the standard to remain unadjusted dollars. That said, if you just used tickets sold, studios would release their movies to all sorts of low-cost theaters early in their runs to goose their numbers a bit. Which would be fun for consumers, but maybe bad for the financial health of the industry as a whole.&&Yeah but what if you account for the different job choices Spider-man makes vs. Wonder Woman's?&&Wonder woman had more experience as well. She was atleast trained. Spiderman is a high school kid. &&Maybe slightly better because Wonder Woman had a production budget of $149 million and Spiderman had a production budget of $139 million in 2002 dollars.&&It's because if you adjust for inflation there's really nothing to talk about, it's just Gone with the Wind being #1 forever.

It's like how you have to talk about the 'modern' era when discussing basketball stats because otherwise it's just Wilt Chamberlain all the time.&&Why can't  fruit be compared? That doesn't make any sense. You're right about dollars, though.&&Even when you take into account inflation, the comparisons may not make sense. In 1930 it costs a lot less than today (including inflation) to see a movie, so people would go see Gone with the Wind a gazillion times, maybe just for the air conditioning. The movie also had very little competition and was re-released many times; there was no good alternative to seeing it for many decades.&&Accounting for inflation is odd to do with movies, as the length of time a feature stayed in theaters is vastly different. Gone With The Wind and Casablanca played for *years*. &&Otherwise, it would be constant stories of ""Gone With the Wind is still the #1 movie of all time!""&&Part of the problem is even adjusting for inflation is a little misleading at times.  Gone with the Wind was rereleased multiple times and ran for much longer than a modern movie.  Plus, there are significantly more entertainment options and ways of watching movies.  There isn't really a good way to accurately judge the relative popularity of movies over a long period of time.&&Because honestly this is all fucking stupid.  It's Hollywood jerking itself off and making up news stories to get more press and free advertising, and stupid fans get all fucking excited that a multibillion dollar company is making even more money.

Honestly, unless you are a shareholder, box office grosses should mean nothing.  

If you enjoyed a movie, who cares how much money it makes or doesn't make.

My enjoyment of a movie doesn't lie in how many other people watched it. &&I think they use the annual average cost of tickets.&&They just use the average ticket price during the most recent year.  So right now they are using the 2017 average ticket price of $8.89.  It's not a perfect calculation because a dollar spent in 1930  would be spent differently than a dollar in 2017 but it's also impossible to account for the lack of competition Gone With the Wind had either.

&&That's right. Those little bitch heroes got nothing on Tobey. &&I'm surprised Iron Man didn't do better. That was one of my favorite movies that year and still one of the best MCU entries. I guess the hype train hadn't fully started and the big superhero movie in 2008 was The Dark Knight. &&That's what I would have expected. Spiderman came out 15 years ago, the ticket price inflation since then would have been enormous (and it turns out it was about 50%). &&I do feel like it's a good point that Spiderman wasn't competing against ANYTHING of the type when it was released

Wonder Woman had competition from Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider Man during its run and still managed to draw a massive crowd for months.

Pretty good achievement IMO.&&But can't we just ignore reality and have happy feelings. 

-most of the top comments&&Batman Begins is imo a seriously underrated superhero movie. It pulled the franchise out of Schumacher's mess, it started the wave of darker, more mature comic movies and laid the foundation for one of the, if not the most popular film of the genre, the Dark Knight. And it's just plain good. &&Batman Begins had the eighth highest domestic gross in 2005.  That's a very respectable showing by any reasonable standard.&&Well marketing can make a turd seem shiny. &&And because of that the budgets were completley different. In Deadpool they even joked about not being able to afford all the X-men.&&OUT ARE WE?!

How pathetically predictable, r/movies. We offer you friendship and you spat in our face. If you had just accounted for inflation your little sub's death would have been quick and painless, but now you've really pissed us off we're gonna finish it nice and slow.&&The Vision origin movie beats them all!&&Spider-man now has 3 origin films to choose from to boot.&&I have a serious question.  Would X-Men and Wolverine Origins both be origin movies for Wolverine?

One is how he came to be, the other was the first movie featuring him and had him as a driving part of the story&&Besting Oprah? &&According to Forbes, Emma Stone is the highest paid actress. &&Plus Spider-man 2 is still the greatest superhero film of all time, and I'll fight anyone who tells me otherwise

EDIT: We're getting a lot of great conversation up here! I will copy and paste my reasoning in favor of *Spider-man 2* from a comment I made below.

*Spider-man 2* is all about the importance of heroism and selflessness, in spite of the burdens and pain that come with offering yourself to protect others while asking nothing in return. It is one of the most earnest and heartfelt films I have ever watched, and I think we desperately need more of that in Hollywood right now, as well as society in general. 

I am by nature more hopeful and optimistic than many, so perhaps my bias comes in part from that.

[This single scene perhaps encompasses everything I love about Raimi's *Spider-man* films.](https://youtu.be/eGBpRk1BPUU?t=109)

Danny Elfman's score definitely contributes to my love, as well. :)&&Don't forget inflation.&&That's what makes this accomplishment so awesome for me. Spider-Man 1 didn't have to compete with some awesome origin films like Iron Man and Batman Begins. 

Wonder Woman came after the Big Bang of superhero films and still stands out amongst them &&While this is true, people were gonna see Star Wars even if it was lead by a paper lunch bag&&Funny I started watching Tank Girl last evening. Gonna have to finish that one soon since it takes place in 2033.&&It's almost like it's shouldn't matter to people one way or the other as long as it's a good movie or something...idk&&Even actors.   Liking Tom Cruise is now niche.&&[deleted]&&Happens with most popular films, even actors sometimes

Only exception might be some Marvel and Nolan movies&&And it's always the same conversations every time. Every single time. There are certain movies or topics that I don't even click on because I know exactly how the conversation will go.&&Could just be different opinions exist simultaneously and some are more vocal than others at different periods&&""It's the circle of /r/moviiiieeees!""&&Same thing happens in /r/games.

Everyone hates The Walking Dead S1 and Bioshock Infinite now. &&To be fair, continued updates on this movie is getting a bit much now. It's been out, it's done. Time to move on. Maybe if we were talking about a sequel, things would be more well received?

I mean look at that chart. Suicide Squad is no. 5, Amazing Spider-Man is no. 8. This doesn't seem to be the best metric to measure a movie's success.&&I think many were of the opposite opinion even back then when WW came out but their voices were drowned by the sea of positive reactions because everyone was praising it as we haven't had a good DC movie in a while. Now they are all rising up.&&Right on schedule too! I am already noticing some change in the water regarding GotG 2, can't wait for that ship to sink.
&&I work in the industry on sets. This is wonderful news! But it's keeping the Superhero trend alive in the Studios mind. Another 5 years of the same stuff. In my opinion, I just want original scripts with the same budget as these superhero movies.&&Same thing happened with Avatar and Jurassic World.&&I didn't like it very much when it came out, but I wasn't allowed to criticize it then. I think WW is the most overrated superhero movie in a long time.&&fewer&&Nah, he'll just laugh as he closes the laptop and rolls back into the arms of naked supermodels laying casually and all bored beside him.&&I think the majority of people on here don't actually like movies at all and are just stark-raving masochists.&&>Also what was the final message, for a moment it felt like that we the people are responsible for the the world that we get and the evil in it, but then mustached Ares for some reason appeared. I guess we are really good and innocent, its just that one evil guy... story.

That's what pissed me off the most about this movie. Chris Pine's speech was supposed to be a reality slap to Diana and if they had stuck with it the movie would've been leaps and bounds better. But the next scene it's like they just discard the speech and jump on a terrible cgi fest and a FUCKING GROUP HUG after defeating Ares. 

This may be the best DCEU flick so far but honestly it's comparable to MCU middle tier movies say Dr Strange, Iron Man 3 or Captain America TFA.&&I agree. Also, the third act was just shit. Ares should not have been real. Just an excuse for a huge cgi action set-piece. And the cgi wasn't that good. Ares looked like he was straight out of a video game.

Edit: looked not look&&Yeah I have to agree with you. Patty Jenkins and the chemistry of the actors (Pine and Gadot specifically) carried an underwritten script. &&I thought it did well enough until the last 15 minutes or so. I don't want to give any spoilers but damn that last bit is atrocious. I think I still like it overall but if I ever watch is a second time I will turn it off before the climax/finale.&&That and they were horribly inconsistent with her powers, what she knew, and some of the extra story. That redheaded charlie dude had 0 point to exist. &&I don't know a single super hero movie that has a satisfying third act. Spiderman 2 maybe? All my favorites from iron Man to dark Knight fall apart at the end.&&The script isn't the most well written thing ever but parts of it like how it shows different parts of wonder woman other than strength(her views on sex, her kindness, her naivity, her humor) and it stayed consistent to it's themes(eventhough the last act was kind of hokey but the last act was little different in the script and much better but the same message is carried out).&&I have nothing to add to this conversation at all. Just thank you and the few people saying this. Because apparently if you only sort of liked it you are some type of circle jerk misogynist? &&The script had all the beats from Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger. Hell, one of the last lines is ripped straight from the ending of CA:TFA.

I liked the movie, don't get me wrong. The movie may be far more competent than anything DC has put out since The Dark Knight, but if the script isn't original I can't call it well-written.&&It's hard to compare movies over generations. A lot of variables. Gone with the Wind didn't have to compete with other comparable forms of entertainment we have today, and it was in the movies forever. Like a year wasn't it? That doesn't come close to happening now.&&But no movie should beat gone with the wind if it sold the most...&&Good. Records aren't meant to be broken. Now there's a box office record being broken every two months.&&Records aren't meant to be broken that easily. It should be historical, groundbreaking.&&The out of 10 rating on RT is similar also. 7.6 for spiderman 1 and 7.5 for Wonder woman. I still think Spiderman 1 is probably the better movie, but Wonder woman ain't no slouch either.&&I can't help but wonder what Spider-Man's numbers on RT would be if RT was as popular as it is now when Spider-Man came out. Wonder Woman benefits from the ratings from all the hype. Spider-Man probably got none of that.

It's like when a new Game of Thrones episode has an IMDB rating of 100 before the episode even airs. Then the episode airs and it gets some of its less than favorable ratings, which don't impact the overall rating as much because the irrelevant, early ratings are still being counted. Now compare that to a show that theoretically wouldn't be listed before it airs, and only gets ratings after it airs. Its overall rating doesn't benefit from the hype ratings.

My point is there's so little actual comparison we can do of two movies from different times because there are *so many* variables that affect how each movie was received. Yet here we are going back and forth, each one acting like we've got all the facts.&&And bigger China market.&&Similarly TDK is $20M behind Avengers adj for inflation.

If it had 3D it'd have been the highest grossing movie in US.&&What is ""4D"" now? 3D DBOX?&&FINALLY I see someone else mention the slow motion. It was ridiculous and done way too much. they would slow mo just a basic punch or kick. Cut that shit and save it for the big moments. &&I don't fight in the ring no more.

I find dissolved movie tickets in my pant pockets after washing them all the time.&&Tell that to ticket master.&&With that factor, isn't it impossible to really compare movie sales over decades? Unless you did a percent of total country population in attendance? This is too much lol&&Not exactly, additional features like 3D and IMAX also bump up the ticket cost faster than inflation. Since different movies' release plans dictate different proportions of 2D/3D/whatever, even movies released at the same time can't consider box office take a perfect proxy for # ticket sales.&&Not just due to inflation of the currency, but theaters raising their prices.&&In fairness Spider-man was studying a STEM field WHILE working in journalism to help pay tuition. Wonder Woman has had everything handed to her by the Amazons and never studied anything, and now works in the liberal arts at a museum.&&We need to fix our pipeline to get more women into the super hero industry.&&Warrior princess should be higher paying than photographer, but I guess having exclusives is a huge advantage while she refuses to pillage after victory.&&https://youtu.be/wjWBXbGVyQU&&Maybe during the first spiderman film.

During the second and third Peter is practically a full grown adult. I mean yeah he has college but he's basically got adult living expenses.

That's why I think the new spider-man should stick to high school for the sequal and maybe the third if they can pull it off timeline wise because otherwise there's nothing that sets Peter apart from the rest of the avengers, other then being a broke version of tony with self confidence issues.&&I wouldn't mind GWtW being the No.1 movie all the time. It's incredible for its time, and still to this day imo.&&Well that movie is awesome.&&wilt's stats are the opposite though, when accounting for the change of pace games back then to now, they all bring down the numbers. kinda like a reverse-inflation.&&This bitch don't know about Pangea &&I just don't like these conflicting principles!&&She like, ”Apples to oranges”
“Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense!
Why can't fruit be compared?”&&You can compare an apple and an orange, but you can't interchangeably talk about some number of oranges versus some number of apples.&&I think he just does not like oranges. Bananas are where it is at.&&And there were much fewer options for entertainment, other than staring at the radio with the family. Seriously, people went to the movies a lot because it was the cheapest and most readily available entertainment outside of the radio, music recordings, and books (though, depending on where you were, they might be more or less readily available).&&Ah, so it accounts for things like IMAX/3D driving up prices as well. That makes sense, and is a fair enough metric to use I guess, but it seems a little confusing to call that ""inflation"". Consumers choosing to pay more money for a ""better"" experience isn't the same thing as the same experience costing more because of inflation. However, there's also something to be said for movies who manage to convince people to pay $5 more to see it in IMAX or 3D when a cheaper ticket is an option...and it seems like they should be rewarded for achieving that draw in comparisons.&&He's Tobey Ma-fuckin-guire!&&Fuck yeah bitch.&&Tobey Maguire, the manliest of superheroes.&&Don't fucking hate on spider Maguire, those 2 movies were wonderful. &&A lot of people shit on Tobey but I thoroughly enjoyed all three of his movies.&&Pizza time&&Also just anecdotally, while Wonder Woman is a huge movie I remember Spider-Man being a phenomenon when it came out. Good superhero movies were a rarity back then and to have a comic book hero be a blockbuster film - and it's actually good? It felt like *everyone* went to see it. 

&&I honestly thought that overall it was the best Batman movie. *The Dark Knight* had Heath Ledger's performance going for it, but in most other respects it wasn't quite as good a film.&&[Exhibit A](https://youtu.be/I6hOlI9cg4o)&&holyshit r/raimimemes is amazeballs!! this made my day!&&Can we really call Homecoming an origin story though?  He already had the powers and the suit. I jus saw it as a new Spider-Man movie in the Marvel universe, not an origin story. &&Sorry, highest paid woman director.&&Spider-man isn't even close to being one of my favorite heroes...but I completely agree. The train scene when the New Yorkers saved Spider-man is one of my favorite scenes in any superhero film.&&Someone hasn't seen Green Lantern obviously. &&Spider-man 2 was and still is the ONE superhero movie that had me watching the action scenes (legendary) but begging them to go back to the scenes with Peter Parker struggling with his complicated personal life.&&Ok. I'll fight you with The Dark Knight&&I agree a Spider-Man 2 was god tier &&Otherwise! &&Nah, Xmen2!&&Then I will die by your side in battle, up in arms until my last breath is had. &&I use the *Spiderman 2* train scene as a simple moral test all the time. 

'If you were on that train, and saw Spiderman's face after he just saved you, would you tell anyone what he looked like?'

I would either keep his secret to my grave or lie to cause misdirection. Its interesting ot me when people get all law and order about it, like it would be their duty to report him.&&That lightning-in-a-bottle charm captured by the first two entries of Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, released at a time when ***America*** needed a hero most...

Regardless of its quality, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* will never quite match the cultural significance of those two films, and that's perfectly alright.
&&I would say it just comes behind 'The Dark Knight'.

Brilliant film. &&Eh, if you are a big spiderman fan, I guess it might be.  Otherwise there's X-Men 2, Watchmen, the first Iron Man, the second Captain America, both GotG, The Dark Knight, the original Batman, shit this is taking too long.&&>Don't forget inflation. 

Do you know the numbers for inflation? I'm curious.&&Star Wars:  Jar Jar's Big Buffet&&Batman v Superman couldn't break a billion, and I think Superman being boring as bread had something to do with that. &&Rogue was possibly the biggest promotional blitz ever for a movie.&&I wouldn't say they saw it *because* it had a female lead, but it certainly helps normalize the idea.&&Langdon Cobb? I loved that guy in *The Thief of Baghead!*&&As it should be.  I'm kinda tired of people using the cast and crew's gender or ethnicity as a marketing gimmick.  Let the film succeed or fail on its own merits, because being a woman or being directed by a woman doesn't affect the quality of the film at all.&&It matters to film creators. They don't believe a movie will do well if it has a female lead (it's also the reason actresses get paid way less than the men). Movies are barely starting to move past that. Wonder Woman might have just officially killed that assumption. We'll probably start seeing way more female leads from this point forward (and seeing actresses get paid way more).&&>TIL Nicolas Cage sucks

Once the tide turns on a circle jerk, the thing in question will be relentlessly shit on until actually liking the thing becomes the contrary point of view.

Just look at the reaction to the The Defenders. The tide has turned against Marvel in general on Reddit, with even their most successful movies facing incredible criticism, and people were so ready to hate the next thing. I mean the show isn't Sopranos-level quality, it's got flaws that are certainly worth criticising, but you'd think it was unwatchable, putrid shit if you went by the response of r/television.

Trust me. Watch it&&Bored supermodels texting and looking disinterested. The dream.&&I hear he's knee deep in pussy.&&I actually wonder if at some point the ending to the film was changed to have that ridiculous battle and ""plot twist.""  I was pleasantly surprised during Chris Pine's speech because I thought it was kind of daring for a super hero film to finish up on a message like that... Too bad they didn't have the nerve to go through with it!&&I didn't get the whole Ares bs.  I thought wonder-woman was going to go win the war by fighting in the grit, not beating some boss.  And she comes to our world just assuming there's a big baddie and everyone disagrees but it turns out there was one?  What is it even supposed to mean?&&You mean the anime boss fight?&&I felt like the trenches could have been handled better.

First off, it felt like it was *really* rushed through - she just turns up and *immediately* runs out into no-mans land. It would have been better if she'd actually seen the futility of an attack first, really play up the ""war is hell"" aspect for the mere mortals, then show her leading an attack which succeeds. You still get the cool ""all ~~eyes~~ guns on me"" scene for the trailer, but you also get a bit more chance for character development. In fact, having her run out the first time, which inspires a charge that gets everyone else killed would be interesting, and give the film a way to break the ""godlike skills but completely naive"" air she never really lost, whilst also letting her know that whilst she might be nigh-unstoppable, the men around her aren't.

Second, the sidekicks really felt like there was supposed to be more to but we got barely anything and then they were left behind. Diana apparently cares deeply for all of them but she spends about two days with them, all told. There's such a varied cast, from the sniper who can't shoot to ""the indian"" who's apparently something like the Milo Minderbinder of WW1. We get that everyone is happy to see him, but we never get *why*.

Then there's the village. I literally didn't care that the germans exterminated them with poison gas. It just had no emotional weight, and Diana running off back to the village just fed into that naive feeling rather than the ""devastating loss"" that I think it was supposed to make me feel.

Throughout the film, I also felt that they never really established what her abilities and strengths were, so everything she does seems to be a deus ex machina for the sake of it - being able to jump a long way is fine, and using it later was a great plot point. Not being even slightly affected by the deadliest poison gas the God of War could invent (and that gas just making Chris Pine cough)? Where did that come from?

The ending was also a bit... yeah.

Actually, come to think of it the beginning didn't exactly start out too well either. It was pretty slow, and the museum scene would have been better as an ending scene to tie it into the Justice League. Frankly I'm not sure whether that would be much better, since no matter what they do with it it's going to remind me that BvS exists. I'm willing to forgive them the island scenes because seeing little Diana obviously trying to copy the warriors was just so adorable.

Shit, I'm getting close to a /r/fixingmovies post here.&&Possibly *Doctor Strange*. And of course, Verhoeven's *Robocop*.

Edit: Oh, and *Dredd*.&&Which line are you talking about? It's been forever since I've seen the movies. &&The problem with your reasoning is that Gone With The Wind is from a time when they barely had any other movies playing in the theater, so it could play for a full year or even longer. People would still go see it because there wasn't much else to choose from.

> Hollywood accounting (also known as Hollywood bookkeeping) refers to the opaque or creative accounting methods used by the film, video, and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project, thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in taxes and royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit.

> Hollywood accounting gets its name from its prevalence in the entertainment industry—that is, in the movie studios of Hollywood at a time when most studios were located in Hollywood. Those affected can include writers and actors.[1][2]

> Stan Lee, co-creator of the character Spider-Man, had a contract awarding him 10% of the net profits of anything based on his characters. The film Spider-Man (2002) made more than $800 million in revenue, but the producers claim that it did not make any profit as defined in Lee's contract, and Lee received nothing. In 2002 he filed a lawsuit against Marvel Comics.[14]

I don't see how movie producers would attempt to screw over Stan Lee. He's in nearly every modern Marvel movie and the Lego Marvel video games. &&This right here. All numbers coming out of Hollywood are false. It's an industry where the more fake you are, the higher you go. It's how the whole industry operates. &&Gross as a percent of world GDP when it was released works just fine.

Spiderman gross = 24.8 BOU

Wonder Woman gross = 10.5 BOU

Where 1 BOU (Box Office Unit) is equal to .0000001% of world gdp at the time of the movie's release

Meaning that Spiderman was about 2.5x bigger of a hit than Wonder Woman is.

For reference, Titanic's gross = 69.6 BOU

And Star Wars IV (A New Hope) had a gross of a whopping **106 BOU**!!

EDIT: fixed some math&&/r/TheyRefuseToDoTheMath&&[deleted]&&If you read the notes on box office mojo, they are adjusting for average ticket price, not total inflation. Which makes sense for comparing over time. &&She speaks over 100 languages and studied combat.&&SUPER STEM&&Do we count inheritance? I feel these comparisons usually refer to proper salaries.&&the issue is that it played in theaters for years. like, if you wanted to go watch a movie, that was it.

I have 10 apples and 12 oranges.  I have more oranges than apples. &&I'm not 100% sure of their methodology, but I think they do separate standard, 3-D, and IMAX costs in their numbers. All the data they use might not be available to the public but might be available for their premium members, which I am not.

Another problem that is hard to control for is the changing nature of how we watch movies. Star Wars, Jaws, and the Exorcist came before multiplexes were a thing and they ran for months without seeing serious drops week to week.

Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, and Spiderman came out with larger theater counts but lots more competition week to week but they didn't have 3-D and IMAX to pad out the numbers.

And now movies have so many screen options and higher ticket costs, but they also face a very saturated market not just in theaters but also from sources like Netflix and Amazon so studios have to try harder to get people to buy seats. Not to mention the US population in 1990 was about 250 million vs about 320 million today.

Needless to say there's so many factors in play that comparing inflation adjusted numbers just can be a simple apples to apples comparison.&&Awww, bitch! &&It's certainly my favorite film duology.&&That's how I remember it as well. Kind of like how when Avatar came out and everyone went to go see that (preferably in 3D) even if they didn't like sci fi movies.

Like it was the film that started the modern superhero movie?&&Superhero movies in general were a rarity. Wonder Woman and Doctor Strange were much better than I was expecting, but the whole lot of them are basically formulaic and repetitive.

You could also follow the action and were rewarded everytime you had to move your eyes and possibly head.

""It's a web/Go Spidey go!"" is the sequence that gets my heart pounding everytime though. Using a cheap 3D film trick in a 2D film made you feel like you were in the action. The way the camera moves is what gives us real action, which is something  a lot of blockbusters are sorely missing.
&&Clearly Iron Man 3 was superior!&&I'm just glad that I've drawn the *Spider-man 2* fans out of the woodwork! I haven't seen *Homecoming* yet but I hope it can recapture some of that feeling.&&*The Dark Knight* is a thoughtful exploration of the inner darkness of humanity, and the importance of being vigilant lest we ""see ourselves become the villain"". 

*Spider-man 2* is all about the importance of heroism and selflessness, in spite of the burdens and pain that come with offering yourself to protect others while asking nothing in return. It is one of the most earnest and heartfelt films I have ever watched, and I think we desperately need more of that in Hollywood right now, as well as society in general. 

I am by nature more hopeful and optimistic than many, so perhaps my bias comes in part from that.

In my opinion, they both suffer from the same root problem: style over substance. In *Watchmen*'s case, it's Zack Snyder's strict adherence to visuals over any of the graphic novel's depth. In *Vol. 2*'s case, it's covering a fairly bland story with tons (and tons... *and tons*...) of humor. It left the audience in a good mood because they laughed a lot, but ultimately the movie isn't that impactful.

The core gameplay (combat) is, and this isn't me being a snob, *vastly* dumbed down compared to its predecessors.

* You are only able to carry two weapons at a time
* All weapons only have one firing function
* You can no longer lay down traps with weapons
* No variation in ammunition types

It just makes the combat FAR too simple. In addition to this, they STILL kept the weapon upgrade system...despite the fact that the player can only carry two weapons. Not to mention that the gun models don't even change when you upgrade them which was half the dang excitement of getting an upgrade in the last two games.

Additionally, the player can no longer carry and manage any health or salts (eve), with the player depending completely on Elizabeth for any or finding them in throughout the environment.

Honestly, A LOT of the problems seem to stem from Elizabeth in order to make her SEEM more useful.

She helps provide the player with...

* Health
* Salts
* Ammunition
* Money

It feels like the developers, in order to make Elizabeth feel more helpful, removed a lot of gameplay systems and mechanics in order to make the player more dependent on her.

It would also explain why the player cannot carry as many weapons as the last few games. If the player was able to carry 12 guns, when would they EVER need Elizabeth to throw them more? In fact, they even FIX this problem in the DLC, as the player CAN carry more than 2 weapons, but simply has vastly less ammunition for each weapon.

As for Health and Salts, it seems like they just took away the ability for the player to carry either, which...is kinda frustrating, since it just seems blatantly obvious they did it in order to make Elizabeth seem more helpful.

Not to mention that Elizabeth just becomes invisible during combat. Even during the final fight. In which the Vox EXPLICTLY tells us that they're going to kill The Lamb (Elizabeth), but they still just run past her.

Bioshock: Infinite has great art direction, amazing voice acting, and some pretty cool set pieces and environments.

But, the gameplay is boring and the story is convoluted.&&Infinite is considered by a lot of long-time fans of Bio/System Shock to be considerably dumbed down from the previous games.

You can only have two weapons at once, they removed the survival elements, gears are an absolutely shite replacement for tonics/implants, and vigors are crazy limited.

You don't get as many of those cool Shock moments anymore. In BioShock, there'd be those tense moments when you're pottering around with almost no bullets left, and the game gets real tense, or you figure out a cool plasmid weapon combo. In Infinite, ammo is no object unless you're using a rocket launcher type weapon. Vigors are definitely creative powers, but they're also very controlled, so you don't get as much fun. Also, tears feel underutilized.

The upgrade system sucks balls. So in System Shock, you had a decent Cyber Module system, where you allocate points for increasingly higher costs into stats and weapon skills, and it was good, but a bit boring. In BioShock, you've got the ADAM system, which is again alright, but the gap in ADAM stashes from saving vs harvesting is too small to be compelling. Infinite says ""Fuck all of that, now you buy upgrades with money, and they suck, and you lose money for dying, so the worse you do the less you get."" The upgrade system also ruined most players experience with the Vox weapons, since you'll have all your points in other weapons once you get them.

The story, you've got two different stories going on here. There's the racist Columbia stuff, and you've got the interdimensional stuff. Columbia sucks compared to Rapture. In Rapture, everyone had a point of view, and every character was their own personal tragedy. The worst characters in that game were probably Suchong and Fontaine, because they were cardboard cut out villains. In Columbia, EVERYBODY is Suchong and Fontaine. Fink sucks. The Lutece twins suck. Slate fucking SUUUUCKS. They could have been more interesting, especially in the case of Slate, but they're done as the archetypal Factory owner, Quirky time traveler, and Psychopath.

The racism is aspect is done very poorly. With a game portraying a world in the style of industrializing America, they had an awesome chance to explore the causes of racism, how it twists people. Infinite's portrayal of racism is awful. What's the message the game is trying to send? ""Racism is bad?"" It's the most obvious, moralizing way of doing it possible. I THOUGHT there was going to be something with Comstock, with how they set him up to be a master manipulator using racism as an excuse to make his own personal world, but no! He's just fucking insane!

World building stinks. There's definitely a bigger focus on what looked cool than what made sense. I was very excited to learn about the Handymen and the Firemen and the Crows, but halfway through the game, all of that is thrown out so the game can focus on the interdimensional time travel plot.

The interdimensional plot was the best part of the story. It could have been explored a bit better, but for what it is, it's poignant, thought provoking, and open ended in the best way.

Burial at Sea fucked the ending in the arsehole. I won't get into it too big right now, but it ruined the ambiguity and tried too hard to clear up the connections. I LIKED the vague connections between Columbia and Rapture, the parallels between Comstock and Ryan, and Burial ruined that.

There's still a lot of great stuff about the game. It's still a blast to play, it still has an entertaining story overall, it's beautiful in a way that can't age, and it's still one of the best seventh gen games, and better than most games overall. But it could have been much, much better.&&Well, it departs quite a bit from the first two in gameplay , as stealth and setting up traps is unviable in favor of a simple if well scructured corridor run and skyhooks didn't turn out very cool after all.

 That said it works as what it is, I've personally realized that staying stuck in your preconceptions is poison for your enjoyment of just about anything, be it games, series or social interactions, it's better to go with the flow and be open to the approach taken. &&Nevermind. &&No judgment, but I hope he washes his feet first.&&Yes, I don't wanna spoil it for anyone but... I mean the scene kind of spoils itself. It's no Oscar movie but it's a fun flick until that scene.&&Well, it was a comic book fight if you wanna put it in these terms, which is good IMO. I loved that they didn't nerf Wonderwoman, whereas the heroes in the MCU are definitely not near as strong as their comic counterpart.&&He must be talking about the line ""I wish we had more time"". I think Steve Trevor says it when he gives WW his watch at the end. Rogers says the same thing at the end of Cap. &&We also have streaming now. Comparing movies from then to today is really impossible.&&While Toby Maguire hasn't aged a day.&&wonder woman might as well. &&Wow, really? I think it aged beautifully!&&> Spider-man came out when Xmen 1 and the Christopher reeves Superman movies were considered some of the best superhero movies ever   
   
I would argue they still are.&&I envy you. You basically had 6 extra years with him.&&I catch a few movies from back then that drop ""retard"" a LOT! 

Edit: Mean Girls. &&But hey, pro-gay-marriage gay joke. &&Cum on my face, brother!&&I can tell you, for money.&&He wasn't in all those things by 2002 when the screw happened.  He was still Stan Lee, though.  (And no stranger to screwing a colleague.)&&For the same reason Stan Lee fucked over everyone else. The money.&&They do unto him like he do unto others.&&It's almost like the bad guys are up to no good.&&And that's why you settle for merchandising rights&&They also screwed over other comic book creators, stan just happened to have the clout to fight them...&&Stallone has a lawsuit pending now that may change this ridiculous accounting business.  Of course, some judge may be paid well to rule against his suit.  If he wins, may change every future pay out, and perhaps in the past too (which would bankrupt various film studios and producers).&&Very cool idea.  Using those same data sources and formula (for the years with data available), here are the top 100:

**Edit: Updated to include more data.  This changed significantly (#2 and #3 weren't even on the previous list).  Wonder Woman is no longer in the top 100; it is actually now at #200 overall.**

**The two notable exclusions they are too old for GDP data are Gone With the Wind which would probably be #1 overall, and Bambi which would probably be in the top 10.**

Is that accounting for rereleases, or just the original theatrical release?&&Since you're already doing the calculations, where does Gone With the Wind factor in here?&&Something appears wrong with your math (or possibly just a typo).

Spiderman made $821mm in 2003 (let's just round it to 800mm to keep things simple).  World GDP was 39 trillion, let's call it 40 to make it easy.  That means 800mm/40t = 0.002%, that's two thousand of your box office units (if your BOU is 0.000001% as you wrote).  I am guessing you just put too many zeros in your BOU, making it 0.0001% would work. &&but but but if we cared more about ourselves making money instead of others making money, how are we supposed to waste half our lives on this website??&&while he was studying STEM, she studied the blade&&Really though if you learn like 7 languages you're bound to be in good shape almost anywhere&&Combat is not lucrative unless you capitalize upon it with an efficient manager. &&Yeah, but he works in web development.&&There were other options, but it was re-released several times in a way that movies aren't anymore.&&Brain needs to take a shit.&&If you want to make cider, no amount of oranges will suffice.&&Avatar was *the* 3D movie, it picked a great moment to take advantage of 3D plus great visuals and build up a hype. Otherwise the movie would have been quite meh.&&That was Spider-Man 2.  The first movie was awesome but 2 solidified the genre.  It was also when game tie ins were actually really good.&&Kathryn Bigelow? Sofia Coppola?

It wasn't that bad.&&I like IM3 more than 2&&[deleted]&&I've heard that it was good, really good, but I'm worried it might fall victim to the modern Marvel curse of feeling samey and formulaic like the other MCU films.&&Homecoming is a lot less dramatic compared to spider-man 2. Also peter is a lot more witty in homecoming.&&It doesnt at least in my experience, completely different movie. You can feel the difference in decades, theres a bit of shoehorning in the movie thats just weird&&Don't expect anything out of Homecoming and you might enjoy it, but it feels like a B iron-man plot.  Oscorp has been replaced by stark industries and they skip the origin story.  They made this spider-man very quippy which I like.  He reminds me of the spider-man in the cartoons when he's in the suit.&&I disagree with that assertion. Dark Knight explores the inner darkness in everyone but ***also*** that everyone has the capacity to be a hero even in the face of their own darkness. There's an entire sequence devoted to two ships told to blow the other one up in order to survive; one was full of criminals and the other was full of civilians. In both, there were those who were willing to pull the trigger but in both, goodness beat darkness and neither ship was destroyed. It was not only optimistic that civilians as ordinary people could ultimately do what's right, it also said the same for criminals. And it also showed that no matter what, we can all be heroes. Joker wasn't defeated because Batman pounded on his face and then got arrested. He was defeated because the people of Gotham refused to support his hypothesis.

We all make decisions and while all it takes is ""one bad day"" to turn someone from the hero (Dent) to the villain (Two-Face), ultimately, it's how one handles tragedy and darkness to avoid being consumed by it themselves. If that's not optimistic and hopeful and heroic in a way that the dark and edgy DCEU films fail to grasp... I don't know what is.&&[deleted]&&The Dark Knight was a great crime movie, but not as good a superhero movie as Spiderman 2.
You could change out the main character for more generic law enforcement/gangster characters and it would still be pretty much the same film. Spiderman 2's main focus is that it is a superhero movie.&&I agree with your argument and one more thing I would like to add to your Spiderman argument is that it also is a perfect mix of comedy and drama just like how Evil Dead 2(another Sam Raimi movie) was the perfect mix of horror and comedy.

And I think that Wonder Woman is one of the greatest superhero films(in general I would give it a 7/10 which means pretty good and is the highest I have given a superhero movie excluding the first two Nolan Batman films and Raimi Spiderman films) because of exactly how you said above. I think it would have been as good as Spiderman 2 if the script was more polished(and WB like idiots shouldn't listened to test screen audiences and changed the last act).&& > Spider-man 2 is all about the importance of heroism and selflessness, in spite of the burdens and pain that come with offering yourself to protect others while asking nothing in return.

This is honestly why I like the Captain America films the most in the MCU, he sticks to his principles and tries his best to take responsibility for his actions even if it makes him a pariah. To me, he represents the person who will fight the fight that no one else can, to stick up for those who can't help themselves. I find Iron Man to be a complete coward who is reckless and mitigates responsibility for the repercussions of his actions. He hides behind his intelligence and his wealth, but when faced with his own demons he's weak.&&I rewatched GOTG 2 this week and came to this same conclusion. It's an incredibly fun film to watch, and it definitely has its moments and its message, but it's hardly an incredible film the way that Spider-Man 2 was. &&no, paper bag is *better* than that&&Jarth Apfel&&Okay but that is probably my favorite fan theory of all time, across universes.

Iron Man 2 was forgettable shit though.&&*I vant my berd!*&&Thanks for pointing the last bit out, I didn't even notice.&&This is a really good write-up, and I appreciate the thought you've put into it!

However, I think you are overstating the theme of everyman heroics in *The Dark Knight*. The ferry scene is poignant and inspiring, yes, but in the end, all we really see is people choosing *not* to do something very, very dark; in other words, resisting their inner darkness, ensuring that they do not see themselves become the villain. In an earlier sequence, the Joker's threat to blow up a hospital if that reporter guy isn't dead in 60 minutes has the masses shooting at his police escort, and a guy who nearly flattens his vehicle, saved only by the timely interception of Bruce Wayne's Lamborghini. To claim that inner darkness and the struggle to resist it under duress is *not* the primary theme of *The Dark Knight* is, I think, incorrect.

That being said, the themes of each movie are hardly a metric by which we can definitively say ""this movie is better than that one!!!"". In the end we are talking about our opinions about movies based on escapist fantasy comic book characters.

Arguably the central conflict of Spider-man 2's plot is that *only Peter* can do what Spider-man does for New York. It is a tremendous burden.

Had the situation with Bucky been applied to anyone else, and they acted the way he did, his condemnation would've been incredibly strong.  That's not to mention that he knew Bucky killed Tony's parents and deliberately kept that from him. 

I get that Bucky was being mind controlled, but Cap made zero attempt to explain what was going on or solicit help from anyone.  Instead, he went out on his own and just made the shallow excuse of ""You don't understand, it's my boyfriend Bucky!""  

Sure, Tony makes tons of mistakes and he definitely tries to mitigate the damage (realistically that's what guys who've always been rich do), but he doesn't wave moral superiority around like Cap does.

I am not 100% sure since I have only read this from other people but it sounds so much better.

Also I don't think there will be a director's cut(it is not needed) and the new ending doesn't really change the film, it just lessens the impact of the film a little bit. &&""You're welcome, Fox intern reading these comments!""&&> Reddit ~~Deadpool fanfic~~ is the worst.&&You don't hire J.

I guess I'm misremembering. Oh well. It has been a while since I thought about them so I guess I'm just misremembering."" 

So I set in my head that they were brother and sister so that I didn't mess it up again.

It's one of my favorite comedies of all time, so it's got that going for it.

On the other hand, it's a sequel to a comedy, so....

If they can limit the number of rehashed jokes/nods to the first movie, it could break the comedy sequel curse.

The problem is, that isn't what fans want from a sequel. Fans want the same characters they grew to enjoy from the first movie, with their same personalities and issues, in different circumstances and with new jokes! 

Zoolander 2, Dumb & Dumber To both suffered from this issue. It is lazy writing and I couldn't stand it. I don't even consider anything past the first Dumb & Dumber to be canon, they butchered that shit. 

That's my fear with this movie. That we will see the 'litreOcola' joke, the shenanigans joke, the 'chicken fucker', the mustache ride, the weed/mushrooms scenes redone.

[Also. This is the best scene of all time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXYDwkG8_QQ)&&I worked on the set of Super Troopers 2 (so maybe I'm a bit biased) - I'm fairly  positive it's going to be a well received film.  We had a lot of talent both in front of and behind the cameras. Yes you can expect some references to ST1 but that is the case with most any sequel. From what parts of the script I saw the jokes are not completely rehashed material from nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.&&22 Jump Street worked because it was a unique meta satire of the usual comedy sequel formula, it wasn't the simple act of rehashing jokes that made it good. If Super Troopers tried to do the same thing people would think they're ripping off Jump Street.&&I agree, 22 Jump Street was great.  It's the very rare exception to the rule though.  &&1 movie does not mean much. Can you list a few good comedy sequels from the countless of sequels? &&But that's the rare exception to the rule. It helps that those movies are very meta based.&&Yeah and 22 Jump Street was a movie about making fun of sequels. So it was perfect&&The key to 22 jump street, and 21 jump street is the movie is based on that specific joke. 21 jump street is a parody of shitty revamp movies, 22 jump street is a parody of shitty sequels. &&I agree. I trust them to have a well made, funny movie. But the biggest criticism I had of Dumb and Dumber To was that it seemed like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were doing impressions of their characters from the first movie. So hopefully they avoided that trap.&&I don't know about that. These guys are passionate about their films. I feel like they legitimately love what they do and will probably try to maintain a large bit of creative control of their work. I wouldn't call it a ""way to late"" sequel. I'd say that it's just in time, albeit a fashionably late sequel. Broken Lizard gave it enough time for the hype of the first film to die off sufficiently, yet didn't wait so long as to only leave the hardcore cult classic movie crowd to wait. I think they're in the perfect timeframe to produce and release a sequel. 

I say this as someone who saw it in theaters in about 2nd grade (my family didn't know how absolutely raunchy it would be and decided to get our money's worth) and I have continued to watch it pretty much once a month since it released on DVD. It's the one movie that I can quote line by line 30 seconds before the actors do their bit. 

I'm the definition of ""cult classic viewer"" of this film and I think they're doing it perfectly. I've learned to not have fear in the future in any regard. I stay realistic. This film absolutely won't have an impact on my life like the first one did, but it will still be amazing. I hope you'll stay optimistic as well. &&I thought Club Dread was funnier than Beerfest. Then again, I also liked Slammin' Salmon, so my taste is questionable, I think.&&>  loosen the lips so they can chug syrup!

Don't forget to cup the balls.&&Yeah, I really wanted to get married so I could have them show up in that really expensive tier. Unfortunately, had nobody to marry. .&&I dunno.

&&Yea there is something being left out I think&&> Moustache Schannigans

I see it's an audiobook, can I get a quick synopsis? is it a good or bad thing for this movie? Considering the name it makes me think all those old jokes will make a comeback:/&&And the heart?&&Yes exactly! No subtlety and they got way more dumb. &&Dumb & Dumber is my favorite comedy of all time, and ""To"" definitely was not anywhere near as good, but it did have a few funny moments IMO. The ""free beer"" scene had me laughing and gagging.&&No defending D&D Too, but why in the heck would it being bad ruin the first one?  &&> That's exactly what people want.

Not really, they quote the original because they can't quote the sequel because they haven't seen it. People want new jokes, they just can't make reference to something they haven't seen yet.&&It's okay to make comments like that I would say. Problem is, making a whole new movie with those rehashed jokes. 

I still quote super troopers from time to time, and dumb & dumber. But with a sequel, I think the right way to go about it is to make new jokes and situations with the same characters. If you don't you end up with fucking Zoolander 2. Ugh. Only movie I really should have got up and left the theatre. Other than maybe National Lampoons Van Wilder 2: Return of Taj.&&Not to mention that in the Super Troopers commentaries, they mention that the funniest parts of the movie (intro and out-tro) were requested reshoots by Fox.

The original ending (with the meat packing plant) wasn't nearly as funny as St.Anky beer and the college kids.

Edit: accidentally a word&&Most people like beerfest just as much, if not more, than ST. Personally, I like slammin salmon a lot. But I worked in food industry for 10 years.&&I loved Beerfest. If Super Troopers was a 10 I'd say Beerfest is a solid 9. &&Beerfest is another good one I thought?

I thoroughly enjoyed it.&&Beerfest is maybe my favorite movie ever, not just broken lizard, but ALL movies.  Watched it way too many times in college.&&Hey Farva! What's the name of that place you like with all the goofy shit all over the walls and the mozzarella sticks?&&Do yourself a favor and watch all of eastbound and down&&Did you watch the actual scene or the outtake reel. If it wasn't the outtake reel get back on YouTube and dig that shit up. There are few things that are funny enough that I fear I actually may wet myself, but that one is up there.&&>  Feel it in my plums

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVcniAcWg0Q&&Fresh and juicy, ready for the pickin'&&Recent history of too late comedy sequels that sucked. Anchorman 2 and  Zoolander 2 &&Standup is a different medium though. There are many instances of comedians better at standup than acting and vice versa. 

Hopefully, this is the case with Jay and Steve. &&That's a shame to hear. I listen to Kevin and Steve's podcast every week and they frequently talk about tour days and I was eager to have them come to my area. The podcast is really funny (to me anyway) and I'd hope the standup would've been the same.&&Still waiting on Pot Fest.&&A movie making it as a cult classic does not equate to an unsuccessful movie. Super Troopers made around $23 million at box office on a budget of $3 million, so definitely a score there...but to put that in context of only doing okay, My Big Fat Greek Wedding did $241 million, and Austin Powers in Goldmember did $213 million at the box office the same year (Jackass:The Movie, $64 million)&&I downloaded it on Kazaa or Limewire and it took 2 days on dial-up. Worth it.&&Man, Slammin Salmon is probably the weakest of their films in my opinion (not including Puddle Cruiser) and I fuckin love everything about that movie.

Now we got no buttah!


Edit: For everyone asking, Broken Lizard movies in my personal opinion go in this order from best to worst:

Beerfest (Just like college!)
Super Troopers
Club Dread
Slammin' Salmon

Salmon and Dread are almost equal in my eyes, I just slightly prefer the characters in Dread. Although [this guy](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZfLEwQABlxw/VKljyBd7IKI/AAAAAAAB098/6agvJvbobtM/s1600/06%2BErik%2BStolhanske%2Bas%2BGuy.png) might be my favorite character of any BL movie, to be fair.

Puddle Cruiser doesn't even feel like BL to me and I haven't seen Freeloaders.&&The sequels taste like sequels!&&*pistol whips* this sumbitch&&Fucking Jim Gaffigan, what an odd cameo but so memorable.&&last i checked, it was canceled.
&&Ya the credit sequence was amazing!&&I love those films. They spoofed the reboot in the first one and continued with the second along with spoofing sequels. 

My name Jeff.&&I don't know how many times I've seen that scene and it still actually makes me laugh out loud&&Ice cube is so great at being the angry captain. The casting in that series was perfect. &&""Welcome back dumb-dumb."" Gets me every time. &&Damn that's hilarious. Ice Cube killed restaurant that scene!&&God dammit not again...&&Mental train reading the comment-
Wow some site insight, optimism about the sequel...1998? Is ST1 that old alrea....damn, got me again. Well done.&&This one got me better than most of yours do. Well executed.&&Why do I keep falling for this???&&You god damn chickenfucker!&&This is fucking horrible I was so excited about ST2 being good&&EVERY GODDAMN TIME&&God damn it!

I think I somehow stumble upon every one of these.&&Fucking mother fucker. &&You are my favourite thing about reddit currently. It's the begrudgingly accepting comments that always get me. That and the rage. This would only be better if you were Rick Astley irl. &&Not this time Satan! I got through the first sentence and looked riiiiiiight at your name and didn't even bother finish reading. &&I got in the habit of reading usernames first, so I didn't get duped this time.&&Just when I finally felt safe&&read the username and still fell for it. Shit.&&Mother of god...&&God damn it twice today.

I will never trust the year 1998 again.&&Everytime, motherfucker, I will upvote you everytime you catch me out you honey dicken bearfucker.&&You must've had some childhood problems to be doing this&&https://gfycat.com/WelltodoCheerfulAppaloosa&&Every single time.&&HA!

Love it.&&Talent doesn't beat skill.&&You and your damn shenanigans. &&You son of bitch lol &&You son of a bitch. &&Ah the king of clickbait opening lines &&Fucking shit&&You have a great power you're squandering away.&&GOD DAMMIT SHITTYMORPH FUCK YOU. Seriously you always get people with this.&&There thing is, he starts with a very typical top comment Reddit response. Just mostly plausible. And then you think, I'm not sure I really believe this, I bet he gets called out in the comments. Better get the popcorn and the pitchforks. 


Then bam. Fucking shitty morphed. It's truly impressive.&&Oh God fucking dammit&&Mm, my heart exploded when I read that last bit for some reason.&&I actually recently just watched the match and it is fucking brutal &&Nooooo&&Goddamnit i really need to start looking at usernames first..&&FINALLY!!! I finally saw one coming!!!&&[Goddammit!](https://giphy.com/gifs/fun-baseball-ugh-Q9pkpDAK2AxQA)&&Mother fucking every time&&Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuiii&&This one got me more than they usually do:( 
So tricky. I was genuinely interested in the script! Lol&&I needed this laugh more than anything ever&&GODDAMMIT.&&What in the fuck! I haven't been bamboozled in a long time. &&Fuck... &&Every fucking time... I finally let my guard down.... and bam shittymorph.... your timing is impeccable &&Motherfucker.Every.Time&&M8. I feel so used.&&FUCK&&You son of a bitch.&&I trusted you...&&Motherfucker.&&DAMNIT&&Fuck I saw the top of your post at the bottom of my screen, so I scrolled and saw announcers table.&&sigh, take your damn upvote. &&22 also came out much closer to the original. After Zoolander 2 and Anchorman 2 I'm not getting my hopes up on a delayed comedy sequel.&&For real.  That's like saying ""Deadpool had a corny over-the-top action montage, and *it* still did well"" &&I loved 22JS up until the third act. It was smart and funny and smart and witty. But the moment the third act begins the momentum dies. It became ho-hum. It became boring chase scene that wasn't very imaginative.&&Part of the reason it was funny was because the entire joke was that they were doing the same thing. Even kept the joke going at the end with all the fake movie titles &&Austin Powers&&Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&&I really liked Hot Shots! Part Deux&&Wayne's World 2&&National Lampoons Vacation movies used to be pretty solid &&Naked Gun 2, Wayne's World 2 and Scary Movie 2 are pretty good. I'm honestly having trouble coming up with more though.&&Back to the Future part 2
Gremlins 2
Ted 2
Look who's talking too
Police Academy 2
Airplane 2
Ghostbusters 2
Evil dead 2
Ride Along 2
Rush Hour 2
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
Harold and Kumar 2
Wayne's World 2
Revenge of the Nerds 2&&What's with the Slammin' Salmon hate around here? That movie is a gem. Don't doubt yourself.&&You're not alone. Given the choice, I'll take Club Dread over Beerfest. Bill Paxton alone is worth the price of admission.&&Sometimes nothing is better.&&*SHIKAKA*&&https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-28-2015/9NdKXv.gif&&""Let me guess... white devil, white devil?""&&When Nature Calls is DEFINITELY the better movie.

Anchorman 2 is also good. Not sure why it gets hated on so much.&&Hot Shots: Deux!&&I thought 2 was better, but I'd rate 3 as the worst of them. Still thought it was pretty funny though. &&I think it's definitely better, just less iconic.

It's like Star Trek The Next Generation. In many ways it's superior but will never be as recognized as the original.&&As well as A very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas&&Can't believe someone bought the patrol car &&> Also includes all perks in the $200 package.&&The monkey has a butler?&&Just give me the god-damn soap!&&[deleted]&&The poor fuckin theater concessions employees who are going to have to hear this over and over and over...&&I have a feeling that might end up being a thing.&&Ever since then I've been shitting pancakes.&&What's a Z job?&&Aren't you?&&That’s what I remember. His look of “why the fuck would i chug this syrup” was genuine. &&I read it a few weeks ago. It's basically a rundown of how broken lizard got together, what they were like in college, and how they got into doing movies. It does have a fair bit of talk about their thought processes, It at least gave me a bit of confidence that they are quite self-aware and they do think about things like balancing the fan-service and providing something new. &&I fucking LOVE Beerfest. That scene where Barry comes in hammered and crushes all the games, ""I'm better when I'm drunk!""

It's totally true too.&&Beerfest is my favorite of their movies, it's just so silly. I think the best part about Beerfest is that it truly looks like they had so much fun making it.&&I love Slammin Salmon and never worked in food service. I probably quote it more than ST. It might be time for a rewatch.&&Beerfest was awesome &&Shenanigans&&Let. The boy. Watch. &&Gettin' a nice bluish hue.&&And Dumb and Dumber To&&Yeah but this is Broken Lizard. Almost all of their movies are solid as fuck. &&Fuck you all Anchorman 2 was hilarious.&&Harold and Kumar did a decent job filling that void.&&I always felt the basic gag was just the concept.

Then you go through the movie with your friends and switch everything around to being all about dank instead. Replace German ancestry with Dutch, and so on.&&I think in one of Jay's AMAs that he said the movie went on to make $100 million because of it's cult status. I bet it killed in DVD sales.&&[deleted]&&WHAT-EVER MOTHER FUCKER!&&[deleted]&&Hahaha weakest?!
Which are your top 3?

Mine are:

Super Troopers

Slammin Salmon

Beerfest

With a runner up is the unofficial Broken Lizard production Dukes of Hazard because it's just a lot of fun.&&Uh, who is Guy Meat Drapes?&&VAT IS IT GRANPAPA&&I don't want a large rehash, I want a goddamn liter of sequel!&&Well thanks for ruining my day. Haha&&Can't find anything on it being outright cancelled but Jonah Hill has stated it is ""almost impossible to make"".&&I felt like they really missed a joke with a Police Academy teaser. I kept waiting for it but it never came.&&YOU TOLD IT WITH SO MUCH DETAIL!!&&Channing Tatum is so completely amazing in the scene&&Knew what it was going to be before I even clicked. Fantastic scene&&I watched both videos he linked back to back and I still laughed out loud. The egg timer sound effect is priceless. &&Same.

I kept thinking ""Surely Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels won't sign on for a film with a horrible script.."" 

I was wrong.... I was so wrong... And so disappointed..&&Joe Dirt 2 proves sequels can be better than the original, right guys?

guys?&&Zoolander 2 wasn't as good as the original but I still liked it when I caught it on TV.&&Now we're talking. That's a legit example of a sequel about equal or better &&Naked Gun&&YOU MUST BE THE MONOPOLY GUY!&&Alright, a solid sequel. The naked gun sequels weren't as good as the original but they were solid &&Also Shrek 2. Mike Myers really has a solid track record of making quality sequels. &&You're not going to lost the house.  Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.&&Wait a second, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back isn't a sequel. &&I, too, prefer Club Dread to all other non-Super Troopers movies from Broken Lizard, even if it's just because I like hearing Mac say ""Peenylope"". 

Also, it has been nearly 2.5 years since we funded this Indiegogo initiative... &&Yup.

See: Anchorman 2, Dumb and Dumber 2, Zoolander 2, Joe Dirt 2, Hangover 2.&&*excuse me you're balls are showing*

#BUMBLEBEE TUNA, BUMBLEBEE TUNA!&&CHICAAAAAAAAAAAGO&&Anchorman 2 is a monstrosity. I would love to hear what qualifies it as ‘good’. 

It goes from being genuinely funny in the first one to relying on shock and absurdity as well as a total flanderisation of Brick to the point where even he isn’t funny. Will Ferrell literally bottle feeds a fucking shark. I try not to hate on it as much but fuck it is the worst film I’ve ever sat through. &&Hot Shots!: Part Deux&&Classic trilogy. 2>1>3. Just like a
Star Wars&&I don't know... I mean, Beyonce was terrible.  Just Terrible - I grant you that. Everything else about that movie was perfect though.  It was impressive that they were still being innovative by the 3rd movie.  Yes, some was recycled, but they acknowledged that, and did a great job making that fun, too.  &&Oh yeah all of their higher rewards sold out [(Source)](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/super-troopers-2#/) &&Interesting piece of trivia: 
Brian Cox (Captain O'Hagan) is diabetic, so for the soap scene, one of the crew had to drive all over New York looking for diabetic friendly white chocolate to make the soap prop. Also, in one take they swapped it out with real soap. &&I swear to God, I will pistol-whip the next guy who makes a Super Troopers reference.&&If you have to ask, you can't afford it.&&""You're not Mexican?"" &&Happy to hear. I'll check it out.&&I want to see the broken lizards do a movie with Simon peggs crew&&Yeah Jay Chandrasekhar has kept busy directing and acting in a lot of other funny stuff since Super Troopers so it's not like he's coming off the bench cold.&&Landfill's twin coming is about the hardest I've ever laughed at a movie.&&ASHLEY SHAEFFER BMW! WOO!&&I was on top of my wife, Janet. &&And Joe Dirt 2&&It's ""too"" btw&&None of them held a candle to what Super Troopers accomplished, comedy wise. &&It had its moments. Honestly it settles better over time. I like it. &&I thought it was pretty funny up until he went blind.

I want it Meow!&&It's also my second favorite movie about food service, behind Waiting...  Everyone in that movie is somebody's coworker in real life and it's beyond fucking amazing. Our Ryan Reynolds started dating the cashier, the owners daughter. She's 19.  She's also a hostess at another restaurant.  The crazy Mexican guy. Ya. We got him.  I'm Andy milonakis unfortunately. &&Yep. I spent about five years in the service industry too. A lot of people tend to think that Waiting is the best serving industry film: they're wrong, it's the Salmon.&&Holy hell, same. They send the soup back:

""NUKE THE DICK OUTTA IT"" &&I think Club Dread is woefully underrated. It has so many great moments making fun of horror movie cliches.&&I watched the Dukes of Hazard movie on a whim one day and was actually surprised by how much of an entertaining movie it was. 

I had to look it up online if Jay was directing because fucking all of Broken Lizard popped up in there.&&:( RIP, big fella.&&Cut that out meow!&&My days ruined. Stop laughing &&Haha&&Also, no Clown College. &&Rich, vivid detail!&&It always starts with a small, but not entirely impossible lie&&I know right every fucking time&&I even got to the 1998 part and was like damn, has it really been that long since that movie came out..&&see, his first line is what blew his cover for me because I was instantly all, ""oOo who is this person who worked on set!"" and that's how, for the first time ever, I caught shittymorph before he could shittymorph me.&&Or your mom with Santa in her mouth.&&[deleted]&&You're in way too deep by that point. &&We are all stupid on this blessed day.&&Same, I secretly enjoying getting tricked by him.&&Oh shit I forgot that was a thing&&BAH GAWD HE HAS A FAMILY!&&Dumb and dumber too had it's moments *SPOILER* like in the last scene we discover that Lloyd and Harry don't even know how babies are made. I thought Zoolander 2 was worthwhile with Hansels orgy family and the near death driving-while-taking-a-selfie accident.&&The third is obviously the weakest but I love all of them so much and I still watch the third just for Beyonce in her prime.&&Shakaka!&&Yeah. To be honest, it's hard to come up with good comedic sequels. The best sequels I could think of are non-comedic (Aliens, Terminator 2, Godfather 2, etc.).&&Also on board the Club Dread boat.

""I'm not blind 22 hours of the day, or 23, I'm blind the whole damn day!""&&If you didn't like them or they weren't as good as you hoped at least they tried and they might bring an audience to the original.

Not to mention who could complain about awesome car chases and the Broken Lizard gang.&&I'll admit it, I saw that movie in theaters probably 3-4 times. While I enjoyed the movie overall (most people that hate it compare it to the classic tv show, which is entirely unfair to both), I honestly just wanted to enjoy the General Lee on the big screen while I could. &&My days are ruined when I wake up in the morning haha&&I *AM* a clune.&&The craziest thing about this one though, is unlike the [tree-fitty lochness monster] (https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/R390EId) or [Rick Rolling](https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/R390EId), which anyone can submit, it's just one dude.

Aaaaaaaaaand that one's going on the list.&&I thought 2 was bad until I saw 3. 2 is fine. &&Don't worry it gets worse, complications of diabetes is pretty generous considering he shot himself in the head and apparently survived initially:

''On February 20, 2012, von Bargen shot himself in the temple during an apparent suicide attempt. After placing a phone call to a 911 operator, emergency crews were dispatched to his Montgomery, Ohio, apartment. Von Bargen suffered from diabetes and, at the time of his death, had been living with one leg amputated. He was due to have a couple of toes amputated on the other foot and reportedly did not want to submit to another surgery.

Von Bargen died on March 1, 2015, having experienced complications from diabetes for years. He was 64 years old.''

That was my first time reading about all this just now. His character commandant spangler was one of my favourite things in Malcolm in the Middle as a kid. Shame to see what happened to him.&&He didn't actually die when he attempted suicide. He was actually conscious after shooting himself in the head and called 911.

all this does is just breeds resentment in their customer base. the people who dont care or have money to spare might well pay for it. the rest of us will just start sailing the seas. the piratey seas.

i think a lot of these companies just see that netflix is making a killing and they think they could do the same on their own. i guess because hbo is making good money? honestly for disney movies i dont know anyone who would pay for it. those movies aren't all that rewatchable. they're good to watch the first time but that's about it. of the movies that are rewatchable, like the animated kids movies most people who would rewatch those already bought the dvds. people only incidentally rewatch them on netflix because it's convenient to do so without needing to pop in the disc.&&Honestly, I'm surprised Disney didn't just buy Netflix whole-cloth. Probably would have been a better move than this.&&At some point there will be a huge list of paid online demand services that nobody subscribes to. They see what Netflix and Amazon are doing thinking that it's easy.&&Here I go pirating again!&&This is a big blow for Netflix. In losing Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars movies they are losing a massive chunk of their already-shrinking non-original content draw.&&Ah well, I guess I won't watch Disney movies. &&This... This is how pirates are created &&$8 for Netflix, $8 for Hulu, $10 for HBO Go, $10 for Amazon prime......It's just cable all over again&&If everyone is Netflix, no-one is Netflix. 

People are not going to pay $12 for each streaming service, they are willing to pay $12 total. This fragmentation will only lead people back to the piracy that was a huge problem for the industry pre-Netflix. 

My guess is that people will end up rotating where they are subscribed, I don't see how each service can remain viable when they essentially only have a fragment of the subscribers at any given time. &&Yeah soon everyone will have their own streaming service but give it 10 years and someone will come out with a revolutionary new service that offers all different programming on individual platforms, or channels if you will, free as a package however to supplement costs they will just have minor breaks within programs for advertisement spots. Revolutionary.&&Didn't they JUST sign a deal with Netflix which recently took effect?!?

I refuse to pay for any more services. I'll just pirate everything else. Their greed will be their downfall.&&They've been doing it in the UK for about a year already, very few Disney movies are on Netflix. &&This was inevitable, and I'm sure Netflix knew it, the way they've been investing so heavily in original content.  

I think a Disney service is one of the few that actually could be sustainable based on how much older nostalgic content they have - I'd love to have access to some of their classic stuff like the Disney Afternoon shows or the obscure live action movies.&&[removed]&&And I won't subscribe to that service.

I don't want to subscribe to thirty different streaming services, two to three at most, and I sure as hell don't find any of these groups that are starting streaming services just for their own content to be worthwhile.

Their studio division has more experience in making movies and TV shows than Netflix does, so if they want to produce original content for the service they already have the infrastructure in place. And they're a larger brand than Netflix is, especially with families. That's a market Netflix & co have tried desperately to get into.

And they just bought the most advanced streaming tech company in the world that isn't Netflix (BAM Tech, formerly a division of MLB Advanced Media, which already powers HBO Now, MLB At Bat, NHL's streaming, the WWE Network, and WatchESPN.)

People complaining about this just being one more streaming service among many are missing the point. Disney is the reason Apple was able to launch iTunes movies and TV with so much content in so many genres on day 1. Netflix is not only losing access to those movies, Disney has all the cards needed to become the biggest single competitor to Netflix in the content streaming market.&&Please people don't support this. Next thing you know all of the major studios will be pulling their stuff off Netflix. 

Only a matter of time until AMC tries this with their shows imo. &&I can't afford all of these different streaming services. I feel like I'm getting gouged. Fine Disney, I'll no longer watch Disney movies through streaming services... Aka I'll stop watching Disney movies&&This must just be a plot to get us to go back to paying for cable.  By making streaming ineffective, or at the very least costly. Who is gonna get a Disney only streaming service? Even if it would have a lot of content (disney, lucasfilm, marvel, pixar, ABC, and more)&&Something like this happened in the games industry a while back. Now it's at its limit with 3 services: 
Steam, Origin and Uplay. People won't really put up with more. And those are free of charge services.

Cluttering streaming services is a terrible idea, considering people usually might pay for 2, but certainly not for every niche. We have Netflix, Amazon Prime & HBO... isn't that sufficient?&&Great...now everyone's starting a streaming service!&&God fucking damn it. Just what we need, another streaming service.&&Can't wait to sign up!!!!! Not.

We all want the movies/shows/games/music/etc to be on one platform for simplicity, but we also want competition from different services so companies don't get complacent. 

Not sure if there's any real way to balance this, just an observation.&&The reason Netflix works so well is because it has a lot of content that people want to watch, they don't want to use multiple services if Netflix has all of it. 

As a consumer in his 20's I might want to occasionally watch a Disney movie here and there if it was on Netflix because it's convenient, and even if I am 20something everyone likes a Disney movie now and then! But I would not go out of my way to get a Disney app then pay for a Disney service. &&Yup. They're exercising an option to pull out.

Right now I'm using Netflix, Amazon Prime, VUDU (not a subscription service and it's owned by Walmart), iTunes, Google Play, and Hulu.

I'm getting a bit annoyed at all of the different applications I have to dive through to watch my content.&&Just hook up with 4-5 other friends, and all of you each pay for one account each, and you all share passwords, that way you all have access to all of them.&&Except you can actually pick and choose competing services, get specialized content based on the platform, and still don't have tv commercials. 

Reddit is always begging for direct pay-for content and then start bitching when they realize content costs money. 

&&This is the biggest thing to me. Spotify, Apple Music, and Google Play all offer more or less the same selection and you get to choose which one you prefer. Is the music industry dying? Not at all.

I will absolutely not pay for more than one video service (not counting Amazon Prime Video which is a bonus). I choose Netflix because they did it first. If it's not on Netflix I will find other ways of watching it. 

It was ridiculous how much Netflix was having to pay for old movies and TV shows that people would not be re-watching if they weren't on there, and it's ridiculous that movie studios think they can make more money by making it more difficult and expensive to watch stuff.&&Could be worse. Check out the publishing industry. They're making cable and Hollywood look like techno-savants by comparison.

> Big Publishers: We don't like this ebook thing. Not one bit. It puts too much control in the hands of the authors and the public.

This digital age stuff is just a fad, and we need to remind people of that. You got all that? (Question directed to the employee typing minutes on a typewriter) Good.

If the service includes their back catalogue of movies and Disney Channel shows the service could very easily appeal to families. When I was a kid I had a stack of Disney VHS, my daughter had a stack of Disney DVD's, kids in the future might have instant access to everything Disney through streaming. This move is something that could work for Disney, maybe not everyone else though.&&I'm curious about that as well.

My bet is that it will end the deal in Canada, but Disney will never get around to setting up their Canadian service anyway.&&I wonder if maybe Disney will bundle their streaming service with ESPN.&&I'm confused by what that means.

&&Can we just have Steam for movies/TV shows? 1 place/1 app/1 account to deal with and you can access almost any content from the medium available. Big regular sales, can redownload content anytime, etc. Thats a system that beats piracy.&&Libertalia?&&1- Control+F *Blackjack*

If there's any company out there who has the content to start up a streaming service, Disney is that company.&&I see 90% of the Disney subscribers being daycare owners&&[deleted]&&This is way more effective. Ideally for Disney other studios all pull their contents and start their own service.

Iger going for the long con.&&Netflix is a bit of an anomaly in that arena but companies seem to think that they can use their format for easy money.

Heck, the only reason Amazon's streaming service has done well is because it is included free with Amazon Prime (which costs about as much as Netflix per year), which a ton of people already had and it created yet another incentive for others to subscribe. &&Do what you want cause a pirate is free, you are a pirate! &&Duh-da-da-da duh-duh-da-da.......link up me hearties yo ho!&&Ok, Reddit so what is the Netflix strategy to counter this?&&*won't pay for Disney movies&&Where do you get premium cable for 36 bucks a month?

They have brand appeal and a gigantic catalog. &&I bet a buy-out / partnership deal where Reed Hastings maintains control was being explored, but Hastings couldn't let go of his baby. 

Keep in mind that Bob Iger, although his contract has been extended to 2019, will be leaving sometime in the next few years. He seems to have been the nexus of all of these great Disney content deals happening and succeeding. We'll see what happens next. &&They could still buy Netflix down the road though.&&Everyone's  getting greedy

We will end up with over a dozen streaming sites 

Then someone will have the ""brilliant"" idea of putting all these stations in one package.

&&Wouldn't there be consequences for pulling out of the deal? I can't imagine the contract between them states Disney can just end it, consequence-free, at any time. Netflix likely paid them for their content assuming they would have it for *x* amount of time, after all.

So Netflix is probably going to be getting **a lot** of money if Disney pulls out.&&They signed [the deal in 2012](http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/04/entertainment/la-et-ct-netflix-takes-disney-pay-tv-rights-from-starz-20121204)&&Which is ironic, because here in Canada starwars is on Netflix. Rogue one just came out last month. So that will be leaving as well.&&They face an issue however where children don't grow up in cable owning households.  And I guess they're going to hope parents will pay for the separate service?  Either way it segments the brand in dangerous ways for them as cable cutting expands.  

If the kids don't watch it and Netflix spends on kids originals they've created an environment where these kids grow up not seeing Disney outside of theaters?  &&Plus I've started to see people on r/Netflix ask for a channel that randomly plays episodes of different shows. It's all coming back to Cable. &&Or more and more people will start pirating because it's way easier &&The worst part is I can't even track easily on what medium a show is. I have Netflix, Stan (an Australian streaming done by some of the owners of some FTA stations), ABC iview (like BBC for Australia), Foxtel Go (streaming for my cable service), and more. If I'm looking for a show, sometimes I have to jump around to find it. I have no idea who was the rights.

Currently, I can watch the new season of Suits on Foxtel Go and the old seasons on Netflix. However, they're missing the last 6 episodes of the penultimate season on Netflix. So, I'm stuck. It seems my only option is to download. I'm seriously considering investing in a better system to illegally download and play shows and canceling my legal subscriptions, because what's the point if they make it so damn hard so often.&&Except that the streaming services will figure out a way to track who is using what, and will shut down the ability to share.  I think Netflix can already do it, but they don't care right now.  Once they start getting squeezed, they will start caring.&&I hopped between Netflix and Hulu until my friend got Netflix. I pay for one, he pays for the other.&&This is the part I don't get. I wouldn't be surprised if streaming services like Spotify have actually increased music and concert sales of little known or older artists. I've often used it to discover the back catalogues of artists well before my time. 

There's masses of old movie and tv content in existence, much of it not even available on DVD, not to mention current tv content that lacks a following. Streaming could identify content worthy of making available for DVD or download sales and clearly has built audiences for current shows.  But instead of embracing platforms, studios are either charging insane amounts for otherwise unmonetized content and trying to build their own platforms that few people will pay for. &&> I choose Netflix because they did it first.

And Hulu has ads and all the other services have no selections. Netflix and Amazon Video (which costs nothing if you count it as a bonus for getting unlimited free two-day shipping) forever for me.

> It was ridiculous how much Netflix was having to pay for old movies and TV shows that people would not be re-watching if they weren't on there, and it's ridiculous that movie studios think they can make more money by making it more difficult and expensive to watch stuff.

Seriously. There's so much stuff that people simply would not be watching if it wasn't on a service, and then the companies justify it by saying ""well, we would have lost DVD sales."" No. No you wouldn't. People aren't gonna buy DVDs of shows that get recommended for them to try out. It doesn't work that way. There are so many shows I've only ever started because it's on a streaming service I have.&&Movies/shows cost a LOT more to produce than music albums probably.&&And then there's textbook publishers which are actually the void from which all nightmares spread&&I actually asked a publisher this question once. ""Why does your intangible ebook that required no printing, shipping, storage, etc $17.99 and your hardback $12.99?"" Their answer was that Amazon and some retailers do not allow them to name their price on the print versions. But they can on the ebook. So they use the ebook to make up for lost revenue on the print copy. 

So it goes. &&Physical book sales are actually coming back pretty significantly believe it or not. &&Are ebooks just as much as the physical books somewhere? I have a Kindle and save a lot by buying ebooks.&&Once or twice a year for me, and only for the occasional song that isn't available on Spotify.

Honestly, it's quite nice to have access to all the music I want to listen to without having to search, download, store, manage, catalogue, and back-up my own collection of mp3s. Spotify is worth every penny.

If only the same were true for movies, but I'm absolutely **not** prepared to pay for half a dozen different services. Not a chance.&&And I'm convinced this has been their plan all along.  They were just waiting to see if streaming services would last.&&Corporations are smarter than the consumer. We punch, they counterpunch.&&Except it'll depend on your internet connection so the picture quality will be worse and you'll sometimes have buffering.&&I have a special HBO subscription where I pay my bill 100% by occasional beers to my friend.

I imagine we'll see services stop dropping whole seasons at once to retain subscriptions.&&Yo ho, yo ho...&&Ads will then appear on the separate streaming services, thus completing the circle of life.  &&$7???? Not a chance in hell it'll be that cheap. &&I've been saying this for a while, and knew it would start with Disney. Disney has more than enough content to pull this off, along with HBO and a few others. Eventually we'll be paying as much for a handful of services as we were for cable. &&And then they will go ""see! Online streaming doesn't work!"" While entirely missing the point.&&And then eventually someone will package up assortments from all of them and offer you a single price for them. We'll call it....cable. &&But if you sign up for Crime Warner, you can pay $40 per month and get access to Disney, Fox, ABC, NBC, Sony, Marvel, FX, news, and for only $10 more per month, you can watch sports shows and HBO!&&Didn't they like..

Everything except *The Song of the South,* perhaps.&&Yep. It's been in the works for a couple years now. Disney Movies Anywhere will turn into this service. They know what they're doing. &&This is exactly what will happen. &&This is definitely a good possibility! Canadians tend to get screwed on streaming services. &&Bell will likely find some way to bamboozle things by buying the rights then only offering a Disney-specific cable package for $20/mo. Just like with HBO, really old stuff will get put on CraveTV but the new Marvel and Star Wars content will stay locked on cable.&&Honestly this is my hope.  IDK if you have ever subscribed to a porn site before, but when you sign up for one often you also get access to their affiliate sites.  This would be big in the regular streaming world.  I sign up for Disney and I get access to all the Disney/ABC Television Group affiliated services.  Suddenly a la carte TV service becomes something far more people can sink their teeth into. &&A separate service without a cable sub. If cable is dead in 5 years this ESPN thing would be why.&&Lol I see NHL on the list but we all know ESPN has no idea what hockey is...&&Yup. The whole reason Netflix has exploded like it has is because it's offered a great service at dirt cheap pricing - even at the current price points. And they've been very receptive to their user base, implementing things like profiles because they understand that account sharing is going to happen regardless.&&So many movies I didn't buy when they were cheap and readily available because they had been on Netflix ""forever"".&&Same, about 90% of my viewing is Netflix shows only.

I was ready to quit when they made it hard to view content from other countries via simple proxies because my region's content is shite. I was even more determined when they raised the price from around €7 to €10.

But then Orange is the New Black season 4 came out so I watched that and then I was definitely going to cancel. But then Marco Polo season 2 came out. And then Stranger Things came out, then season 3 of Bojack Horseman, then the Get Down, then Narcos season 2, then Black Mirror Season 3, then The Crown, then Lovesick season 2, then A Series of Unfortunate Events, then Love season 2, then Dear White People, then Sense8 season 2, then Master of None season 2, then House of Cards season 5, then Orange is the New Black season 5, then GLOW, then Castlevania, then Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later.

Agreeing with OP here, I'm not paying $10-15 a month per fucking service. 10 years from now a new service will roll out that ""combines them all"" and it'll all be hailed as brilliant...but it'll just be Netflix. 

Edit: I get it cable tv, same thing - my point is that it's just one big circle, not the evolution of service we hoped for. &&I love Adult Swim so much for putting the good stuff on their website. I feel with there should be ads or something so I know I'm supporting their choice to do that. &&I think I may just let shows queue up on services and then binge them at different times of the year. One month of netflix, one month off, one month of HBONow, one month off, one month of Prime, etc. I don't really watch a lot of streaming services when I can look forward to weekly network shows in the fall anyway. &&Adult Swim knows what's up. I don't have cable but I know I could pirate Rick and Morty pretty damn easily. However, I know I can stream it officially for free and give Dan Harmon an extra thousandth of a penny by watching on the website. I'll always pick the second option in that scenario. &&Disney might be the one company who can pull this off though. Parents might love it. If they have all the Pixar/Disney animations along with all the other family friendly stuff that Disney owns, it could be successful. 

Throw in the potential inclusion of the Marvel and Star Wars universes and this stands a chance. &&>I'll pay for Netflix because it has a big library.

For now.&&Sea turtles, mate.&&RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR&&Just watch, companies will start offering year long subscriptions only to stop people from doing that.&&Yeah, that's a legit way to combat the subscription model. I do this currently with some popular shows on Starz (American Gods) and HBO Now (Westworld and movies though I have to see GOT as soon as it hits the service) You end up paying only an extra $10-$20 a year that way if you let the shows pile up.&&Fuck CBS with a hot iron.&&EDIT: I rewrote this to be a bit more structured. Realized after writing it that I had a lot more to say about this than I thought I did...

I already quit. I was so hyped initially when it was just Crunchyroll. Be able to legally watch anime conveniently? Awesome! I was even still onboard when Funimation joined in - more competition is good!

But then even before stuff like Netflix and Anime Strike came around, things started to get shitty.

Crunchyroll episodes were often bad quality, especially on older shows. If you go look at Working!! on Crunchyroll it looks like it's 480p. The quality of subtitles is often severely lacking as well, as they made a lot of ""cringy"" and ""meme-y"" jokes in the subtitles like with Gabriel Dropout translating ""itadakimasu"" to ""In the name of the dark lord, amen"". They also tended to use the worst possible versions of shows, with stuff like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure being the censored version of the show. Also their servers are often really bad, with them going down every Saturday night like clockwork and basically being unusable until midnight.

Funimation, I have a lot fewer complaints about, but their Roku app was very laggy and frustrating to use for the longest time. They recently redid it, so that might be improved now (but I haven't yet used it). They also did some of the ""meme-y"" shit Crunchyroll did, like with the infamous ""gamergater"" line in Prison School. The actual subtitles themselves though on Funimation just always looked like crap. I don't know the technical terms here, but the subtitles were generally arranged very poorly on the screen and made it difficult to follow what was going on and who was talking. Funimation is mostly (exclusively?) dub focused now though, so again this might not be an issue anymore.

So yeah, this is a long rant. But basically what it boils down to is: Anime streaming had a lot of great potential and I (and many others) was totally on board with it and hype to be able to support the creators of content I liked. But then streaming services totally dropped the ball on quality and service, and now they're splintering like crazy and trying to force us to pay for 4 different subscriptions to watch the shows.

So the options are: 

1. Pay a *lot* of money to deal with shitty apps, laggy servers, bad subtitles, and poor video quality.
1. Pay nothing to get professional quality subtitles on the best possible versions of each show.

Not hard to see why a lot of people are starting to go back to option 2.&&[removed]&&Isn't Amazon kinda like that?  Some stuff's free through Prime, other stuff you pay to stream.&&On planet PC we have the same problem. Steam, Origin, Uplay, GOG... 

Edit: alright alright alright, it is not ""the same problem"" but it is somewhat comparable (ignoring the fact that u don't pay for the services) <3   &&> Can we just have Steam for movies/TV shows? 

No. Because publishers are obsessed with control and brand.

Many years ago I spent some time dealing with publishing industry people (even had a fancy dinner with some). At the time they didn't want their stuff online because they felt it would ""cheapen"" their product. Then, if they were going to go online, it would have to be on *their* terms, on *their service.* They wanted to be the ones making the money, not anyone else. There was no way film was going to end up online. Music was beginning to go online, but only with great reluctance.

I think the music and film publishers in particular are too used to having all the power; traditionally they've got to decide all the terms of any agreement, and they have this in-built hatred of anyone else having any power (or making any profit) from their stuff.

So if stuff does go online, it has to be on *their* service. They have to have complete control over pricing, release windows, ideally with only their-brand stuff. And they have to feel that they're getting a better deal than anyone else. Oh, and the other big thing they wanted at the time was for the tech companies to put in all the investment, create the service, secure it (with whatever meaningless anti-copying system the publishers demanded), bring in a large customer base and *then*, if they paid upfront, the publishers would let them use their content.

Steam works because Steam managed to get big enough before any one game publisher could say no. And now the independent gaming scene is large enough to keep it going even when the big publishers (looking at you EA) pull out.

iTunes works because Apple was in a position to just buy out all the music publishers if it didn't get its way.

Spotify worked because it was a small, foreign market, and even then it had to hand over a good chunk of its equity to the publishers.

Netflix's physical service was able to become a big thing (as with Amazon) due to the First Sale doctrine (why physical Netflix never took off in the UK - it would have been illegal). They then were able to leverage their market share to sneak in this streaming service, but that was before the film publishers thought it would be a big deal; it was just a niche thing (who had the Internet capacity to stream films, and even then, who would watch a film on a computer rather than a proper TV?). Once Netflix started doing well, you have film publishers pulling out again.

I'm not sure how Amazon managed to keep going. Again, I have a feeling it's a case of them being big enough to threaten to buy out publishers, or at least pay them lots of money.

But yes; a Steam for movies/TV would be great. But it isn't going to happen. Because the film publishers would never be willing to give up that much control, and would never be willing to share a platform freely and openly with anyone else.&&Ah yes, I have played Uncharted 4.&&wait, if disney has lucasfilm, does that mean they have indiana jones too? just curious&&Amazing original content that they've been pumping out. 

Oh, and not losing ""The Office""&&Push out more original content, make deals with the competition.

Netflix will throw in a single ad. They'll all throw in a single ad. Then two. Then it'll peak and then come back down. It's the pendulum of competition.

So much cheaper, companies didn't have to physically make anything, and hey, no paper usage if you're into the going green thing! But regular books are sticking around as a thing because of the pricing.   

Don't get me wrong, I like physical copies for a variety of reasons, but they take up space, are prone to damage, and God forbid if you're moving and you have to drag 3 boxes of books with you everywhere. I love that I can have 20 books and they weigh whatever the tablet weighs. &&Why wouldn't they be able to name their price?  That seems...wrong.

I will just go back to cable at that point. Or just pirate anything I want to watch. 

I'm happy to pay for it when it's easy, but when it becomes a chore I will have no part in it. &&The day I see an ad on Netflix is the day I cancel my account, and I'll try and make sure they know why.&&Streaming services are looking to turn out like your cable bill.

I'll probably stick with that model, though i love seeing the marvel movies come to Netflix when i can't make it to the theaters very often. I dunno, if it's reasonably priced it may be worth it.

This is exactly what i knew and feared would happen with these streaming services, they'd splinter and all cost $10-15. Getting 5 of them puts you right back to cable level costs, which was exactly why i dumped cable. Mark my words, eventually all the major channels will do the same thing.

What's hilarious about this statement is that compared to cable packages its still a fucking deal to by HBO Now, Netflix, Hulu, Youtube Red, and whatever the fuck Disney will be launching. And you'd get WAY MORE quality. 

&&Actually if Disney makes a netflix type service their catalog may actually tempt you to dump Netflix. Disney owns a FUCKLOAD of studios - Including Pixar, Lucasfilms, Marvel, ABC, A&E and ESPN.

Sure, they have Star Wars and Marvel, I'm not leaving Netflix for just marvel and Star Wars, I'm honestly willing to buy most of that content on a permanent basis anyway. What a bunch of assholes segmenting their shit off again. I thought they got away from this model when they rightfully determined that the Disney Channel wasn't worthy of a separate premium subscription. They aren't HBO and you won't convince me they are.

Steam knows that if they honor keys that you buy elsewhere on their platform, and if they are great about refunds, and if they support linking to non-steam games for the overlay, and family library sharing, and mod workshop, and cloud saves, and all those other nice things that make Steam a pleasant experience then users will stick around so that when a sale pops up they can get some of that *other* cash.

Hell, Steam's service is SO good that people will re-purchase games they already have access to (from piracy, or friends, or on other devices or services) just to get integration into their library.

If a streaming service had cheap, a-la-carte streaming and downloading of tv and movies AND they honored purchases from other places (like direct from the studio or from 3rd parties) on their platform... my god it would be amazing.&&before stam, netflix, hulu (without ads), and other of these services i just pirated everything. now i wont. see disney is gonna start seeing that the deal with netflix is waaaaay better than ANY shit they can do.&&And fully supported separate profiles for different viewers.

The rest is owned by:

Disney Company (through Disney–ABC Television Group) 30%

21st Century Fox (through Fox Entertainment Group) 30%

Hulu is basically the traditional media giants pooling together to try to get the upper hand in the streaming game. &&Thus I have been known to not put ESPN on at all.&&See, that would spell the death of this service for me as a consumer because the Disney Vault is already a severely irritating model, but to do it like this where you don't even get to keep the edition as a collector (if that's your thing)? That's ludicrous. I could totally see them doing this, but I feel like anyone with even half a brain wouldn't buy into this.&&Parents would hate this too.

Studios have a ""hey, we're [insert studio name here], look at what we made!"" 

Truth is, millennials don't care about your name, they want good content. This is why Netflix Originals have been so successful (not all of them, I understand, but the unexpected quality of said originals is notable).&&Yea I will gladly not watch Disney movies. They are dumb for doing this. Netflix,HBO, Hulu is all that I will pay for and the first of those to go will be Hulu but will not be replaced by another streaming company. People don't want to pay the same as they do for cable, and if I have to pay for 7 different services then I won't bother. Netflix is by far the best and a close second is hbo. &&Currently I work like this. If it's on Netflix, I'll watch it there. If it's not, I'll pirate it. It's that simple.

How about trying a non exclusive model where I can watch it on Netflix OR through you. Maybe Netflix has the movie, but if I go to your service, I can get extras like deleted scenes, directors cuts, etc. Now you're offering me an incentive besides ""because we took it off Netflix"" which just causes animosity and makes me want to either not watch it or pirate it because fuck you too.&&They just don't care. Why would they want Netflix to succeed? &&There was a brief period of time where i actually went without pirating, steam had me covered for most games and netflix and Hulu had me covered for tv and movies, but as more and more streaming services started popping up, each taking a chunk of the media with it.  I stopped paying for the ones that only had one or two shows i liked. I refused to continue and pay for a fractured service when i can get better service for free. I understand that it costs money to create new content and i try and refrain from pirating new shows but I can't believe that it would be outside of disney's ability to provide a comparable service to some random pirating service online when it comes to their older content. I still have netflix but i refuse to accept anything less. At this point each steaming service is little better then a cable bundle, and usually just as shitty.&&Im 27 and have been piratung since I was 12. There's no stopping me.

They have the option to have people like myself as a customer.. But im only going to do so if they don't make me give the cable companies money.

I've personally never seen anything like that living in the UK/elsewhere, sounds horrendous. &&I first noticed them recently, right next to the sticker saying to turn off all electronic devices around the gas pump.&&[deleted]&&The advertising industry will suffer. They'll be forced to pay more for showing products within a show, rather than outright commercials. IMHO that's a big step forward. 

The entire entertainment industry is moving this way. Even small production companies can easily host and distribute their media over the internet, and that's the best way to make money. Consumers paying you directly for the content you create. 

I'm sure traditional commercials will persist, especially to subsidize more expensive commercial-free subscriptions. But at least they're on the way out.&&I pay 11.99 for Hulu with no commercial.  I'm ok with that price.   I'm not ever paying for a service that has ads. You can give it to me free and have ads (OTA) or I'll pay for the content w/o commercials.&&For like $2 more than the base Hulu price you can get Hulu with no commercials. &&Let's make that the new meaning and screw with whoever made it up. &&It costs money to install and maintain these federal grant funded wires!

Yep! Making it easy to use and compatible is one of the main reasons I stay with Steam. EA tried to pull a Disney with their Origin platform, and I've pretty much refused to use it.

This is exactly how the music industry beat piracy, at least for the most part. They offered cheap, simple, and all in one options. People migrated to iTunes and Spotify in droves. Music piracy is now a niche thing for purists and hobbyists. The masses get their music, they pay for it, and it works. It might not be the cash cow it once was, but it *does* make them money.

Movies and TV aren't going to win this game any other way. It is too easy and convenient to stream literally *everything that exists* for free right now, that any expensive hurdles they want to offer up are not going to work.
&&Learning how to pirate things without getting caught is difficult.

Music on the other hand has managed to sell the rights to the same songs to nearly every company that does streaming, which allows new competitors to sometimes actually make a go for it without feeling like you're missing too much.

I believe it likely has to do with music having had to deal with things like sampling and whatnot, for far longer. They had to come to terms with the fact that lots of people wanted to use their content, from movies, tv, sampling, commercials, etc. So they have in place agreements for issuing rights for various purposes. 

Video media has long been ivory towers, keeping their content to themselves, and only letting it out via home video. They want to control every dime made from it, and cannot wrap their heads around these new distribution methods. Which is why, for instance, Netflix dvd catalog is vastly larger than their streaming catalog. Yet they have to mail you a physical disc, that can be easily copied by the user, but a much lower cost method of streaming is covered by entirely different, more stringent down agreements.

Gaming and music figured out how to beat piracy. Video has yet to understand the market, they are like that old guy on Craigslist trying to sell his 1998 IBM desktop pc for $2500, since you know, he paid $3500 for it. Its a deal.

&&Could you elaborate plz?&&[removed]&&Yeah, it's about cost, but also convenience. Netflix has a nice(r) interface than the others, not perfect by any means, but at least halfway ok. I'm not going to go from looking through netflix, to looking through amazon prime, to looking through hulu, to looking through each companies own streaming service to find something to watch. I'll look through netflix for something then usually pirate. Sometimes I'll check amazon but honestly even thats a hassle when I just want to watch some tv before bed. &&This is basically it. The same thing happened in gaming. Steam is super popular so big companies decided to create their own ""game services"". So gamers just pirate their games instead.

"On Dunkirk, Nolan strapped an IMAX camera in a plane and launched it into the ocean to capture the crash landing. It sunk quicker than expected. 90 minutes later, divers retrieved the film from the seabottom. After development, the footage was found to be ""all there, in full color and clarity.""",44247,6ul604,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6ul604/on_dunkirk_nolan_strapped_an_imax_camera_in_a/,1496,1503093885.0,"From *American Cinematographer*, August edition's interview with Dunkirk Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema - 


>They decided to place an Imax camera into a stunt plane - which was 'unmanned and catapulted from a ship,' van Hoytema says - and crash it into the sea. The crash, however, didn't go quite as expected. 

>'Our grips did a great job building a crash housing around the Imax camera to withstand the physical impact and protect the camera from seawater, and we had a good plan to retrieve the camera while the wreckage was still afloat,' van Hoytema says. 'Unfortunately, the plane sunk almost instantly, pulling the rig and camera to the sea bottom. In all, the camera was under for [more than 90 minutes] until divers could retrieve it. The housing was completely compromised by water pressure, and the camera and mag had filled with [brackish] water. But Jonathan Clark, our film loader, rinsed the retrieved mag in freshwater and cleaned the film in the dark room with freshwater before boxing it and submerging it in freshwater.' 


>[1st AC Bob] Hall adds, 'FotoKem advised us to drain as much of the water as we could from the can, [as it] is not a water-tight container and we didn't want the airlines to not accept something that is leaking. This was the first experience of sending waterlogged film to a film lab across the Atlantic Ocean to be developed. It was uncharted territory.""

Would it? I don’t know what kind of media high-end digital cameras use. Probably something solid-State though? So they’re saying a flash drive wouldn’t have survived 90 minutes at the bottom of the channel? What am I missing? 

Seems fishy to me. &&>This material would have been lost if shot digitally

\#celluloidmasterrace&&It's basically my #1 dream in life to get to point where I can convince other people to crash a plane into the ocean because that's the way I want to do it.

I mean the Spitfire is a historical artifact, and it's crazy enough to fly them in dogfight scenes.

Not necessarily. Even consumer-grade flash memory is surprisingly resilient and frequently works after immersion for days, weeks, months or sometimes even years.

&&I think you mean. ""Yesssss, YESSSSSSSSS. Let it fall from the SKY into NOTHINGNESS. For the shot of course""&&Yeah I doubt this claim too.

I've personally recovered footage undamaged from two different digital cinema cameras (one Sony, one Red) that went into sea water while recording. In one case every clip was fine, in the other case the clip that was being recorded when the camera went in hadn't be written correctly but was recoverable without too much difficulty.

So, no, there's absolutely no assurance that a digital camera in the same circumstances would have been a total loss. 

There are definitely circumstances where digital footage has survived things that film cameras wouldn't have. I can't remember which film (a Fast and Furious, maybe) but I read of an instance where a camera was completely destroyed by a vehicle. The data on the card survived. A film camera would have been total loss as mag would have broken and exposed the film.&&Maybe the media gets corrupted in the event of power loss before the stop button is pushed.

>\#celluloidmasterrace

It's probably not true, though. To be honest, I'm fairly out of the loop on modern digital cinematography. But I'm sure that the bitrate required for high-resolution filming nowadays requires solid state media of some sort, like an array of extremely high speed flash of some sort, which is nearly shockproof and, at least while off, effectively waterproof.

That's how much they value cameras! And you know there wasn't any state of the art expensive cameras on that film like this one. &&Kind of? IMAX was able to repair the camera that was destroyed on the set of The Dark Knight Rises, so this was probably a walk in the park for them (given that there are like a dozen or so IMAX documentary films that had cameras underwater for long periods of time).&&Standard practice in the conservation of archaeological materials in submerged contexts is to use freshwater baths to dilute the salt until you reach an acceptable salinity to begin the drying process using organic solvents. &&I used to be a camera assistant.

SSDs have no moving parts or internal air spaces, so they could be more easily waterproofed, but if salt water did get inside, it would make data recovery very difficult.

&&If anything digital would be better because you can house the components in waterproof boxes with wires in a way that physical film physically moving from a can into the body behind the lens and then back into the storage can is just mechanically weaker and full of necessary holes.

I'm not sure even that's fair. We've been led by Hollywood to expect crazy flying stunts, so that when we see flying of a sort that regular pilots could actually do, we're sometimes disappointed.

O&&/r/baneposting&&On the follow-up question, you can't easily make a comparison of which is ""better"" on IMAX vs RED.

IMAX [has roughly 12000 lines of equivalent horizontal resolution](http://www.tested.com/tech/459274-lets-clear-some-imax-misconceptions/), which makes it roughly comparable to 12000x5400, or 64.8 Megapixels. However IMAX is typically digitized for mastering, often in 4K, so much of this resolution advantage is sacrificed. It does leave the possibility of remastering at higher resolution in the future as technology advances though. You can actually see Blu-Ray releases of some pretty old movies because of this. Red goes up to 8K, which is roughly 2/3rds the resolution of 75mm but like 75mm, it's typically mastered in 4K.

Somewhere IMAX severely loses out is dynamic range. Dynamic range refers to the width of the amount of light you need to get total 100% white on your image and the amount you need to get 100% black. Digital cameras, particularly RED, have a huge advantage of film when it comes to this. Film is typically 10 stops. RED can do closer to 16, which on a log scale means roughly 64x more range.

So you can't say either is ""better"" any more than you can say a Ferrari is better than a truck. They're good at different things.

EDIT: A bunch of people have pointed out a number of important mistakes in my post:

- Old movies being remastered has nothing to do with IMAX. What I meant was that film, even old film, has very high resolution, which has means it can be remastered in high quality digitally despite being quite dated. If you shoot in 1080p digital today, your footage will always be 1080p. Shoot in 35mm today and even if you master in 1080p now, you can remaster in much higher resolution later.

- My 10 stop number for film is completely wrong. I was basing this number on consumer 35mm camera film. Apparently cinema grade film is better. Who knew? Seems IMAX is at least on par with RED here. I'd really like to see proper tests if anyone has them.

I didn't mean to make this a comprehensive comparison of the two though, just point out that it's not black and white that one's better than the other.&&I'm not sure exactly, fiance works in film and said it's a 70mm IMAX camera, of which he believe there are only 2 left, because Christopher Nolan broke the other 3.

And to answer your follow up question, IMAX is all on film, so the quality is *way* higher then digital can be as of now.

tl;dr resolution doesn't say much about the final quality.

I don't know where you read the 20K number from but if it's from Christopher Nolan's mouth I guarantee he exaggerated the numbers. Like when he says 35mm film has a resolution of 6K (24 megapixels) and yes that's true BUT that's for Vistavision which is typically only used for visual effects or miniature shots in movies. The actual 35mm format that's typically used for shooting a movie tops out at 4K (8 megapixels) and even if you account for Christopher Nolan preferring to use anamorphic 35mm the resolution still stops out at 4K but with slightly different dimensions that bring it up to 9.4 megapixels.&&Eh, resolution is not that important.

Cats knock shit over like this all the time.&&Oh, shit.&&I paid you a small fortune &&To bring down the box office &&> Digital cameras, particularly RED, have a huge advantage of film when it comes to this. Film is typically 10 stops. RED can do closer to 16, which on a log scale means roughly 64x more range.

RED claim to be hitting over 16.5 stops at the moment.

Digital cameras can also do high frame rate recording (75 Hz at 8k 2.4:1), and can do it silently (you effectively can't use an IMAX camera for dialogue scenes, because they're too noisy).&&RED owner/operator here. Kodak Vision 3 stocks definitely have way more than 10 stops of latitude and more than Dragon/Helium without HDRx. Maybe you're thinking of reversal film. 

Every company tends to rate dynamic range differently due to noise floor tolerance, but out of every format I've used (RED, Arri Alexa included), film undoubtedly had the most dynamic range. RED's ""16.5 stops"" is about 0.5-1 stop lower than Arri's conservative 14 stop rating. Color negative film is easily 14-15 stops if handled properly.&&Sorry, feel the need to correct you. Projected, 15-perf IMAX trounces every recording medium in existence with regard to motion picture resolution. Scanned, we’re talking about 12-18k lines of resolution. 

I’ve never heard anyone describe dynamic range like that, ever, and it’s false. Color negative film has incredible dynamic range, MUCH more than 10 stops. If you want to see 10 stops, look no further than a Canon 5D Mk2. Dynamic Range has been one of film’s chief advantages over digital for quite some time, and likely still is. 

Source: I’m a professional cinematographer. 

&&Red is very, very good at not costing as much as an IMAX camera :)&&There is an important quirk to the dynamic range of film that narrows the gap more than the numbers suggest. 

Because film involves a chemical reaction, it doesn't happen at a linear speed. As film gets closer to fully exposed (i.e. white) the reaction gets slower and slower. This effectively creates a built in log-curve that means it's very rare for any part of a shot to ever go to 100% white. Even when it does, it does so in a gentle, natural looking manner.

By contrast digital is linear. Going from 0% to 10% and 90% to 100% both require the same amount of extra light. This means that when shooting with a digital camera you need to make sure you can capture a larger amount of dynamic range so that you can apply a log-curve afterwards, otherwise they look very 'flat' and unnatural. Those 16 stops are going to be compressed in to less than 10 anyway.

One final note, your figures for film are a bit off. Modern cinema films are ~14 stops, not 10.&&A strange thing I've noticed about film vs. digital is that even though the dynamic range of digital is better numerically, film shows highlights and shadows simultaneously with great detail and pleasing image quality. Digital seems to be you can adjust to have one one or the other look good in a scene with vast differences in brightness, but one is going to look bad, over or underexpsosed or faded from lifting. I don't know why this is or what its called but I think it's related to exposure latitude. I shoot stills with kodak c41 film with vision technology and I can get a bright sky and land in one shot with no graduated filter.  &&proper downscaling of images can actually make the overall sharpness and color quality better than the original, so going from 12k to 4k is really not that bad, its still high resolution, but it will look sharper than the original picture and the color fidelity will be better, because for proper downscaling to work you take an average of all of the red blue and green values in a mask (usually 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, or 9x9), and then that result is the new pixel of the downscaled image.&&35 and 65mm film is rated at 14.5 stops. &&Film is more like 13-14 stops, and depending on what stock you're using you may still have more latitude in the highlights. 

Red's specs are laughable, it is not anywhere near 16 stops, more like 12-13.

Geoff Boyle's CML website has done extensive tests over the years. &&Nolan needs to get more of these custom built or he'd run out of them. &&like two left in the whole world? can they make more?

There were 26 500ft models in 2009, and that number has probably greatly increased since.

There are four 1000ft models in the world, one of which was damaged, not destroyed, by Catwoman's stunt double while riding the Batpod during the filming of The Dark Night Rises.

First off, there aren't only 2 IMAX cameras left. That was just some nonsense articles spread after the Dark Knight camera got destroyed. Apparently there were 26 in 2009 and since Inhumans is shooting on IMAX cameras, I'm pretty certain there are now more than 26.

Second, what do you mean the film reel is taller than a person? You mean the mags for the camera? Or the reel that gets sent to the cinemas for projection? 

The magazine seems to be only a small box - [pic 1](http://8cn.info/sites/default/files/styles/500x262/public/50imax.jpg?itok=H1cQVriw) [pic 2](http://www.trbimg.com/img-59081a1f/turbine/la-fi-ct-imax-christopher-nolan-20170424) and it's certainly not taller than a person.

The film it uses is a 70mm in width - that's not taller than a person. If you mean when the entire reel gets unraveled that the length is longer than a person..... yeah, well, anything over 4 seconds long would be. And that's shooting on 35mm.&&[There's at least 26 now.](https://www.quora.com/What-is-so-special-about-an-IMAX-camera-Also-why-are-there-only-4-of-them)&&Can't they, like make more?&&Not to mention the dynamic range has to be wider than your mom.

Resolution is only a small part of the overall image quality. &&Their phone at 4K can't even compare to a professional 4K movie camera.  &&[deleted]&&Only one (exciting) way to find out...&&Or more importantly a quality sensor&&IMAX is 70mm, just run through the camera “sideways” Most film is shot with the holes or “perfs” on the left and right, 70mm film is generally shot 4 perfs high. IMAX rotates the film so the perfs are top and bottom, and then it’s 15 of those wide. It’s a huge exposure area. 

*edit: I wanted to correct myself, 70mm film is run with 5 perfs on the left and right, it's 35mm film that is 4 perfs high&&I work in film. There are some movies where you eat like that for lunch every day haha.

But you're exactly right about studios. Producers will try to keep costs low here and there, but I can almost guarantee they budgeted for this shot and the potential for losing the camera when they made the budget for the movie. The studios will try to keep the cost low when they can, but they know making a great movie that will make them a ton of money will cost them a lot of money. But they know it's worth it and will pay off big time in the end.&&BACK TO BACK!&&Or is ran over by a vehicle, like that one time on the set of The Dark Knight Rises.&&IMAX was able to repair the cameras.

It's possible, but it's also possible they could lose that data.

Water pressure is a bitch. &&Couldn't you just pre-fill the SSD with distilled water or oil? That way, the pressure will be equal on the inside and on the outside, not matter which depth you're at, since water is nearly incompressible.&&Exactly. Most people think that electronics/electronic memory are bad with water and all is lost if they get wet. Actually the electronics are almost always 100% intact, it is the metal contacts that die as they get corroded or shorted - the latter indeed killing electronics if a power source is available. Silicon itself is very resilient, and if you have the tools and know-how data can be retrieved even from partially burnt hard drives.&&You skipped the ""wash the salt off"" step.

Having no moving parts on SSDs means virtually no air voids and pressure differentials on the storage media. 

What I'm saying is that the data is usually recoverable from the storage media (NAND) chips, not that the whole drive itself will survive intact. Agree with you that the drive power electronics and connector interface are always the first to go in catastrophic events. 

Not bulletproof of course, high enough energies will destroy anything.&&There's really no need.   An SSD is just a PCB with chips on it.  There's no air voids, or pressure sensitive components.   There's nothing the water is going to immediately damage except create a power short and cause whatever damage stems from that.

Take the SSD from the water, rinse it to remove any residues and dry it off and it'll probably work just fine.  If it doesn't, then the actual flash chips are almost certainly fine and may need moving to a new PCB (or replace the power supply circuit on the original).

You can try this at home by putting your SD cards in water and seeing they still work after they're dried off.

*Most things that are worth preserving also need to have a bulking agent applied and most bulking agents use an organic solvent. Waterlogged wood left to evaporate the water will warp heavily if not simply crumble to nothing. Leather reacts quite poorly to being left to dry out as well. Metallic objects are slightly different and composite items of suitable complexity can generate a thesis worth of research material. &&Still cameras often still use acetate however movie cameras generally use polyester as the high speed of film transport tends to damage acetate.

Fun fact, 35mm polyester movie film is strong enough to hold a persons weight and climb if suitably anchored (I would have been around 100kg at the time, which is probably like 10 stone or 1300 pounds or something). It can actually be annoying to work with sometimes due to it's strength (it tends to break things such as transport gears rather than breaking itself).

The main problem with getting seawater on movie film is the antihalation layer isn't a dye like still film, it's a physical carbon layer which will wash around. Generally it's removed using a basic bath and brush however if it's allowed to wash around it will become entrapped inside the film emulsion and leave black spots in the image.&&I've no experience with modern film but I suspect that due to the exceptionally short amount of time it spent in seawater it was pretty easy to flush out the salt and the film was probably more or less okay. &&Acetate was mostly abandoned in the 70s - I believe - when archivists discovered this type of film stock leads to vinegar syndrome. Polyester stock, commonly used by moving image and still photographers today, does not decay as quickly (in appropriate conditions) and isn't as susceptible to shrinkage as acetate is.&&ECE?

Thanks. &&what about everything else tho like color grading, special effects, etc?&&Oh yeah I totally agree with you there, it's why I kind of find it funny whenever people go around saying digital isn't future proof compared to film and its infinite resolution.

This is necessitated by the use of polyester film base for strength and the light piping it can cause.

Consider that even if all of the electronics in the camera were 100% fried, that still might not be the majority of the cost of the equipment.

'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' Will Mark End of the Current Character Line-up,37945,6rz6sp,http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-james-gunn-line-up-change-ravagers-sylvester-stallone-peter-quill-a7879246.html,2319,1502035909.0,,"I remember reading somewhere that Bradley Cooper isn't signed on for a multi picture deal like the rest of the cast  and rather just picture-to-picture with very limited promotion appearances. It's a very unique deal as far as Marvel is concerned. Maybe they will wrap up Rocket's storyline in the next one?&&*Now That's What I Call ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Vol.43*&&Can someone tell me what the fucking hell has gone wrong with online news sites?

[Why do they cover so much of the actual article with overlaid bullshit?](http://i.imgur.com/HhjemSk.png)

I measured. On a 1920x1080 display, the vertical reading area is 900 px and they fucking cover 200 px of that (22%!) with a fucking video that follows you around as you try to read.

[I deleted the element in chrome and look at that, it's almost like a normal article!](http://i.imgur.com/Lkt0aOS.png)

I have no idea why this kind of thing is acceptable. It makes it so hard to read the actual article, not to mention I have to get extensions to immediately stop any autoplaying videos that these news sites try to force down your throat.&&Pretty interesting to see how Marvel Studios was able to turn some no-name comicbook into a big hit with the public audience. Don't think GotG were ever really big as much as they are now.


They made such a name for this team, that they're confident that they can change lineups and still make another hit/good story with solely the GotG name. Let's see how things go.&&I know they made it for pretty much a cameo, but I'd love to see the ""Original"" guardians squad come together in their own movie. Stallone and Rhames seemed like they'd make for an interesting team. &&GOTG characters have not had the same screen time as Avengers characters and think i that sorta sucks

i want to see much more of Quill & co before they say goodbye xx&&He says it's going to be the end of the current lineup but I don't think it's going to be the end of all of the characters. It will be like the avengers lineup changes from the first movie to the second. Quill and gamora will probably stick around and then they'll get some new members. Maybe if the Sony thing keeps going well we'll get agent Venom? &&I feel...sad. I've come to love these characters so much. Hopefully they won't be killed off and might still return.&&Infinity Wars is gonna fuck some shit up &&PSA: Gunn said this will be the end of the *current line-up*. He didn't say it would be a total overhaul.

It might be, he might completely go off and follow the Ravagers or someone else

or he could just change up the line-up a bit, get rid of a few people. I looked through the sourced articles and while he might ""explore"" the Ravagers, it doesn't necessarily say he's ending the entire cast of what we have now.&&Everyone keeps saying how great it is that Marvel took ""no-names"" and did something. I feel thats an advantage in these days and one Marvel has used well. Everytime a Batman or Superman movie gets made, its broken down compared to the characters lore. ""Batman doesnt do this"" or ""Superman isnt suppose to be like that"". 

Meanwhile, Tony Stark or Peter Quill can be whatever they want. Stark too much of an ass in the comics? Lets make him funny. &&I'm betting the new team will function like the Infinity Watch did in the comics.  They will be responsible for guarding the gems after Infinity War. Warlock will most likely be added to the team since he was hinted at in GOTG vol 2.&&GOTG 3 will mark the end of the current playlist.

Long live 90s alternative college radio hits!&&So 5 movies in total for all these characters? Not bad for a crew that 99% of the human population had never heard of prior to the first GOTG.&&I just hope they wrap up Rocket's story for us. He's my favorite character and I want to see some kind of closure for him. &&So Howard The Duck will need to get a new gig?&&GotG has the potential to be an absolutely incredible trilogy, not just by MCU standards but in general. I definitely see myself doing a lot of back-to-back viewings of the first two once Vol 2 is out, I think they really compliment each other and go hand-in-hand. 

I really hope that GotG3 isn't bogged down too much by Infinity War aftermath, it would be nice to have a solid trilogy that you can watch by itself. The Cap trilogy is fantastic, but The Avengers and (moreso) Age of Ultron are basically required viewing to understand what's happening. However I fear that Thanos' fate will be a huge aspect of Gamora's arc in the third GOTG, so it'll probably be necessary to watch Infinity War. &&Isn't that because they will probably be in like the next 3 or 4 movies related to Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet?&&Man I don't know if I can handle a change in characters... It's just never the same&&Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 is still the greatest Marvel movie I've ever seen.&&The second GotG was good but not on the same level as the first one. It was great in terms of giving the side-characters more screen-time and exploring their backstories and personalities. Baby groot was awesome too.

The over-arching story though with Ego was not as fun as I thought it would be. Narratively though, it was solid and it was well-written. 

It's hard to capture the feeling of the first movie.

All in all, it was still a good movie.&&In one way, it's really sad. I love the series a LOT! I love the characters, I love the music, I love everything. But all good things come to an end, and it's a fitting end, because Gunn will be (presumably) leaving the series, and he turned this series into a massive hit and Marvel took a chance on these characters and it paid off really well. Groot alone made this series happen.

If I had to make a guess when it comes to ""current"" line-up, I can tell you, for marketing purposes, Groot or Rocket will not die, actually, I can see Marvel doing a spin-off movie with just the two of them (which would be epic). Drax would be the only character I can think of that could possibly die, only because he lost everything, and if Thanos is killed or dies either in the Avengers movies or in GOTG 3, then his goal is done and his storyline has concluded - and I can see himself sacrificing himself to save his GOTG family. The rest is up for grabs, they are leaning towards Peter and Gamora ending up with each other, but it could change with Infinity Wars. Peter's storyline itself has concluded practically (no spoilers). 

Either way, I'm excited to see what Marvel has up their sleeves for future GOTG series, knowingly it can't be the end. They still have Stallone and gang to do!&&Is it possible we will see king Quill in the near future? I adored that time line&&Hmm, GOTG has been fun but it feels like they are still telling the origin story.

If they swap out the characters it would be origin story mode 2.0.&&I'll just be glad that Baby Groot is gone. Easily the worst part of GotG2. In the first he was at least an asset and dumb. In the second he was used solely for dumb comic relief (in a group consisting almost entirely of comic relief).&&I'm hoping they get joined by Agent Venom and Iron Man. &&I hope they let the Guardians exist to a point where it doesn't feel milked... but it lasts long enough and when it's over, it's a perfect finish.&&GOTG, other than the high production/CGI costs, feels like it could be an excellent TV show. &&Good. Starlord is running out of parents &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I have never clicked an independent article until now.

Now I understand why Reddit hates them.

Why is there a banner with a video scrolling down as I read? It's almost like the article is just there to hold me while video ads play.&&I feel. Happy, I rather see a good trilogy than milking the cast through 9 movies&&Can we get a full size groot at least?&&Well they all have to be so exhausted from all of the filming in space.&&As long as the writing is self depricating, subversive and charming, they have room to operate. 

Guardians is a triumph of casting and self aware writers. &&Not sure if I should downvote it because it makes me sad, or upvote it because it was a good article.

Either way, this makes me sad. :(&&I pretty much expect nothing to survive in its current form post Avengers Part 3 Part 2. &&As more time passes, the more I realize I didnt like the 2nd one very much.&&In the words of Yondu...

***OH HELL***&&I thought it was really odd that he and Vin Diesel weren't doing press tours before GotG2 came out. I was worried that Cooper wasn't interested in it anymore and that Rocket wouldn't have much of a role at all in the film. Thankfully that wasn't the case, but this worries me. Rocket is one of my favourite characters in those films.&&Even if Cooper leaves I don't think Rocket will go anywhere. Not only is he a merchandising goldmine but as CGI characters Rocket and Groot don't age and the actors behind them are much easier to replace.&&Interesting since all of the animated characters would have much longer shelf lives on screen since just the actors' voices are needed. Look how long The Simpsons have lasted.&&They'll just get a new voice. &&I think they're gonna wrap up Drax's story, instead. He sort of got over the crimes committed against him. He found a love interest. At the end of GOTG 3, he will settle down with the love interest.&&Do they still make Now albums?&&I opened the article in a new tab and didn't read it for several minutes.  By the time that I got to the tab, the video had finished and redirected the page to a new article, and then one more article after that.  I had to hit back a few times just to get to the original page I had want to read.  That strikes me as a problem.&&[the mobile web in 2017](https://i.imgur.com/fUIFl85.png)&&The mobile web especially is a disaster because of this shit.&&It's also just a rehash of the original article from [*The Hollywood Reporter*](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-guardians-3-marvels-cosmic-plans-1027046?utm_source=twitter).

All links still work and any pictures in the article itself will still show up. But no random pictures on the side or other stories or anything.&&The Independent online exists because it abuses Reddit as a platform to get clicks.&&And they complain we use ad blockers...&&I work for a local, small paper. We have similar video ads coming from the left, right, top and bottom. Trust me, if we could get rid of it we would, but we’re desperate and broke, and it brings in revenue as a last ditch effort. If you’re not a large publication like the New York Times or are successful with social media, it’s hard to make money. Our ad revenue has been declining, and print is dying too. Plus more viewers are using adblockers or finding other ways to get their news. &&They don't care if you read the article, only if they can get more advertising money.&&I completely understand but as a mostly mobile user Safari plus Reader view equals plain black text on white background. No ads no auto play video BS. &&Yesterday I saw an npr article here in reddit and I have to say that's one of the best sites to read/listen news I've seen and I wish my country had something like that.&&I don't get that bullshit anymore since I disabled javascript and use readermode.

It's impossible to use much of the web without ublock origin and probably good to add a dose of noscript and ghostery. 

As to why it is this way? Well, online advertising pays the bills, especially for people who click through. Some people just assume website should have ads, and something like .02 percent of people actually clicking on ads is considered a win.&&Not sure if this was pointed out in the comments but add ""outline.com/"" before the url to cut out the overlay.

Heres the article: [https://www.outline.com/KBRS5T](https://www.outline.com/KBRS5T):

Pretty neato. Thanks whoever made it :)&&Because they are desperate for ad revenue. Not defending these annoying ads, but the sad truth is that ad blockers have made it almost impossible for media sites to stay afloat. They end up doing 2 things to stay profitable:

1) Annoying video overlays and pop up banners

2) Sponsored content and ""advertorials.""

The first one is super annoying, and the second one has actually damaged the legitimacy of online news. Half the shit you read these days has been paid for by a brand. 

We really shot ourselves in the foot by blocking ads.&&Maybe they can do Alpha Flight next. Just gotta leave out the whole ""Weapon X"" thing...

Edit: Maybe even Excalibur, but they have waay too many ties to X-Men.&&I don't think the fact that it originated as a comic has any relevance to its success. It became popular with the public because of the great writing, cast, humor, story, visuals, etc. Likewise, WB has shown that one can easily ruin a movie adaptation of a popular comic.&&When it’s all said and done, this summer GoTG2 will have done 50+ million more than Spider-Man Homecoming in the states. Mighty impressive for its sophomore turn.&&I hope Gunn gets to retire the characters with dignity. With the Avengers, it makes sense for the team to go through shakeups - they're an idea, a shield for planet Earth. They've already set a precedent for swapping up the team. They can get away with tagging people - even heavyweights like Iron Man and Cap - in and out. They even have the benefit of replacements waiting in the wings: Strange, Panther, Spidey, Captain Marvel, etc. 

But the Guardians are different. To me, the Guardians are those specific characters doing a very specific thing. They're not out to save the universe - they're just a bunch of asshole mercenaries for hire who sometimes find occasion to be heroic. They're not an institution in the same way that the Avengers are. Swapping them out doesn't really make sense because they don't serve a super-specific purpose in the universe: they're outcasts by definition, and the idea is that they're just a bunch of semi-heroic losers. Once those characters are gone, so is the team. Hopefully Marvel recognizes that and lets them ride off into the sunset in whatever manner Gunn sees fit. If there was ever a series for Marvel to permanently retire once the original actors/director has left, this is it.&&> Pretty interesting to see how Marvel Studios was able to turn some no-name comicbook into a big hit with the public audience.


My wife put it perfectly. There was no need to have fan service. The majority of us went in not knowing what the hell Guardians of the Galaxy was. Everything felt fresh and new.&&Without a doubt it owes it to Chris Pratt. No matter how amazing everything about the movies, characters and actors/actresses was, it wouldn't be what it is with anyone else but Chris Pratt. At least not for me.&&Indeed. Both the marketing team and the filmmakers just nailed it completely. Me and every single one of my friends had no idea who they were, even some of the comic book nerds I know didn't really care for them. &&Iron Man wasn't that popular before the movies too right?&&It's particularly interesting when you compare it to DC's strategy with their movies. Marvel has been taking relatively unknown characters and turning them into massively successful movies, while DC went straight for their biggest names: Batman and Superman.&&In fairness, while GOTG was unknown, among comic fans it was fucking revered because the writing and characters were so good. I'm happy they were able to translate it well :)&&ITT it was because no one knew anything about it, and therefore had no expectations. I've grown up with Batman, Spiderman, and Superman, and whenever I go see a reboot I come in with expectations and am ready to draw comparisons to other movies I've seen.

Not possible here. It was very well acted, had a good plot, funny moments, and a great soundtrack. It also made its ""universe"" very accessible... so you didn't *need* to know anything about the comics.&&Amazing Squirrel Girl and the GLA?&&I think that's what they're planning actually. A prequel series focusing on that crew.

Of course, it would also open the door for Rooker to return &&wtf, I saw Guardians 2 twice and don't remember Ving Rhames. &&Could you explain what this means?&&That team is AWESOME in the comic as well. Charlie (Ving Rhames) would be awesome on screen. They just need to cast a killer Vance Astro. &&Gamora (Team Leader), Rocket, Mantis, Hulk & Adam Warlock.

This is the new team I would want to see as GOTG 2.0. Drax & Star-Lord can die during their battle with Thanos. Groot can be simply permanently rooted into Earth's ground by Thanos and unable to ever move from his spot.

Hulk would take on Drax's powerhouse role and Warlock would take on Star-Lord & Groot's versatility role. The team would be scaled up in power quite a bit so throwing stronger threats at them in GOTG4 would make way more sense at that point.

This also lets Hulk remain relevant in movies while giving him some new characters to bounce off of.&&He did say lineup which can mean all of them are going to be replaced, or only a few are going to be replaced.  So there is a chance Quill will be around but the others are still a toss up.

I don't want any of them to leave since they make a great team but... I dunno.  I can see Drax leaving by dying a warriors death and Rocket and Groot taking off together looking for Cosmo for whatever reason.&&Well, they're certainly going to be in at least 8 more hours of film, what with the two Avengers films and the third GotG film, so that's good.&&My thoughts exactly.&&Same here - despite the fact they've only had two movies and were such an unknown entity beforehand, I feel much more attachment to the Guardians than anyone other characters in the MCU. Those movies are something special, and hearing that the third will be the last for them just feels like ""...Wait, already?""&&They're gonna be in Infinity Way though.&&Not likely but certainly possible some of them stick around Earth after the next Avengers movies. No longer part of the Guardians line-up but still in the MCU. Stark can retire for real (so RDJ can exit the franchise) and Rocket can take over the armor.&&Exactly. Some people are gonna die and need to be replaced, but it won't be an entirely new crew.&&I'd love to see Flash up in space yelling ""hey look it's *Penis* Quill""&&I imagine Nebula and maybe Drax or Rocket will die and be replaced. I can't see the entire team retiring at once, to be honest. Movie-goers just got used to this team after never hearing of them before, why change it so drastically after only two movies?&&And Nova! If Richard Rider isn't in Phase 4 I will be surprised. The setup for his character is so easy after the events of Infinity War. &&Interesting, it's almost feels a little premature IMO. &&[Seeing as how some of those characters are key teams to Adam's troup when it came to the Infinity Watch, maybe they'll find some way to mix that in? Even if there isn't enough time considering War is right around the corner.](#spoiler)&&I just want the third movie to make me care for them for more reasons than them being funny. Peter had great development in the first movie, Rocket's backstory was hinted at too but Drax's origin and character arc felt like it got shafted in favour of him being an idiot who spouts audience jokes to laugh at and Gamora was completely wasted, isn't she meant to be like an incredible assassin or something? Doesn't feel it. 

The first movie struck a good balance between comedy and drama, the second I felt went far too overboard with tedious comedy and hopefully the third movie can find that balance again, because I don't want another movie is non stop jokes when there's potential for so much more with these characters.

I think the sequel suffered too much from pandering to audiences. For example audiences find baby Groot cute? Keep him small for the sequel and have him do stupid, cute little things throughout the movie. People love Drax's jokes? Let's make every single line of his a funny joke for the audience. Even in the opening credits of the film there's that moment where Groot stays still when Drax is looking at him. It's such a ""haha, wink wink audience ;)"" moment that takes me out of the movie because it's clearly just pandering to what audiences found funny in the first instead of trying new things.&&maybe they will get solo movies. &&No doubt, some characters are going to have to die. In fact I'd be pissed if they didn't. 

My bets are on Iron Man, Captain America, Rocket, Nebula, and Vision. Thor COULD die if they want to pursue the fem!Thor storyline but I don't know that they will, I think he is far more likely to lose an arm. Either Bucky or Sam Wilson will become Captain America after thst, probably. But yeah, I think we are going to see a few major character deaths. And honestly, I would be fine with it. It would be a fair and fine way to round out a few of their stories - dying uniquely and heroically.&&That's just one talking point though. Batman and Joker in TDK were way different than their comic counterparts. The difference is that it was a good movie. 

People don't mind changes to the characters. They mind changes to the characters *in bad movies.*&&Its been, one week since ya looked at me!!!!!&&Oh God yes. A GOTG soundtrack packed with Barenaked Ladies and R.E.M. and maybe some Pearl Jam and Alanis Morisette would be so deep in my wheelhouse there'd be no room for wheels&&We most likely won't see GOTG3 for another 2-3 years. That's plenty of time post-Infinity War & IW Part 2 for the aftermath to be taken care of in other movies. GOTG3 will most likely see the survivors coping with loss, recruiting a new member or two and trying to defeat and ultimately teach Adam Warlock about being ""good"" rather than a tool for revenge.&&My top three are GotG, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. It's hard to say which of the three I like the most cuz they're all so damn good. &&I kind of prefer Vol. 2, but that's likely due to me actually watching Vol. 2 in the cinema as compared to at home, and that I loved that Vol. 2 started straight in with the lighter feel, as compared to Vol. 1's more stereotypical intro.&&Yeah I think ego was the biggest problem in that movie. Wasn't really a fan of that story. I liked everything else tho. &&Considering that his dad in the MCU isn't a king, I doubt it. &&THANK YOU. &&I agree. Holy crap Baby Groot pissed me off for the whole movie.. &&The scene where Rocket says ""Now we're all standing up like a bunch of jackasses"" really defines this series for me. They turn tropes on their head and satirize themselves, but still manage to make you care about the characters (Deadpool unfortunately was only able to accomplish half of that task) &&I'm Mary Poppins ya'll&&He was filming a movie at the time. I can't imagine that he wouldn't like it because while voice work can be a repetitive grind it can be done quickly and if he is indeed picture to picture that means he can negotitiate for more money. Hell, that could be the only reason he is picture-to-picture given that when the first film was announced he was the biggest name attached (at the time). It could be just a simple business strategy but it also gives him an easy out if he ever decides he doesn't want to do it anymore. I'm just speculating, though&&He was the best part of the sequel. It was great to finally see him kick some ass.&&I don't think he did much press for the first one either&&I seem to remember that Bradley Cooper specifically doesn't do a lot of Marvel press because he wants Rocket to stand on his own and not be known just as ""the character that Bradely Cooper voices."" 

Vin might have a bit of the same idea, especially with Baby Groot this time around. But he also had his own franchise film to promote around the same time as Vol 2. &&It's funny because we actually do see Groot age. &&I agree. On top of that, Rocket honestly doesnt even sound much like Bradley Cooper. The voice is very processed. 

EDIT:  Apparently it isnt heavily processed? My point stands that he could be replaced fairly simply. &&Maybe he'll finally get a cockneyed accent like in the books. Gunn has already said the Guardians will be using translators to talk to the Avenger in IW, so it wouldn't be hard to retcon a new voice actor. &&Or... You know... Die seeking vengeance for his family&&Yes, sadly.&&Not only do they still make them, they even make best of Now albums.

However, I think Fox may own the rights to those characters given that they originated in X-Men. Kinberg indicated as much when they were talking about future X-Men development. &&This is correct.

In the end, it's a collaboration but Gunn was responsible for most of what made those movies great.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&My dad had never even heard of Iron Man before I convinced him to go see the movie. Now he's his favorite superhero by far, partly because of his powers and partly because Robert Downey Jr.&&And not just the biggest characters, but the biggest possible stories that would get everyone psyched up. They dived straight into Batman v Superman as their 2nd movie, Justice League as their 4th.

Edit: genuinely forgot about Suicide Squad, but that applies to Suicide Squad too. Remember the reception to when they announced the movie, and when the trailer came out?

DC introduced almost all of the Justice League by the 2nd movie.&&I disagree, personally. DnA's run with the Guardians was revered, yes, but the movie characters barely resemble their run at all. I guess that it could be considered a good film translation, but to me the film versions lose a lot of what made the comic characters memorable.&&Um.. I may have read GotG after the movie but.. Those characters are nothing like the movie. Gunn has probably made the least faithful Marvel movies so far. &&It wasn't translated well at all...&&They didn't translate it at all. There are almost no similarities between the comics and the film.&&yes, but i want this on netflix and low budget&&I think it's doubtful that it would be a prequel. Gunn says in this article:

> **These are older characters** and more criminal than our Guardians. So we’re focusing on that.

I believe when he says 'older' he is referring to their ages, their experience, the fact they've been around the block longer than Starlord has been alive. If they did a prequel of the ravagers being younger, it'd basically remove that whole entire element that Gunn says makes them unique to the guardians.

That's not to say there couldn't be flashbacks. There easily could be plenty of scenes depicting some crucial moments or heists in their early days with Yondu. I'm more curious as to whether it'd be a one-off or not, I can't imagine Stallone leading a new trilogy.&&I sure hope so! The time stone is out there so anything is possible. Rooker at this point can definitely carry a leading performance and having his team with him would really add up to a very solid movie. &&I hope not. I hate prequel movies.&&He was in it very briefly. During Yondu's funeral, he's on one of the ravager ships. He says ""fare thee well, old friend"" and then a ravager salute.

He's also in one of the post credit scenes. &&Probably because you didn't recognize him. Dude got huge.&&He's talking about Sylvester Stallone's crew who cameoed in the post-credits scene. They were the original Guardians of the Galaxy from the 1970s comics. They were probably originally in Vol.2 just as fanservice for classic comics fans, but if Gunn is retiring the current Guardians team after Vol.3, one option he could go with would be to make a movie about Stallone's crew.&&> Drax's powerhouse role

I must be missing something about Drax, because the movie version doesn't have him doing much more than mediocre berzerking- a charismatic minion.&&I guarantee you there is no way that they are going to kill off such a major character/actor as star lord. If this actually happens in infinity war I will eat a bunch of week old Chinese food. Actually I bet they won't even kill off a character any more major than quicksilver was. Disney knows how to make money, and killing off the A list stars that make their characters so good is not a good idea.&&I'm betting the new team functions as a team like Infinity Watch did in the comics with Warlock being added in a leading role.&&The reason? 

I am Groot. &&I'd be happy with a Rocket and Groot solo movie.&&I think Cosmo would be a cool addition to the second line up. Quirky characters are the Guardians strength, especially if Rocket and Groot leave.&&There's going to be so many people in the Avengers movies, their screen time will likely be very small. We'd be lucky to have them on for an hour of screentime in each film, and even then the majority of it will likely be action scenes that don't really add any character development.&&phew xx&&The highlight of Infinity War is going to be Rocket and Stark shouting ""you're a fucking moron"" at each other.&&Oh great, Barry has fucked the timeline so much that he's appearing in Marvel films now? Damnit. &&I like the courage, keeping everything the same is the safe option, but they're trying new things with the line up.&&I think it will be fine, they'll have a trilogy and two Avengers movies under their belt.&&3 is coming after Infinity War. Adam Warlock will be coming in part 3, but won't be showing up in Infinity War. It's just too soon.&&I think we'll be getting a lot more Gamora/Nebula story with Infinity War&&I really like Guardians 2, but there are some jokes that completely cut away the tension. The Hasselhoff joke is an example of that.

Imagine if in Civil War, right after Stark founds out his parents were murdered by Bucky, the movie threw a silly joke at the audience. It would completely kill the drama of the scene.&&And don't forget they turned Groot into a cute, money making machine instead of the badass he is in the comics. Don't get me wrong, they did a good job with him in the first movie but in the second one, it felt like he was there just to be a extension of his after credits dancing scene. They pretty much did away with his backstory, but hopefully he gets to do some cool shit in Infinity War.&&I'm so happy to see that someone else thought that as well! I thought the movie was fine, but it was an insane amount of pandering to what people people liked in the first one. 'Oh you liked yondu's whistling arrow thing?' HERE HAVE SO MUCH OF THAT ITS COMPLETELY WORN OUT AND NO LONGER COOL AND DIFFERENT &&I'm a little amazed they haven't given that this is Marvel, but also I think the only characters that would work in solo movies is Peter and maybe Rocket, these movies are very much about the ensemble.&&A big criticism of Marvel Comics right now is that they've seemingly taken their big hitters - Iron Man, Captain America, Spiderman, Hulk, Thor - and made them women and/or minorities, instead of keeping them as is and making great women and/or minority characters into heavy hitters (though Moon Girl & DD, Ms Marvel, and Squirrel Girl are great, but they don't seem to be included in the big show often enough yet). 

Instead of a female Thor trilogy, can't we have a Black Widow, or Squirrel Girl, or Ms Marvel trilogy, and maybe keep the Thor character in the background just in case Chris Hemsworth needs money? &&Too true. Like in Spider-Man Homecoming I was greatly surprised by the new Aunt May, MJ, Flash, etc. Compared to the comics these characters were pretty different, although the movie was fantastic and so I ultimately didn't have a problem with the changes.&&SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING I'M ANGRY&&Need some weezer in there too&&What? I can't see many paths for *Infinity War* to not deeply influence GotG 3. The first movies has him playing his first onscreen role as an antagonist, and is the sole motivation for Drax and Nebula, and the central part of Gamora's history. Every Gamora/Nebula interaction is laden with Thanos' presence.
If Thanos is dead/defeated by the third movie, that's going to leave some holes one way or another. At the very least it will be clear that a lot happened off-screen to wrap up those arcs.   
   
Pretty much the only way for GotG to be viewable as a highly self-contained trilogy is if Thanos is *also* a villain in the third movie, and is finally defeated in that one.  
     
Maybe the really will make it work, who knows.&&Winter soldier is so good, the tone and the relationship between Cap and Bucky is so perfect. I've been reading the Captain America run featuring the Winter Soldier and you can see so clearly how well they adapted it to film. 

Certain aspects of the Winter Soldier/Captain America conflict actually transition better on film, imo.&&I....I like The Incredible Hulk&&Winter soldier was really well done, which is why im glad the directors are doing the two infinity wars movies instead of joss. &&I actually liked ego. The fact they were able to take such an odd character and make a movie with him was pretty impressive while adding in the explainations for a few things from gotg1 that people had questions about. &&That was my biggest disappointment with go gotg2. It was a good movie for sure. I just wanted more space drama politics, with quill's Dad at the center&&Fun fact, that wasn't even in the original shooting script. The stand in actor (Sean Gunn, the fellow who plays Kraglan), just said that after one's of the takes just cause, and they liked it so much they made it a line.&&I'm still salty about the second one. Michael Rooker is one of my favourite actors and I feel he did a great job with that character. &&He may have been your father.. but he weren't yo daddy. 

..excuse me I have something in my eye. &&groot, groot, biggest diesel groot&&Also, with Voice Over, he could have recorded all of his lines over the course of a week, 6 months before the film came out. What is he going to say to the press that he didn't say for the first one.&&Cooper and Vin Diesel can both be somewhat easily replaced with other similar voices.

Groot: I am Groot

Rocket: yeah, I know you got a cold, you gave me one to ya big root.

Groot: I am Groot!

Rocket: yeah yeah yeah...gonna have to stop off at the CVS and get some decongestants.&&But also they it's easier to replace him than it is Chris Pratt. You can find someone to mimic the voice or do a story line where he lost his voice. Or make him and Groot body swap or something where Vin Diesel now talks as Groot and Rocket just says I am Groot/rocket with a different voice actor. &&And Rocket mentions that he has a pretty short lifespan. &&For the most part, it's actually just him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPa1d8ygmo8&&I honestly had no idea it was him until now&&Rocket doesnt sound like Bradley Cooper because he does an amazing job. Clearly you havent seen the BTS video since you can tell easily that his voice isnt processed at all. &&Cooper doesn't even do the motion capture for Rocket.  It's done by Sean Gunn (Kraglin).

Edit: just realized phyla vell and moondragon would be an awesome way to introduce lgbt characters into the marvel universe. Maybe Drax will die and he'll reveal he has a daughter?&&Hit me with that agent venom man. Fuck Sony for keeping this from me! &&Well, what he's saying is that the vast majority of the people who went to see Guardians never knew it existed as a property until the movie started being advertised. And now that they know of the property, they still know absolutely nothing about the comics. They've also never even heard of the guys you mentioned. To most people, the five characters in the current Guardians *are* the Guardians. Trying to do a GotG-branded movie with a new bunch of unknowns instead of the Guardians would certainly confuse a lot of people. &&Out of the current roster only Captain America was iconic to the mainstream audiences prior to the movies. It's easy to forget that even Iron Man was B-list _at best_. In other words, they've been successful building them up before - let's see if they can repeat it.

Edit: Hulk was definitely iconic already, though has had limited use in the MCU so far&&Doctor Strange did well critically and in the box office, and Black Panther was very well-received on social media after Civil War. The only big unknown is Captain Marvel, the heroes that *have* come to the big screen seem to have been a hit with audiences.&&> There is an over-saturation of comic book movies at this point,

Maybe to you, but not according to the box office sales.&&People keep saying this but they crush every release, #1 at the box office, and that trend only continues. 

They're not going anywhere.&&If you think people aren't HYPE for Black Panther... Well, I guess we're talking to and looking at different people. &&Black Panther is about to do crazy numbers. The entire black community is excited for it and I'm almost certain any sequels will find success. &&They are certainly going to go with Carol Danvers, and therefore Captain Marvel will be a huge success among the female viewership. Strange is... not great, but the A list actor will help that series along. If the Black Panther movie is even a little good that franchise will be among Marvel's strongest.

I think the thing that hurts Marvel's future the most is relegating Inhumans to the TV.&&That doesn't make sense nobody knew who the gotg were and now they are huge. &&> banner heroes 

There's only one Banner hero&&Exactly. Sadly prior to marvel, movie executives were probably saying ""a talking raccoon with a machine gun and a tree monster?? No no no. We need to make it more realistic! Change the raccoon into a bland human character and make all their costumes black leather!""&&When that moment happened in the theater, I remember the audience (myself and my dad included) *crying* with laughter like this was the greatest thing that we'd ever seen.

I thought my dad was gonna pass out laughing after Drax's ""I wasn't listening I was thinking of something else..."" moment.&&A lord of stars, if you will&&Even the original music in GotG was a lot better than what you hear in most Marvel movies.&&C-tier superhero, maybe B... As a kid growing up in the 90s, you couldn't pay me to watch his cartoon. &&The smartest thing they ever did was make a superhero movie about a middle-aged conservative who likes AC/DC. *Iron Man* came out just 6 years after 9/11 -- the character was a match for the zeitgeist.&&[deleted]&&Iron Fist low budget or Daredevil low budget?&&The time stone  was in Dr. Strange. I don't know that it would work that way in the MCU, but possibly.&&I actually hope they keep him dead. There's hardly an serious consequences in the marvel movies besides Rhodie breaking his back. Death should be final, not something to play with.&&It's treason then.&&It wouldn't really be a prequel. It would just take place in the past. The characters have never been used outside a tiny cameo.

After watching it for a second time I realized it was Ving Rhames, and then on my third watch-through I recognized Miley Cyrus&&I don't think it'll happen at all actually, I mean Stallone is 71 years old, and to do an action movie probably 8-9 years from now....&&Oh awesome! &&Drax's sole purpose and reason for existing is to be the ""kryptonite"" to Thanos only. Otherwise he's simply an above average power character with a higher intellect in battle/combat.

Honestly? I think the comic books should take a note from the MCU version and depower him if anything.&&I think to have weight in IW some characters will have to die.

Iron Man has been in a tons of movies and his arc is probably over. 

Captain America imo is too noble for the modern world, he dies and someone else picks up the shield, like Winter Soldier or Falcon, then CA4 would be a new person trying to live up to Steves morales but coming short.

Hulk is an under utilized character.  If they don't find a way to make him work in MCU like adding him to GOTG, then him sacrificing himself would be a good send off.&&True but at least Avengers 3 will focus on Thanos and from the leaked trailer it looks like the Guardians are heavily involved. I mean, how could they not be? Considering Nebula and Gamora.&&He was OBVIOUSLY talking about Flash Gordon.&&I mean, I understand if they get rid of Captain America or Iron Man, since we already had a lot of movies with them. But we only had two with the Guardians. They don't feel fully explored yet.&&Guardians is a much more light-hearted movie than Civil War. Even if you don't like the joke, it's not nearly as egregious as it would be in the Bucky Fight.&&I would watch a ""Rocket and Groot"" movie&&Spiderman isn't really one to lump in with that. That was only in the ultimate universe, after they gave that version of Peter a fantastic send off, and Miles is a really well received character, so much that they brought him into their main 616 universe when they destroyed 1610(ultimate). They're never gonna get rid of Penis Parker, emperor if the status quo. 

I haven't read any Thorette but from what I hear its pretty well received too. &&Yes I really dislike that. Just make new interessting characters and they will be sold. It is like a big middle finger to all the fans to just kill them and replace them after 40-50 years &&I did too.  Dozens of us.&&I almost think that Joss was the guy who HAD to do the first avengers movie, but I'm glad hes not the guy anymore &&YES. It was like they solved the main conflict in like a second, and then they spend half an hour trying to kill the bad guy.&&Plus he didn't really cross the moral event horizon. [His heroic sacrifice wasn't needed by the story and I think just about everyone would have gotten just as much enjoyment out of the film had he lived (plus, doesn't quill have a space helmet that lets him survive in space long enough to be rescued? what happened to that? Oh, right, there was a line in the script i think). I mean, really, it was established in the first film that he kidnapped a child and raised him as an outlaw, so for most of the time we know him, dropping kids off to their dad is actually a step up from how he treated quill. When he realized that wasn't the case, his act of saving Quill as a child is enough to redeem his character, so his death after he made everything right just kind of felt like someone aping the hero's journey death of the mentor step without really understanding why the mentor has to die.](#spoiler)

AH-AAAAAAAAAH!&&They're going to have both Infinity War movies before Guardians 3, we might feel differently then. &&They're involved in at least one of the Infinity War movies, so that'll total 4 or 5 for them.&&And it was specifically called out earlier in the film that Quill has used Hasselhoff as a sort of fantasy surrogate dad. That gun was totally on the mantle.
&&I'm reading Miles Morales' current Spider-Man book as well as the current Mighty Thor (with Jane Foster as Thor) and they are fantastic. Haters are gonna hate. &&I see it as a way of thinning the herd for cross-over movies. Can't merge all these main characters in Infinity Wars and expect to have good dialogue.&&SPOILERS:

His redemption wasnt just for saving Quill at the end, he was redeeming a lifetime of sadness he caused in Peter Quill. Even if he protected him from Ego, Yondu knows well that Quill has hated and resented Yondu for years since Quill didn't know about Yondu's orders with Ego, and in Peter's eyes he was basically kidnapped as a child and threatened daily by his captors.

So Yondu sacrificing himself tied a neat bow around Peter's family story arc (and the whole film is about family). Peter's real father Ego is evil at heart but appears good, and wants Peter to join him and take over the galaxy. Peter's adoptive father Yondu is good at heart but appears evil and wants Peter to be himself and protect the galaxy. 

I wish Yondu didn't die but James Gunn loves setups and payoffs, loves character and story arcs, he uses them in his films more than any other filmmaker I know. And although I really want to see more Yondu since he was amazing in this film, I do think that bit would've been a less satisfying ending had Yondu not died. I choked up a little at that part, having come from an unconventional family; seeing a father give his life for his son is just touching (especially due to the fact that Yondu isn't his real father and was never asked to take that role, but did anyway because he loves Quill deep down). &&I rewatched just recently and quills mask is actually broken by his father by that point so maybe he'll get a new one. &&Ego broke Star-Lords helmet in the fight.&&Ego hits quill and breaks his helmet.&&It wasn't needed no. But I think a point is that he would feel more like a father to Peter than what his real father was to him.

Kinda like a adopt story.&&[I mean, the whole reason he kidnapped Quill and raised him as his own son was because he found out what was happening with all the children he was delivering to Ego. And saving one child isn't enough to redeem his character if Ego's mountain of skeletons is any indication. Dying in such a noble way might have actually redeemed him, though.](#spoiler)&&It worked for me. The guy was suicidally depressed, that's really all there was to it. He wanted to die, he felt he deserved to, and his earlier rejection by the Ravagers was the final straw for him. So his action didn't need to be sensical, the tragedy is exactly that: he didn't need to die, but he still wanted to, and wanted to do it while saving his surrogate son. 

Yes, I'm still crying from it, shaddup. &&His sacrifice was needed to get on good terms with the other ravagers.  They may be important in the next film (I dont see them dropping Stallone in the next film).&&There's a shot in there where you see his helmet get broken. You see him roll over and his helmet is in two pieces on the ground next to him.&&Hahahaha he got paid more money than you or I will ever see to laugh in his pjs.&&*IT'S REAL*&&I use adblock plus. It works so well that I forget about ads and then open things on my phone and am immediately disgusted.&&So google is god basically&&Edge does&&Edge definitely does. It's nice. &&It seems like such a useless law. The end result isn’t increased privacy, instead now I have to dismiss a banner ad on literally every website I visit because everyone would rather fuck up their UX than not track users.&&[deleted]&&What?&&I want what The Expendables had the potential to be until they fucked it up.&&[deleted]&&FF is just fucking wasted with Fox. X-Men, and mutants in general, at least there are so many that they can exist as their own universe just fine. FF? They and their rogue gallery could be weaved into the cosmic stuff of MCU so well. &&I also enjoyed DoFP, although I might be alone in that. Logan was excellent in almost every way and in my opinion, would be a great way to shut down this X Men franchise for good.&&First Class was entertaining but I hate how most of those mutants were just killed off in between movies. &&I'm 100% surprised that he hasn't yet for 2 reasons:

1.) They straight up introduced Nova corps in GotG.
2.) They pushed him really hard in Marvel vs. Capcom

For those who don't play videogames and are wondering about the second point. The MvC fighting games are widely popular. Marvel had full final say on which of its characters appeared in the last iteration. 

The last batch in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 included Rocket, Hawkeye, Iron Fist, Ghost Rider, Nova... the point is that they heavily pushed characters in upcoming projects to get brand awareness. Rocket for instance was a complete unknown to most players as this was before GotG came out. &&They've already intro'd the Nova Corps. The question is which ""Nova"" we're going to get.

Disney tends to support ""current"" run comics, so that might lead to our younger Nova... and possibly later New Warriors. The Superhuman Registration Act (beyond civil war) could be prime material.&&>Hell, even Cap was regarded as kind of a joke character by mainstream audiences. He was a guy dressed in the flag with wings on his head who's most memorable ""power"" was throwing a shield.

I remember this the most from the old movie, not being a huge fan of comics. And Robert Downey Jr made Iron Man what he is today. Honestly before Phase 1, I was way more into DC than Marvel. Now sometimes I forget that DC exists outside of Bat and Supes because DC hasn't done nearly as good a job with their movies. Not to be a Debbie Downer but I'm not stepping on a hype train for Justice League till the reviews are out. DC makes good trailers like they did for BvS and Suicide Squad, but the movie content is always lacking.&&Even as a moderate comic book fan, I kind of had that impression of Cap before the movies. I had no idea how they were going to make him interesting. But damn if they didn't turn him into the most compelling and likeable character of all of them. &&Thor might not have been obscure, but he definitely wasn't considered good material for a marketable movie franchise.&&Good point on Hulk.

Thor was a joke though. Really still was in the comicbooks until Jason Aaron's 2013 run.&&Good suggestion. I'm not sure why you picked July of '97 in particular, but I noticed that Iron Man #11 was shipped that month – indicating that they had recently rebooted the title. I was curious how it was faring prior to that reboot and found I couldn't even find him in the top 300 in any month of 1996 and that Iron Man #318 (May of '95) came in 95th:

http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1995/1995-05Diamond.html

Within 5 years (2002) Iron Man dropped down to the 40s and 50s.&&Comic sales =!= mainstream audiences. Iron Man was definitely highly recognized among comic readers (and maybe some gamers), but he was nowhere near mainstream in recognition.&&I look at it like when westerns were the big box office draw at the box office and there were so many of them being made because of that. It can last for a few decades easily but nothing is forever, especially in this day and age. People's tastes change.&&The second intro has tony stark with a mullet&&The only time I remember seeing Cap in a cartoon was with Wolverine during WWII. &&It is on the box sets&&Bad things.  Bad things happen.&&The 4th MCU movie was set in the 1940s  
So, yes, there is precedent for covering earlier time periods &&You're right, I skipped that comment and just read the one mentioning the time Stone.&&That seemed like more of a tradeoff with the X-Men franchise. By killing him off, MCU keeps Scarlet Witch, and X-Men get Quicksilver. It eliminates confusion, and gives both IPs solid footing.&&I expect Thanos will resurrect him. &&I've been hoping that Wanda will tap into her powers more fully and bring him back to life at some point, at he expense of her own sanity or the fabric of reality or something.&&Yeah, but he was lame compared to Xmen Quicksilver.&&That's also seen as one of the major flaws of the medium. We're hoping they don't repeat the same mistakes in the movies. &&/u/hatesandguy12
&&That's a great way of putting it &&Endless time, money, and steroids will do that to you.&&thanos father and grandfather made drax as a weapon to kill thanos. they didnt like what thanos was doing, made a body out of mud, and used the soul of a guy that thanos casually killed when he was on earth, and made the body super strong to fight thanos. 

dont know how the old drax worked, but the new drax seemed to get a power boost when he was close to thanos. he got stronger, faster, and got a green glowy aura. as soon as thanos died, that strenght vanished, so there was something special about him then, but dont know how old drax worked&&Essentially in a quick summed up blurb about Drax's history (which I assume will be touched on in Infinity War & GOTG3):

He had a young daughter and wife. They are from Earth and when traveling through a desert a ship above being flown by Thanos to scout the planet out thought they noticed and were following. They shot their car into oblivion. His wife perished, his daughter was taken as she survived the crash by someone to avoid possible future spoilers and his spirit was snatched by Thanos' father & Kronos, an Earth eternal. They placed his spirit into the now seen body of Drax The Destroyer knowing he'd want revenge and after Thanos' father (Mentor) & Kronos saw Thanos as a growing threat to everything.

Drax's sole purpose in life is to avenge his deceased wife and long-thought deceased daughter from the car crash. He was never informed his daughter survived. So he hunts Thanos down across the galaxy seeking his vengeance. His body isn't some kind of Hulk-level power house. He is more roughly around Captain America's level of strength and agility with a lesser mind of combat strategy. Mentor & Kronos believe Drax The Destroyer's body to be strong enough to take on Thanos with his former life's mind for revenge being enough fuel to get the job done and nothing more.&&Considering he's a fictional character, and at the whims of the authors writing, I'd say anything is possible.&&[deleted]&&https://imgur.com/gallery/CTqbb&&King of the impossible!&&Thor 3 as well.&&Yeah, gotta get rid of those duplicate character archetypes... Can't have Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, and Peter Quill in the same room together, nobody would get any plot dialog in that wasn't delivered in the form of a snarky quip.&&I mean, they added like two new guardians&&Yep, I found that beautiful, and the whole idea of him even being an outlaw to the rabagers, only for them to pay their respects and realise that he was all good in the end. &&And not only that his redemption wasn't just about Quill. He had to redeem himself and his entire group in the eyes of the reavers (? I dont remember their name). &&Rooker was AWESOME in Vol. 2. I was really impressed. &&Ego did cause Yondus death, but not directly. I don't know what would have been better for the movie. If he had killed him somehow: Bit of a cliche. As it was in the movie we got: Noble sacrifice - better?  
Well, we got a lot of Yondu and I don't know if Gunn could top that in 3.  
  
Also: RIP Bolty. &&MORE SPOILERS

It's also Yondu redeeming himself for working for Ego to begin with, as Peter wasn't the first kid he was sent to take.&&Who?&&He may be your father, but he ain't your daddy

The one [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) operates it pretty good, and I've seen others which are about 50px at the bottom of the screen.&&It's a classic example of good but misdirected intentions. It looks good for consumer rights on paper, but in practice turned out to be nothing but bothersome. That's why they'll likely do away with that regulation.&&because they have to.... Otherwise, they would have to have a page that you would have to accept to enter.

Cookie laws are retarded.&&English motherfucker, do you speak it?!&&I ain't never heard of no country called what. Do they speak English in what?&&Say what again!&&Say what one more time!&&I mean, I still love the first 2 as fun movies, but I know they're terribly written&&Yeah not only that but the XMen movies and TV shows have been making them a little bit of Bank so they are going to keep doing it (the risk is pretty low and the rewards of putting up the capital themselves are high). 

Now they could do a revenue sharing agreement where Fox is also putting up Capital (a little like Sony and Spiderman with distribution expenses) and that would make more sense. 

However, at this point Marvel doesn't actually really even want the X-Men. 

They have been doing all they can to minimize FF and X-Men in the comics for the last 5 years. The X-Men story lines have been reduced to a few (when they used to be the majority of titles). The FF are basically gone. 

Which is why they have been pushing the Inhumans both in TV and comics &&All we really need from them is Dr. Doom&&Alone? Do other people not consider DoFP one of the best X-Men movies in the franchise? That's news to me if true.&&Totally agree. DoFP and Logan were the best X-Men movies we've had. The Rogue Cut made the former easily my favorite.&&No way!! DoFP was amazing. Also loooove Logan, I agree that apocalypse was probably the weakest one for that generation.

I just want a decent portrayal of the Phoenix entity.&&I'm so attached to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine I don't think I could live with any one else playing a Logan Wolverine. &&I imagine they're holding some of these characters back for Phase 3.&&I just want John C Reilly to be Nova.&&What's sad is they do amazing animated stuff. They've got decades worth of solid material that could be easily converted into live action.&&Yep. I remember when the first Iron Man teaser showed up, a lot of the reaction was ""Yeah, but who cares? It's fucking *Iron Man*.""

They definitely pulled off something special with that. They somehow took a B-minus character and made him the focus of their non-Sony cinematic universe.&&> DC makes good trailers like they did for BvS

Wait what? You mean the ones that gave away the entire plot of the movie in neat little bullet points?&&Come on, [who could forget this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgPjoJGU2V8)&&There's a reason for that. Iron Man switched writers from 318 to 319 and is then revealed to be an undercover villain the whole time and dies, getting replaced by a teenage Tony Stark in one of the most asinine storylines in history.

EDIT: Oh yeah, and 1996-1997 was heroes reborn. That's the #1 you're talking about.

Also, May 1995 is a month when Spider-Man couldn't break the top 20, Marvel was pretty much the house that X-Men kept standing, and there were only a half dozen non-X-Men Marvel books in the top 100.

But it's all a fallacy anyway. Comic book sales have nothing to do with character popularity and notoriety in the general population. Most people wearing Superman T-shirts won't pick up a comic. Batman couldn't break the top 20 comic book sales but did 600 million dollars in adjusted box office for Batman Forever.

Movie audiences don't even care that someone is writing these comics, and if those comics are bad, they're not going to stop watching movies they like because there's a shitty comic out there. They're going to watch the movie they like and ignore the comic.&&I like the XMen Quicksilver&&Oh shit is that why they did that? Makes sense now &&If you haven't, read the House of M comic arc.&&not to mention the incentive of making millions of dollars due to your physique.&&See, this helps out so much.

I don't mind hiding secrets in characters for the future and such, and even changing some of the lore, but sometimes lack of backstory in these movies hurts.

I never got any of this from the movies aside from the death of his wife and child and he's after revenge which kinda honestly is everyone in the universe, so what makes him special? the movies have not hinted to this yet, but this explanation does.&&Oh, so that isn't Drax' natural body. So there can/might/will (if the MCU wills it) something special for later, maybe with the runes etched in his skin?

That kinda makes sense now. I, like some others have also been kinda underwhelmed with the lack of ""destroyer"" in Drax the Destroyer, but its more for a future story.

Thanks&&I want to see this scene now. Give it a Larry David twist where none of their one liners are working at all and they all just walk away embarrassed. &&And Ant-Man. And Spiderman. And Black Widow most of the time. And Loki usually. And Vision, in his own weird way.

Infinity War is pretty much guaranteed to be at least 85% quip.&&Soooo...avengers 2 then?&&I've been thinking that Tony dies in  Infinity Wars (RDJ is getting old, he's done a lot of movies and the characters death would make Thanos seems like the badass that he is supposed to be), so following your thinking that would fit in nicely with the thinning out idea for the second part of IW (Whatever they decided to end up calling it). 

Having the roster be thinned out between IW 1 and 2 would fit in well, Tony Dies in IW1, the rest of the team defeat Thanos because he lacks all of the infinity stones, Thanos comes back in IW2 (since he never dies),Vision dies in IW2 Thanos gets all the infinity stones and wins in IW2 and the next Avengers has to do with dealing with a world after Thanos.&&Oh, so *that's* why Whedon stepped away.&&>rabagers&&I think the Stallone group were the Old Guardians or something and Yondu's current group were the Ravagers I'm pretty sure (they don't make it very clear in the film). But yeah youre right, Yondu proved himself to the Old Guardians by the end. 

Also the writing was on the wall that Yondu might die from the beginning of the film. Yondu's ravagers were becoming more and more disappointed in Yondu for not being hard enough, for not killing Quill. Taserface (lol) was going to take over for Yondu. So in retrospect you can see it coming that Yondu wasn't going to be with the Ravagers forever. He need to separate from them so he could redeem himself in the eyes of his old friends, the Old Guardians.&&No, I didn't at all mean that Ego caused Yondu's death. Yondu sacrificed himself in a frankly brilliant way the more I think about it.

Yondu saving Peter's life by protecting him like that was very likely James Gunn making a callback to the first film, where Peter nearly sacrificed himself for Gamora in space. Yondu saved Peter at that moment, so he obviously knew that Peter was ready to risk it all to save Gamora. So by Yondu doing the same to Peter in the second film, Yondu is basically establishing that he's more family to Peter than Ego ever was or would be; that both Yondu and Peter both, despite their differences, are more similar than they might admit.

And yeah for the record, I'm glad Ego didn't kill Yondu because Ego was a villain with decent motivation; he wasn't exactly ""evil"", he kinda just wanted to spread his seed across the galaxy (literally). And if people died in the process, then that's just survival of the fittest, no different from a human destroying an ant colony so he can grow crops. Ego after all wasn't human, he was much higher on the ""food chain"". So it would be out of character for him to murder Yondu. It makes Ego more a believable villain and less cliche as you mentioned.&&Ego the Living Planet. Peter's dad in the film&&The answer is ""most of the time"", and ""to almost literally anything"".   
Do i get to be a god now too?&&Would you prefer Reddit gold or a good, safe porn link?&&Ahem..*Bing* would like a word.&&While the jetbrains one is cool and well themed, they have the larger problem of no mobile site. The bigger problem is on a phone where the mandated text takes up a huge amount of space, and 50px actually pretty big.&&Y-y-yes!&&>""What"" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in what? 

Ftfy
&&What?!&&It's a shame, too.  X-Men and related titles were pretty much all I bought in the 90s(except for when there were crossover events).  I've never really liked any of the Fox X-Men titles(I liked *parts* of First Class, but mostly just the ones involving Magneto) except for maybe X-Men 2, and even the spinoff titles that were legitimately great(ummm...  Logan and Deadpool?  I think that's it) couldn't really be considered X-Men movies at all, but rather doing their own thing completely.

I pretty much stopped reading comics when they switched to glossy paper and started charging more for fewer pages, but it still sucks to hear that the business politics around the movies is killing the comics.&&I mean, I really want Doom, but other villains like Galactus and Kang would come with them as well. I definitely want the antagonists more than I want FF themselves.&&That's actually the standard opinion. First, it was a pretty darn good movie. Second, it didn't really have a super-high bar to clear to be the ""best"". &&The Rogue Cut?&&The new one, with Jessica Chastain, has me excited, I think. Some of the best parts of Apocalypse were Jean struggling with her potential and then seeing it unleashed.&&I think what people don't realize is that they are planning for the future. Disney is seeing decades down the line. They need new characters to interject over time to increase hype. They can't just blow their load and expect no fatigue when they're on GotG: 17 or avengers 36 way down the line.&&Yeah, like what are they doing? Like honestly wonder woman made it to my top movies, it's just they're overly dark and it was so hard to watch BvS.&&They should definitely let in the animation people work on the movies. It worked perfectly with the Arkham game series. &&You mean they used to. The only DC animated movie I really like after Flashpoint Paradox was JLA:Gods and Monsters. None of their new films hold a candle to the old ones like Under the Red Hood, Wonder Woman, All star Superman etc.&&[No I meant this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhWg7AQLI_8)

Edit: I try to not watch trailers that are more that just over 2 minutes long. Anything that goes over 3 minutes is asking to have things spoiled for you. Either they are giving away too much or the creators don't know what the hell they're doing. 2 minutes is all anyone needs. The giveaway plot trailer didn't make BvS bad. BvS made BvS bad.&&That's only in the comics though. In the movies, I'm convinced he's just a normal guy from a warrior race more powerful than average humans.  
  
His motivation is avenging his family, not being a murder weapon whose sole purpose is killing Thanos. The movie definitely would have touched on something like that.&&well, its unlikely that they will take that story into the movies, it seems he is just a alien with superpowers that had his family murderd by thanos. we know he is atleast not from earth, and rocket talked about his people, so we know he isnt a special dude as in the comics. so, his backstory doesnt seem to be the same in the movies.&&I like to imagine Tony Stark enters the scene by violently slamming $50 on the table and declaring that he's out of the contest.&&I really, really want the Larry David reboot of the Marvel universe now. Like, The Avengers with the same general plot and tone, except everyone is *super* awkward; Captain America keeps accidentally dropping terminology that was OK in the 30s, not so much now.

>""Look out! Get those grenades away before one of those *colored* children sets one off!""

Alternatively, Marvel's Seinfeld - Captain America is Kramer, Hawkeye is George Costanza, Widow is Elaine Benes, Thor is Puddy, Hulk is played by George's father (who is constantly nagged into Hulking out by George's mother), and Loki is Jerry Seinfeld.

I'd watch either.&&85% quip, 15% slaughter&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&[removed]&&My thoughts exactly. The problem was Ultron was meant to have Stark's personality but there's only room for one Stark&&See, I think it's flipped. I think IW ends with Thanos gaining the last stone (possibly killing Vision), and winning over a now working together but still not entirely trusting Avengers. And then in Avengers 4, they finally all get back on the same page, everything is clicking, only for Iron Man or Cap to be killed.&&I don't think Tony will ever get killed off. He'll probably resign to not wearing the suit and be a Nick Fury kind of character.&&""Rabagers, Rabagers, barely even human!""&&cabbagers&&I know him. Who is this Star Lord?&&Wow I fucked that one up.&&The only plus side to it is that it made Marvel invest in some of their lesser known but cool characters, start reprinting Star Wars comics (which are pretty legit in both story and art), and since X-Men was the place for diversity and a majority of the big female characters they had to add that outside of the X-Men story lines. &&It and X2 are the top 2 for me, followed closely by Logan. There's a pretty big drop-off after that, but I enjoyed almost all of them.&&I don't understand how First Class is not a high bar. It's a great film, let alone a great superhero film.&&Director's cut. Almost half an hour longer and fleshes out the story *so much* better. Rogue was completely cut from the theatrical version, but she's the plot device that the entire movie centers on. Weird choice.

The theatrical version is awesome on it's own, but a little extra exposition and character development made it great.&&This is the key to the MCU's success and DCEU's failure. Disney had enough faith in the quality of the characters and the IP to give each major character their own movie(a really risky decision at the time) With DC, they tried to cram all the big guns into a single movie, and it fell on its face.&&Green Lantern was so hard to watch because they had everything in place to just copy the cartoon version that did it all better.&&The new Justice League (animated) as well as Assault on Arkham are great. If you want to see how Suicide Squad should have been done, watch that.

Also.. watch Flashpoint Paradox.&&If only the rest of the movie were as good as that trailer.&&They kinda did. They set up Drax v Ronan, and then at the end, Drax says that he doesnt think Ronan was who he was fated to kill.  &&The only sane choice! Lmao. &&$50? That's peasant money for him&&Can't spell ""slaughter"" without ""laughter""!&&Yea what are the odds everyone who hasn't re-upped their post-infinity-war contracts bites it in Infinity War?&&TARS what's the current quip level?&&Are... Are you OK @eyeheartsatin?&&It all started with Stark. Better to kill off everyone else and leave him tragic and isolated.&&Nah, cap won't die, his face defines the brand but with iron Man it's the suit that does, so I think they will kill off Tony and someone else will enter the suit (maybe they kill Bucky to cuz they have used him enough for plot lines)&&I could see that working too, though I feel like my idea works better. First of all the big issue, they couldn't defeat Thanos before he got all the stones, now how the hell do they want us to believe that they can defeat him when he has all the stones.

Having said that though, your idea does fit in a little bit better with how Civil War ended, with them not trusting each other and all that, but I have issue with the them getting back together part, as they've kinda done that in some way or another a few times already. On your comment about which of the two dies or both Evans is confirmed for a Avengers 4, whereas RDJ isn't (yet). Also something I didn't think about before, with how Civil War ended, having Stark die, would give Cap a very good incentive to ""come back to good side"".

Me saying Vision dies in Avengers 4 is partly selfish and partly cause I think the characters needs to shine before getting killed off, honestly, he hasn't done that much and the character is supposed to be freaking strong, though I could also see them having him shine in IW and dying at the end.

Also something to note, it appears that Hela leaves behind the Tesseract in a ruined Asgard and Loki finds it, now Loki COULD bring it to Thanos, though seeing as what he wants is to rule Asgard (which is now in ruins) that's a bit less likely. And if they go with Hela taking the place of Mistress Death, Loki would be wise to watch his back, because he would have two strikes against him with Thanos.&&I really hope vision doesn't die but when the stone is pulled from him he turns all white like his original comic appearance.&&Rabagers, rabagers, drive them from our shore! &&Legendary Outlaw&&Hey you did your best and you were super close. Don't be so hard on yourself, champ&&> The only plus side to it is that it made Marvel invest in some of their lesser known but cool characters, start reprinting Star Wars comics 

That probably had more to do with Disney buying the Star Wars franchise. &&First Class is pretty up there too. But yeah, the other movies definitely suck by comparison.&&I don't even know how people can talk about the X-Men franchise as anything but successful. X-Men 1 was very good, X2 was of course, amazing, then you get one flop with X3, but they come back with First Class and DoFP which are outstanding. That's 4 great X-Men films. (I'm not considering the stand-alones as part of the main franchise here btw)&&Well the Flash movie is supposed to be Flashpoint.&&I think he said Ronan was only a pawn, and Thanos is his real target. Ronan was under Thanos's command when he killed Drax's family. Haven't watched it in years though &&",2017-08-06 12:11:49
Moviepass - a subscription plan that lets you go to the movies every day just cut their price from $50 per month to $9.95,35952,6ttrnq,http://blog.moviepass.com/our-new-9-95-unlimited-subscription-plan/,5279,1502799956.0,,"Since we are getting a lot of /r/HailCorporate love I just wanted to point out the biggest drawback to this price change. Here's an article from Bloomberg: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want

Relevant paragraph: 

>MoviePass could lose a lot of money subsidizing people’s movie habits. So the company also raised cash on Tuesday by selling a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., a small, publicly traded data firm in New York. The companies declined to comment on terms of the financing but said MoviePass intends to hold an initial public offering by March. Helios and Metheson shares rose 8 percent to $3.01 at 2 p.m. in New York.

>Ted Farnsworth, chief executive officer at Helios and Matheson, said the goal is to amass a large base of customers and collect data on viewing behaviors. That information could then be used to eventually target advertisements or other marketing materials to subscribers. “It’s no different than Facebook or Google,” Farnsworth said. “The more we understand our fans, the more we can target them.”

So for the cheaper price you should know you are sacrificing  your movie watching habits to public data trading. 

Also as a MoviePass user here's some stuff you should know about the app:

* You can only see one film per day

* You can only see a film once (**edit:** sounds like that rule may change: https://twitter.com/MoviePass/status/897439572526862337)

* You can't use it for IMAX or 3D

* The feature has recently went away but for a while you had to take a picture of your ticket to prove you paid for the film you said you were going to see

* The app can often be buggy and not have the proper film listings or they may not show up at all

* If you go to a theater that has seating reservations you can't order them online, you have to be in person in theater to buy your tickets. 

I sill plan to use MoviePass but I want people to be clear that there is no such thing as a golden ticket in the world of corporate moviegoing.

Do you think this news is hugging the site to death? &&[deleted]&&Never before have I tried so hard to give someone my money unsuccessfully.&&I honestly don't understand how this business model works. Can someone explain it? If they're paying the full price to the theaters with no kick-backs or other revenue streams, how is this a sustainable business?

EDIT: I understand now!&&I've been a member for about 5 years and it's been a tremendous value. They did dick over a lot of people on pricing over the last couple of years, but I was lucky enough to keep my grandfathered price of $35 through the turmoil. 

For 9.95, I just can't imagine why someone wouldn't get it. &&I really want to use something like this, but the lack of any real information on their website is ridiculous. Their FAQ is completely empty, the main website section contains no details regarding how it works, where its accepted, and specific details whatsoever. Do I need to sign-up before they give me the details?     
       
Anyone who already uses this - Can you book tickets/reserve seats in advance or can you only buy them at the ticket window?
       
Edit - To be clear, I don't want to hate on this service, it seems like it would be great for me as someone who goes to the theater several times a month. Just baffled by the limited information.&&Can't get to the site.  Reddit hug of death?&&I wonder if Cineplex would ever get something like this (jk, I know the answer, of course not).&&Veteran MoviePass subscriber here. There are so many films I never would have seen but I've given a chance. Go to your local indie theater and give something different a shot.

Also, enroll in rewards. Regal, AMC, Cinemark have great systems and while I have only Regal theaters in my area, I frequently get enough points for free concessions, free tickets, etc. 

Even though my premium sub was just cancelled (included IMAX and 3D) at 9.95 and rewards I can at least get a discounted IMAX ticket. 

No subscription required to see theaters in you area, use this link and change the zeros to your zip. It will take a while to load, it seems their servers are getting hammered and it will take a LONG time to return any results At first it will say no results. be patient. **https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=00000**

EDIT: until about a week ago they would ask you to snap a photo of the ticket when you purchase. I was wondering if something was wrong but it sounds like ticket verification is not going to be used at this time, so FYI.

EDIT2: everybody zip codes are taking over 30m to load on my app. I'll try to get to those who have PM'd me but I've got over 30 queued. I also have a day job. Happy to answer any questions, but I'm afraid you'll need to try to hit the site later. I'll try to get back to people as I can. 

Edit3: **I do not work for MoviePass. Please do not PM me with account questions.**

Edit4: apparently they changed and you can now see a movie more than once: https://twitter.com/MoviePass/status/897439572526862337

Edit5: I can't take anymore zip check requests at this time. I'd like to keep myself employed. &&Has anyone managed to sign up for the free trial? I'm at the final screen and it says  

>Your free trial will officially begin when you receive your MoviePass card in the mail and your credit card will be charged $9.95 when that ends.
**Your credit card will be charged $9.95 today, and your first month of service will officially begin when you receive your MoviePass card in the mail.**

Kinda confused.&&I have been using moviepass for the last few months and have been getting pretty decent value out of it but now I have no idea how they are going to make any money off of this. They apparently just sold off a big stake in the company, but still. 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want&&If this is legit, I am 100% getting this. &&I built a small site to search if MoviePass supports theaters near your zip code... please feel free to use it :)

http://mdudetm.com/moviepass/&&Is there anything remotely this good for Canada?&&[deleted]&&I cannot get any details to load on the website.  If I try to change to my zip code, nothing happens. Anyone having this problem? &&My local cinema in England does something similar, unlimited movies for £14/month when it's about £8 a visit&&I have read that no one will be able to use the map today as they have used all of their daily Google map calls. 

Instead, use this link to view at least a text representation of your area.

Https://www.moviepass.com/theaters/zip/90210&&The link posted in this thread to check if your theater is supported won't work for the rest of the day, since it relies on Google Maps, and MoviePass has reached its daily quota for the Google Maps API. However, this link still works:

https://www.moviepass.com/theaters/zip/00000

Replace ""00000"" with your own zip. If you don't recognize the name of a theater or its address, manually put it in Google Maps.&&So I used to be a MoviePass subscriber for almost two years before it all went to shit sometime last year. Not only did they implement ticket verification but they also had a completely new way that they did their ticketing system. Basically, they only had a set amount of tickets per geographical area for morning, afternoon, and evening shows. If all the morning tickets sold out (and this was for any movie at any theater), then you couldn't see ANY movie in your area until the afternoon or evening. Did they finally do with that godawful system? Before they instituted it, MoviePass was so worth it, it was crazy. &&https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=10001

Someone below posted this link for finding theaters in your area that are supported!&&[Here is the webpage](https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=10024) that allows you to check your zip code for theaters near you that use the service. It's not at all obvious on the website and I had to go digging in the FAQ comments for it.

Great service, horrible website.&&Man all that site traffic won't let me see what theatres are available in my area.

Edit: finally got it working and all the amc's near me and one edwards does. I am definitely getting this.&&Oh good.  I can finally afford that $40 box of Raisinettes.&&Wow, this is amazing i have been a subscriber for nearly four years now at $30-50 a month price point for unlimited movies. I am a power user and see about 150 movies a year in the theater, so it was already a value for me. $10 a month is a steal. I will be able to get most my friends and family interested for $10 a month. This is a major step In the right direction to accomplish the goal of getting more people in theater. &&I think I managed to complete a sign up, even with the website timing out, but I never got a confirmation email or anything...&&Never wanted to subscribe to a company I never heard of this quickly before. So you're saying I can get MoviePass and I'll be able to go watch a movie everyday for free if I wanted?&&It's crazy to me that some people still find something to bitch about with a service like this.&&I look at it this way. I go to movies maybe twice a year. Usually for a movie I just HAVE to see. Otherwise, I'll just wait for Redbox, HBO, etc.

So, I'm paying let's say $13 a movie ticket. So, $26 a year on average, not including concessions which is irrelevant here. But for $10 a month, I'll gladly sign up and be able to see movies whenever I want. It's basically a new releases version of Netflix.

I'll be spending $100 more a year that I never would have spent in prior years. I have to imagine Hollywood loves this. Movie theaters who wouldn't be getting my popcorn and soda money are thrilled I'm now showing up more than every six months. And I get to see as many movies as my heart desires.&&Maybe make it $10.95 and invest in some more bandwidth.&&Wait so you're saying that for 10 bucks, I can see any movie I want for free during an entire month? SO essentially I could just pay the initial 10 bucks and then see 31 movies???????&&So I signed up through the Apple app and got through payment (used PayPal) where the payment went through (my credit card app shows this), however I received an SSL error after hitting ""complete"". I received no confirmation email but I've been charged. Any one else having this with the website being hugged so much? 

Let me know :)

Edit: I retried about an hour later to log into the site and it recognized my credentials however still no confirmation email. I'd recommend after the hugging ceases or lessens, see if you can log in with what you signed up as if you got charged. &&They should have prepared their damn website for an influx of customers with that price point. Ugh. &&WOW! I've been a MoviePass subscriber — at $35/mo — for about 6 years. And I use it!

In New York, there are many cinemas, often showing previews and independent films you can't see in the suburbs. You can find showings across a wide number of screens within a small area, and if you live in Manhattan, probably dozens within walking distance.

Movie tickets in NYC cost about $17. (I don't pay as close attention since using MP), but basically I have to go 3x a month to get my money's worth. I make that most months.

$9.95 is amazing. I was thinking of cancelling bc I'm in between jobs but now — no way!&&I know the guy behind this: I remember running into him a few years back in NY and we spoke about what was happening with his company - one of the trade magazines just released a total ""movie pass is dead"" or something like that.
I remember him telling me the numbers behind movie theatre capacity and occupancy. The numbers were ridiculous - something like an average of 6% but yet he was telling me of the resistance he was facing from the theaters.
This is finally the move forward that movies need but theatre owners fear. 
For me - this is awesome. For the public at large - this is awesome. It's basically a win-win. 
Anyways, I'm super happy for him and the company. And I'm super happy for all the movie fans.  &&Website got the Reddit hug of death. &&basic capitalism. a reaction to online streaming. cut costs or become irrelevant&&Does anyone have this pass and can help me figure out what theaters in my area can be used with this? That's the biggest thing stopping me from jumping on it is I have no idea who I can use this with!&&Why don't everyone get off the site and give me a chance to sign up!!! Lol&&I'm fairly sure this announcement and their servers apparently melting are related.

There's a Marketing VP absolutely losing their shit right now.&&https://www.moviepass.com/theaters/zip/*insert your zip here*

I find the website doesn't work, but I was able to get code for what theaters we have locally and just CTRL+F what I was looking for. &&[deleted]&&I'll tell you what they are hoping for here... statistically, Americans on avg. are not spending $120 or more at the movies per year. They are hoping that a service like this, even though they might lose some revenue on the extremely active movie goers, on avg. brings in higher revenue from all people overall.

Theaters are probably ok with this too because their real profit comes from the concession stands, so anything that draws larger crowds to the theater is good for them.

In all honesty, I got to the theater maybe 2 or 3 times per year and even I am tempted by this at this price point. It might actually incentivize me to go see the less-mainstream blockbuster films I typically just wait to RedBox.

I like it.&&My card was charged, but I don't have a confirmation email, and I can't sign into the app. But I'm guessing it's just backlogged. &&To anyone having trouble seeing the map: [](https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=10108)

It appears they've exceeded their daily quota (25k) for map loads from Google.&&So how does this work? You get the card, select the movie, go to the theatre and buy the ticket? Can it be used multiple times in one day? And how many times a month can you use it? Would you have to get another one if you want to see something at the same show time?&&It's like Planet Fitness. They make the money off the people who don't go.&&This is cool and all, but all the traffic to the site crashed my MoviePass app and I wanted to go see a movie now...&&does anyone know if alamo drafthouse uses this&&If you're trying to see the map of theaters (https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=YOURZIPCODE) they've exceeded their limit of 25K google maps requests per day so unless they increase their limit it won't be available for the rest of the day.&&AMC is threatening to block/sue moviepass. Of course, AMC is the only theater in our town. They bought out Carmike and jacked up the prices and cut service. Fuck AMC.    
    
http://deadline.com/2017/08/amc-theatres-block-moviepass-1202149783/&&signed up. lol, it's cheaper than 1 movie ticket in nyc. is this real life?&&Moviepass is legit. I signed up last night, and watched my first movie today. Was easy as pie. The theaters in my area have eticketing so all i had to do was punch in the confirmation code at the kiosk and boom.. ticket in hand. I'm going to the movies all the freaking time now. 

I even got rewards points from my theater so every 7 movies I'll get a free popcorn/soda. This is way too good to be true. &&I would've been happy with a movie a week for ten bucks&&Sounds too good to be true&&I'm not trying anything that won't tell me where its supported in my area before I sign up.

AMC Slams MoviePass, Threatening Legal Action

I used to have Moviepass and used it at AMC all the time. Hopefully they don't exit the deal the currently have with Moviepass due to the pricing change. &&I can't get the theatre map to load.

>the company also raised cash on Tuesday by selling a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., a small, publicly traded data firm in New York

>Ted Farnsworth, chief executive officer at Helios and Matheson, said the goal is to amass a large base of customers and collect data on viewing behaviors. That information could then be used to eventually target advertisements or other marketing materials to subscribers. “It’s no different than Facebook or Google,” Farnsworth said. “The more we understand our fans, the more we can target them.”

>Lowe said the data-based business model is still “years in the future.”

But honestly I doubt they're just tossing that data away for now. They'll still sell it It just won't be a major revenue source for ""a few years"".

Also the markets seem to believe this will be a profitable move.

I've had it for 3 years now, and I've found it absurdly worthwhile (originally $35 a month and then the price hike last year to $45, which I was fine with).

Come back to me moviepass!&&I saw it on MSNBC and it's on the front page of slick deals and now it's on Reddit. It's definitely getting a hug.&&Theaters make most of their money on concessions anyway. I'm sure they would be cool with this, as more people in the door equals more potential concessions buyers

Edit: so I've gotten responses that both agree with and contradict what I wrote. I'm at work right now, but the answer seems to be ""it depends on the theater"".

[This article](http://fortune.com/2015/02/18/movie-theaters-concessions/) from 2015 gives AMC's 2014 revenue from ticket sales at $1.77 billion (down from 1.85 billion). It also AMC's concessions revenue at $798 million (up from $787 million).

What that doesn't take into account, however, is the cost. [This article] (http://business.time.com/2009/12/07/movie-theaters-make-85-profit-at-concession-stands/) from 2009 says that ~85% of concessions sales are profit and has links to other articles that support the claim that concessions are the money maker.

[This article](http://money.cnn.com/2002/03/08/smbusiness/q_movies/) from 2002 which was linked to the previous article says that studios take 70-80% gross from the opening week sales. That number goes down in subsequent weeks, bottoming out at 35% around the 6th week. It doesn't give much more detailed numbers and I'm sure that they vary per studio and per movie theater/chain. 

So ultimately, it seems like movie theaters take in more revenue from ticket sales than concessions, but the margins on concessions are much higher.&&I'm not sure what Moviepass is doing now, but when I was a member 2 years ago, Moviepass wasn't in business with the theaters at all and were still paying full price to the theaters for the tickets. It was just a debit card. Now, with this price, I don't know though.&&That won't be a problem as they pay the full ticket price to the theater, it's only moviepass that is losing the money&&Cost was never a factor in my reasoning for why I stopped going to movies in theaters regularly.  Audiences had just become trash to deal with.  It's great that you, person who is about to comment, have NEVER EVER had someone text, talk, yell at your movie theater and/or can just go to the Alamo Drafthouse or similar option.  I don't have that luxury and average about 2 out of 3 movies having some problem person in the theater regardless of crowd size or time of day.  The only times I go to theaters now are for Marvel movies and when I know it's a film that if I don't see it opening night I will be spoiled.  The worst thing is I can never see a horror movie in a theater ever again.  That is a 100% guarantee of audience bullshit during quiet tense moments or people using their phones because they are scared of the film.&&I don’t even know if it makes a difference to the theaters. The way this works is Moviepass activates the card they send you when you check into the theater. The theater then just runs that card like it’s a regular credit or debit card. If anything I would imagine them wanting something like this because they can show more ticket sales (and likely concessions).&&Moviepass still pays the full ticket price, I believe. This is Moviepass making the bet, not theatre chains.&&MoviePass pays movie theaters the full-price of the ticket: [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want)&&You haven't tried to buy tickets for a major concert before.

At the end they said the user already exists, but then I got my email an hour or two later.&&doubt they pay full price, think of it similar to how hotels drop prices to ensure they book all their rooms.   if the movie is going to play either way, is it better to have 10 people who pay full price or 50 people who pay half price?&&Me neither haha. I linked an article to Bloomber news that seems to say that they are trying to increase subscription counts so they can start  gathering data on users to use for ad revenue. Not sure how profitable that will be either. &&It's not. They are dropping the price to achieve scale quickly. Growth matters more than profitability for VC-funded startups. MoviePass sold a stake of their company to a data firm, so you can definitely expect them to sell movie watching behavior data to enable more targeted ads and marketing.&&For every person like me, who has still been SAVING money even at the $44.99 price point, there are probably 10 people who go to the movies between 1-5 times per year.  Same with gym memberships.  The under-users subsidize the over-users.&&[deleted]&&well i just signed up only to see that almost none of the wealth of theaters around me support it, so that's a huge bummer &&Yeah exactly. I have seen my friend have to take a picture of his ticket to verify that he bought the right ticket now but even still $9.95 is less than the cost of one ticket in NYC so I don't know why I wouldn't do it. &&There was a thread a while ago that said it some pass (not sure if it was this one or not) limited you to not going twice within 24 hours as opposed to going once per calendar day. So if you went to a 5pm showing on Saturday. You couldn't go to a 4:45 showing on Sunday.

Do you know how the Moviepass subscription works as far as using on consecutive days?&&Same here, 3.5 years and have loved the service the entire time.  Lucky enough to be in a market that they never experimented with the business model, so it's been smooth sailing since the beginning.  

I've always expected the price to go up as movie ticket prices continued to trickle upward, so this is a most welcome surprise.&&> For 9.95, I just can't imagine why someone wouldn't get it.

$10/mo is basically paying for a movie ticket per month. To be frank, I don't have interest in a lot of what Hollywood puts out these days, and I only go to the theater to see films I *reeeaaallly* want to see - which amounts to maybe 3-4 movies per year. That means I would be spending $120 per year on movies instead of $40-50.

That said, it really is an amazing deal, and I'm debating on whether or not to buy a pass just for the cheap entertainment value. 


&&I just got Sinemia. it's a similar thing but it allowed 3D and Imax, plus you can buy one ticket online per week. How far in advanced can you buy tickets? Could I stop by the theater in the morning and buy tickets for that night? Or the next day?&&Basically, for me, all the theaters around me are assigned seating, and if I wait until the day of the show to buy my tickets I'm sitting in the front row, so I ended up almost never using the card.

Also, I got a couple of shitty phones in a row, and had to install the app three times in a year, and they helpfully explained that if I had to install the app again they wouldn't verify it, so I couldn't actually use the service I was paying for, so fuck them.&&35 was too much for me bc Id only go maybe once a month.  I dont live in a walkable distance from a theater.  but this new rate is almost too good to be true&&The way it works is you get a card in the mail. Each time you want to use it you have to be at the theater and check in on the phone app using your GPS to verify you are actually there. Then it will activate the card and load exactly the amount for a ticket onto the card to use. &&They have an app, when you're at the theater, you select a movie and showtime that will load the debit card they've supplied with the amount of the ticket. Go to the kiosk/window and buy the ticket with that card. 

You cannot buy in advance, you can only buy same day tickets. &&Yeah, unless there's something I'm not seeing on that site, it looks like I have to sign up and put in CC information just to find out if my local theater accepts it.&&I agree. You would think there is a list of theaters that it supports on their website, but there is nothing. Their FAQ is also zero help.

To use the app to check the theater listing, you have to sign up for the service. Why would I want to sign up if I don't know if my theater supports it?&&[deleted]&&Is this service available in Canada??&&Ciniplex is a cancer&&I wanted to ask if this would interfere with Crown Club or Stubs rewards negatively, seeing that it doesn't is helpful.&&> Veteran MoviePass subscriber here.

YES.  I've seen so many great movies that I wouldn't have given a chance without MoviePass.  I've also seen a lot of bad movies that I shouldn't have given a chance, but hindsight is 20/20!&&FYI for everyone who can read JSON, go to https://www.moviepass.com/theaters/zip/90210 to get the list.

Just wanted to mention&&Once a day unlimited days. And yeah you have to go to the theater. &&Thats every gym.&&What is the logic behind this. The article says they get full price for the tickets so it does not hurt them; if this increases traffic into the theaters it also means more concessions sales and that is where the real money is. 

Is their concern that the increase of people going to the movies will require them to hire more people and then if movie pass raises their prices they will have to have massive layoffs?&&Shhh!&&https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=10001&&Well fortunately for you their website literally has a map that shows all of the supported theaters.&&As far as I know, MoviePass pays the full price of tickets to the theaters. Unless that's incorrect or has changed, nothing should change on the theater's end, and would, in fact, drive attendance. They'd have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

A while back, however, AMC was talking about rolling out its own MoviePass-like program where a person could see a movie a day for $35-$45 a month. If that was still in the works, this would throw a wrench in those plans.&&that's the old policy. Not the new one. That is before this Netflix guy took over.&&It probably does not apply nowadays since moviepass has new rules and this new $9.95 offer is not a yearly contract. You could dig further into the site FAQ or call the information line.&&earlier i saw there was no cancelation fee. you can hold your account. you just cancel and reapply. &&I read this too. However, I found a different post from  2015 that describes a cancelation fee based on length of subscription: [Buyer Beware: MoviePass Hidden Early Termination Fee](https://geekdad.com/2015/09/moviepass-early-termination-fee/) 

Don't know which is more accurate- still researching while the website is down

EDIT: Current terms and discussions with support are indicating that there is NO Cancellation fee, and that you pay month-to-month, not locked in for a year. $10/month price point is guaranteed for 1 year. However, please be aware that T&C indicates that subscription restrictions are subject to change, and that MoviePass reserves the right to cancel a subscription at any time. This means they could put limits on how many movies a month you get with this price point. However, in my area, even if I only see 2 movies a month then I am still saving over 50%.&&I have had this happen once as well in the 2 years I have used the service. They also have a service line you can call if you run into that problem again. &&I'd be interested in this as well.&&Its traffic. I wasn't even able to use the service today as a long time customer. The app is not functioning properly today. &&I got charged, was able to log in to the app (which is still broken).  I'll give it a day and check if it's up and running.  No confirmation email but don't think I need one and didn't see anything about getting one.  I was able to login and they said they are mailing my card, so I think I'm fine.&&It works at all the big chains. It's the smaller indie theaters where it's hit or miss. Landmark, Arclight and *some* Alamo locations have been the big miss as far as ""chains"" go. &&From what I can tell they take most. All the amc and regal ones I have seen listed here in NYC as well as some smaller indie houses&&Not only can you, but the rewards cards ""think"" you're paying the full ticket price.  So in theory if you saw 10 movies at $12 per ticket in one month, you'd pay $9.95 but you'd get $120 worth of rewards.

ALSO, AMC Stubs Premiere lets you use your points to renew your membership.  So after the initial investment ($15 per year I believe), having MoviePass ALSO pays for an annual AMC Stubs Premiere membership.&&Yes, I use it with my AMC Stubs card and still get points. &&Only works on 1 ticket per day.

So if you wanted your family to be able to go unlimited like you, they'd need their own accounts.&&no catch. moviepass tried many different prices but people got mad and cancelled.

they have a new CEO from netflix so they lowered it to $9.95/month.&&A few catches I saw mentioned in the comments-

-Can't reserve seats earlier, have to go day of

-only for 2D regular movies

-pretty sure it's per person

-the last line makes it seem like after 12 months they may raise the prices again&&Not sure how AMC is going to stop them, they use a debit/CC to purchase tickets.

I think AMC is scared that this may lower ticket prices significantly.

Which I'm for... the theater industry wheel needs to be smashed.  It's an outdated model.&&More than pays for itself in Los Angeles or New York.&&I think the gotcha is that you pay every month.  Yes, you can cancel but most people don't. Sure, there are some months that I may go to a couple movies but there are several months where I don't go at all.

That being said, I'd sign up for this with my local movie theater just to help ensure they stay open.&&I had read an earlier review of Moviepass that said you had to book the tickets in person at the theater. You can't book tickets online.&&[deleted]&&This must be what it's like to be rich. I can easily afford something!!!!!&&A matinee showing around here is $10.75.&&Can you speak to how easy it is to see new movies? I'm spoiled by being able to just buy tickets online and pick my seats. No need to wait in line. Would this membership card make me have to go to the theater, buy the ticket on the day of, and then wait in line for seats? Essentially the same way it was before online ticket purchasing. &&Yeah, might find a movie I actually want to watch.&&Not likely, if it's the way it was before, where they have to send you a card first. But they might have changed that as well&&If you see it at an AMC you should be able to. You won't need your card as when you check into the theater at an AMC you will get a confirmation number for your ticket.&&That's a really great price. $50 is obscene, but 10 is amazing.

There are cinemas here in the UK that give you unlimited passes for about £20, and I think that's a pretty good deal.&&You can only buy tickets the day of the screening. Of the theater requires the use of the card you will get sent, then you will have to be at the theater to do it. If the theater is an AMC you will get a confirmation number for your ticket and can check in at any point that day from anywhere.&&Where I live a standard, 2D movie ticket at an AMC is $16.99. Consider yourself lucky.&&Let's get this to Canada!&&What country is it available in?&&It's also just shittily designed.

>> As before, there is no contract, so you are free to cancel at any time. This price point will be guaranteed for at least 12 months for those who sign up during this period. **Space is limited.**&&and under a model like this I might actually feel more inclined to occasionally splurge on consessions&&From an econ standpoint it's called ""Perishable inventory.""  Basically any of those empty seats would be more profitable with any kind of income at all. &&This is a very common misconception. As a manager at a big theater I can tell you that box office revenue is just as important as concessions sales. If you're movie theater is selling a lot of tickets you will be just fine. Smaller chains may have to rely on concession sales a little more, but many average - above average theaters are fine as long as people are filling the seats.&&How do they expect to make any money?

I just signed up too and it's only showing Studio Movie Grills, but at the bottom it says ""Want to see more theaters? Request MoviePass Card"".  I hope that's the case - this is really awesome if it works.&&They did just get rid of the ticket verification too. &&This was true for a year or two, but over the summer they reverted to the original policy of allowing one movie per day no matter the showtime.&&Yeah, if Hollywood films aren't your thing, then it's not for you. It had a limited audience at $40-50. You'd have to be a hardcore movie goer to get the most value. 

At $9.99, its got a broader audience. My sister's don't watch anywhere near the amount of movies I do, but they watch *at least* 12. 

Plus, if you live in a big city, they cover a decent amount if indie cinemas. In Chicago, it covers The Music Box and the Siskel Film Center which are as far from Hollywood as you get. &&You can only buy for the same day. So you could show up in the morning to buy ticket for later that day, but not for a future day. &&This is my concern. I really only see new movies and I've grown accustomed to picking my seats in advance. I dread having to go back to the days of coming early to wait in line for a new movie. So this service is not useful for me then?&&Thanks! I don't like the idea of not having my seat reserved, but even if I just used it for the mid-week movies I go to it'd still be completely worth it.    
      
All that being said, I still don't understand how this could possibly maintain at this monthly price point.&&Are there ever any restrictions on when you can get a ticket (i.e. only during matinee times)?

They can see when I go and what movie I see. &&Their current price is in the same general neighborhood as a single ticket, though, and iirc they are paying the theaters full price for each use. Data has value, sure, but I doubt there's any way they're getting $8-12 aggregate per viewing.&&Nah it is just for 2D regular tickets. Usually if you try to buy tickets that are more then the card will either get declined or it will be approved for the normal price and you pay the balance &&Ctrl-F - ""Canada"", see this reply. :(&&Still not working for me. Looks like they really were not prepared for the influx of web traffic with this price drop, which seems dumb. &&Wish MyVue did which is right near my hose&&I guess it's possible that it was so terrible that they scrapped it shortly after they instituted it. I'd say that policy was probably put in sometime in November or December last year, that's around the time when I scrapped my subscription. 

Also, can you see a movie any time of the day if you watch two movies on back to back days? In MoviePass' earlier days you had to wait a full 24 hours before you could see another movie, but they did away with last year.&&It says they are over their quota for Google Map API calls today. Who in the hell built this website?? Are they using free heroku dynos?&&[deleted]&&Yeah pretty much, Im a huge movie fan. Sometimes I sneak into a second film and then just buy the ticket using my movie pass for the other movie the next day, so that helps keep my days in the theater down, while still making sure that everyone gets paid for what im watching. &&How long was it between signing up and getting your confirmation email?  I signed up but on the last screen I got an error. When I reloaded the page it said Welcome to Moviepass Congrats etc. but no email has been received (and yes I checked spam).

This link is nowhere on their website.&&And how do I get to this map? 

EDIT: nevermind, found it on [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=moviepass+map).&&That's basically the situation. &&i live near several AMC theaters and none of them appear to support it &&Hooooly shit that's so good. That's an insane deal.&&A typical movie for me is $13.50, this is like a discount service. &&Hell, in Los Angeles, movies are so damned expensive that this thing pays for itself even *without* going to the movies.&&My wife and I both subscribed to it back when it was $50 each pass. We had no problems making it worth the cost. You just go see tons of movies, even bad ones.

We cancelled because we had a baby, and those things just make it hard to see movies on a regular basis. But when it was just us? We'd see 2 movies a week on average.&&>Sure, there are some months that I may go to a couple movies but there are several months where I don't go at all.

The indirect benefit of this service is you don't have to decide if the ticket price for a movie is ""worth it"" or not.  So you can go to movies in the theater you might not have previously.  Like movies that you're only half interested in.  Or movies maybe you didn't even know about due to a lack of marketing or whatever.&&Yeah, but this kind of product would mostly appeal to movie enthusiasts, right? I can't imagine the kind of person who would subscribe to this kind of thing wouldn't go to the movies at least once a month.&&They've changed that. You now pick your seats in the app. &&That's not too bad, for me. The local theater doesn't have assigned seating and the only time I buy advanced tickets has been Star Wars.&&[deleted]&&This may legit make me start going to movies again. I used to go all the time, but now I'm down to once or twice a year because of the cost/inconvenience. &&Their site is crashing, I tried using the app to sign up and that's down also&&Yeah highkey I think we just gave it the hug of deaf &&I read that as manatee and got super excited until I realized that what you actually typed and also that 10.75 to see a manatee might not actually be that great of a deal.&&Yes, that's the one minor inconvenience for most. You can only buy the ticket in person the day of. They're allegedly working on online reservations, but that might be set aside with the lower price.


I see movies during the weekday (which luckily ny schedule allows), and I just get to the theater slightly earlier to be safe, so I've rarely had a problem with not being able to reserve online. Even if you're seeing  a movie at a more popular time though, you can just buy the ticket in person earlier that day.&&But you need to wear pants... Tough choice...&&But this Norwegian movie about salmon is a 92% match.&&[deleted]&&I don't think $50 is obscene considering the service of the subscription. If you're already in the habit of going to more than 3-5 movies a month, then it's still a no-brainer money saver. That said, $9.95 is still leaps and bounds better.&&$50 is not that insane if you go 5-7 times a month. &&$17? that's a robbery&&i think cineplex holds too much of a monopoly here.&&If this was in Canada, I know for a fact, my friends and I would subscribe in a heartbeat. $15 a month is still worth it for me. &&Pretty sure your country's tagline is **Not available in Canada*&&USA&&I just got signed up. So I'm good. Keep TRYING!&&Considering that this is now the price of one ticket, you could finally splurge on that second or third movie of the month that are free for you.&&So you're saying this may influence you to make some concessions..... for concessions?&&Absolutely. I wanna get nachos so bad, but I just dropped $12 on a ticket. I can't justify $7 chips and cheese too. So I sneak in candy and maybe a Subway sandwich. But if I'm on my 3rd movie of the week or even month, I'd be much more inclined to splurge on them stale chips and plastic-y cheese product. And maybe even a sweaty hot dog wrapped in foil, yum!

For the record, I am saying all of this unironically. I genuinely love shitty theater food.&&sure, but at that price they're also cannibalizing their consumers.  I mean if it were getting someone to go that wasn't going to pay that's one thing, but there are some people now that were going to pay for a ticket that are now going to use the card, and I imagine the reimbursements from movie pass are pretty thin if any.&&Thanks for the input. A lot of articles I've read say that concessions is the most important source of revenue for a theater, so it's nice to get an insider's perspective.

If you don't mind me asking, what are your thoughts on MoviePass?&&I noticed, starting about ten years ago when I was still living in San Francisco, that the larger chains (AMC and Century) were really awful to see movies in. People texting on really bright phones, people talking loudly to each other, etc.. I can remember at least two occasions where someone actually answered a phone call during the movie. Lots of babies. One lady had a baby that wouldn't shut up so someone complained to management and when they tried to remove her, she stood up and started yelling at the whole theater that they were intolerant. Several instances of severely drunk people either starting fights with other people in the audience or, on a couple of occasions, with the characters on the screen. I've seen people forcibly removed by the police from three different theaters in SF. By the way, if you try to say anything to any of these people, you're risking a physical altercation. It got pretty terrible. The only theaters I go to in that city now are Alamo Drafthouse and the AMC Kabuki, which for some reason doesn't have the same problems as the downtown theaters. I live in Portland now and experiences are definitely better at indie places like Hollywood Theater, but it's not super bad at the bigger chains with the comfy recliners. There it's mostly yokels who can't help but gasp loudly when something interesting happens or who ""awwwww"" whenever a baby appears on screen. Annoying as fuck, for sure, but at least not as blatantly malicious as the animals in the SF theaters. &&They paid full price when they just started out... It might be that movie theaters finally saw an opportunity and decided to partner up with them?  
The way I see it - movie theaters will still sell tickets from reservation seats, IMAX, 3D, and what not. Leaving moviepass to fill up the rest of their seats and ensuring that theaters will get extra revenue they wouldn't get otherwise. On top of that, people will be more willing to spend money on concessions. So it's a win and another win for theatre chains, and even bigger win for moviepass since there is noway they can possibly pay full price at $10/m but at discounted rate like this... a **lot** of people will be buying it. Which again, helps theatres more.  
I have one right outside my house... probably go there less than twice a year.. with the pass might go there weekly if it's really $10/m.&&The price is guaranteed for 12 months. They probably made a deal with participating theaters to bring in more customers in exchange for lower rates. The theaters still profit, since it doesn't really cost more to have more people in for a show and they still make money on concessions and people bringing friends.&&Sure but this is coming from the cofounder of Netflix. Ya know, the service that is everything it is precisely due to data analytics and nothing else. &&That's exactly what they're doing. They plan on going public around March. It's in the article.&&stupid me immediately tried to cancel my account when i saw the lack of theaters and of course the app gave me issues with that so at this point i have no idea what's going on and i can't contact the company to ask until a bit later &&only MJR and Goodrich show up in the app. i gave AMC, Regal, Emagine, and several small chains in my area. &&I think it's just getting slammed right now. I'm a returning subscriber and I see my local Regal and Cinemark theaters showing up.&&I'm looking at the map on their homepage and it shows only 4 theaters and a pop-up in all of DC. None of the Landmark theaters that I usually frequent are listed.  What a bummer.

EDIT: I took the plunge, figuring I could see three movies for ten bucks next month even if I don't plan on keeping the service. Their app is TERRIBLY slow right now, but its the first day of $10/mo. pricing, so I can give that a pass.

For the DMV, [here's what they offer](https://imgur.com/XFyIs7I?r):

* Regal Bethesda
* AMC Courthouse
* AMC Mazza Friendship Heights
* The Avalon on Connecticut Ave  

And in DC proper: 

* AMC Loews Uptown
* AMC Loews Georgetown
* Regal Gallery Place 
* Angelika Pop-up at Union Market

Hope this helps, /u/indiebass and /u/jaypeg25&&I was wondering why they got rid of it because they only started it a few months ago.&&I noticed that. That was annoying at shit; not just taking the picture, but taking the picture a million times because the camera wouldn't send it through or whatever. I only had to do it a handful of times, but it was the worst. Especially trying to do it on the subway on the way to a movie. &&Smart of them to switch to calendar day. The 24 hour stipulation was a really dumb way of administering the one/day limit.&&>Plus, if you live in a big city, they cover a decent amount if indie cinemas.

Yeah, this is the aspect of the deal that is making me consider it. I live in Atlanta and there are a couple indie theaters that I really enjoy going to for under-the-radar films.&&Not being able to reserve seats sucks for theaters that offer it (such as my local cinemark). To get around it, I buy my seats on the cinemark app ahead of time. When I get to the theater, I return the tickets (full refund up until show time) and then reorder them with moviepass (since they are now released). &&They got funding from a VC firm and are effectively restructuring the business. They were previously operating on the business model you'd expect from a gym: Offer a subscription at a reasonable-enough price, and hope to make money off the people who have the subscription and don't actually use it enough.

Now, they're intending to sell at a price point that will create a massive, massive userbase and use the data they can gather on their userbase to sell to advertisers and generate a profit that way.&&Nope&&That's fine. I've bought tickets in the morning for an evening show. Just has to be the same day.&&Fandango charges fees and the card only gets loaded with the exact amount for a ticket + tax so I don't think that would work. &&Unless you go earlier in the day.&&I'm getting a page with ""Application error"" but thanks.&&https://www.moviepass.com/register/map?zip=90210 change it to your zip. I was surprised how many theaters participate. It might take awhile to load but it eventually will&&damn. I go to the movies once a week as it is (I try and hit cheap night), this would be an absolute steal for me...&&Wow, I thought I was a power user, Im a diamond member, but haven't gotten up to free popcorn status yet. How many lifetime points do you have? Im at about 350,000 but am curious to know what a top user would have. &&Well that's another problem, I'm receiving an error when trying to sign in to the app.&&Right?  

Feel free to track that. I'll be happy. I'd do reviews of the movie or the theater too for that. &&The only way it makes sense is if a ton of people sign up that use it less than once a month.&&It sounds like even still it's worth it if you only have to pay the balance for some movies.&&I only had to picture-verify my ticket once, I've been a subscriber for two and half years.  The picture thing was about 2 months ago.&&do you pretty much just see every movie without any discretion? do you go around to many different theaters? i'm kind of surprised there are enough different movies for you to see this many lol&&Across the railroad tracks, take the second left, then turn right after the third fire hydrant and there's one next to the flea market.&&Hugged to death :/&&Do they not show up in the App itself?&&My friends and I have been going almost exclusively on Tuesdays just because why the fuck not when its $5 instead of $12-13, but this is like a game changer. &&#Buy half a movie, get 29.5 free!&&Los Angeles here. $13 is unheard of.

EDIT: I should clarify. I'm in the middle of the *City* of Los Angeles, and I was saying that $13 or *less* is unheard of. Discounts don't count—I'm referring to base prices for those of us who aren't students, seniors, or able to skip work to see matinees. :-(

EDIT 2: Okay, Jesus, people—you can see movies here for less than $13. But it's true that we're #3 in the nation for most expensive movie tickets.&&Kind of like an insurance. You don't want to risk walking into a movie by accident and go bankrupt because you have to pay a full ticket, so you buy the pass just to make sure.&&Here in NYC I'm literally making money buying this pass. &&-those things-

Lmao&&That's very true for me. Hell, I've only been going to the theaters for action movies or anything visually striking where I know the $13 ticket is worth it for the big screen and sound.

I'm just reading through these comments to see if there's any downside at all because $10/mo to see (as I currently understand it) one movie per day is a hell of a deal and sounds too good to be true.&&Whoa really? So I can book the tickets sitting at home in the morning for a 7:30 show?&&It makes sense. The infrastructure is already there, the movies are being made regardless. The only big change is that people stopped being willing to pay an awful lot for movies.

This could be a huge change in the future of movies, because if I'm being honest a movie is often best experienced in theatre, even though people stopped being willing to pay a large amount for it, understandably so. Let's hope we'll go back to a time where 'going to the movies' is not just something nostalgic for a large amount of people.&&I started to think that too, stopped going altogether about 18 months ago. But...I like not going now. The idea of sticky floors, unclean seats, cellphones and talking still turn me off. My home viewing is a far better experience, even at $10/month. 

Still I see how this would be great for many others. &&Walk me through the process, I sign up today, fork over my $10 and receive the card in the mail. I have the card, now what?

Do I simply present the card in person and get a movie ticket? Or do I have to be proactive about getting refunded money? For example I present the card and still pay out of pocket and get reimbursed at the end?

I mean what is the exact process? I don't want more than the $10 per month coming out of my pocket. Period. &&I wouldn't say you need to... it's highly recommended though.&&If anyone gives you any guff for Porky Pigging it at the theater, politely remind them that the sign on the door says, ""No shirt, No shoes: No service."" Doesn't mention pants. At. All.&&Not entirely true unless they are changing it. I've had movie pass for years and have gotten into every fathom event I have tried to go to, as recently as Batman and Harley Quinn last night.&&3 movies is not break even at $50. 4 is break even for non matinee in certain cities and not a money saver. 5 minimum to save money, plus it commits you to that min of 5 a month. It's absurd and I don't believe there are that many people who go see movies 5 times every single month indefinitely. Now at $20 a month this would be a great deal for just about anyone who gets out of their house for more than just life obligations. I feel like they undercut themselves a bit too much at $10 but hey I'm the consumer, I'll take it!&&That's Manhattan for ya. But I've also stuck with MoviePass through their price hikes, so this whole service has been a godsend.&&Ugh. And their digital movie situation is bollox. No, dickheads, I don’t want to spend more on a movie to rent that I can’t watch on any device beyond a laptop.  

The fact that they’ve not worked to create something for more STB devices like the Apple TV baffles me. 

I want to pay. Let me pay. But no, you keep fucking it up. &&No Canada at all?
&&Yeah I got through! Are you able to see available theaters in the app? I can log in but can't see any theaters (I know there are participating theaters in my area).&&It's less than the price of a movie ticket!  I could go to the movies with two other people, and if we each paid for the subscription, it would be as if one of us got into the movie for free!&&If you really think about it, it kind of makes sense economically. I go to the movies fairly frequently, more so than many of my friends. With that being said, I most likely spent around ~$100 on movie tickets last year, not including any other purchases at the theatre. 

MoviePass is basically capping my movie ticket yearly purchase at $120. Sure I might go to a couple more movies with the pass, but I'm just filling an empty seat anyways. This will be profitable to MoviePass, as there are tons of customers who will purchase this pass & will not redeem it for $120 worth of movie tickets throughout the year.

It's very similar to gym memberships. Yes, gyms might not make much profit off of the guy who buys the $10 monthly membership and uses the gym 3x per day. But, for every one of those guys there are three customers who buy the $10 membership, go 5x per month, and won't cancel as ""it's only $10 per month.""&&I work in finance and cover movie theaters, and it's not a misconception at all. Exhibitors absolutely rely more on concessions for a variety of reasons. 

AMC made $0.49 cents on every dollar at the box office and $0.85 on every dollar at the concession stand last quarter. AMC's box office profits barely cover its fixed costs. They also probably have some of the best profit share arrangements in terms of film rental. Tickets are important to theaters because, asides from the profit it does provide, it means people are more likely to buy concessions. 

Relying too much on ticket sales gives too much power tostudios in terms of film rental arrangements and the general slate of films.  No well run theater is ever going to rely on the box office other than as a proxy for concessions. &&its hollywood math. they are ""shifting"" the costs on paper into one category so they can say they don't make anything on tickets when in fact they make upwards of 80% of the ticket price (depends on deal and how long movie is in theater the long its played the more of the ticket they get to keep)&&I'm right there with you. My wife and I never go to the movies anymore but for $10 a month I think I might start going again.  And every time I go to the movies I would spend 15 or $20 on concessions.&&the theatre list will empty until you get your card and attach to your account. They are terrible at explaining things&&Their theater map is still under construction I think, don't cancel until you can contact their support. &&Are you sure you’re not taking about ETicket? The special debit card should work pretty much everywhere if you do a purchase inside the theater.&&Damn. I only ever go to E St or Atlantic Plumbing for movies these days. I'd sign up in a heartbeat if they were eligible in this. &&Maybe they have better integration with the cinemas and have better ability to do accurate billing between them and the cinema, or maybe they lost too many subscribers over it and had to shed it.&&Can you not go to the theater and buy a ticket for later that day? Or even another day? It has to be for the exact time you're physically at the theater?&&This link just takes me to the signup screen&&Heh... 1.5 million. (Yikes) but also remember I was paying the $99/ premium MP that included IMAX, and I'm an IMAX nut. I work from home all day. MP is my Netflix. Can't stand staying in the house after work is done! &&Just letting you know, it's probably because their everything is fucked right now. This news obliterated their website and app. The internet collectively DDoS'd them. Their website comes up and then goes right back down. &&Interesting how this general opinion has shifted over the last decade. Zuckerberg wouldn't shut up about how it was shifting for the last 5 years.&&Well, that is, ultimately, the GOAL of advertising: to deliver you an item that they think you want to buy. We see advertising as this awful bullshit because we don't give a shit about 99% of the garbage out there; targeted advertising is the solution.&&As if cinema chains weren't already tracking it anyway. &&Yep. Their data must show that the average person signed up barely sees a movie a month.&&I figured out early on that you could get around the picture-verification by reporting that the app glitched and wouldn't let you send the picture. The app is so notoriously terrible (it serves its purpose—select theater, select showtime—and has never prevented me from using the service or getting a ticket in time but it does crash and bug out kind of a lot) that no one would question it. The whole service is pretty easy to game in ways that are undetectable and also not detrimental to moviepass or the theaters (i.e. there's a way to see movies twice, there's a way to use it to buy tickets for another day)&&I nearly see everything. I have been studying film for the last few years in school, so I will pretty much watch anything just to practice speak about what I do and don't like, but I often ovoid obvious junk. For example the movies I've chosen to skip recently are: the emoji movie, Despicable Me 3, Kidnap and The Nut Job, but my theater also has been adding two-four Indian or Korean films a month, so Ive been expanding on my international cinema this year. I live across the street from an 18 theater megaplex so Im pretty lucky. &&they do not &&Man same here. One of those restaraunt theater chains in my area does $5 Tuesdays. It is the only way to see movies now...we are spoiled. Even for big releases we all want to see we can't bring ourselves to go to an actual crowded theater for $13 a piece.

 Plus, unlimited soda refills for a plastic cup of soda the size of larges at normal theaters that would cost $7 is only $4.75.&&I watched Seven and 30 days of night. Now I have no idea what I paid.&&But you must buy one every month. &&eh, not so- hit up an AMC before noon on the weekends and it's $7.50.&&[deleted]&&Just don't tell him I said it.

But Ike, if for any reason you are reading through dad's Reddit post history, just remember, your mother and I cancelled our unlimited movies for your sake.&&As far as I can tell. I just signed up today, and they have to send you the card in the mail, so I can't confirm until I get it. But from their [FAQ](https://i.imgur.com/8zvNKuP.png), this seems to be the case. 

EDIT: [Looks like the ""e-ticket"" thing is only available with certain theatres.](https://i.imgur.com/hqw1n8R.png) &&A monthly pass makes a LOT of sense. 

I think the big thing that's changed that's escaped the studios' attention is that the internet, social media, and the ability to watch movies online (legally) means that falls in the ""wait and see it on TV"" bucket is far more easily identified and bypassed. 

For example - if I had a monthly pass, I probably would have gone to see *Suicide Squad* in the theater. But no fucking way was I paying over $10 to see it. 

So with the empty seats sitting there, these movies could actually become profit drivers for movie theaters, since subscription seats still buy concessions. 

Honestly, I don't even mind if the pass is blocked during opening weekend or while a movie is Top-5ing it. 

I'll wager this is a ""bait"" pricing - obviously we're all talking about it and thinking about it. Betcha if it takes off (hopefully it will) then over time the price will creep back up. If they're smart they'll grandfather pricing, so if you sign up at $9.95 then you can pay that until you die or the company goes out of business. &&Find an Alamo drafthouse. They gladly kick out people for cellphones or talking&&There might be an activation fee too (something like $30-- the moviepass website got the hug of death so I can't check).


So you pay the fee, you get the card in the mail, and you download the moviepass app on whatever smartphone you have. Once the app is downloaded you register it with your card.


Each time you see a movie, you'll need your moviepass card and your phone with you. You find the theater you're at on the app (which will show up automatically based on your entered zip code and/or location), you ""check in"" to the movie time you're going to (the app looks like fandango), and you'll get a conformation immediately. You can now use your card at the theaters kiosk or box office to purchase the ticket (checking into the movie on the app loads the card with the money to by the ticket. So the card otherwise has no balance. And you can't check in without being in or at least close to the theater, since the app accounts for your location).


That's it. It might sound like a process, but once you get the hang of it, it takes like 10 seconds all together. There used to be the added step of taking a picture of your ticket stub after purchase, but they fazed that out recently.


Other than the $9.95 a month (and the possible registration fee), you won't get charged anything else.

**EDIT:**


**Just to add some cons and quirks, so people know what they're signing up for:**

* You can only see one movie per day.

* Every now and then, though its rare, a movie won't show up on the app, even though every other movie in the theater is showing up. I've contacted both moviepass (who said there's no reason it shouldn't be showing up), and the theaters (who also said there's no reason it shouldn't be showing up, though I don't think they fully understood what moviepass is), but it still happens on occasion. It's happened for the last three a24 release for example, where they'll take over a week after they release to finally show up. Good Time still isn't showing up on the app despite coming out Friday. The work around is checking in to the movie through the costumer service chat on the app.

* Four times in the three years that I've used it, the app freezes in some way: the check in process never completes, or no theaters or movies show up. Luckily, again, you can just check in to the movie through the costumer service chat. The app is always fine the next time I use it.

* And lastly, this news seems to have crashed their servers, since the app wouldn't load at all for the movie I just saw, and their customer service is so swamped I couldn't have them check me in on their end. I bought the ticket myself and I'm hoping they reimburse me. Thanks for crashing it guys!&&You have the app on your phone along with your card. When you are within 100 feet of the theater you want to get your ticket for, it allows you to check in on the app for the movie and time you want a ticket for. Then movie pass loads funds onto your movie pass debit card, so you can buy your ticket. I used to be a member and i would go to the theater i wanted to see a movie at during my lunch break for that night, so i could pick my seats and get my ticket in hand so i could just show up like i normally would. I cancelled when they raised the price to $45 a month, but now i might sign back up. &&I'd say it depends on what kind of movie theater you are going to.  And I doubt those movie theaters accept Moviepass. &&Nah, just wear a dress!  All the benefits of pantsless, but with modesty!&&> 3 movies is not break even at $50

Very much depends on where you live. In large cities thats easily breakeven.&&$16.67 (obviously not that exact price) is unfortunately not unheard of for single tickets. Regardless, I gave a range on purpose: it varies.&&When I lived in Harlem, I could only afford too go the matinees (about $8) which is no fun. :(&&[deleted]&&Damn it.

replace the 90210 with your area code to see the moviepass theater near you, the closest one to me is a half an hour away &&A lot of people have reported in the past that it doesn't ""unlock"" all the available theaters in your area until you physically get/activate your card.  I don't know the logic behind it but many people have stated it, both ITT and on other sites.  You can't use it until you get the card anyway.

In theory, you can use it at any theater that puts showtimes online (so the app can populate for you) and takes debit cards (so you can use their card).  Theaters don't have to opt-in, it's like using a gift card that they keep re-filling for you.&&After successfully logging in it told me there were no theaters in my area which seemed unlikely. Sure enough after a while all the major theaters near me popped up, so it's probably just a side effect of them not being able to handle all of this traffic. &&Same here. I live in the heart of LA and my map is showing no theaters near me at all.. definitely something wrong with their app/websites end&&80 is a little generous, most movies are starting at 30/70 with 30 going to theater. It can shift depending on how long a movie is in the theater and the deals. It's different between companies and the deals they can make with the distributors.

-current movie theater employee&&Basically the way it works is a movie buys the rights to show a movie. they then have to give the studios a percentage of the ticket revenue for that movie a week. This can start extremely high like 80% or more. It then goes down week after week until the movie has been out for so long that the theater is actually making all of the money on ticket sales for that movie. This is also why some movies seem to be there forever (mostly animated kids movies)
as there is a steady stream of people going to see it. We had a secret life of pets in the theater I work at for nearly 6 months because we had about 5 people per showing for 6 showings. 12$ per ticket and math, 360$ per day on weekends.&&that seems like an awful strategy.

i want to know if my local theaters support it BEFORE i give them money&&I can still see the theaters without a card but it took like 10 tries&&Probably was too much of a hassle &&I think you can do it for later that day, but not a day in advance. My local theater you have to reserve your seat, versus open seating, so most people reserve them days in advance. &&You can buy tickets in advance for as far as the schedule is up! Just don't lose the ticket stub.

-movie theater employee&&Wow, nice! I guess I have a long way to go. Im sure the IMAX helped too. I almost sprung for the $99 plan just because it only takes 2 IMAX movies a month to make that worth it. &&This is different, by them data mining my movie going habits, it ends up a net benefit for me.  Now if they were using the app to see my Google history, that would be very different.&&Not as detailed. Now they know the gender and exact age group and location of movie goers&&I use to have Netflix by mail and would forget to use it for a month at a time.&&Most likely they're looking for sleeping dogs. They'll lost a ton of money up front, but any subscription service is going to amass a ton of people who simply forget to cancel- and at 9.95 they probably won't go out of their way to do it.

This service only works for standard movies in 2D, you can't reserve your seats, and it requires you to validate your location via GPS. That's gonna be annoying enough that most casual movie goers may not even use it sometimes.

Its in the concessions. My biggest issue has been spending $30 on food an drinks while also spending $20+ on tickets.

Why do that when I can wait a few months and buy it on Amazon for $14-$20 and save myself half price?

The prices they charge to allow us to show their movies have gone through the roof the last decade. It's a shitty stuck in the middle situation, as without the movies a theater can't make any money, but distributors will always be able to make money whether it's TV plays, DVD/digital sales, etc. That entire building is paid for by only concession sales in most theaters in the US. Utilities, payroll, property taxes/lease, everything. I promise, we hate charging you that, but nearly every theater I've looked at numbers for is scraping by :/&&A great tragedy.  And to replace it with a worse theater, to boot.  &&>I'm not an asshole for telling people to turn off their phones because the light is incredibly distracting. 

Agreed, and I feel bad for people who live in places where this is common behavior at movies.

I go to the movies maybe 3 times a month, and I rarely see anyone turn their cell phone on or otherwise act like a dick - maybe once or twice a year.   I don't know if it's a geographic thing or just the type of movies I go to - but the theater experience is great and for me, so much better than watching a movie at home where my biggest enemy is myself (checking my own phone, getting snacks, etc.)&&Yes, you can use it at the kiosks. As far as the theater is concerned it's just like any other credit card.


I'm unsure about using it with the theater awards programs, but I don't see why you wouldn't be able to, since again, the kiosk doesn't know the difference between a normal credit card or a moviepass card.&&It works with AMC Stubs. It's really awesome because I see enough movies that once I break even on the MoviePass subscription cost, I basically get free Stubs points.&&There is a time limit?&&Exactly. &&Now I will only use my scene points for 3D UltraAVX with DBox, it's the most expensive ticket you can redeem for 1500 points, I think it's like $25 if you were to pay.

I will only go see giant blockbusters now that will take full advantage of the theatre going experience.  If it's a smaller movie like a drama or a comedy, I will just wait to watch it at home, where I have either a 65"" or 13' screen to choose from. 

However, if I could pay $10 a month for unlimited movies, I absolutely would be in the theatre at least once a week. 

&&Rolling like a celebrity.&&No, theatres aren't opting in or out. Moviepass works like a debit card, and is accepted at theatres as a debit card. They arent kicking back anything, because moviepass is paying them just like any other way you'd buy a ticket.
Moviepass is making money based on the fact that many people will sign up and not use it, like plenty of other sub services, and the fact that they were recently bought by an ad company, who will no doubt sell your movie going habits to other companies.&&lol thanks, but their site seems busted to hell right now&&I think this is sort of a feature, not a bug, from movie pass's point of view. 

It doesn't really drive sales for high demand weekend releases--theaters are gonna be swamped then anyway. I'm sure they pitch this to theaters as a way to generate foot traffic for the middle of the week and off weeks when nothing big is releasing. 

Think how often theaters project movies to empty or nearly empty audiences.

I can't figure out what they're upset about. They must be planning to roll out a competitive monthly service or something.&&Yep.

Let's hope this is it.  Obviously Dumb and dumber, Zoolander and Joe dirt were not going to pull it off. &&God I hope they serve large farva's at my local Alamo.&&I'm cautiously optimistic, but I hope the whole movie isn't just constant call-backs to the first. &&""Graphic nudity"". Dammit, we're gonna have to see Farva's dick again, aren't we? &&I'm not worried at all. I backed the movie during its Indegogo campaign and their hearts are definitely in it. They didn't reach the funding goal to get Brian Cox, but he had so much fun the first time, he took a pay cut to come back anyway. I think they did hit the funding goals for ""super awesome blockbuster car chase"" and ""see rabbit fuck a REAL BEAR"" though, so I'm confident that it will be awesome. Plus, Rob Lowe is the bad guy. The girl from Zohan is in it too. 

Now that they're almost done, I should soon be receiving my mustache, my aviators, and my badge. Planning on going to the theater dressed as my spirit animal: Rod Farva. &&They look a lot better then I thought they would age wise and It looks like it's self aware and not trying to top the original like zoolander or anchor man.

*Hell Yeah I do*

God I missed this. Can this please come out right meow instead of 2018? &&Lots of people shitting on the movie already.

It's a 60 second trailer that used some call-back jokes to reintroduce the characters and how they interact with one another from a movie that came out 15 years ago. 

Relax.  

&&Best Picture - go ahead and start the engraving&&Jim Gaffigan is...bigger.&&Started watching this and 11 videos later I found out I've been shaving my pubes off wrong for years. &&Find it kind of amusing how people are claiming they are reusing the meow joke. Um, no. If anything they are making fun of the fact that Jim Gaffigan is expecting them to do the meow joke while they have no idea what he's talking about. They are poking fun of movies that reuse the same jokes and idea from the first. At least, that's how I interpreted it. &&Fuck I am so excited, I am going to drink a liter of cola&&ENHANCE&&Maybe I was just instantly recalling the hilarity of the first one but I laughed and had a smile on my face the entire time I watched that.  Will definitely go see in the theater!

&&I laughed 4-5 times watching this teaser trailer.  Which is 4-5 more times than the entire 2016 Ghostbusters movie.&&Meow I can die happy.&&MOTHER OF GOD&&I saw the preview of it at a screening  and I laughed so hard. It's really funny 

They all worked so hard to get this movie made- they deserve so much success &&[deleted]&&First excitedly read this as ""Starship Troopers 2"" .. then realised I'm a tool.&&I have never seen the original,do I need to fix that?&&I can not wait! ... I went on set as a featured extra August 2016.  It was so much fun meeting the whole cast.  I got to also watch a few scenes being filmed.  It was hard to hold back my laughter.

I wish the trailer mentioned the plot lol.  It sucks knowing it and not being able to share it hahaha.

&&Fuck yes, thats all. Fuck yes!&&are you people fucking kidding me? the negativity about this is insane. There is under a minute of footage from the movie and you guys are shitting on it. for a site where there are tons of people who either claim to be cinephiles, screenwriters, filmmakers or ""working in the industry"" you think you would have the smarts to watch the entire film or even a longer trailer before shitting on it. 

This site messes with your mind, learn to form your own opinions people and try not to get caught up with the negative idiots that pollute this website. &&Remember Meow jokes!

*cries in a corner*&&I hope they constantly do call-backs but the joke is told by poorly Farva so the other characters can get annoyed about him reusing their old jokes.&&I used to listen to Heffernan and Lemme's podcast and hey said there will definitely be some call back jokes but they knew going in that they didn't want to saturate the film with them. So I have optimistic expectations. &&I feel ya, way to many sequels do this, its like they are trying to be fan-servicey but just come off as cringey. We could probably start a list.&&Like joe dirt 2? Isn't that the point of a sql?&&I'm sure they'll do a couple but I trust these guys at making original stuff. I think they know how shitty a reboot would be with just the same old jokes&&I listened to their podcast Chewin' It for a while and they talked about how they specifically didn't want to be a sequel packed with a bunch of recycled jokes (kind of how Anchorman 2 was). That said, I am also cautiously optimistic, but at the same time, hearing how passionate and excited they seemed while making this, I feel like we are in good hands. &&The guy who plays Thorny hinted that it might be his this time. Apparently he owes one to the guy who plays Farva. &&I'd be alright with seeing the German chick naked again. Zis time wish ze pussy.&&Very doubtful.  I saw Farva live at a comedy show and he said it was his biggest regret to get his dick out in that movie. &&This time it'll be *all* their dicks... wearing mustaches.  Fan service.&&On Kevin Keffernan and Steve Lemme's (Farva and Mac) podcast, Lemme talked about his dick being in camera, so I'd assume it's his. &&My spirit animal is Car Ramrod.&&Brian Cox when interviewed didnt even remember working on the first movie.&&Took me a second to figure out they weren't trying to get the physicist to make a cameo.&&If you don't get naked from the waist down at some point, you're doing it wrong.&&$20 paid on indigogo for Farva to call me a chickenfucker was some of the best spent cash of the year.&&Ya know... I never put 2 and 2 together that Captain O'Hagan was William Stryker in X-Men.&&> their hearts are definitely in it

See, I think that's where some of these sequels actually fail. Their hearts are in it to the point that it turns into a private circle-jerk and no one looks at it from an audience perspective. I think that was one of the biggest failures of Anchorman 2. They clearly all thought they were having a fun time, and no one took the time to sit back and objectively edit it.

I worry that's what going to happen here too, but I'm basically done when it comes to these kinds of sequels.&&How was zoolander 2 such a horrible flop. Boggles my mind&&The second anchor man was shockingly bad. it seemed like a straight to DVD kinda film. So bad and im a simpleton when it comes to movies. &&Keep in mind Super Troopers came out 16 years ago and that DVD quality videos were at best 720 × 576 (576p); they do look like they aged well, but we are seeing them far clearer that we did previously.  &&>  better then I thought

Not as much as the first one but it still had some pretty funny moments&&Great username - do you still own the record for World's Stickiest Bogey?&&[deleted]&&I want to as well, but I'm a little nervous about what work will say when I take off the afternoon of 4/20.&&With moviepass, there are a lot of 'fuck it' movies I'm planning on seeing.&&""son of a bitch we've been doing that for years.""

All joking aside, this made me laugh more as well. &&[deleted]&&You know there are already multiple Starship Troopers sequels, right?   I'm not saying they're good, just that they already exist. &&Yes, ideally multiple times.&&Immediately. Literally right now. Go. &&Thank you for not spoiling.

There's a difference between just redoing the same jokes and making fun of sequels for redoing the same jokes.

Have you fools forgotten the first movie or what?

First scene is a few stoners trying to get rid of weed by tossing it out then eating a whole bag of shrooms.

The movies plot revolves around a weed bust.

There's a fairly long and hilarious scene of them smoking the evidence they've collected...

It's not a ""stoner"" movie like cheech and chong, or half baked... but it's definitely in the realm of grandmas boy - plenty of casual references and use of weed. And lots of people watched these movies while stoned... these guys know their audience.

And besides it's literally ONE reference to weed in a one minute clip.

Chill out?&&I'm just hoping for a Weedfest reference.&&Maybe they break up Potfest?&&Why? There already was a Starship Troopers 2&&Do you not remember them busting a literal TON of weed in the first movie? And then making use of it?&&No. No it didn't. It's better if you just trust me.&&They decided to make it a crackle exclusive. &&It went straight to Crackle&&No it didn’t. 

But just Incase you’re not sold and want to find out...there was a scene where they dropped the “thug life” shades.

No I don’t mean he dropped some shades down after a hilariously mediocre burn....

I warned you.

https://youtu.be/yI0ehRug6Kg&&That's definitely for the best.&&Meh, I watched it with a buddy and we had fun. Wasn't the best movie I have seen, but we both were in tears during the airplane bathroom scene.&&it was originally released on Crackle.    it can be found elsewhere now.  don't do it.
&&After Dumb and Dumber, the Farrelly Brothers made Kingpin,  Something about Mary, Me Myself and Irene, Shallow Hal, and plenty of other movies. Some weren't great (Stuck on You), but D&D was hardly a one-off.

Ben Stiller was in Starsky & Hutch and the Night at the Museum movies with Owen Wilson, and he also directed Tropic Thunder. Plus there were plenty of other combinations of people from the Zoolander cast working together later on.&&I think the problem with that is they went all out in the first. The second was just a rehash of the same jokes. &&And Anchorman...&&I want a god damn liter'a'cola!&&Lady in blue, coming through. Never shit a shitter.&&Eh, Fuck it.&&That would be genius. I'd prefer if they didn't but that seems the only way to play that card. 

It can't be as bad as Joe dirt 2 right?   Right guys...? &&""Hey guys, I can't remember the name of that restaurant I liked...""&&I think 22 jumpstreet pulled the callbacks off well by being pretty 4th wall&&Oooold poorly Farva &&My guess is that since this is a teaser trailer then they are just using the throwbacks to remind people what it is about. In the next trailer they will get into what the plot will be and such.&&even here, the call back to ""meow"" leads to the real joke being them whispering and being heard every time they think they're being sneaky. as long as they do stuff like this where it builds on the old it's great&&I just discovered that podcast. You forget sometimes that these guys are actually smart&&Joe Dirt 2

&&Yea... though when done right, if the movie knows how ridiculous the joke is, it can work really well. See 22 jump street.

But I agree, comedy sequels are hard to pull off because you gotta toe the line between redoing all the same old jokes and trying ot make new ones that probably wont work as well. So hopefully this movie is in on the joke and knows how ridiculous it is. And I have hope just from that little mountie scene, that they are in on it.&&Anchorman is one of my favorite comedies. The 2nd one tries way too hard to be the first and it's awful for it. Made me so sad&&A right join would've worked better. &&>sql 

is this a database joke?&&That would be Jay Chandrasekhar, I think I spelled that right.&&Who wants a mustache ride?&&Lolol

I did however find a video Brian Cox made to help with the crowdfunding campaign back in 2015.

Then again, he was picking up a prescription at 3am.&&wouldn't have figured him for a pot head, tsk&&And that's why I love shenangins. &&The science version of Demetri Martin... they both unlocked the secret of eternal youth.&&It really was a disaster. I cringed at the incessant call backs to the original, the forced ""insert laugh here"" moments.

Felt like a fan made sequel.&&There were a lot of reasons why Zoolander 2 was terrible. One of which was the writer and creator of the original, Drake Sather committed suicide in 2004. 

So the sequel was essentially a rudderless ship from the initial concept. &&I liked it&&Honestly I thought it was a huge ""fuck you"" to the first movie to completely reverse the happy ending.&&Honestly the first half was okay. Not good, but watchable. As soon as he goes to that lighthouse the movie takes a fuckin nosedive though. &&The rated-R version is like a totally different movie than the theatrical one, and I'd definitely recommend that if you haven't seen it. It's not just more risqué dialogue, entire scenes are different, which is apparently the version they wanted to do all along. Makes it much, much better. &&I actually fell asleep while watching it...twice and I don't sleep during movies at all..&&The director wanted to make his pet project, The Big Short, the studio said they would only finance it if he would make Anchorman 2. He agreed, and then put the least amount of effort into Anchorman 2. He says as much in an interview somewhere. &&Yes&&Probably just a joke from the movie&&They could've used Cillian Murphy as a backup and no one would've known the difference.&&You look like the chairman, president and CEO of Levi Strauss.&&They barely existed in the first place&&they broke up years ago. i only remember that, because i used the news as a way to take a cheap shot at a local band who seemed like their entire purpose was to be jet, but like.. better.

Still seems odd to change that plot point. A movie about them being Spurbury PD would be a lot more entertaining and different.

In the sequel, they seemed to know that what they were doing was wrong and it came across as really mean-spirited. I honestly disliked them in the sequel. &&It was probably one of my all time disappointments.  I was so excited for that movie, too. &&I couldn't agree more. The genius of the original was that they were the only idiots in it. The rest of the movie had a completely different atmosphere.

With the new one everyone was a joke and that mixed in with the constant throwbacks just made it unbearable &&It would have been more forgivable if it came out soon after the original, in a way, but when it takes like 20 frinkin' years to make it with the people involved talking about how they were just 'waiting for the perfect script', it's somehow worse.

Then one day I randomly went on while it was past the middle and it was fucking hilarious. I had no idea how funny the second half was &&Exactly! I think I suffered through the rest and then went back and watched that one scene ten more times. I'm sure Kyle wrote that, it seems written in his voice, and also is the only funny part. &&I had no idea who that was and had to look him up. Thankfully he has no lines...&&To be fair, the first movie had Derek attending parties featuring famous reality TV socialites like Paris Hilton and Donald Trump.

Yeah we get it, he's got mental issues but in the first one his home run lines didn't come all that often so it was refreshing and hilarious. Due to Steve Carrell blowing up in popularity, his role obviously was dramatically increased in the sequel, couple that with just an absurd amplified version and it was just intolerable. &&Way too much brick&&He had one funny moment.

At times during this movie I completely agree with your assessment, but other times I respect it's unblinking absurdity.

Ben sits alone in the desert. It's been ten years since he came to Tattooine. His day is routine; he meditates. He does Jedi crossfit. He hurts for food. He does his force exercises picking up stones. He stares into the light of his laser sword. He finds a way to the outskirts of the Lars moisture farm to keep an eye on young Skywalker. This is his routine. 

Until one day during his hunt he finds a injured Middle aged woman on his usual path. He wants to mind his own business, stay anonymous. But the goodness inside convinces him to act. He helps the lady but she is on death's door; delusional. dehydrated. 

Ben gets the woman to his home. She's needed several days to recover. When she is able, she frantically tells Ben of her two daughters. They've been abducted by the Sand People. She was as well, but after torturing her, they released her. Ben knows he can't do anything. He's the last of the Jedi, but he's alone. But he's still Jedi. So he decides to help find the daughters. Ben won't admit it, but he's happy to have some excitement in his life again.

After doing detective work, Ben finds the Tuskin Raiders group that abducted the girls. They aren't forthcoming and attack. Ben tries not to hurt them, but they get the upper hand. So Ben does what he didn't want to do. He pulls out his lightsaber and the Tuskin Raiders are scared shitless. Ben defeats them and find his way into the pen in the cave. No one there. A lone protocol damaged droid reveals the Tuskin have sold their abductees. 

Ben and the woman go to Mos Eisley where Ben has to befriend smugglers to find out who would be willing to buy slaves from the Sand People. He eventually joins a crew to get to a planet where the girls were sent. He cannot reveal himself as a Jedi so he has to go undercover as a smuggler. He gets in many fights before reaching the girls. All the while using blasters, his fist, and secretly his force powers. In the climax, as he is about to save the girls, he nearly pulls out his lightsaber, but finds another way not to make it obvious he is Jedi.

He saves the girls, and gets them back to Tattooine. He goes back to his usual routine. Years pass. He's secretly bored again. Until he gets a visitor at his door. It's young Skywalker. CGI Mark Hamill says one word, ""Ben.""

&&The director choice seems to indicate the return of Ewan in the series (they'd be the dumbest not to set him aside) and maybe a more thoughtful movie then an actioner which would be great IMO.&&My favorite Stephen Daldry story: during the creation of the acclaimed ""Billy Elliot"" stage musical, Elton John turned in a pop-oriented, bouncy demo score keeping with what his own music sounded like at the time when the story took place. Daldry, who returned to conceive and direct the musical, reportedly said ""What the fuck is this shit, Elton?""

Elton replied ""It's Elton John.""

To which Daldry responded, ""Well, I don't want Elton Fucking John. I want Reginald Dwight."" So Elton scrapped much of the poppy, upbeat feel of the show and wrote a stripped-down, folk and British pub-song influenced score which most people today consider the pinnacle of his work writing for the stage and screen.

Moral: If Daldry can corral the notoriously prickly and uncooperative Sir Elton John into going against his commercial impulses and crafting something artistic, he may be the perfect person to work with the Disney/Lucas Complex.&&[deleted]&&I'll let you have my money if it's Ewan McGregor.&&Well events in Rebels mean a certain storyline cant be done, and tbh Obi Wan was not supposed to be doing much while on Tatooine...not against it though....but Disney:

More Sith, more Jedi, etc. &&I'm not sure what story they can tell that would actually be meaningful to the series as a whole (especially since they would need to avoid planetary travel and keep low stakes since he's in hiding and all), but I'd love to see Ewan's return to the role!&&Tom Hanks as Obi-Wan Kenobi

/s&&Would be neat to see Liam come back as Qui Gon&&This could be a good movie but I am more then ready for them to move on with the universe.  I hope they eventually move past the old characters and start to expand the new universe with one-shot movies revolving around the new players.  I understand why they're doing them (easy marketing, familiarity, etc..) but I feel like once Episode 9 is complete they'd be much better off fleshing out the universe by supporting all the new story arcs and moving things forward making it feel like a more persistent, evolving world that we're watching.

Disney needs to stop expanding this universe inward.

EDIT: I should probably clarify that the issue isn't *more* Star Wars content, it's the abundance of Star Wars content that seeks to ""fill in the blanks"" rather than explore this gigantic universe. 

Maybe people tend to forget that these movies aren't the only the only source of New Canon. That also emcompasses TV shows, books, and Marvel Comics, few of which have done much away from the Skywalker story and elements/characters related to it.

I like McGregor a lot in this role, don't get me wrong. I just don't know what Disney plans on achieving by making this the tentpole release following Episode IX. It's signaling a move backwards, and not forwards into the world of the new trilogy that will have just completed when this movie releases.&&Ewan or GTFO. &&Obi-Wan kicking rocks in the desert for 1.5 hrs reflecting on the justifications for dicing up his friend.

After the disaster that is the Han Solo production I've lost faith in Disney to do anything other than deliver safe and predictable films designed to do nothing more than recuperate their multi-billion dollar investment in buying Star Wars. 

Rogue One was a step in the right direction but even that had its flaws. To follow it with two standalone films about characters we're already familiar with shows that Disney is aiming at risk aversion. They aren't interested in truly exploring the IP they purchased, they just want to use it as a brand to sell whatever crap they can turn out.

Do it. &&Or 2 hours of him, Mace Windu (he survived his apparent death, why not?), Yoda, Jar-Jar, and others getting drunk at a Tattoine bar and trading stories on what an ass Anakin was to everyone. Directed by Quentin Tarantino&&[deleted]&&I'd watch that. McGregor is a fantastic actor. He could pull it off. &&I'd still be there, opening night.  Star Wars should have more tonally different movies, like Rogue One.  I want to see a Star Wars romcom, a slapstick comedy, a horror film, and some R-rated action flicks by 2034.&&Black & White/Greyscale&&I would unironically watch the shit out of that, and I'd enjoy it too.&&Scored by Morricone. &&I think that central to this movie is that Obi Wan has a crisis of faith. He nearly murdered his protégée and best friend because he turned one a prophesy that was central to his belief system. Now his religious order is gone and he beliefs have failed him.  When we see him in A New Hope he has evidently found his faith again, so this story should have a process of rediscovery of faith in the Force. &&OK, I didn't know this was something I wanted really badly, but it is. The Tree of Life: A Star Wars Story. Still the same number of shots of outer space, but maybe just a little bit more desert. &&Plus he's a fine actor and age wise would still be OK if they make it a prequel to A New Hope.&&Why am I seeing this comment everywhere? Of course they are bringing Ewan back. There's literally a 0% chance it gets made without him starring.

It's like if they announced Iron Man 4 and a bunch of people went ""I sure hope Robert Downey Jr. is coming back!""&&Starring: Jai Courtney &&From what I've seen, he wants to do it. &&Its gonna be 8 year old Kenobi talking about Angels &&[My buddy and I made a trailer for what it could look like with Ewan last year.](https://vimeo.com/178941014)&&It would be interesting if we saw him acting as something of a surrogate father to Luke, but always on the sidelines. Protecting him from afar, even in the midst of danger. 

I'm guessing the film has to end with a cut to the future, and the older Obi-Wan meeting Luke as an adult.&&Forget the prequels, I think Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan has to be in the conversation for best character in the *entire series*.  I would watch the shit out of a standalone movie with him! &&yeh a standalone ObiWan movie doesnt really work without Ewan. 
&&[deleted]&&can we make some kind of charter of signatures of some kind, ill stand in solidarity, ill do what ever it takes but please bring back ewan for obi wan hes perfect. I mean they did bring back han, leia, and luke right?&&No, it's Watto.&&Same. Ewan or bust.&&Absolutely zero interest if he doesn't come back.&&[He has shown interest in the past](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-ewan-mcgregor-obi-wan-kenobi-movie-disney-anthology-a7690386.html), Disney would be foolish not to bring him back.

/r/prequelmemes jokes aside, I think that the Star Wars community really has embraced the prequels recently and some fans feel frustrated that those movies have been almost whitewashed from history by Disney.  It's as good a time as ever to bring them back like this.&&This is like saying “They release it with the audio track or we riot.” 

Of course they’re going to use Ewan. That’s a total given. &&Negotiations were short. &&> Stephen Daldry

Yup. http://i.imgur.com/OPE1PTg.jpg&&I only know his work from The Crown as of recently. Fantastic show. &&Searched the comments to try to figure out if anyone knew who he was.&&What an unexpected choice&&He directed Billy Elliot! What a great film &&Please spoiler tag this next time.&&Why stop at the beard? We can shave his head and eyebrows and make those CGI too! && I hope not &&>Rotten Tomatoes score of 56% fresh.

Fresh is at least 60%.&&Don't play with my emotions like that. This is the spin off I'd want to be good if it meant every other one was crap. Ewan deserves this too for being the best thing from the prequels. &&This is slightly depressing to read because it's actually not that far fetched. Star Wars will soon become the new Marvel franchise for Disney. They'll churn out conveyor belt films every year with little effort because they know they'll make money. Then every couple years, we might get lucky and get one film that's truly really good.&&> Ewan's face is to be painted green the entire time of filming so they can CGI beard during post

i would watch a documentary concerned with the struggles of fitting cgi-beard tech into a production of this scale&&Praise the maker!&&/r/prequelmemes was running out of material. This and the Solo movie should keep then going into 2025 at least.&&FROM A CERTAIN POINT OF VIEW: A Star Wars Story. &&HIGH GROUND: A Star Wars story&&I can't fathom why they wouldn't bring him back. Disney seems obsessed with fan service when it comes to Star Wars so I can't imagine a world where he doesn't play Obi Wan again. Especially when he's of the right age and is still a relevant actor. &&I think Floyd is gonna win &&That could set up the animosity owen has to ben as well&&That would be awesome to watch but would ruin Luke's backstory if Uncle Owen was anything other than a middle-of-nowhere farmer. His total lack of ambition or interest in affairs outside his farm is an important factor in shaping Luke's character arc.&&The whole thing is the Obi was just a strange hermit in hiding. Him going ham on Tatooine would have blown his cover. &&I didn't realize everyone loved Edgerton so much, but this thread has made that apparent.  Nor did I realize until looking at his imdb just now what a fuck ton of movies he's been in since then.&&The readings are off the chart.&&A surprise to be sure but a welcome one. &&General Kenobi!&&This reminds me of the scene in Battlefield Earth where the aliens think humans love eating rats just because they once saw a human eat a rat. &&Hey bud! I'm making the ""/u/Shot_Dunyun dinner"" for our barbecue on Sunday, I know you like that. Your mom would be really happy if you can make it. I know you're busy with college and everything but let us know!&&..too soon&&I... I... I just had hot dogs and potatoe salad for dinner. Is Disney my dad?&&I made the mistake of telling my grandma that I liked corn on the cob. I got that shit every day for a month when I'd visit during summer vacation. I love that she wanted to please me, but a change of pace would have been nice. &&It's a well established universe with a magical system that everyone knows very well.  There are vast amounts of material outside of the main storyline with lots of interesting locales and characters that could be explored.  Instead of doing any of that we get more filler. 

I appreciate the main story, but these standalones would be a great place to shift into new and interesting territory, not just doing fan service by rehashing old characters. &&If they can get Joel Edgerton back as Uncle Owen as well then we'd really be sucking diesel  &&i would bet my money it's something like this. hell, obi wan on rebels was a straight up samurai.&&I just had a discussion with some friends over the news, and mentioned how awesome it would be if Clint Eastwood directed and it had an ""Unforgiven"" type vibe to it.

We then realized nothing released will top that idea and ineveitably leave us disappointed. &&This is almost the exact story of ""Kenobi"" by John Jackson Miller.

Obi Wan's first year of exile on Tatooine narrated in the style of a western.&&>Ben defeats them

All of them?&&Part of it would be him learning how to use the force to come back as a Force Ghost and communicating with Yoda.  Probably see some great Tuskan Raider action, maybe more podracing and even a quick trip off planet.  I mean, he can't be baby sitting Luke the entire time, Luke barely knows him and Owen calls him a hermit.  &&I wonder if Disney is having a harder time attracting noteable directors for their big franchise movies due to their treatment of Phil Lord and Chris Miller on the Han Solo movie and Edgar Wright on Ant-man. 

There's now the perception that you're only allowed to bring so much creativity into the project and at the end of the day you're still going to make the film we want you to make. Yes, it's probably an amazing paycheck but it's also probably not very exciting knowing you won't have much freedom on something you will end up working 3 years of your life on.  
&&The Hours

The Crown

The Reader

Billy Elliott

Mediocre?&&He’s a 3 time Oscar nominee for directing. Forgettable? Maybe. Mediocre? Far from it. &&I think *The Hours* is a really neat movie (even if it acts more as a supplement to *Mrs. Dalloway* than it does as a movie on its own). &&The Crown is good mate.  I imagine there's going to be more drama than action in this one.&&Oh I'm sure they'll do that too eventually.  &&> since he's in hiding and all

He changed his name to Ben **Kenobi** and hid out on Darth Vader's home planet! As long as he doesn't carve ""I am a Jedi"" into the local system governor's forehead with his light saber I don't think the Empire is gonna catch on.&&more like qui gone amirite (sorry)&&No Salacious Crumb in the prequels?&&It's treason, then.&&I mean, 90% on Rotten Tomatoes isn't a 9/10 in quality, it just means 90% of critics thought the movie was enjoyable—enjoyable basically meaning ""above a 5 or 6/10"". The actual rating for Rogue One was a 65/100 on Metacritic and a 7.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.

RT's system is fine, people just don't tend to understand it, so a 90% screams ""wow this movie is almost perfect??"" to them.&&You haven't even SEEN Han Solo yet and you're already shitting on it because they replaced two children-movie directors with RON HOWARD?&&I know I just sound like a silly old continuity curmudgeon but that's really all this movie should be.

If Obi-Wan is off having space adventures then he's being totally derelict in his duty to watch after Luke. After all the years of war and deaths of his friends and witnessing his entire way of life being destroyed by his own student... I like the idea of Ben Kenobi living a totally pedestrian, boring life until R2-D2 shows up on Tatooine.

He earned it.&&Just him doing daily chores and walking throughout the desert for 2 hours, it'll be the first avant-garde Star Wars film!&&if done incredibly well, that could be great

but fans just want a pretty desert and Obi-wan acting like a cool samurai&&You're absolutely right, Yoda and Obi Wan barely do anything for almost twenty years.  They don't hang out or have big adventures, they hide and stay hidden from the empire.&&I agree. BUT THIS is the one exception I wanted. After this one I hope they get really crazy with when/where/who they focus on.&&That's all it is ever going to be under Disney.&&Ehh:

>Sources say talks are at the earliest of stages and that the project has no script. 

[Hollywood Reporter](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-film-planned-director-talks-1030505) isn't a gossip rag but still take this with some salt, the high end is still ""*actually* thinking about it"" here. &&It's not official, but HollywoodReporter is pretty solid. [They originally reported it](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/obi-wan-kenobi-star-wars-film-planned-director-talks-1030505).&&Then they rob a kyber crystal store only to learn later that Jar-Jar was an undercover Imperial the whole time.&&""DOES. HE. LOOK. LIKE A SITH?!?!""&&[deleted]&&""You owe me 100 Empire scalps... and you will get me my scalps.""&&I never thought I wanted a Star Wars movie directed by Tarantino.&&Five guys, sittin' in a bullpen, in Mos Eisley. Wondering how the fuck they got there. ""What did we do wrong? What shoulda we done? What didn't we do? It's your fault, my fault, his fault."" All that bullshit. Finally someone comes up with the idea, ""Wait a minute. While we were planning this rebellion, all we did was sit around bitching about Skywalker! Got the message? Fellas, I don't mean to holler at ya. When this uprising is over - and I'm sure it's gonna be a successful one - hell, we'll get down to Alderaan, I'll roll and laugh with all of you. You'll find me a different character down there.&&Yeah Mace Windu would have to have survived the fall if Tarantino is directing.

Because Samuel L. Jackson would need to die in the Tarantino movie instead.&&Please!! I love Tarantino and I would pay extra to see this!&&Oh my god fucking please😂😂&&..I said to Anakin: Youre not a master yet! Youre just a padawan! And then I took my big, black, pecker...&&Well according to George Lucas and Samuel L. Jackson, it's basically already canon that Mace Windu survived his fall. Jackson is very vocal about wanting to return to Star Wars so I say this is the perfect chance to do it.&&[deleted]&&That's a song I haven't listened to in a while.&&Goddamn it I *love* The Thin Red Line but this made me laugh. Thank you.&&I really want to see a star wars movie that's just about rogue squadron.  It'll be Top Gun in the star wars universe.&&Sounds like someone wants a Christmas Special&&Star Wars office comedy about the Empire's PR department.&&A full on Ocean's 11 style heist movie where a Rebel cell has been tasked with robbing the Bank Of Coruscant before the Empire can transfer out the plot-irrelevant MacGuffin and take it off world.&&Eh, Rogue One was tonally almost identical to The Force Awakens. It may of been slightly darker (in parts) but it still held on to that post-Avengers brand of Disney humour we've all come to love. &&It's never going to happen, doesn't fit with building a cinematic universe. &&> Greyscale

Starring Iain Glen?&&[deleted]&&Well it certainly couldn't be *after* ANH...

Edit: why are people telling me to tag a spoiler from a 40 year old movie that's probably among most watched movies ever?&&Yeah or a Han Solo film without Harrison Ford!&&The article said it could be an origin story, which would mean Ewan McGregor is too old to play the role.&&And I highly doubt they are not going to go with Ewan. Casting some one else will be stupid since he is a perfect age, one of the best parts of the prequels and has shown interest to reprise the role&&They brought him back for the force awakens. He's on their payroll. He's doing this movie.&&Article suggests it's an origin story though. Ewan will be too old, no? &&One does not simply get this erect &&I heard the deep-space pilots talk about their beauty. They live on one of the moons of Iego.&&I just wanna know what he thinks about sand. &&That was fantastic but I admit Force Ghost Qui-gon took me by surprise&&Really enjoyed that!&&Hooly mooooly. That was rad. 

What would the genre be? I feel like this trailer plays out more like a drama, but for the life of me I can't imagine it being one? Not to knock your trailer, I loved it!&&That was really cool. How on earth did you convince Jesus to act in this? You have good agents&&I guarantee this will be better than any trailer for the actual movie.&&Neat! That actor looks like Jorah Mormont!&&That looks like a professional quality trailer. If I stumbled upon that randomly, I would have thought it was real. &&They've shown some of this aspect in Star Wars Rebels. I know, it's a kids show and not even sure if it's considered canon or EU. [This scene is one of the few that shows what he's been doing between the Clone Wars and A New Hope, in regards to Luke](https://youtu.be/no4SxdIIDBE)&&For sure, people underestimate the prequels too much. Liam Neeson and Ian McDiarmid deserve more recognition too.&&It's almost unimaginable that Disney isn't going to bring back Ewan for this role, given that they gave him a digital cameo in TFA and it's all but acknowledged he was the breakout star of the Prequel Trilogy.&&If he doesn't come back or they try and make it a prequel about a young Obi-Wan it will be the first time I get irrationally upset with how Disney is handling the Star Wars franchise.

I'm a fanboy, so I am willing to look past quite a bit... but that would be the 'straw that broke the camel's back' so-to-speak.

Not that they care what I think, but still...&&He also recorded a line for The Force Awakens, and recently starred in another big Disney film, Beauty and the Beast. The working relationship is definitely there, and he's said that he's willing.&&Disney is backpedaling a *little* bit from the prequel whitewashing, I think.  Tying up loose story ends from The Clone Wars in Rebels is an example of that.  

Initially when they canceled TCW, Disney seemed to think nobody would mind.  It wasn't until the backlash that they actually brought in TCW characters/arcs into Rebels.  I'm hopeful this means they're realizing that shitting on the prequels is going to alienate some fans.

I'm just waiting for them to make a movie set during the prequel era myself.  It would be a nice nod to the fans who still appreciate the prequel films. &&The prequels were bad, but the universe they built was great, and Disney has not been able to replicate that. Everything they do has been derivative of the originals. &&The Crown is fantastic, the reader is fantastic, Billy Elliot (movie) was fantastic... He's a really good choice for a stand alone obi-wan movie if you ask me. 

I was extremely excited about Gareth Edwards being announced for Rogue one, and I was extremely happy with the result, I have the exact same feeling towards Stephen Daldry for Obi-Wan... 

I don't want to say this but I <3 what Disney is doing to Star Wars. &&Like Ang Lee directing The Incredible Hulk...&&A surprise to be sure but a welcome one&&By the time of reshoots it'll be someone else to redo the movie.&&Just get Andy Serkis to play Ewan McGregor playing Obiwan Kenobi.&&Rian Johnson's smooth ride thus far with TLJ is keeping me optimistic&& Not yet.&&Disney will buy rotten tomatoes through a subsidiary and change freshness algorithm to ""be more in tuned with audiences"".&&I feel like the Han Solo movie should have been treated like *Guardians of the Galaxy*, allowing for some fun and and artistic freedom with a heist-flick feeling.&&And I'll go see them all and leave the theater thinking how awesome they were only to come on Reddit and have people tell me I'm an idiot for enjoying them because it was ""actually"" a really bad movie? I'm okay with that.&&It's not far fetched at all. Not even a little.&&If you think prequelmemes is running out of materials, then you are lost!

Ep 1-3

Rogue one

The clone wars

Star wars rebels

And the upcoming Han Solo solo movie&&HELLO THERE: A Star Wars Story&&Only reason I can think of is if they want to do a story about young Obi-Wan.  But hopefully they can put that on the backburner for 10 more years until McGregor is incapable of reprising his role

Really the only places I can see them going are in between episodes III/IV or before episode I.  Anything else is going heavily involve Anakin and we saw that in the prequels already and they won't want to cast a new Anakin alongside McGregor.  &&That would make sense.  In A New Hope its evident that Owen is trying to keep Luke form knowing him at all and simply refers to him as ""Ben Kenobi"" and gives strange look to his wife when his name is mentioned.  I would love to see Edgerton back as Owen and Ewan as Obi Wan.  &&Meh, not so sure I want my one shot at an Obi-Wan flick to be a buddy cop movie.&&One of my favorite Hollywood stories is about Battlefield Earth. Apparently Travolta put up a huge amount of money for the movie, so the studio had little to lose in distributing it, so they let him do what he wanted. 

So for the premiere Travolta rents out this theater in Burbank and invites all the top critics in town, and he's just ridiculously excited to show off this passion project. So they show the movie, and it's... you've seen it, it's a fucking lasagna of bad filmmaking decisions. It's so bad it's fucking amazing. 

So after the film's over, Travolta holds a Q&A afterwards, and he's still super excited. He's convinced he's just made the next Star Wars. So he's in front of this huge crowd of critics and studio people and industry people, and before he takes the first question he says to the crowd ""I can't wait, I just gotta know! I just gotta know, you loved it, didn't you?"" 

And there's this yawn of utter silence. 

And from the back of the crowd a lone, small voice yells ""we love you John!""
&&That reminds me of the time where the Battlefield Earth screenwriters thought that humans love watching and listening to shit because John Travolta invited them to his church.&&I love the movie. It's so stupidly over the top and shit. It's like watching Syfy special or something. Such a good comedy. &&I vote Michael Cera as a young Luke.&&It would be a good way to make it go full circle. Star Wars was inspired by Kurosawa films, and Toshiro Mifune was offered the roll of  Obi-Wan but turned it down.&&Tusken Raider would be interesting.  There's a scene in a comic where Darth Vader is back on Tatooine (iirc the Emperor sent him to work out some deal with Jabba, after ANH), and in his free time he went to go slaughter some.  When he pulls out his lightsaber they start worshiping him because of when Anakin killed not just the men, but the women and the children too.&&Not to mention Joss Whedon and Gareth Edwards, who were allowed to complete the film they were making but made heavy compromises when Disney didn't agree with their vision.&&Look I love Lord and Miller but from what I have read and heard about their treatment of the Han Solo movie they were going to turn it into a farce. The most damning thing I heard was they were treating the character of Han Solo as if he were Ace Ventura. Han Solo movie needs to be self aware with some black comedy, something I figured those two would excel at. But the set reports and comments from the actors have led me to believe that then leaving the project was for the best.&&While I think Disney's heavy-handedness might be offputting, I think the director shake ups on Ant Man and Han Solo were a little more nuanced than you're letting on.

Lord and Miller, as much as I love their work, seem to have not only been in over their heads on a lare production, didn't instill confidence in the cast and crew with their off-mark portrayal of Han Solo and the tone of the movie.

Ant-Man was in development long before the start of Marvel Studios, before Iron Man even. Marvel tried to get the project off the ground multiple times with Wright onboard, but because life just happens, both parties ended up stalling for outside reasons. This was even the reason Ant-Man and Wasp are absent from the first Avengers movie, they were on hold for the solo film. 

By the time Wright became totally available, the studio needs for Ant Man had changed fundamentally from Wright's original vision. They split because the original movie that Wright was set on maaking just wouldn't work anymore.&&Jedi mind tricks do work wonders&&if this movie is set between trilogies, this ***needs*** to be an incredibly well written and directed film that really dives deep into who Obi-wan is without any inconsistencies between the prequels or original trilogy

I doubt it will be&&Who knows. Maybe a bounty hunter or Imperial assassin hears a rumor of Vader's son being on Tatooine and goes to look for him.

Ben Kenobi has to defend Luke in secret, without blowing his cover as a Jedi, and make it seem like nothing suspicious happened.

It could be cool, especially with people much more creative than me thinking of ideas.&&This is the exception that everyone wanted. Seriously, open up any Star Wars Anthology threads on r/movies and I'm willing to be that 90% of the comments say ""make an Obi-Wan movie"". I swear, the Reddit community doesn't know how to do anything but complain. &&I don't think Han Solo has a script yet either.&&So this is basically a test to see how the idea is received.&&Eh.. it's not as if these movies' first priority is the script anyhow. The hot new director (who will later be fucked) tends to come first. &&""Hollywood Reporter isn't a gossip rag"" 

*Reports a lot of the bullshit DCEU rumours that end up being completely false*&&I would pay a lot of credits to see Jar-Jar getting slahed down with a saber.&&Sith Lord is what you mean. r/DarthJarJar&&""SAY SENATE ONE MORE TIME""&&What?&&Holy shit, a non-linear Yoda film would actually be pretty cool.&&I read it from the perspective of Jar Jar. To each his own.&&I feel the need, the need for lightspeed!&&As long as it has the homoerotic volleyball scene with BB-8 as the ball.&&Porkins, you're still in the Danger Zone!&&Previous State:  Flaccid

Current State:  Flesh saber

Didn't realize how much my body wanted a Star Wars Top Gun&&The only Christmas special I want is a Game of Thrones one centered around  Cleganebowl.&&*Jim face hid behind Stormtrooper helmet*&&Something like this on a grander scale would be fantastic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaOSCASqLsE
&&Or mercenaries hired to do the robbing.

Like that episode in The Clone Wars where Cad Bane and co. pull off a heist.&&I don't love that humor&&Yeah I don't get why people act like Rogue One was such a departure from the Star Wars/Disney formula... outside of the ""everyone dies at the end"" ending it was in line with a lot of other recent movies. &&Friendzone: A *Star Wars* Story&&Sure it could! Two hours of Force ghost shenanigans!&&Anaking Skywalker the Third, meet Obi-Wan Clone-Obi.&&Ewan is the perfect age to make a film taking place between Episode III and Episode IV. Harrison Ford is 75. 

The only way I don't see him coming back is if it takes place before Episode I, but I highly doubt they would do that seeing how much the fans want to see Ewan McGregor come back. &&I seriously hope not. I generally don't care for origin stories, but Obi-Wan's backstory is one I give less of a shit about than most.&&Could very well be an origin story of Obi-Wan as we know him in A New Hope, and not an origin story of Obi-Wan from Phantom Menace.  There's plenty of unexplained and unexplored story implied between RotS and ANH, like how Luke seems to think of him as something between a hermit and a legend.&&He *is* the best part to a lot of people who were kids and grew up on the prequels.&&He also recorded ""Rey"" for the scene in the Force Awakens where Rey touches the light saber, so yeah they acknowledge him&&On top of that, even with the prequels starting to become dated, his image, and general portrayal, as Obi-Wan has been the basis of the more recent animated media (save for parts of Rebels, I think, which had Alex Guinness-looking Obi).

Right now, Ewan McGreggor *is* Obi-Wan.&&He's the perfect age if the the storyline is between Revenge of The Sith and A New Hope. But not if they do an origin/young Obi Wan story.&&If Ewan McGregor for whatever reason passes up the role, the actor who plays Beric Dondarrion on Game of Thrones would be really good.&&He did Beauty and the Beast for Disney, I figure there's some contract agreement, right? I mean, how stupid do you have to be. I'm practically throwing money at my monitor to make Ewan Kenobi again!&&If they cast anyone else besides Ewan then they are no different than the sith themselves &&Plus they can't really do anything with him other than post ROTS since they covered Obi's journey from a Padawan to Jedi Master.    It has to be Ewan. &&Unless they go with the origin story like they suggested; which would be a terrible decision quite frankly.&&We was the only part I liked about the prequels.&&They used him in in Beauty and the Beast too, so Disney Execs have had a chance to work with him.&&He also worked for the Mouse on Beauty and the Beast&&...what?&&I've wondered if they'll use a CGI Alec Guinness ghost with Ewan McGregor's voice. 

...I don't think I'd hate it. &&Ugh, not another ""origin story"". Can we just have an Obi-wan movie of him [walking the Tatooine (and other places), getting into adventures and shit!](https://youtu.be/Yh-QWKGbm2Q)? FFS is that too much to ask?

We already know about Obi-wan and don't need to see how he becomes a Jedi or his days as a youngling or shit like that. 

Young Han Solo is already a mistake please don't do it again.&&He's looking pretty young still. Have you seen Fargo?&&The article's use of the word ""origin"" is completely misleading. There is no way this is anything other than between ROTS and ANH.&&His origin story is phantom menace tho. There's not much more we need to know before then, but there is so much room between 3 and 4&&BUY OUR TOYS ^^TM&&Oh man I hope they do ghost Qui-gon. Liam Neeson has done that a few times in the cartoons, but I would love for him to come back in a movie.&&A logan type movie. Obi Wan has a lot of emotion to deal with. He probably blames himself for Anakin and he just lost everyone he knows. Throw in someone discovering that the child is Luke and you have yourself a movie. &&Are you talking about the guy talking to Kenobi, who happens to be the fellow that played Mance Rayder?
&&[deleted]&&Holy shit now I'm gonna have to watch all of these this is great &&Liam Neeson is so boring in that film though. What does he deserve recognition for?&&But if they do young obiwan, that would be like a 14 year old kid at best, which i can't imagine anyone signing up to see&&Wouldn't it be the straw that broke the tauntaun's back?&&The good thing about episode 8 is that there looks like so much new set/location/creature/ships design based on the celebration reel.
&&Queen Elizabeth has actually watched the Netflix series. The palace said she loves it and would have a weekly viewing party. 

For anyone else it's kinda a who cares, but she's 91yrs old, she's seen a lot and met a lot.. very little impresses her so the fact that she actually put time out of her schedule to watch it weekly says a lot. &&Technically Ang Lee directed *the Hulk*, not *the Incredible Hulk*.&&At least people knew who Ang Lee was at the time!&&It was actually the *Hulk* movie which was released in 2003- not the MCU one.&&Omg stop.

I would love to know what the critics questions where and how Travolta reacted to them. &&I feel terrible for any poor soul who wasted money to see it.&&Hey do you think my lightsaber should be blue?

And while most of us love or at least like the final cut of Rogue One, there definitely appears to have been some behind the scenes in-fighting in the movie direction between him and the studio. From the outside looking in, it appears they were the driving force behind him making the major changes to the story. Good examples. 

I can see someone replying that Disney's changes have often been for the better but that's not the main point. The main point (in our hypothesis on why a mediocre director like Stephen Daldry is now at the helm of a major project) is that top directors aren't going to want to work with a studio that is known for heavy meddling, even if it sometimes produces better results. &&Yep, in a different follow-up comment I pointed out that while Disney's meddling is sometimes for the better, it's still easy to see why top directors would be wary of working with them now. Because these projects are their babies and no one likes being told to make major changes to their project, even when they're potentially for the better. &&Also Edgar wright's ant-man script kills off both Henry Pym and Janet Van Dyne.

Like there might be memos and emails but no contracts have been signed and no money has been raised. We can't even rule out possibilities like nobody is acting in any official capacity and just say talking things over at lunch. Or more tangibly some junior suit is exploring this in their own capacity to be brought to Kathleen Kennedy later if it they get something good.

Also please control your cynicism in matters that can only be fundamentally rumors and gossip because everyone with real info is probably under an NDA and thus won't talk.  &&No credits, only money ayyyyy&&*handwave*  
You don't want Jar-Jar in another movie...&&In the actual new canon now, Jar-Jar survived the Galactic Civil War and lives on the streets of Naboo as an outcast, hated by those old enough to know how he was unwittingly complicit in Palpatine's rise to Emperor, but adored by children as a poor *street clown*.

&&.. Honestly I'd probably watch this on loop for a month if it ever happened. &&Exactly. How much more origin do we need beyond what Ep1 gave us. He was still a Padawan then. &&> He's the best part combined with Ian McDiarmid.

Ian McDiarmid was great as Frank.&&I thought Mace Windu was p cool&&It's treason then&&Yeah, but we knew Palpatine was going to be tits af. Ewan killed it, and more importantly, his performance got better with each of the 3 films.&&This is interesting. I think having Anakins turn happen more subtlety and perhaps more ""off screen"" would have been more dramatic and interesting.

Like the audience knows whats happening, even though they can't fully see it, creating dramatic suspense for the final climactic turn.

Like imagine instead of us watching order 66 happen, we watch Obi live it and slowly piece together that it is his friend and student, Anakin, that is going all SS on everybody.

Imagine obi pinned down, anakin lands. He's ecstatic, he has his old friend and ally to help him.

""Anakin, the clone troopers are rebelling. Go left up the ridge, I'll go right.""

And then Anakin unleashes his saber, malice in his eyes, as he slowly walks toward Obi Won. A look of confusion sweeps over obi's face. Why aren't the clone troopers firing at him?....

But Instead we got the story of darth plagueis the wise.&&I'd say that Obi-Wan was the closest to the protagonist, even if Lucas considered Anakin to be. We knew Anakin would turn evil, and he often behaved arrogant or frustrated. 

Obi-Wan however was the ""straight man"" and we followed during many of the important missions while Anakin was just having his romance issues. &&Star Wars was, and still is, a space soap opera about the skywalker family. That's how it was written and always intended to be shown. Making someone else the protagonist would have been fundamentally altering George Lucas' story. But yes, it would have been better. &&The arcade game was the best thing to come out of Episode I.&&I think you accidentally a few words there&&> I'm 21, 22 in December.

So you're 21.&&The coolest part is going into the movies knowing you're watching a great actor like Ewan emulate another great actor, Alec Guinness (Old Ben), while simultaneously bringing his own ideas to the role.  It's awkward in Episode 1 (like a son playing his father) until hippy Liam Neeson dies and we seem him channel Mark Hamill's reaction when Ben died.  We get a glimpse at Obi-Wan's fury before it became tempered with age.

What's really cool is Neeson imitates Guinness, too, showing Obi-Wan's unconventional understanding of the force was learned from his master and taught to Luke.  This is probably why Qui-Gon was the second character audiences in the theater had seen with a green lightsaber, the first being Luke.&&Yeah his fight with grievous in the film was like the most fun sequence turned desperate struggle. The fact a Jedi resorted to using a gun was pretty badass.&&Huh. Episode 3 is the only prequel I enjoy and can stand re-watching.

The clone battle in 2 was pretty danky though.

1 never needs to be watched again.&&Makes me a tad emotional.&&Of all the theories of Rey's family, this is the one I want to be true the most.

Obi-Wan is hands down, far and away my all time favourite Star Wars Character.&&Personally I don't see Obi Wan as needing an origin story and am all in favor of a post Revenge of The Sith movie. &&A fucking candlestick with the only convincing French accent in the entire movie.

This guy replaced my mental image of Lumiere into his rendition of the character.&&Well, that's all the reason I need to rewatch TFA again.&&Exactly!

I think the article is just padding. I'm sure the guys at Disney know that Ewan *is* Obi-Wan. He's aged in ""real time"" from ROTS and having a movie based about 10 years on from his landing on Tatooine would be the best thing they can do. Doing an origin story would be like a less eventful Episode I-II, with a whiny teenage, hot-headed Jedi being told to calm the fuck down by Qui Gon. 

The prequels are as much about Obi-Wan's fall as they are Anakin's. 

It would be a huge mistake on Disney's part to make ANOTHER 'origin' film and I think that after the success of Rogue One, having an insular story that moves things on, and doesn't look backwards, is a good thing. (I see RO as more of a sequel to ROTS than I do as a direct prequel to ANH, weirdly enough.)

Ewan is a fan favourite and universally admired as one of the best things of the prequels. No way they won't capitlise on that again for another film.&&Adventure could come to him though.&&I doubt he was living in a cave on Tatooine for 20 years without ever going off world.&&Please stop&&The idea of this really makes me angry.

Like Obi is tasked with revealing who sithis is, and who his mysterious apprentice is.

Fuck me right?&&I will and have sit through Episode 1 just for that. Its The best thing in the prequels by far...and I'm someone who finds a lot of good things in them. &&Maybe the movie could be told in partial flashbacks. Like the main plot is current day Obi Wan taking out some threat on Tatooine but since there would be lots of meditation and general boringness in there due to being on an uneventful desert planet and the fact that Obi Wan shouldn't be going off world. They could spice it up with some short flashbacks. A few minutes at a time with some glimpses of various key moments of his life. Being discovered by the Jedi, building his first lightsaber. (Fuck yeah a real lightsaber construction scene) Even use CGI to de-age Liam Neeson for a few short cameos (at least use his voice when he communicates as a force ghost)  Maybe Obi Wan could have a force vision/dream of an older more well directed Anakin. 

But really it would be cool to have some prequel related shit in there and see it in the hands of a more competent director. The little glimpses of Coruscant,and Mustafar in Rogue One were neat. 
    &&I don't think you've ever heard a genuinely thick Scottish accent - he's very neutral and well-spoken &&I thought that was Luke all this time.&&Just ramming the fuck out of them.&&It's senator then.&&Yep &&Dewwit.&&[deleted]&&I just want more prequels&&Michael Fassbender would make an amazing Thrawn.&&But think about it, Samuel L Jackson played a warrior with ridiculous ability, but still played the calm, cool headed nature of a Jedi master.

Leonardo Dicaprio is perhaps the only major movie star left with no franchise film.,32321,6rtahb,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6rtahb/leonardo_dicaprio_is_perhaps_the_only_major_movie/,4033,1501956790.0,"I think currently Leo is the biggest movie star. Wolf made close to 400 million and The Revenant made more than 500 million at the BO. Gatsby finished with 350 million, and his presence certainly helped Django make more than 400 million. These are the sort of films that dont really make that kind of money,yet all these films are very successful considering they are more or less serious dramas. Other movie star who previously refrained from franchises, have all joined them. It is not wrong to do so, but these are safer bets as compared to original movies.Washington is also in this category now as he is doing Equalizer 2. 

Therefore, I feel Dicaprio deserves credit for making a big name for himself while doing original films every time.

I've wondered about this a lot, going down some rabbit holes. The notion of corporations undermining the individual's drawing ability and crediting the IP/ corporate product for all the success is something that has emerged in WWE in recent years, much to the chagrin of many wrestling fans. Basically, the individual wrestler is no longer considered the draw; the main attraction now comes from the franchise/ draw.The entire purpose, it seems, is to take away any power the individual might have over the corporation, which would obviously put the company at a disadvantage.


Marvel is probably the starkest example of this in Hollywoo. The films are spectacles that basically sell themselves. And yes, I'm well aware of RDJ/ Ironman's positive effect on box office, but those movies are at critical mass now, and would be making bank regardless.


Basically, we're moving to the point where the individual creative/ artist will have far less sway because they play second fiddle to the spinning wheel of the machine. Interesting times.&&IP?&&>And then you have guys like... who have had supporting roles in a few films within a franchise.

Even the best actors can be made to look shitty if they are being directed and edited poorly (see: all the ""bad acting"" by oscar winners/nominees in the Star Wars prequels) and by the same token a good director and editor will make an actor look better. Pick all the right takes, sense when they can't do a scene well and work around it rather than just have poorly acted scenes in their film, etc.

An actor also has to be careful which scripts they pick, even without a good or bad director attached a good actor/agent can tell whether  the movie will make them look good or not.

I'm not saying that's the case with Leo, delivering a bunch of great performances under tons of different directors is certainly something he has ownership of. But working with the greats has a halo effect.

I also agree about his choice of movies. I am the same with Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt, I might not think they are amazing actors (although I like them a fair bit) but they value their time more than their paycheck and wouldn't waste it making something downright crappy or average. Or at least, they wouldn't do it knowingly.

&&>I'm sure he was offered roles in a lot of other garbage films that would've paid well.

I see what you did there&&>Interesting times.

Indeed.

I hope they don't get too interesting though, since as much as I like big comic book movies and what have you, it would be great if Hollywood also kept doing other stuff.

And I think they will. Things go up and down. Maybe we'll get a return to Biblical epics before we finally get back to a more 70s style approach to film as an artform (that happens to be commercial), but I do hope we go back.

This is a bad argument by OP though.  Leo's last 6 films were directed by Nolan, Eastwood, Tarantino, Luhrmann, Scorsese, and Iñárritu.  Almost all of those directors had Academy Award nominations for Best Picture or Best Director before working with Leo.  (Nolan just had a nomination for original screenplay for Memento, but go a best picture nomination for Inception).  Sure, his presence probably adds to the box office numbers, but it's not like he's turning water into wine.

Daniel Day-Lewis actually carries movies.  He also has great directors behind him, but he truly pulls box office numbers.

For example, There Will Be Blood made ~$75m with a $25m budget.  Most of Paul Thomas Anderson's other films either lost money or broke even.  The exceptions are Boogie Nights (Marky Mark and Burt Reynolds) and Magnolia (Tom Cruise).  But movies like the Master with amazing performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't even crack $30m.

My Left Foot made $15m on a ~£600,000 budget and In the Name of the Father made $65m on a $13m budget.  These are comparable (or even better) numbers compared to Leo and Day-Lewis has won a few Best Actor awards in the process.

Leo is a great actor and I'll pay to watch him in pretty much any film, but he's not usually the main reason why I go and see one of his films.&&With the exception of Silence&&How the fuck he didnt get the oscar leaves me befuddled &&It was a joke, he said he hasn't in several interviews&&He didnt die in Revenant. &&Romeo + Juliet&&Thank goodness I've seen all of those.

And of course he's a bonafide action hero doing his own stunts, and even if it's franchise the Mission impossible movies are all pretty good still, and for huge blockbusters actually kinda thinking mans action movies.

And he likes to do some really out there stuff too, like Oblivion or Edge of Tomorrow, both which I guess would have never been made if it wasn't for his starpower as the main actor.&&takes balls to turn down Star Wars&&> Even Depp shined in the film.

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/film_franchise

So The Godfather films are just as much a franchise as Star Wars is.

The term can also refer to the ownership of the series as opposed to the series itself; my guess is you've associated the term with more commercialized franchises because those are the ones around which conversation related to ownership of the films (marketing strategies, merchandising, etc) are more likely to occur.&&That is really interesting what you brought up about There Will Be Blood. I didn't realize that film did that well at the box office. I think you are onto something in terms of DDL being more of a star than people may think. However, I think OP's point still stands. The Revenant is not something that should make $500 million WW. Sure, Iñárritu got some popularity after Birdman, but I highly doubt his popularity was anywhere near enough to carry it to $500 mil. That is on DiCaprio. Same goes for Baz Luhrmann. The Great Gatsby made almost as much as Baz's last 3 films combined at the domestic box office. 

Scorsese is a trickier situation as the majority of the films he has made in the past 15 years have had DiCaprio, so it is hard to attribute who deserves more credit. I am not going to count Silence against Scorsese because that is a film with incredibly limited reach and on the other hand, Hugo was not catered to Scorsese's demographic audience. Basically, I think DiCaprio increases the reach vastly of some great films that otherwise might have done at best okay.  &&Yeah I agree. Reading through the comments I strained to think of a movie star that defined ""box office draw"", but the first name that popped into my mind was Daniel Day Lewis.

&&Berg-nado&&That ship is looking desperate.&&Goddammit, Beaker!&&Is the background from the perfect storm cover?&&I picture Tommy Wisseau writing that review. &&I need to see this movie&&From one of the reviews:

>No attention was paid at all to continuity, some exterior scenes and establishing shots use the 1936-vintage Queen Mary, moored in Long Beach, CA; while other outside scenes utilize some of the most god-awful CGI animation I've ever seen, which appears to depict the 1912-vintage Titanic. The ship shifts from a '30s three funnel liner to a pre-WWI four funnel liner and back again multiple times, the colors of the funnels even changes between red and yellow and the name sometimes disappears from the bow

Sounds like a winner. I'm going to buy that movie now.&&Typo. It was supposed to be 16/10.

He's obviously talented but it's just so off-putting and I can't erase it from my brain. &&Loved cruise in edge of tomorrow in particular. &&[deleted]&&And you only named new things. Jerry Maguire, Rain Man, A Few Good Men, Top Gun, Risky Business.... Plus he was in the Last Samurai and played a hilarious Stacie Jaxx in Rock of Ages.

He has skills. I think he is underrated as well. &&> Tom Cruise doesn't get enough props for his acting IMHO

People like his acting, he is just annoying and weird &&Absolutely, one of the best actors in our lifetime. Looking forward to see him in American Made. &&I agree - my wording was poor. I feel like, nowadays, people hear the name and only think of the Pirates franchise. While he definitely created an amazing character with Jack Sparrow, it doesn't do justice to the quality of his early works. As you said, nothing compares. Thank you for correcting me.&&Oh sorry, I thought you were being sarcastic lol.  I like it too but it gets a lot of hate on reddit which is probably why I misread your comment.&&Nope, actually involved. De Niro did 2 movies in the 90s with the then very young DiCaprio: Marvin's Room and This Boys Life. He told Scorsese about him which led to his casting in Gangs of New York.

It was a good confluence of events where De Niro recommended someone of similar sensibilities and serious aspirations who suddenly became *extremely* bankable shortly thereafter, of course Scorsese's producing partners said yes.&&I kind of got the impression he was chasing that damn Oscar for a while there, so maybe now that he finally got it he just want to chill in his piles of money with super models. Or maybe he knows he can't be a leading man forever, so he's focusing more on the production side of things. I don't know...

But I do also hope he gets back in the game soon. He's the kind of guy who can get stuff greenlit that might otherwise never be made.&&I highly recommend this [SAG Conversation](https://youtu.be/61oxkOk4jy0) he did. It's a terrific in-depth interview about his career, how he got started, what motivates him etc. If you like Inside The Actors Studio, you're going to love this. You really get to understand him, especially when he talks about his early career. Leo was never going to be anything else than what he is now, it is very deliberate. He even turned down an offer when he was a teenager and unknown, that other actors would kill for. Just for the slim chance he'd get the role in a much more low profile movie.
  
A fun thing you also learn is that he is an LA native, and very good friends with Toby Maguire, who he met on auditions as a kid. Really interesting, fun and relaxed interview, check it out!&&Last I heard, he's doing The Devil in the White City with Scorsese.&&Banging models on yachts is a fun time. I'm assuming. 

The Revenant probably took a lot out of him.&&I really like him. He is not like Crusie, Depp, RDJ, or other big names. As you said, he always plays in original movies, not franchises, and this is really good, impresive. I also like his characters. He doesn't play cliche heroes (superhero or agent etc) who are save the world again, again and again. Cruise loves this characters, RDJ loves, every actor loves, but DiCaprio plays anti-heroes. He loves characters who have mental or healthy or marriage problems. His choses (movies, characters, directors) are perfect. I hope we will see him in a new movie in 2019. 
(sorry for my English :) )&&Huh, isn't he doing the movie based on H. H. Holmes yet? I thought that was the next project he's working on.&&Maybe he's picky, but he's not as picky as Daniel Day-Lewis!&&For the love of God, I hope not. The first one is awful. &&Good news my friend the third film is in development.&&Ocean's is like a half dozen people's franchise.&&Oceans it's Clooney's franchise.&&I hesitate to qualify the Da Vinci Code adaptations as movies.&&Same for Christian Bale. I know he is thought of as an asshole personally but damn that guy can act. I never go to a movie because Christian bale in is it but he is a phenomenal actor and makes the movies he is in better because of it.

The Big Short
American Psycho
The Prestige
The Batman Trilogy

Probably more but those are the first ones I thought of

 Another one is Hugo Weaving 

Elrond in Lord of the Rings
V in V for Vendetta
Mr Smith from The Matrix

&&Yeah, those kind of films are not as prevalent as they used to be, but they are still around here and there. I think something like The Nice Guys would count, or perhaps Sicario. Not over $100 million and not based around a high concept/comic books.&&The point is that DiCaprio has never guaranteed himself a success by choosing to play in a franchise movie. It's not about whether the actor is himself carrying the franchise. It's about being associated with one in some way.&&Birdman made $100m on a ~$13m budget.  That's a pretty huge film if you ask me.  Babel did similar business.  Considering that, the budget of >$100, and Tom Hardy, the Revenant certainly should've made what it did.  Sure, Leo contributes a lot, but Daniel Day Lewis in that role would pull similar numbers.

>Same goes for Baz Luhrmann. The Great Gatsby made almost as much as Baz's last 3 films combined at the domestic box office.

Yes, domestically.  But worldwide it's not even close.  And when you consider the movies, it makes sense.  The Great Gatsby was meant for American audiences.  Jay-Z co-produced the soundtrack and it opened in 50% more theaters.  From Box Office mojo:

Title | Budget (Wikipedia) | Worldwide | Domestic
---|---|---|---
The Great Gatsby | $190m | $351m | $144m
Australia | $130m | $211.3m | $49.6m
Moulin Rouge! | $52m | $179.2m | $57.4m
Romeo + Juliet | $14m | $147.6m | $46.4m

Leo definitely carried both Gatsby and Romeo + Juliet, but those stories are well known to American audiences.  Moulin Rouge! and Australia were original stories.

I won't begin to argue Scorsese because he had about a dozen well recognized films before Gangs of New York and his name will carry a film to great box office numbers in most cases.  Hugo and Silence were outside of Scorsese's core demographic and drove away anyone who would've expected to see Wolf of Wall Street or Gangs of New York.

I'll concede that Leo pulls in bigger box office numbers than Day-Lewis, but they are both ""Hollywood stars"" that can pull in huge box office numbers when they star in Hollywood films.&&I don't know man. Both performances in Dallas Buyer's Club were masterclasses in acting. They utterly sold that friendship despite a lot of the dialogue being really aggressive. And then the behind the scenes stuff where they did everything basically in two takes tops with no rehearsal and how they both basically stopped eating and significantly overshot how many pounds they were supposed to lose really added to it. 

TWoWS was good and no one's denying that but Dallas Buyer's Club was nothing short of jaw dropping. &&It wasn't exactly the best time to release a movie about how someone on wall street ripped people off and paid very little for it.

I'm sorry to the fans, but Johnny Depp, Val Kilmer, or Kevin Costner in the Matrix would have made the movie dog shit. It was totally not a movie for them, but they turned it down so they must have known this too. I like when actors at least know when they will be a good fit or not, so I give them credit for that.&&I can see Cruise pulling it off maybe; you're right though it would've been so different--a blend of his Mission Impossible, Minority Report, and Vanilla Sky characters and signature action movie intensity. Plus, so much running for him to do. That might have actually been a really cool movie though. 

Kevin Costner would've given it such a late-80s, early-90s action movie feel, and The Matrix feels so much newer than that, timeless like Star Wars sort of. Not that Kevin Costner isn't super cool. &&I would pay good money to watch that film.  Leo and S.Jackson are Neo and Morpheus?

Saying masterpiece might have been a bit silly, but I think it's a pretty good movie and not deserving of all the hate it gets here.&&Yeah This Boys Life was a pretty believable abusive father-son relationship between them, and IIRC DeCaprio was still a teenager (or at least early 20s) then.&&That's crazy!&&> d of got the impression he was chasing that damn Oscar for a while there, so maybe now that he finally got it he just want to chill in his piles of money with super models.

> But I do also hope he gets back in

He is very knowledgeable about movie making. I would not be at all surprised if he started directing. &&No way! This is not a man who just phones it in. He has more money than he will ever spend already. He wants to be the greatest actor of all time and I dont think he will stop any time soon picking top level roles. And yes he can def be a leading man forever; look at Liam Neeson, George Clooney, Daniel Day Lewis... &&I kind of assumed he would end up in political office eventually.

If not, that's two Scorsese pictures he's currently on. IMDb also has him listed on The Black Hand (2018) too.&&That's been pushed back as Scorsese is working on The Irishman.

Leo's next film I believe is The Black Hand &&O don't know if I would say RDJ loves playing clichéd heros so much as he loves playing Iron man and the absurd amounts of money it gets him and that leaves him with no time for other stuff.  &&I've always thought Cruise a fantastic actor, and he's had a lot of movies where he had fantastic and convincing characters. He's 100% balls out. I mean... Who can forget Tropic Thunder. People still don't know that's him. But, a few times I felt like I was watching Tom Cruise.

Not so with Leo. I forget it's him, it's always the character I'm watching. He's definitely my favorite, Cruise is a close second for me. 

RDJ while I love his movies, I'm just watching RDJ. &&He's been around for longer and is arguably on another tier acting wise but this whole thread made me think of Daniel Day Lewis. If Leo stays on his current trajectory and picks his roles very wisely over the next 20 years, he could definitely end up with a career very similar to DDL. &&RDJ needed iron man to jumpstart his comeback to film. Prove he was clean and stable again, and that he could still act. I don't think he or anyone else could have predicted that marvel cinematic universe would catch fire. I'm fairly certain there will never be another stand alone ironman movie unless they pay serious $$$ for RDJ. He's pretty much contractually obligated to do MCU movies, but if he stops doing ironman, he can get back to doing new roles in originals. &&It's meant to be, but it's unlikely to become one now.&&I didn't even know it was out. So I checked Rotten Tomatoes. Their 'Critics Consensus' is:

""*Go then, there are other Stephen King adaptations than these.*""

That's freakin hilarious. &&In development or ""in development""? &&[deleted]&&So is the MCU&&Definitely, he's The mastermind. I don't think Brad Pitt really has a franchise either, and I think Leo has had the better career by just a hair.

I regret watching the second and didn't see the third while wishing I also hadn't read that terrible book.&&The big sick?&&>""The great Gatsby"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", and ""Gangs of New York""

Franchises that where basically guaranteed success, hell they're all classics.&&I would disagree that Blade Runner is a ""franchise."" One sequel 35 years later is not a franchise. 

Arguably, Django Unchained is part of a ""franchise"" in the sense that Quentin Tarantino makes a lot of really similar movies in a shared universe marketed through recognition of the director's name and these common elements.&&I think doing a Scorcese movie is an equivalent guarantee of success.&&>Leo definitely carried [...] Gatsby

Not to detract from your argument but I'd argue against this. Leo might have helped the production, but the name recognition alone from the Great Gatsby is the draw. We're talking about a book that has been in high school curriculums since the 1950s if not earlier.&&This. Leo's tragedy was that someone always did better than him every year. &&Yeah for sure. I also like the irony behind the controversy of how the movie was financed in general haha.

Blows my mind that they had Scorsese + Dicaprio and still had such a difficult time financing it, ultimately having to settle on a sketchy production company.&&Wait really?  When I first heard this movie was out I grabbed all of the audio books, just finished the last one last week.  I didn't expect the movie to measure up but that's madness.&&I can't even imagine Samuel L successfully pulling off that role.  And while we're on it, I thought his Mace Windu was lame and I'm sure Laurence Fishburne could've done it far better.  &&Morpheus' fight with Smith in the bathroom, for all of 30 seconds, is one of my favorite fight scenes of all time.

That's what happens when you manage to teach actors to fight instead of the other way around. Lawrence Fishburne does amazing and was completely exhausted at the the end of filming. That whole scene turned out so well&&[deleted]&&Pop quiz, Hot-shot!&&What amazed me about Keanu-zen: if he does not master his style he comes across as wooden. If he DOES master himself he seems to be in very tight control of his feelings whilst still having a warm ambiance about him.

I feel the strong point of John Wick is how amazingly kind he is for someone who slaughters humans by the dozen. Many similar such films are surprisingly dull without this signature penchant for making his assassin-job feel almost... humanitarian.&&What about 


""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.""&&If you haven't seen Master and Commander, Crowe is absolutely perfect for that role.  
As Morpheus?  Just no, I can't  see that; Lawrence Fishburn was the right choice.&&I take it you weren't a fan of having a Huge Jacked man as the hacker in swordfish. :P

On a side note, [some hacker are jacked](http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/pictures/inside-the-wild-lifestlye-of-the-hackers-who-pulled-off-historys-greatest-cybercrime-20101112/the-coder-1292020056).&&I was just trying to picture Depp as Neo and I realized I can not visualize Depp in any role he hasn't played already.&&*portal opens and Rick's head pops up*

So long as the artist hasn't been involved in any sort of sexual assault/abuse/violence type stuff, I'm alright with them being insane but talented. &&Oh the irony&&Its pretty hard to remove the stench of scientology and the fact he acts like a sociopath, we cant get past the unnerving gut feeling theres something not quite right.

That explains why I really loved Toby at the end of Gatsby.  His performance really shined and I think that him being friends with Gatsby and how he really feels, at the end that no-one is there for him but his friends was a very personal reaction and played into his performance strongly.&&They both understand what it is like growing up in such a particular world.&&He turned down hocus pocus for Gilbert grapes&&Devil in the White City and Killers of the Flower Moon are two separate, excellent books that Scorsese and Leo are developing for film. Both are set around the turn of the century and revolve around serial killings that go unrecognized as such for a time (the HH Holmes ""murder castle"" and the deaths of several wealthy Osage Indians, respectively), so Scorsese must be in the mood to tell that kind of story. I loved both books, they're the kind that pull you in with murder and then hit you with fascinating portraits of a moment in history. Overall, two 10/10 books entrusted a fantastic actor/director pair. Color me excited.&&The Black Hand as in the WWI Serb organization? Is there a film being based on that?&&Yeah I was actually hoping for more Sherlock Holmes but I suspect those films got in the way of making gobs of Iron Man money.&&Tom Cruise is more of the prototypical movie star.  Of course he's capable of more,  but sometimes he is just playing the Tom Cruise persona, which is exactly what is expected of him.  Denzel is similar.

Leo doesn't even have that 'default' persona, really.  He actively avoids those kind of roles.&&It's funny because I hate Tom Cruise so much but most of the time when I'm watching his movies, I forget that it's him. It's not Tom Cruise anymore, it's his character. Goddamn that weird bastard, but he's a good damned actor. 

Same with Leo he's amazing, but I don't have a personal level of hate towards him lol&&According to wikipedia they are starting a TV show with the kid and Elba.&&""It was neither"" - Ron Howard&&The latter. They've been trying to get it going for years now. For a while after the second, it was just kind of like ""we should make another one sometime""

but it's been a good long while that they've been serious about it

in all fairness though I do think in the past year or so they've been strong, serious strides to getting it up and running.&&As I understand it they're hoping to start filming next year.&&If Oceans doesn't count for Brad Pitt then Samuel L. Jackson doesn't have a franchise either.

edit: and Russell Crowe. His only part in a franchise film was Jor-El and the possibility of one from the new Mummy movie (but who knows if that will become a thing now). So are we talking about being in a franchise or headlining a franchise film? Leo has never been in a franchise film, Brad Pitt has.&&Third was a really bad movie...and I actually enjoyed the second one.&&An adaptation of a book is way different from a film franchise.&&Isn't Titanic a sure thing?&&Uh, Gangs of New York was a classic? I've read the book when the movie came out. It's an old obscure work of non-fiction, that would have remained so if the movie had never been made.&&I would categorize a franchise in this case as a film where it would be fair to assume a mult-film contract is involved for its leads.&&Except for when he was nominated for What's Eating Gilbert Grape. Sure, you could argue Ralph Fiennes did better than him in Schindler's List, but that doesn't matter since they were both beaten by Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive. &&I would have loved a Mace Windu by Fishburne. And a Dicaprio as Anakin too. I mean Hayden had shit to work with, but an actor like Leo might have saved it, like Ewan McGregor kind of saved Obi-Wan IMO.&&And he was Johnny Utah in Point Break&&But not Speed 2.&&Don't forget *Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure* and subsequent *Bogus Journey*&&one of the best movies ever...  taught me that when you hate a villain so much that your just asking for his death at the end, it means the actor did a great job..    &&It's not about being jacked. Swordfish was fine, Jackman wasn't my issue with that film. The whole screen play was somewhat flawed in my opinion, and I think Travolta may have been my bigger issue with the movie, not a super believable cyber villain I guess. I haven't watched it in ages so I can't really remember my issue with that particular film, but as I said, I don't believe Jackman was my issue. 

Edit: FYI my step 1 in a zombie apocalypse is to find Keanu Reeves as he has come to define resourceful bad ass in my mind. I wasn't even thinking musculature, just personality, I can see Keanu being fairly withdrawn, where as the others I couldn't as much. Joaquin Phoenix or someone who is known to be fairly withdrawn could have been a good fit. IDK I just believe in the end Keanu was perfect for this roll. He want the actor they wanted but he is the actor they needed.&&Whats eating Gilbert Grape was a weird one&&All I'm seeing is a very out of place drunk pirate.&&That's because most of his roles have been ""Johnny Depp."" &&I think he'd be an incredible Joker if he took it in a really dark creepy direction&&1.6/10 is actually a little generous. &&I would love that. Continue chasing that dream and give us incredible, original movies.

Leo established himself as a top actor without that Oscar, and if it serves as inspiration then let him be inspired.&&[deleted]&&Shhhh...shhhh.....baby no...&&That was a good fuckin' move.  He absolutely killed it as Arnie Grape.  I mean to have the self-confidence at that age to even attempt that role says a lot about an actor and where they may go in their career if you ask me. &&Even if he didn't get GG that was a good call&&> the deaths of several wealthy Osage Indians

Oh my gosh, I heard a segment on NPR with the author of that book once. Insane story. All I could think of was, ""Somebody must make a movie out of this.""&&http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6487156/?mode=desktop&ref_=m_ft_dsk

Looks like a remake of the 1950 New York crime film.&&Good. DT deserves a series. Its too big and all over the place for less than a s dozen films. 

I've been saying it for years. HBO needs to do it with books 1 and 4 being movies, and the rest of them all being 6-13 episode seasons. 

Only way to do it justice. &&There were also serious plans for a tv show based on the 2009 film 2012, and they too were quickly scrapped after the movie bombed.&&Yeah, I actually prefer the second movie (Angels & Demons) over the first one (The DaVinci Code).  The third one (Inferno), I agree was just weak overall.  It was a weak story, even weaker adaptation, weak acting all around, some of the accents took me right out of the movie because they just felt like bad stand-in ADR, etc.&&_An adaptation_

Also, how are we defining franchise here? a movie that has 3 or more sequels? Also, do cameos count? I feel like a lot of arbitrary rules are being put so that ""Leo is the only one"", which is a bit silly. 

I mean come on, there's a bunch of original movies that ended up having sequels and didn't loose any integrity, a great example is the godfather.

I wanna talk about it now!

[**visits subreddit**](http://i.imgur.com/8vWmi7E.png)

Oh come on.
&&Unfortunately, the sub has already gone to shit because so many people are posting that they watched a movie and it's kind of hard to have a discussion. Some movies have been posted multiple times already by different people.  There needs to be some order or something. &&It's funny because to me, an OLD movie is a movie from. Like. Maybe 10 years after I was born or earlier. so maybe 1990 and before.

Not a moive from late 2015.&&Top post is The Prestige.

Yeah, fuck that sub already.&&Cool, I do that every night, yesterday I watched Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief for the first time and it was great. Subbed!&&I will comment next time I watch one. I keep oeuvres on lots of oldies like Errol Flynn Lauren Bacall Bette Davis Fred Astaire. So much good stuff out there. Fox Classics in Oz is doing good widescreen restorations. &&There's going to be *a looooot* of reposts.&&I have a blog dedicated to this exact same thing, though I haven't been able to update it for a while due to being a freelance writer for hire now: http://tardytotheviewingparty.wordpress.com.&&I checked out that subreddit and all it does is make me feel old.  All of the movies on the first page were in theaters 10+ years after I was born.   

Honestly I was expecting 1940's and 1950's movies. &&Ohhhh an old movie! I read ""i watch donald movie"" and found stunning that somebody else also saved that [post for the Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land movie] (http://imgur.com/a/tdSFy) and it took long to watch.

Disclamer: Still haven't watched it. But read the comic long ago.&&Mostly 90 and 80s films. Yeah that old.&&Oh man, looking through this thread makes me feel old, the matrix and heat are now classic movies?! Watch north by northwest!! &&I hope this picks up steam, I watch and review old movies almost every night on [my Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/txdrmst/) and I'd be so down to post them on your sub as well!&&Great idea and good luck. It worked out well for gamers in a similar situation over at r/patientgamers&&No one ever talks about True Romance. I still consider it in the top 5 for movies I love. 
So many stars, so many great characters. Storyline is interesting because the lead character is entranced with comic books and Elvis, and gets his motivation from them, making his actions and the story a bit more fascinating. Tarantino wrote the script, I believe. 
&&recently die hard was on tnt i was like on the edges of my seet all the movie&&I saw this post last night before I went to bed and thought: ""What an interesting idea, I'll make sure to subscribe when I wake up."" 

I wake up, check Reddit and find out it's been up voted 12k times!?! I wasn't expecting that. 

This is a great idea for a sub and I've subscribed but looking at the front page it's already filled with films that /r/movies talks about all the time. 

Hopefully when the circlejerk dies down we can get some discussion going about some other great movies. In the meantime I guess I'll have to suffer through yet another thread about Memento! &&I'm home. Thank you.&&Damn, 11 hours later and 23K subs.

I like it!&&Now how many times will people discover 'Moon'?&&I was like, ahhh sweet, let's talk about the classics like Treasure of the Sierra Madre and It Happened One Night and whatnot...

First post I see, ""I just watched Superbad.""

Guess I mis-imagined this subreddit.  &&Anyone remember ""The Artist""?  No?  It won best picture a couple years back.  It sucks.  &&I first read the sub name as ""I watched a Donald movie"" and assumed it would be about movies with Donald Trump in them&&i think i would fit well in there.&&This is an awesome idea! My gf and I have been watching a lot of critically acclaimed movies from years back that we have never seen and I would love to contribute. &&Yessssds I'm literally doing this now!!!!!! I just watched the shining for the first time!!&&Instantly subscribed to your subreddit. I'm 18 years old and I obviously wouldn't have the chance to watch many of the ""classic"" movies when they originally came out, so whenever I would watch them I would only be able to read archived discussion threads. Now I can have an actual conversation about those movie. Awesome idea, OP!&&Will come there when I start watching the fucking game of thrones in 2022&&I immediately felt old going to that sub.  &&Thank God. Now we don't have people posting about Gladiator like no one's ever seen it before here&&I'll join this sub in a few months when no one is posting in there &&All I know is, a lot of the movies you all are talking about came out in the 70s or later, and it's making me feel ancient! Here I was thinking we'd be talking about old black-and-white films, and people are talking about The Godfather and Jaws. 

Let me go yell at that cloud now...&&Speaking of ""old movies"" (omg past 10 years is old?!)

Don't want your kids to do hard drugs? Watch Traffic with them when they are teenagers. 

Or New Jack City. Both excellent but disturbing. &&lmao. the highest voted post in that sub is ""i watched the prestige"". what an underrated gem! a brand new subreddit and it's already an absolute joke. &&I watched Top Gun for the first time ever the other day. 

I actually loved it, but Tom Cruise tonguing that woman to 'take my breath away' was so off putting. I thought he was literally gonna suffocate her. &&Love this idea! I always want to talk about an older movie I just got around to watching but feel irrelevant. 

Subscribed! 🤘&&Oh awesome idea! Subbed!&&Ghost Dog:  The Way of the Samurai 

It's great in all the right places and made me want to have a code to live by...something to perfect even tho perfection is impossible.  We're all flawed.  If a samurai didn't live by this code they had one choice, seppuku.&&Thank you! This is the perfect sub for me because I love to watch movies but my family can really only handle comedies so I miss out on many movies I want to watch until they show up on Netflix, On Demand, or Redbox or something. Sometimes I have no choice but to watch the movie on an airplane flight. So this sub is so useful for me!!!

Also I watched Room (the Oscar winning drama, not the horror movie) last week and now I have a place to talk about it!!! I can finally share my tears!!!&&Brilliant. I might actually watch Heat now!&&It's like /r/patientgamers meets /r/movies&&Anyone else read I watch Donald movie in the title?&&Could this also include, say, movies that everyone says don't watch, but you do anyway?  Like Death Note?&&I need one of these for tv shows so I can discuss Lost.&&I made one a while ago called r/JustSaw.  Same concept&&Ah, like r/patientgamers for movies, love it.&&Cool sub! Would there be any interest in watching a movie together? You could do a live reddit post and have everyone start
the movie at the same time and then we can talk shit about it. &&For those that enjoy horror, /r/HorrorReviewed has reviews plus discussion for tons of horror movies, both old (early 1900’s) to current. We appreciate movies from all eras.

One question: where do I find the ""what old but must-see movie I totally missed should I watch?"" thread? I always wanted to have something like this. I'm such a movie noob, I didn't even watch LOTR, Matrix, Jurassic Park and similar until two years ago. I'm still planning to watch Guardians of the Galaxy... I'll do it eventually, I'm sure of it. My main problem: I just don't know what I should watch if there's a day/evening where I think ""yeah I could watch a movie"".&&Great idea mate. Subbed!!&&Nice one. Been having an old movie night with my grandson once a fortnight. I think you can appreciate new movies more when you have seen the classics of each genre. You dont get kingsmen without james bond for example, or valarian without 5th element. Plus he's really getting to understand character driven versus special effects. I'm taking a big step to see if he likes 84 charing cross road. He loves books, it might be a success. 1987, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft and Judy Dench for what it's worth. &&Needs a rule about movie age. Movies from this century are not 'old movies'&&Heh, someone should make one for music too! Like old Eminem music that no one talks about anymore... ;-;&&I created a Google Doc for all of the times I've said ""I haven't seen it, I'll put it on my list"" and never have. So now when I watch a movie and share it via social media I include the URL so people can suggest movies to me.

Well done.&&I know you probably won't see it, because this thread blew up but thank you so much about this. I have a list of about 2,500 films to watch and most of them are old.

One of those moments that makes you feel old. nice idea!&&subbed. 

Thank  you.&&i usually search /r/movies for the title of what I watched, and the words discussion if the title alone isn't enough but this sounds cool&&17 hours old, and 33,000 subs. That's insane.&&This is actually genius &&DAE Memento??&&You guys kill me. I got really excited and then realized you were talking about films from my teens and twenties. You need to go back and watch the classic b&w films. Anything with Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Gene Kelly. Those are the great old movies&&Mallrats, I believe, is a must see.&&The sub is already shit lol. 

In a few weeks or even days time, every thread will be dead or just repeating the same shit. 

The front page of the sub has already listed most of the greatest movies of all time. Definitely needs to be limited to mod only posts or polls for what movie to talk about next. &&Have you ever seen Krull? Yea you don't need to see Krull.
&&I just watched inception followed by shutter island for the first time. My brain is fucked right now. HELP&&Why not just make those posts on here instead ?&&""Old movie"".... What a joke of a sub.

""No, loser.""&&What's special about this sub? It's just being divisive by calling most of good movies old. If it's good, it's good no matter when it came out. You just have to have some imagination to put it into context and enjoy it. Then might as well go and discuss it on any  relevant sub without excusing yourself for watching old movies.

It was ridiculous that those forums are gone. The IMDB founder met his wife in the forums and he still closed them.

I've had a Letterboxd account for a couple years now but never used it. Yesterday I actually started slowly going through every year to catalog every film I've seen.

[Here](https://letterboxd.com/emeraldelbow/) is my account. I actually followed you on there. I'm not sure if there is a friends feature as it has been a few years. I'll be looking through your ratings to see if you've rated anything highly I haven't seen to add to the watch list.

&&How about Pulp Fiction or Office Space?  I have not watched any of the Rocky, godfather, or jaws movies and really do not care to see them, but I routinely lend out pulp fiction and office space as I consider it a travesty if you haven't seen them.&&You don't watch movies do you?

If you're desperate for closure give 3 a go but it's not amazing. I've watched them all so many times that it's kind of ridiculous. The first time I watched them I wasn't really invested. Kind of just watched so that I'd watched them, if that makes sense. Then I watched them again and understood so much more. 

Apocalypse Now is a brilliant film, but it is a downer, so don't watch it if you're planning on being productive afterwards. Late at night, with lots of quiet, and be prepared for some drawn out cinematography against a massive soundtrack. If you drink, a couple of beers/bourbons wouldn't go astray.

One was some actor threatening to sue because someone who had known them in the past was using the boards to spill the dirt on him and then there was also a stalker situation.

the issue is going through and censoring message boards is a full-time job, and if IMBD was getting inundated with threats from very rich and powerful people, it's just easier to take it all away then have to dedicate probably an entire team to monitoring discussion. Then there's the slippery slope problem - once they agree to censor discussion about ONE film or ONE actor, then suddenly it needs to apply to all, etc.

I'm not saying that I agree - the boards were a lot of fun - but as someone who's worked in community management before I do get the logic behind it. &&Yeah odd to get mad about a likely innocent factoid &&Home Alone 2 on repeat?&&Hey, yours is a pretty great 30 Rock reference!&&But this would be outdated in a couple centuries.

If there was a digital antenna that big you'd have no problem getting every channel clearly, and clearer than the cheapest cable/satellite package (which includes Standard Definition channels). Most stations now broadcast OTA channels in HD.

Seriously: do you guys ever get tired of this? &&[deleted]&&I sniff rocks. No one will see this&&Hollywood's treatment of the suburbs is weird to me. There's just something so ironic about the film industry's repeated attempts to typecast the suburbs with this cynical portrayal of *affluent upper middle-class people living in a cliquish, elitist little bubble and obsessed with perfection,* especially when said portrayal is coming from a bunch of *affluent gazillionaire actors living in a cliquish, elitist little bubble and obsessed with perfection.*

Sorry we can't all own multi-million dollar homes in the English countryside or on Lake Como or the Hollywood Hills, Clooney... but for a lot of people (including the people who watch your shitty films), the suburbs is the best we can do. Maybe do us a favor and smell your own shit before you call us out on ours?&&I guess I'm not interested as most people here..

I know so very little about the movie, but they made this poster great. It's enough to get me wanting to know more and I'm already interested in watching the movie. Hopefully, the trailers are just as well done and don't spoil anything. 
&&Have you, uh, seen the movie yet?&&Although a slapstick comedy about a unicorn that goes into witness relocation in suburbia isn't a bad idea either. The unicorn has to wear a series of hats and ridiculous wigs to pass as a horse. His cover is blown when he intervenes upon seeing the youngest child in his adopted family being bullied. The bully's father just happens to be a unicorn horn poacher. The mom faints when she walks in on the unicorn teaching the children karate. The dad's oddly oblivious to the whole situation. Sinbad plays the unicorn's witness relocation case worker... and he's days away from retirement. 

It really is fun for the whole family. 

SUBURBICORN&&I thought it was sub-unicorn until I read your comment.&&I always read it as 'Sub Rubicon' as in crossing *under* the Rubicon&&Well, now I want to see Sub Unicorn. F this other movie. &&You mean r/unicorn?&&[""Sub Unicorn""](http://i.imgur.com/eYEwYwG.jpg)&&I read it as Surbiton - which is in London.&&Might just be a design choice. It looks better above the names, rather than having it below (where it would be in the centre of the sign). &&> Even Kubrick put his name below Cruise and Kidman.

That's an exception. Most of Kubrick's films had posters with his name before the stars, [if their names were even on the posters](https://originalvintagemovieposters.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-original-vintage-stanley-kubrick-science-fiction-movie-poster/).&&Most ""heavyweight"" directors have their names at the top of a poster.

Check out posters for Hateful Eight, Interstellar, Mulholland Drive, etc.

Some films (again, Interstellar) will have some posters with the stars' names at the top and other posters with the director's name at the top.&&Would be better if there were names of 4 actors instead of 3, to balance out the difference in populations.&&Where is the humor?

Just to add to this and I mean this in the nicest way, those cars are from the 50's. The one on the left is the iconic 1955 Chevy Bel-Air. The one far off to the right looks like a later 50's Chevy, hard to say. Your comment made me realize there were older cars in the background. Was a car guy in a past life and couldn't help but comment, as the 50's versus the 60's were quite different times :)&&Yeah, I feel like the title was a play on words and the closest I could think was The Rubicon, but it'll be interesting to see where this goes.

Let's shit out 100,000 nearly identical superhero movies, because that's not overdone! (Spider-Man Homecoming, Wonder Woman, Justice League, Guardians of the Galaxy, Logan, Thor: Ragnarok.)

Wait, no.  How about we resurrect a beloved science fiction franchise from years past?  (War for the Planet of the Apes, Alien: Covenant, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, The Mummy (I guess,) Blade Runner 2049, xXx: Return of Xander Cage (depending on how old you are,) Homg: Skull Island (another maybe.)

Or maybe we could make a WWII movie! (Dunkirk in 2017, but you know there are a billion WWII movies.)

What if, instead, we try to cash in on nostalgia? (Transformers: The Last Knight, Beauty and the Beast, The Lego Batman Movie, Baywatch.)

Or maybe we should try (and fail) to make a good movie out of some Steven King book?

Maybe we could take a young comic and team them up with an old comic and do a parent/child thing?

What if we took any movie, and made every aspect of it pander to black people?

Or a spy movie?

Or what about a movie where a pretty young women gets kidnapped?

Or, you know, we could half ass some ancient story - idk, King Arthur or Robin Hood or something.  Just toss in some sexy young actors and modern music, and call it a day.

What about a movie where a ragtag group of misfits gets together to pull off a heist that that should be well beyond their abilities?

I mean, have I covered 2017 enough?  It's one thing to bitch about Hollywood recycling concepts.  But I think it's pretty silly to point out one recycled concept in an ocean of them.&&Is that Julianne's twin brother?&&> Julianne Moore is a babe still in my books.

That's what's great about women.  You keep getting older, they keep getting older at the exact same rate.&&I saw this. &&I'm absolutely seeing it opening day.&&... But this movie is set in the 50s/60s, judging,by the trailer and the cars shown in this poster, and that's *exactly* what suburban life was like back then.&&Agree&&HE DOESN'T EVEN ACT IN IT!&&Reddit has gone cuckoo with this nazi shit.  Literal nazis literally everywhere.

Let's take a minute and try to think if there's a country other than Germany in the first half of the 20th century that holds eagles dear and uses them frequently in its symbology.  Bonus that country happens to be the country that is the setting for this movie.  I'll give you a hint:  *The United States.*  

&&I'm guessing it's a reference to panopticon, originally a style of prison or medical facility designed to be supervised by one watchman, where the inmates can never tell whether they are under observation. Nowadays in pop culture, it refers more to the pervasive and intrusive surveillance of every aspect of one's life. &&The Roman eagle at the top makes me think they are referencing The Rubicon. When Caesar crossed The Rubicon it marked his ""invasion"" of Italy and coined the term ""crossing The Rubicon;"" to mean that there is no going back from here. &&Look up a famous european border river of the Roman Empire...also a crappy upgrade of a Heep Mangler.&&I now want this movie to be all about a grizzled investigator who moves into town, only to realize it's a crazy murder cult.

Sorry mate. Seems like you missed the blood splatter too.&&[deleted]&&> Sounds like a very original idea that has definitely not been done to death

I'm hopeful for this one because the movie poster has the population of the town, but it's crossed out and a slightly lower number is written in it's place, possibly in blood, and I've never seen that in a movie poster before.

Which I am very selective about.  I'm peaky piquey picky.&&I was thinking more like porno with a super hot submissive girl (otherwise known as a sub unicorn) but I like your idea better&&I was thinking of a unicorn that has under water adventures in a submarine. &&I agree, the poster has a lot of design thought so they definitely did it purposely.

It could easily show in place of coming soon, or under the microscript. But I think it's more to do with Clooney's ego of really being into directing.

I think this may be the payoff, movie looks great.&&Maybe they kill the director&&There's definitely a dark humour vibe about it. Especially in the crossed out population figure. &&It's very contrasting: storm/sunny weather. Fun-free font/dark message&&Haha thanks. Good call. You know, the other thought I had was that those houses look newer in design than the cars.&&It's hard to tell with the blue car on the right, but it does look like a later 50's with it being longer, lower and looks like some tail fins, about 1960. And the greyish blur behind that car also seems to be low and long. With it being suburb and those cars having shorter lives than modern cars, I'd guess 1959-61 setting? 

Source: nothing solid&&His full head of hair went grey kinda young.  If Richard Gere is any indication, women *hate* that.&&Implying that's a real suburb and not the WB/Columbia Ranch backlot&&He seems to follow the Windows rule where every other thing he does is okay (Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads, Ides of March, Monuments Men), bodes well for Suburbicon.&&What? Where are people getting this idea. The only truly not good movie he's made is Monuments Men, and it wasn't even that bad. Leatherheads is uneven but the idea is unique and the first half is screwball brilliance. Good Night and Good Luck is brilliant as is ides of March.
Edit: and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is amazing!!&&huh.&&probably...&&Or they're afraid if they don't make the poster as literal as possible, audiences won't know what to think about it so they won't see it.&&Idk what your point is supposed to be. &&[deleted]&&Actually that was the only thing that *did* occur to me but I can't make any sense of it.

""Peaked"" is not spelled as ""piqued"". They're entirely different words with different meanings.

""Pique"" means stimulate, rouse or awaken. Therefore, having your interest piqued means that you have just become interested in something for the first time.

""Peak"" means to reach a peak, either literally or figuratively. Having your interest peaked is the figurative use, and it means that you have reached the maximum possible interest level in something.&&/\'d&&""Piqued"" is literally ""stung"" in French. Your interest is stung.

  ""Peaked"" is all about peaking.&&Your spelling paekiqued!&&That really peeked my interest when I peaked at someone whose powers had not yet piqued.&&Yeah but it is considered a good movie - it has 85% on rotten tomatoes.

My husband loves it because it helps maintain property values, but I hate getting letters that I haven't pulled my garbage cans in time (and made sure they are properly concealed behind an 6 foot fence that is painted the approved shade of brown.) And that time that we got a letter complaining that the paint was peeling on our chimney. We don't have a chimney. Sigh. 

There is a clubhouse included in our HOA dues and the board spent thousands of dollars to get members to vote to expand the clubhouse. But rather than using reserves to help pay for it, the board wanted to double our monthly dues because they are ""really low for this area."" Well, yeah another local HOA has higher dues. They also include lawn service and have a club twice the size of our and 1/4 of the residents. The vote to expand did not pass. And now the board refuses to even do basic things like replace antiquated gym equipment because, hey, they were going to do that in the expansion and we didn't vote for that. SMH&&HOA's are very common, unfortunately. They're mostly 80 year olds with nothing to do, using it to make their neighbors change what they plant in their yards and such, but never dealing with serious maintenance problems in a fiscally responsible way. Oh, and those people are generally immune from action by the association they run. Basically, obnoxious and seldom useful, and they extract money from you like another property tax. Also, you have to make sure those people like you, because they can issue fines and ""special assessments"" (unplanned large bills).  
  
Also, they can hurt resale value. Nobody wants to spend 30% more, on top of their mortgage, for mandatory services selected by the idiot up the street.&&Yes.  It can actually be beneficial if you live in a neighborhood like mine where we have a community pool and playground, walking trails, and common areas.  Someone has to pay for all the upkeep and maintenance.  

I've lived in 3 different neighborhoods with associations, and they can all be very different in terms of strictness and requirements.  In one there was actually an embezzlement scandal.  To avoid that often they will hire outside companies to run the HOAs.  They collect the money, hire the people to mow grass/upkeep the pool, etc.  Usually there is an elected ""board"" of neighbors that meets every few months to discuss concerns.

And yes, making sure your house is kept up to standards is part of the process.  However I have found in many situations when push comes to shove, the HOA can threaten, but it's expensive to take legal action so most HOAs don't have a lot of power.  I have heard of cases where HOA's were able to force people out of their homes, but I've never seen it happen here in NC.&&Yes. I am president of ours. And my prime goal is to make sure we don't become ""that"" HOA. &&Yes, in more affluent areas. &&Yeah out HOA is just for keeping funds that go towards maintenance of common areas like the entrance to our neighborhood. We will have meeting to discuss stuff like block parties, parking in the street, who is hosting the monthly orgy, do we need speed bumps. Just average boring neighborhood stuff.&&My parents live in one. There is a HOA bully who harasses whoever the board members are until they quit. He's passive aggressive and vicious.

It's an extension of dumb high school bullshit.&&can't you just say no to hoa people. or do you have to join to live where you live.&&My spouse and I were completely against HOA when house shopping. It's like, you get a job to move out from under your parent's rules to live in an apartment, save up for a house, then end up living under your new mom and dad's rules in the HOA without the free food. You pay them to fine you and tell you what to do and you don't have domain over your own land, so you're practically renting again. &&sounds like someone is embezzling.

Really just a glowing review you've given. I'm dying to see it now. &&It's the same issue that has plagued pop culture since it became a major thing with the advent of TV, most of the one's who create and the one's who roll the money tend to be older than the average consumer, and thus the main agenda's/messages of the mainstream are likely to be a bit behind the current state of the younger consumer, who form counterculture's (note: a counterculture in this context doesn't just refer to the typical modern form) rejecting it, only for a cycle of rejection to form as the generation that create's the media moves on, the counterculture becomes the mainstream and new countercultures form.&&Orrr....

It doesn't have to be a shadowy cabal of Hollywood executives trying to erode the fabric of society. It could just be storytellers tapping into the escapist fantasies of the 90% of Americans who are pretty content with living a Joe Schmo, Leave It To Beaver lifestyle, but occasionally want to get away from it for about 2 hours. &&Can you give an example of the films you are describing? I can think of a few (Dazed and Confused comes to mind but that's over 20 years old) but not enough to say that is some ubiquitous message that is permeating Hollywood films. &&Idk, it felt like total Oscar bait to me.

If you live in a townhome or condo, you usually have to though.&&Most are fine really. It's just that bad ones are unbearable. It's like milk. It's either fine or it's horrible, there's no in-between&&Well in some areas your choice is often: HOA, shitty neighborhood, or live out in the country... we got lucky to move into one of a handful of good neighborhoods in our area that doesn't have an HOA, and it took us almost two years to find a house. Previously we rented in an HOA and it was a constant pain in the ass for our landlord.&&Honestly, I used to feel that way before I became a homeowner. Now I own a house in a town with some not so responsible neighbors, and I can see the appeal of having someone enforce some basic rules. When you are constantly faced with people who think lawn mowing is a once-a-year chore, don't put their garbage in sealed cans (so the raccoons dig into it and spread it all over the street), don't bother to shovel when it snows, etc., it gets old after a while. HOAs can be overly picky, but it's not like anyone is being taken by surprise--you know when you buy a house if it is subject to an HOA and can take that into account in your decision making. &&You have to join. And if you don't pay your dues, or if you get too many fines, they can put a lien on your house. &&Yeah, I really detest the idea. If they can tell me what to do, and I can't decline, they have a partial ownership interest in the property.

And I'm not interested in co-owning property with a crapshoot council of petty bullshit.&&Basically any neighborhood built in the past few decades is part of one. The idea is that since your house value is affected by your neighbors taking care of their own, and since almost everyone's biggest investment in life is their home, it's important to keep them valuable so when you retire and your kids are gone, you can turn the house into money, buy a cheaper place, and have extra for retirement. If your neighborhood has gone to shit (ugly lawns, etc) then your home will be worth less and your retirement is fffuuuucked.

Also hoa administers upkeep on common areas like neighborhood pool, playground, signage, etc.&&And send you angry letters asking for money.&&It's just the one swan actually.&&Its just the one swan, actually.&&Kind&&Not the hair.

Can't you move there and just be like, ""no thanks""?&&Yeah I've lived in 3 different HOAs now. One was a terrible experience but the other two including the one I'm in now have been totally fine.

But the one terrible HOA I was in completely ruined my experience living in an otherwise great location. &&> Well in some areas your choice is often: HOA, shitty neighborhood, or live out in the country

This. I live in the ""shitty neighborhood"" because we couldn't afford an HOA neighborhood and don't really want to deal with well water, satellite TV, and other issues of being more rural. I would love an HOA to tell some of my neighbors to mow their lawn and put their trash in a can instead of all over their front yard.&&That's retarded and should be illegal &&thanks for the info. wow. sounds like mini prison.&&That's all true, but it also seems like HOA attract that washed up people who haven't been relevant since they were in high school or college, so they create arbitrary rules and yell at people who don't follow them to stroke their own ego.&&Someone is on the board.

""NO PLANET HAS BEEN MISTAKEN MORE FOR A UFO THAN THE PLANET VENUS.""&&Mine started doing some of these things the last couple years I lived there. Early on dues were fairly reasonable and they took care of all of the exterior maintenance and lawn mowing and the snow removal. 

But toward the end they started making all kinds of changes willy-nilly. They never sent an agenda for what was up for vote at the meetings so unless you showed up to every single one you never knew what bullshit they might pull next. And there was an obsessiveness about parking despite the fact that the visitor spots were always taken by the same damn cars.&&Exactly. I've heard horror stories of HOAs but they can be really effective enforcing what should be common-sense etiquette. Bring your trash off the curb, mow your lawn (and not just the petty shit- go to a non HOA neighborhood lawns with like 2-3 feet of grass), don't park cars in your lawn, no bright pink homes, etc.&&You agree to it when you buy/move in. Just like different cities will have different laws.

And its from the same guy who wrote/directed Tucker and Dale vs Evil. I'm in. &&Adam Scott is the kinda actor who regardless what project he's in, he's still so damn enjoyable.

Edit: and Turk from Scrubs!! I'm excited for this.&&I fucking love how Netflix just gives you shit. No ""oh this movie is coming out in 2 years."" No ""watch this series one episode at a time.""

I just learned about this movie, got pumped about it, and I can watch it in my damn living room next week. 

Thanks Netflix.

For Hollywood, this seems to mean that the trailer comes out 4-6 months before the movie, but it does seem like the that gap is smaller than when I was younger. 

This could be just a change in my own perception of time as I get older, and not actually what Hollywood is doing, but Ive noticed it all the same.&&Good guy Netflix. That's awesome!&&I was thinking about this - why not start advertising when it comes out? I'm probably going to forget about this in a week but I would watch it immediately if I could right now! I feel movie-spoiled saying this but come on, what is Netflix doing with this movie for the next week, just hanging on to it?&&After 5 years of redditing, you'd think you wouldn't need to make an edit like that.&&Yeah I always complain about how far in advance movies are announced and a trailer comes out for them. It just puts me off movies a bit now because most of the time seems to be spent waiting which isn't fun. Releasing a little bit of extra footage every few months for 1-2 years for an upcoming Avengers movies or something just puts me off it completely.

When 10 Cloverfield Lane got it's first trailer, which is when I first heard about it, it's release date was just 2 months away! it was awesome. I was definitely still hyped for it when it came out and like you said you can see the trailers and be like that looks great! I can see it soon.

Same goes with games now too. They're getting worse and worse. First teaser trailers come out like 18 months in advance for big games and the same thing happens, it puts me off it by the time it comes out. Imagine if the next The Last of Us game or something gets announced with a trailer and says release is in 3 months, it would be huge.&&Whose dick do I have to suck for a lifetime of free netflix?&&Ummm...

Hey @Netflix Suits, I love Netflix too.

This is not a positive, though, for a currently airing showing. They do this all the time with their Anime. For instance, *Little Witch Academia* was released as 2 separate seasons months apart, but it actually aired as a continuous 25 episode season. Netflix didn't even release ""season 1"" (the first 13 episodes) until after all 25 episodes had aired. Netflix Japan released them as they aired. &&On the other hand it never has the movies you're searching for, in Europe at least. &&Agreed on liking a short time span between trailer and product.

But I wish their shows released weekly. I hate having to binge shows the weekend they come out just so I can meaningfully participate in online discussion. I like the social aspect of weekly episodes. You can get together with friends for a viewing party. Everyone at work can theorize about what next week will bring.&&Am I out of the loop? I feel like Netflix never does this. I see a movie coming from them I want to see and the release date is always just 2017 or 2018.&&Wut? Pretty damn sure they had a teaser trailer for that movie with the Workaholics guys even though the movie isn't coming up until a whole year later.&&Oh look Evangeline Lilly...

Edit: Forgot Death Note. That's been advertised for a while now. Oh and remember those Adam Sandler movies?

I was actually incredibly annoyed when the teaser came out and recently the full trailer and saw it wasn't out until December. Because I'm so used to the marketing for Netflix stuff not hitting until right before release date. Hell I was even annoyed at having to wait for October to see Stranger Things 2 when the superbowl trailer hit (how cool is it that a Netflix show is big enough to be one of the most hyped trailers at the Superbowl?).&&And Punisher. Been waiting on that for what seems like forever. &&Feelin' like a frontman after my Rockstar energy boost!&&Hollywood needs to build up buzz to get people into the opening weekend, because that's when the majority of tickets are sold. I can only think of a couple exceptions this year to that (Wonder Woman and Get Out). Broadcast and cable TV also really need to get people to watch the premieres of their programming because they run on an advertising model: the higher the ratings, the more than they charge advertisers. Netflix only needs to keep people subscribed for as long as possible. They don't care if you watch the day a movie/series comes out. They just care that people are watching their content and staying subscribed (or adding new subscribers with diverse content).&&GGN is real. I'm still slightly in shock due to the extreme realness.&&Chances are decent that if you watched anything remotely similar, Netflix will let you know when it is available. I forget about stuff after I see the trailer and then it pops up in the app that I might like it. &&What? 99% of movies would have a trailer six months out. If you forget this film in a week, there's literally no amount of advertising that will help you.&&Likely word of mouth buzz. It gets shared here on reddit, gets shared on FB etc. If it was just ""out"" , people would just watch it and move on.

I watch probably like 20 things a week on netflix. I don't mention them at all anywhere. I did however share the Defenders trailer when it came out last month.&&To build hype. It's easier to do before people get their hands on something, unless that thing is truly special. &&You can add it to your list now. &&I don't understand, you're saying it's bad to advertise a movie a week in advance because you can't remember something for that long?

Marketing works on hype, word of mouth, that kind of thing. I already showed this to some friends and suggested we should watch it together. I shared it to facebook. Articles have been written about it. That shit gets into search algorithms, helps people make plans, etc.&&That's what Bethesda did with fallout 4&&Yep. At the end of the day, a movie is ~2 hours of entertainment. 

I get actually offended when companies show me a trailer for ""Christmas 2019"" or whatever, like I'm supposed to give a shit for 2 years about a 2 hour event.&&mine?&&Some non-Netflix shows have a weekly release in some countries. It's a tie up thing between networks and Netflix. Example iZombie is a CW show and I get a weekly release in the UAE.&&Yes, for anime it is really bad. It's either you wait three months dodging spoilers, fanart and so on or pirate the show and be able to participate in discussions with the fanbase. In the end, it hurts the ratings.&&It's enjoyable to be able to watch and discuss a show as it happens. Not to mention how it stretches the time out that you're invested and makes it feel more involved and rewarding. Watching every episode in a day or so just ends up feeling a little hollow.

There's a reason why people form rewatch threads just so they can experience the feeling of watching a show episodically with others.&&Ugh, severely underrated Hollywood dream girl.

If not for the hype then we'd probably see a more normal distribution.

If anything, I'd argue the limited theater space is the main driver for the hype. Since theaters can only hold so many movies at a time, you need to get as many sales as you can as fast as you can. You can't just wait for steady ticket sales because you might be off the theaters rotating roster of movies before your sales have dropped off enough.&&They do suggest so much stuff that I have zero interest in, I'm afraid it has become white noise to me.

I forget about stuff after I see the trailer and then it pops up in the app that I might like it.

Netflix just doesn't understand me. I see stuff that I love (like Icarus) and I just found it by accident on a scene release site the day it was released and saw it was a Netflix Original. Also weird is most of the time new stuff doesn't show in the alert bell, even though it's been released.&&You can add shows and movies (originals) to your List before they're released, and they will show up as soon as they are.

Here's a screenshot showing the Windows 10 results in the black box&&Yeah, this. I don't like to have details dripped to me over the course of 2 years. I flipped my shit when they said it was 6 months out.&&I mean she starred in Lost and had a prominent role in the Hobbit trilogy. I think these projects were simply so huge that they'll continue to overshadow any other movie or show that she's in for the foreseeable future, which is why it's so hard to remember what else she's been in.   &&Yep, but can't blame her. She started a family, wrote a children's book, does a lot of charity work. I bet she's able to choose her projects more carefully and is enjoying the ride instead of trying to be in everything. &&Might be because the first big thing she was known for they made it a romantic love triangle story line, which I think she tried to avoid after Lost.  She might just be avoiding most things coming her way because it's different variations of that.    &&People forget she was YOUNG when she was in Lost, as in she was like 22 years old when it began shooting. Then it ended when she was around 28-29 and she had a family, while having some small roles during Lost like in Hurt Locker. 

But now that she has most likely felt that she has had enough stay at home mom time (twice), and the fact she's still pretty young for someone who starred in a 2004 TV show (37, but looks 30), plenty of studios are hiring her. 

Her ""return"" to acting and working consistently began with The Hobbit trilogy (Real Steel was filmed a while before she got pregnant; she got pregnant after the Hobbit was filmed then spent some time away), and then she got a job as Wasp for the Ant-Man film, and then got pregnant again in 2015, but now she's back and she's definitely going to be an A-list film actress from here on out in terms of blockbuster films for the next 3-4 years until she's early 40s. 

She went from A-list TV star to stay at home mom to A-list movie star. Not many women can choose that -- but she's lucky she began young and is still relatively young and looks even younger than her age. 

She's a good actress who got unfair shit from crazy Lost fans even though she didn't write her character. 

TLDR -- she never really left from acting, just breaks, as she just had kids 4 years apart, meaning she didn't work for a 2-year span twice. But she's still crazy young for someone who starred in a show 13 years ago and doesn't look her age, and is getting a ton of blockbuster roles. &&Okay, I was gonna say that it's a pretty run-of-the-mill line for a comedy, but that makes more way more sense.&&It's okay, u/LegendarySpark

He did Krampus as well.&&> But it seems to be a comedy which is a bit weird for this sort of plot

To me it looks to be less about the actual plot and more about the fact that they're poking fun at horror movie tropes. It's like Scary Movie, but with less slapstick spoof and more intelligent satire. There are scenes that are obviously making fun of the kids in movies like Poltergeist, The Shining, and The Omen, but it's not as heavy handed as past horror movie spoof films. &&It seems to be a great spoof on the many demon child movies of the past. I will put it in queue, for sure! &&If you've seen Tucker and Dale vs Evil, the plot isn't that weird for this director.&&I think they were pointing out that the trailer didn't tell you the whole story, which is a good thing.

Reference five!&&C+&&We seriously replaced Zach Braff with a different nerdy white guy with great hair. I approve. &&I really liked that movie 'Spectral'. Good story and really good graphics. That one's my favorite so far in the 'Netflix original' movie bunch.. 
&&Thing is, often movies like this are made with the GOAL of being bought by WB, Fox, Paramount, Universal, etc...

Usually when they're picked up by Netflix, it means that the studios saw the film or just a sizzle real and said ""no, thanks"" (as in ""no, thanks, this film looks awful and we don't want to pay for it AND pay for marketing because that's just burning money on fire""); there's no way Will Smith would ever knowingly sign up for a film he believed would be ""straight to Netflix,"" but that's basically where the movie went because not even Sony's Indie division wanted it. In other words, Will Smith's star is fading as 15 years ago there's zero chance a Will Smith film wouldn't already be financed by a distributor that's partnered with the production company to make a film (for example, JJ Abrams Bad Robot films are often paired with Paramount, like Mission Impossible films -- there's already a partnership between Bad Robot and Paramount and Bad Robot doesn't have to worry about selling the film because Paramount already partnered with them. It's why you often hear about a movie script's rights held by a production company that has already signed with a director and star attached -- like Scorsese and Leo -- and many distributors FIGHTING for the rights to distribute it. This  and Will Smith's urban fantasy film are not this case. Because they're likely terrible, like War Machine). 

The problem with that film is that it would likely take another $25-40 million to market on top of the acquisition fee, and the studio would split the revenue with the production company. 

If it's on Netflix, it must be pretty mediocre to bad, because the studio that made it can't even get theater money or rental money from it. ""Straight to Netflix"" is just above ""Straight to DVD and VOD,"" as the studio likely takes a bigger ""set price"" from Netflix -- and won't recoup all of its costs -- because selling it for VOD would be a bigger gamble to them. 

In other words, it's like making a movie for $10 million, hoping to sell it to a distributor like Warner so that theaters can play it and you can get a cut of maybe a $50 million gross. 

But no studios wanted it. Now you have to shop it to Netflix and VOD, and as a studio you're thinking ""should we just take the $5 million Netflix is offering and call it a loss?"" or ""should we sell to VOD for $1 million and hope enough rentals make us back the $10 million?""

Many choose the Netflix route because it's safer, and Netflix markets better even though it doesn't really do much for the studio -- it just means more subscribers will watch it, though some studios may have an agreement that if the movie is watched X amount of times, then they get a ""bonus.""

That was a pleasant surprise. &&Cabin in the Woods and Dale/Tucker are really alone in the Horror Satire genre.&&I haven't but I think I want to now.&&Lemme preface this by saying I'm totally willing to buy your argument, but could you explain this a little more? (No worries about spoilers, I've watched all of Lost at least twice)&&She's nice to look at though&&Hm, motivation to go back to it I guess

Watched it earlier this week while asleep&&I liked ARQ. &&What? Spectral was firmly ""ok"". It completely fell apart in the end though. Like they had two completely separate movies that got stitched together.&&Its a mouthful, but I Don't Feel At Home In This World Anymore is my personal favorite. Elijah Wood is hilarious in it.&&That movie was already in the can and was set for   a theatrical release from Universal when they decided to pull it from their roster, then Netflix came around and snatched up the distribution rights and plunked it on their service.

Really great, high-end B flick with a unique take on the genre (can't really describe too much without giving it away).&&I saw the trailer and the production surprised me. I was glad it was on Netflix but I am sure it would have bombed at the box office.&&Have you seen punch drunk love? He still plays himself (angry man child, arrested development) but it's friggin amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman is there too! &&[deleted]&&Samuel Jackson&&This isn't very accurate. Watch six degrees of separation, ali and wild wild west and tell me will smith just plays himself.

With Tom Cruise it's even more pronounced. You have Eyes Wide Shut, Tropic Thunder, Magnolia, The Last Samurai let's say.&&I feel there's always a new crop. Channing Tatum. Jennifer Lawrence. There's a few more. &&To be fair I would probably defend most if not all of the *casting* in that, its problems are elsewhere.  In fact, that's mostly true for DC full stop: I don't think i've had a problem with actors at all, it's all been writing or tone (With SS due to editing, I think.) but never them.

It's why I get a bit sad when I see Batfleck is wavering on commitment, he's a great batman.  Just let down by other parts of the production.  &&Will Smith made it way worse imo. Since he's such a huge, expensive actor, he had to have the most screen time, putting in that sympathetic dad subplot when the character is usually a greedy selfish asshole, making his face always shown and barely wearing the mask, and his character overpowered Rick Flag's, who should've been the main character.&&I had it because I like The Office. Completely ignore the fact that I watched The Clone Wars (movie) and am watching Clone Wars the series... &&Bourdain shows are damn fine tho. &&Just wish you could blacklist (sub)categories. I enjoy comedy shows/movies occasionally but I don't like stand-up that much. Yes, I could go to the subcategories, but I'd rather have one list than having to go to different ones. I'm lazy and just want a convenient list. (There's probably an extension that will do that, but that doesn't help when watching through the Android app)&&I fucking hate the new system. So much harder yo sort wheat from chaff, so I just watch less stuff&&She got ripped for the Ant Man sequel. &&Real Steel is *way* underrated. &&But in that movie, everything was so small!&&Hey, is this an episode of Talkin' Bout Turtle?&&Great ep.&&I think we need to be careful with how we do the rape scene.&&Painfully intricate &&It's a no for me, dawg&&That's like the anal of friendship&&Only if you call me daddy&&Well only the host can pause in the one I know/use. So just don't pick a douchebag host&&The bad TV Zombieland though....&&I loved Sock! Reaper is one of those shows I can enjoy on repeat viewings. &&I watched this one last Christmas and I think I'm going to make it a tradition too! It's right up there with ""Gremlins"" and ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". &&I wanted to like Krampus so much. It just came off as a middle of the road thing. Wasn't scary enough to be a horror, wasn't funny enough to be a comedy, the camp value of it was all over the place, one second gingerbread men were leading an attack, the next Krampus is sitting ominously watching the chaos unfurl. &&I mean... Shaun of the Dead? &&Oh man, you're in for a doozy of a day!&&Try to go in blind. Don't watch any more trailers, read synopsis, or anything. Just turn it on and watch. &&I, too, hate Kate. She constantly ran from all of her problems, blamed other people for them, hurt other people, and she was equally a douche to both Jack and Sawyer. Her character's defining characteristic was basically her selfishness, which was extremely grating. &&I'll take a swing, as I've watched LOST all the way through like 5 or 6 times and love the series completely. 

Why Kate Austin suckssssssss:

1. [She jumps back and forth between Jack and Sawyer like 40 times and only stops flip flopping once Sawyer chooses someone else and she has no other option but to choose Jack and stick with him](#spoiler)
2. [She literally never listens when people ask or tell her to do something. ""Kate I need you to stay here"" or ""Kate please go do this"" always results in her doing the exact opposite and royally screwing up their plans. Seriously, every single time](#spoiler)
3. [She is constantly getting captured or caught out or some other form of becoming a damsel in distress and it gets super tiresome because she SHOULD be a badass that can handle herself but more often then not she needs someone else to bail her ass out](#spoiler)

There's more things that come to mind when I'm actually watching the show but I can't think of them right now. But yeah. Love the show, incredibly, so, but Kate sucks. I only like her because she makes Jack happy. 

""But she's hot!"" -- uhh yeah sure but there are other hot girls on the show that didn't suck, like Sun and Juliet. 

""But she's just a complex character that changes dynamically with the show, you can't fault her for that!"""" -- Bullshit I can't. Both Sawyer and Ben are far more dynamic and are also far better characters that don't piss me off constantly. 

The end :)&&Oh boy where to begin? I guess I can go with just the general reason why I despise her so much. She's so immensely selfish in pretty much every action she does. Even in the world of Lost, where one of the main themes is that it's comprised of tragically flawed characters, Kate seems to find a way to transcend that flawed nature by constantly and consistently doing things with no regard for the other survivors, or even the people she claims to love. 

I've considered doing a series of ""I Hate Kate"" posts in some medium that describes in detail, and for every episode, just how deplorable Kate Austen truly is. Maybe I'll do that next time I rewatch the series, which might be sometime next year. &&rip nathan fillion&&Also yes.&&I try to watch movies while awake. Usually more enjoyable that way.&&ARQ was good, as was Naked.&&I was going through a 'Sci-fi' phase. Was hard to come by new ones. The ending was a little off. I agree. &&Having looked at your username. I have zero reason to NOT believe what you just said. &&Not every director/writer that Adam Sandler works with is Paul Thomas Anderson -- it's possible he deserves some credit for that performance ;-)&&
Punch drunk love released in 2002, 15 years ago. So to try and say Adam sandler still does good movies based on this is a huge stretch. 

Have you seen Jack and Jill or how about the even worse and more recent Ridiculous 6? That's more akin to what he does now. 

Even The Do Over, which is probably the closest to an older Sandler movie was still mostly a miss IMO.

Was Punch Drunk Love great? Yes, but more likely due to the fact that it was a PT Anderson movie and Sandler lucked out. &&Tom Cruise was the same age when he made Edge of Tomorrow as Wilford Brimley was when he made Cocoon.&&Hollywood doesn't like to talk about it but a lot of actors are digitally de-aged in some of their movies.&&Idk, he looks pretty damn old to me.&&Even as a Jedi, he was still... Samuel L Jackson ([Mace Muthafuckin Windu](https://youtu.be/FCW_Vt35IzI)).

Edit: Jewish --> Jedi, thanks to muthafuckin autocorrect.&&Channing Tatum has done a range of roles, though. Hail, Caeser vs 22 Jump Street vs Foxcatcher, he's pretty good at playing different characters. He just doesn't physically blend into his roles&&I think chris pratt more than tatum. Pratt is the definition of a movie star and he kinda plays the same role (for the most part ) in everything he's in. Granted, he's not the draw that Cruise/Smith were in their prime (he just happens to be in movies that would make money without him)&&I REALLY hated their decisions on the joker for that movie.  it just didn't feel right at all.&&I finally broke and watched Suicide Squad.  I had avoided it for awhile since it seemed like a waste of time to watch (it was), but what elevated Suicide Squad from being just kind of bad a la the Man of Steel movies (which I find to be just dull and pointless) to infuriating was the fact that it seemed like they were always just about to do something really cool and interesting with the concept and just...never got around to it.  Most bad movies are just boring, have nothing but dumb ideas, or are poorly executed/realized (see Man of Steel).  Suicide Squad was like the recap I would give of a really good movie if I had been drunk while I watched it and forgot all of the most compelling details and character development. 

I don't even hate Jared Leto as the Joker.  There, I said it.  I think that if Jared Leto portrayed that Joker in a Batman film or as an actual antagonist it could be really good.  Each of the three big-screen Jokers that we have seen portray the Clown Prince of Crime have emphasized very different aspects of the character.  With Ledger we got Crime (and psychosis), with Nicholson we got the Clown, and with Leto we got Prince.  That Joker could be a more ridiculously flamboyant villain striding the line between comical and horrifying, which would be a great thing to have.  Imagine a Joker who actually tells Batman to lighten up and have a few laughs and *means it* and just can't understand why everyone is so serious.

&&> putting in that sympathetic dad subplot when the character is usually a greedy selfish asshole

Deadshot has had that plot before where he's doing what he does because he has a child he cares deeply about. &&> putting in that sympathetic dad subplot when the character is usually a greedy selfish asshole

Wait, what? The movie portrayed Deadshot exactly how he has always been. Deadshot has always been a a sympathetic dad and does everything for his daughter. &&If we are going to make arguments on cost sucking up from other things, the over licensed soundtrack would rank much higher than Will Smith. That was way too many high cost classic rock standards that are expensive, that added nothing to the movie and was actively annoying with its on the nose jokes. At least Smith played his part well. 

But none of these parts matter when the simple fact of the matter is they had no clue what movie they were making. The super on the DL villian squad that is used so it can be disavowed of any involvement by the US government, and their first mission is to take down a city destroying force?  The movie was fucked from the start based on that alone. 

&&I don't know who Rick Flag is in the context of the comics(never read him) but he was basically a little bitch in the movie.&&Oh totally, I was actually using that to see if my gf would want to watch Rogue One with me, since she likes Bourdain but not Star Wars haha. It didn't work.&&Oh no I hope they can put her together again&&I really enjoyed it.&&Whenever someone has the chance can we go over the members of the band U2?&&What in God's name are you talking about? There's no rape scene.&&We should use this blanket so you can't see it. It makes the rape -- I mean, *sexing from behind* seem more classy&&Dude do you have a boner right now?&&So yes? &&There was a tv zombieland?&&There's more than one Zombieland?&&And Die Hard?&&Okay you're right. Now I hate Kate too. I've watched it through probably like 5 times and every time I just expect the show to change and for her to not be a piece of shit. &&Usually being the key word.&&Finding good scifi is tougher than a Klingon's bat'leth.

A lot of it is made cheaply, so falls firmly in to the ""could have used more money/talent"" category. A lot of it is also watered down to be more marketable and becomes more like science-fantasy.

I have to watch a lot of bad scifi to find good ones, and even the good ones often have severe problems with endings/pacing/etc. &&Anderson deserves a lot of credit for that.  I remember reading a review where they explained how they basically did 2 takes for every scene.  They let Sandler be himself in the first one, then they asked him to try things completely differently.&&True&&I actually saw sandler do a panel for the film Reign Over Me (one of his serious roles, he was fantastic). He said serious was too draining and it took a huge toll on him. He wasn't likely to return to it because he didn't like having to think about shit that made him intensely emotional. I think it's a pretty fair point, especially since he can make millions fucking around with his friends. &&I read in an interview somewhere that Adam Sandler is doing movies now to help his friends money wise.&&You not like That's My Boy? I thought that was old school Sandler to a tee. 

His new netflix movies are just eh. They're not awful, but they're not balls funny. Sandy Wexler was weird, but really likable. &&I watched the Do over and ridiculous 6, and can't remember what either one was about. Talk about forgettable performances&&I have to Google this to see if it is true. 

Edit: It is true! Holy shit!&&""Even as a Jew, he was still... Samuel L Jackson""

That may be my favorite line of the day.&&[deleted]&&Channing Taintyum&&Ah - Ok, fair shout, I didn't really think about Jared. I can see that being the most controversial they've done.

I didn't actually end up disliking him, I feel he was way over-advertised and we were pretty much straight up conned as to his level of involvement,  and the tattoo's are the main thing I dislike. Jared himself is a *great* actor when he wants to be. &&I like a saddistic revolving Joker. Not a punk wanna be Joker.

>The Joker: Tell me something, my friend. You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?


>Bruce Wayne: What?


>The Joker: I always ask that of all my prey. I just... like the sound of it.


That's some good writing and in the suicide squad it was... bland.&&I didnt read the comics, but arrow's deadshot is also the same. He's in it for his daughter. &&Go away Dad! I'm trying to hang out with my friends!!!&&It's just a well-made movie with a reasonably unique premise, so it's easy to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride. &&Clearly you gotta start with the spiritual heart of the band - Adam Claytwothousandpounds&&And what I can do is thrust this way, and you can struggle.&&Don't ruin this for me Dude&&Sure!

Wait, are we talking about anal or....?&&Yes, it was Amazon's attempt to make a series, it was a massive flop and didn't involve any of the original actors. &&The greatest Xmas movie bar none. 

I don't do family stuff on Xmas, so for the last 7 or 8 years, I've celebrated *Thai Hard*. 

I order Thai food and watch Die Hard on Xmas. After all, it's not truly Xmas till Hans Gruber falls from Nakatomi Tower! 

Edit: Rare Exports is also a great Xmas Horror film. &&Ugh she suckssss. But on the upside, her suckiness is what made Jack and Sawyer great characters, I think. Sawyer ended up being one of my favorite characters by the end of the show. 

But Ben, I think, is my all time favorite. He just has such a wide range of character development. I can still perfectly remember his reaction when [that commando shot his daughter in front of him](#spoiler) and when [he was asked ""Why would you go back to Locke?"" and he said ""Because he's the only one who will have me""](#spoiler). Ben is the ultimate character.&&and every movie he makes is a themed vacation.&&As much as I hate it, I see where he's coming from. I used to watch all kinds of serious and emotional dramas when I was younger. But now that I have a family and other bigger responsibilities, it's a lot harder to find the emotional energy to sit through a really dramatic movie. I'm much more apt to watch a comedy or action flick these days. &&If you're referring to the Howard Stern interview a few months ago, Howard kind of alluded to the fact that he does movies to support his friends (David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc.). Sandler did not say it was to support his friends money-wise. He said something to the effect of him wanting to do projects so he can have fun with his friends (they were all doing some comedy tour together). With all that said, there's probably some truth to it but Sandler never actually admitted it in that interview. &&That's My Boy is personally one of my favorite Sandler movies, right up there with Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. Definitely does not get the love it deserves.&&He's freaking hilarious when he does comedy, so I'm hoping he sticks to it&&My understanding is the Joker was the original villain...and they have tons of footage shot but never shown because partway through production the decision was made to minimize the Joker and make the Enchantress the villain.  I believe they regretted their decision later.
&&Arrow did a damn good job with Deadshot. He starts off an asshole, and the sympathy comes later when they start to give Dig more characterization. It's a shame they killed off the character (rumor has it they were forced to because of the movie).&&And of course you have Larry Mullen Sr's Son&&Username checks out&&Either way, I'm in.&&That's not fully true. Amazon makes pilots and then let's their members vote on which shows to make. So that got a pilot made, they released it, everyone thought it was garbage, and nothing else happened.

"'The Lion King' Stampede Scene Took Three Years To Complete, Says Director Rob Minkoff",26653,6wdj5a,http://screenrant.com/lion-king-director-producer-interview/,869,1503855667.0,,"From the article:

**Now I heard there was a scene that took three years to make, so which scene was that? And what was the hardest scene to execute in the film?**

*Don Hahn*: Well, there were a lot of scenes that we kept revisiting. The wildebeest stampede is probably one that took a long, long time.

**That’s the one I heard that was like three years I believe…**

*Don Hahn*: Yeah because it was early days of computer animation and so the wildebeests themselves were computer generated and so that was one wrinkle into it. And then trying to, it’s an action sequence so there’s that and, in the end, it culminates in Mufasa dying and so you have this sensitive situation that you want to take the audience through and feel this empathy for Simba, but not traumatize this audience. And the thought process of that took some time.&&Coincidentally, some people took 3 years to beat this level in the Genesis/SNES game.&&I read from a /r/moviedetails thread that while the scene took very long to make, it was considered shoddy animation, and had a lot of repetition. From the thread I also learnt that most of the lion king animators were junior/new as the senior animators were working on pocahontas &&It took so long because the animators spent 2 years of it crying and in therapy &&Here is some [behind-the-scenes footage](https://youtu.be/epd3mEpWjco?t=96) explaining exactly how they animated this scene, going into detail about the software and collision tests. It gets really interesting at the 3:45 mark. &&That scene was the first time I cried in a movie. I was probably 9 or 10 and was staying home sick from school. So I guess the time on that scene paid off&&https://youtu.be/XM_VHtSDMIQ

The scene&&See stuff like this makes me wonder why Disney considered Lion King to be the B movie. So much work and care went into this film. And it honestly shows. You can tell the animators gave a damn.&&3 years? Hakuna matata.&&I saw this in theaters.  I had just lost my pet bird.  I didn't remember anything after the stampede and i cried the entire rest of the movie.  My fam was pissed.  It is still my favorite movie at 36yo.&&I remember my dad crying in this scene. I'm a dad now and it makes sense. I just cried now and I also cried then. My family cries a lot....&&To everyone saying they don't understand why it took so long:

I can't find the video right now, but I remember watching a behind the scenes video where they go into detail about the herd simulations they used to model and animate the wildebeest herd. Computer animated films were in their infancy and combining crowd simulations with computer animation at that level had never been done before and was a huge technical challenge.&&Fun fact: a buddy of mine designed and animated Mufasa, he wasn't sure how he should handle the head on collision in this scene so he did and ""accordion squash"" style deformation. If you watch it in slo motion you can see it and it looks funny. He said, ""every time I see the saddest scene in this movie with my kids I can't help laughing.""&&It didn't take three years to make. It took three years to *get right* which is not the same thing at all. &&""I just can't WAIT -- FOR THIS SCENE TO BE OVER!!""

*animator banging head on table*&&I really wish these interviews got into the technical details of restoring a decades old film for today. Did they do an acid wash? What kind of noise reduction did they use? Any other post-processing? Etc...&&So what you're telling me is it could have looked like [this](https://youtu.be/P0Vz-lIG1D0) if they ran out of money &&6 months to animate, 30 months to tweak so that every tear gets extracted from the audience.&&So what you're saying is it took 3 years to complete but only 3 seconds to rip my heart out.&&And now a 14 year old could make it in a few hours with some pirated video editing software and even add explosions and lens flairs.&&
Interestingly enough, my former cognitive psych professor told us about one of the tests he and his colleagues do to study emotion and brainwaves that involve this movie. They hook up their patients to electrodes and monitor their brainwaves and other bodily regulations (skin perspiration, blood pressure, etc) while they watch a certain clip. 

He told us that they ALWAYS get an emotional response to this scene, no matter the testing subject. And he's been doing it for years. Pretty cool if you ask me!&&Dedication&&TIL real life Pumba is demonic nightmare creature&&Can I downvote for the TERRIFYING autoplayed video on this page? &&*Took three years to complete*... Its been **twenty-three years** and I'm still not over it.&&Took that long to beat the mega drive level as well &&And if you ever wanted to see what it looked like in it's [early stages.](http://i.imgur.com/z8ppoEx.gif)&&So did the level on the video game&&The website takes 3 years to load too&&Is this a we literally worked on the scene every day for 3 years?&&And to this day im still pissed mufasa died.&&Any idea how fast that scene could be done today?&&And only took 3 seconds to ruin my childhood&&In related news write up of stampede scene work now complete after 23 years
&&Does anyone else still hate the Reddit front page algorithm? Fuckin shit is here 9 hours later. I remember when the front page would have neat shit every time you reloaded it. Now it's garbage. Site is okay still but the censorship, social engineering and goddamn front page piss me off. TL;Dr get off my lawn edit: and fuck sorting by new I don't wanna sift through all the fucking garbage.&&If you want to see the scene again: https://youtu.be/g-KbexL-fJk&&I imagine that they had to stop from everybody crying and screaming no, a la Michael from the office&&In one of the special editions there's a really cool making of/behind the scenes type thing after the credits. It's about an hour long and discusses this and quite a bit more. It was awesome. &&So they made Chiwetel as Scar huh. Gave Jeremy Irons the shaft &&How did they get all the animals to go where they wanted?&&Not because of any technical challenges, mind you, but because the animators, knowing how it ended, would get emotional and have to step away from their work every few minutes.&&And only 20 + years to suppress it from memory....&&One day of animation and the rest on bawling their eyes out at the mufasa scene&&Simba attempting to wake up Mufasa is the only specific instance in my life I remember crying. I know I've wept elsewhere, but damn that scene was powerful&&Took 3 years to complete you say? Still not as good as this though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0Vz-lIG1D0&&The recurring plug for the blue Ray DVD release was kind of distracting. Do people even still buy those?&&3 years to complete but 3 seconds to break my heart and cry. &&""Not traumatize this audience???"" Bitch Im about to cry all night just because of the title.  I havent even seen the movie in ages.  Dangit where are my tissues...&&There's nothing special about the scene. It's one of those things where old school animation of the same scene wouldn't take a fraction of that time.&&Well I guess mufasa had a slow and painful death...&&It looks like it. That scene had a completely different look to the rest of the movie. &&I think this scene is like the massive fish caught by the fisherman. As the years pass, the reported length gets bigger and bigger.

Yeah, when The Lion King first came out, they claimed it took a year to animate the stampede.&&This scene always made me cry as a kid. No matter how many times I watched it.&&Stampede in the gorge! Simbas down there!&&One of the most horrowing scenes, even today.&&This is my go to scene to introduce people to surround sound. I play the intro and jump to this scene. It's mixed remarkably well.

It sounds like most of the time was spent conceptualizing the scene.&&I know CGI wasn't as good back then as it is now but three fucking years? For this?

I can't believe Lion King was ruined for me, after all these years of not watching it.&&oh, they WEREN'T trying to traumatize 6-year-old me ... well, thanks for trying, I guess&&Wow thanks for the unmarked spoiler asshole.&&>  Mufasa dying, but not traumatize this audience.

Disney is apt at wholesome murders.&&Wow, I had no idea it was CGI. It was super photorealistic. Amazing for early-90's technology!&&I remember when I was a kid I always had a very hard time beating the Elephant Graveyard level, and the few times I did, I was in the fucking stampede level and would die instantly. I still know every inch of the three first levels of this game though.&&[deleted]&&I don't know how I learned it as an 8 year old, but right when it starts to get crazy like 2/3-3/4 of the way through there is a spot over on the left where staying in the same position gets you all the way to the end.&&That damn waterfall. I'm still bitter about that. &&I believe the creator of the game did an AMA years ago where he actually admitted to making the second level unbelievably difficult and apologised. &&It took me three years to give up on that level. &&GOD. I hated that stage sfm. The damn rocks!&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpUNh557FnA&&The creators recently admitted that the difficulty was mandated to make rentals not cut into sales as much. Basically, it was designed to be impossible to beat in just a few days.&&Youtuber Cry did an [attempted playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgl928e41U) last year that I think captures the frustration and self-loathing this game wrought on our childhoods.

Key word ""attempted"". I don't think he even makes it to the stampede level.&&That level was easy compared to ""can't wait to be king""&&Furthest I got was the Hyenas towards the end.  Just once :/&&They must of made it hard so people are forced to replay the scene to justify their work.&&Only 3 years? I still haven't beat it. Fuck that game. &&I never made it to this level. I couldn't beat the giraffe level. &&It was the waterfall that got me.&&The code to get to any level is B A R R Y on the options screen.&&lmao&&I played it again after building a retropi. How the hell did I beat this (or Kid Icarus?) when I was a kid?&&Was expecting the top comment to be about how shrek's scene with the dragon breathing fire was similarly revolutionary. Was slightly disappointed then I remembered that level, fuck that level, I've still never beat it &&Was that game really that hard for people? Forgive me if I sound prude, but the game telegraphs where the wildebeests will run to and where the incoming rocks will appear. The monkey level was just figuring out which monkey does what. The boneyard level was just mash the shit out of the jump button while alternating left and right so the grey stuff doesn't touch you.

Really the only trouble I had with this game was timing the grabs on the hippo's asses on level 2, but even that was nothing I'd get a game over on.&&Yeah I never beat it as a kid. I had to revisit it after getting into emulation. It was a pretty cool feeling to explore NEW(to me) levels in a classic game I played as a kid, as there was still like, half the game after that level. &&Some people took 25 yrs and couldn't beat it😑&&You gotta put in the cheat code B-A-R-R-Y. &&Everything on reddit is a video game&&No way. The Hakuna Matata level was by FAR the most patience-testing/frustration-inducing of the game.

Source: still haven't beaten it, but have stopped losing sleep over it.&&But seriously- how do you get past the giant gorilla on the ""hakuna matata"" level?!&&Funfact: When you go to the option menue before starting the game and push the buttons B-A-R-R-Y in a quick row, you can play the Lion King in god mode. It makes you invulnerable, but it will not help you to find the right way through the hyena caves, tho...&&Computer animation was also in it's infancy at this time.  &&Which goes to show that neither bad CGI nor poor animation ruin a movie, if the story is compelling.

Looking at you, Valerian.&&Yeah a lot of animators thought it would be a total flop. I feel like the cast alone would make me interested in working on it.&&To be honest I think Pocahontas has some of the best animation among Disney movies.   It's all very cinematic looking. &&True. Pocahontas was going on at same time. The cycles for the wildebeest were pretty straightforward but getting them to not collide was painstaking. They developed a method of layering the simulations of the key framed wildebeest. The CG department was tiny and had a lot to prove. They were young but brilliant people who were really pioneers in CG animation. Worked there as an intern before returning to Cal Arts. Good times. 🙂&&I heard from friends over at Disney that it was a similar situation with Frozen. Most animators just considered it to be another princess movie, expected it would be a flop and wanted to work on Big Hero 6 instead.&&Yup let's put all our best animators in fuckin' Pocahontas &&Man they really backed the wrong conceptual horse on that one&&I remember this scene being a huge deal at the time and even a number of special features on TV about how it was made. People hadn't seen anything like it before.&&Weird considering what a great movie this turned out to be and what a stinker Pocohontas was, guess the young inexperienced guys were maybe more eager or talented who knows... &&They got a whole studio of new animators starting with Little Mermaid. Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Lion King was Disney's Renaissance. &&I am getting choked up just thinking about that scene. I loved the movie as a little kid, but I never really understood it until I re-watched when I was 10 and ended up bawling my eyes.&&Cool!

At the time, the A team worked on Pocahontas, and the B team worked on Lion King. The experienced A team took risks with Pocahontas. And while it had really beautiful moments, it wasn't as critically acclaimed as other parts of the [Disney Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Renaissance). Team B took it as a challenge and had to think more creatively under pressure.

As a reward for beating the waterfall and the boss that follows it, you get to play the first adult Simba level, which is one of the easiest levels in the game, with lots of cathartic leopard murdering.&&THIS. I never got past it. 😭&&https://youtu.be/kILeyo1iv0A?t=18m30s

https://youtu.be/kILeyo1iv0A?t=26m30s For the Stampede level&&https://youtu.be/kILeyo1iv0A?t=18m30s
&&Stampede level was my favorite. I always beat it without jumping.&&Lion King with the stampede and Aladdin with the carpet flying were some of the first cross overs by Disney of traditional animation into computed generated.  I remember the stampede being awesome in the cinema at that time.&&And it was fucking amazing. While I can see some technical shortcomings today (the herd is too sparse; nowadays the CGI wouldn't let you see the floor whatsoever!) I think the animation itself and how they made it work with the directing they had to do was genius.

This CGI was better applied than most the CGI we see today.&&I thought the Lion King animation was beautiful when I watched it recently. It just has a different sort of style to it than others. &&Huh. TIL Valerian has already been released.&&Don't forget the music and I don't mean just the sing along songs. There's great choral music during the stampede scene that really sets the danger of the situation and there are great melodies composed by Hanz Zimmer when Simba meats Mufasa's spirit and on his way back to Pride Rock.&&Even Elton John thought he was washed up while writing a song that started ""when I was a young warthog""&&Yes it is!&&If that's true, I think they managed to prove themselves, spectacularly so.

I hope those newcomers become super appreciated and legendary after The Lion King was released.&&I love Big Hero 6!&&Speaking strictly artistically, it is a more ""beautiful"" movie.  But the crowd wants what it wants&&I remember reading that they thought it was going to be the 'big' Disney movie for that year. 

Hah! Shows what they knew! Well 3 year old me too, because I had a Pocahontas themed birthday party. It was a pretty bitchin' party though.&&I know right? To be fair pocahontas seemed successful enough, and had beautiful animation. But at the end of the day was ""just another Disney princess movie""&&I saw The Lion King on Broadway (bucket list item!). It was probably the greatest thing I've ever watched. I cried so much and was hysterically sobbing at the end. Granted, I am a huge Lion King fan.&&>mixed with that particular moment in the Hans Zimmer score...

There are very few scores that are guaranteed to destroy me. One is The Lion King, particularly when Simba is climbing Pride Rock in the rain at the end.

The other is the burning bush scene in Prince of Egypt. Hans Zimmer has it out for me...&&Uh-oh. &&You seen Up?&&I didn't. 
But i guess a 4 year old girl couldn't understand the concept? And since i watched that movie religiously for few years, by the time I could comprehend what that scene really ment I didn't really react since I watched it like few times a week for years. 
That's how I explained it to myself, since now I am a wreckball that gets emotional over super dumb shit, and cannot say that I don't have a soul

Off the top of my head, so, loose with the facts, but, Lion King was a throwaway movie that had ""amateurs"" working on it.

I think the 3D renders are missing an outline. It looks like they used two colors for the models and flat shading with shadows. It works very well with the hand drawn stuff. In most cartoons even today it's much more noticeable. &&http://i.imgur.com/fh6ufle.gifv&&The double jumps. Always the double jumps. &&Yeah you gotta learn the timing for the double-jump.&&Took me 2 rentals to beat. The thing is, I could never beat Scar.

Then there was the jumping over pigs with the ostrich and all that stuff. Memories.&&Fuck those monkies.  &&Same, that whole game was hard as fuck.&&If im not mistaken they actually released it with a game breaking glitch where one of the monkeys didnt catch you&&Annoying fact: That part of the game was made overly difficult to combat the game rental market.

Apparently it is a single pixel near the left wall where you get hit one less time than you have the health for, so you can just chill the entire stage.

They also explained that the pattern is not random, so you could also memorize where the stampede comes from and dodge everything perfectly as it is the same every time.&&...so it's all Blockbusters fault?&&You just took me down an amazing YouTube hole.

I don't know about 'most'. Much of the CGI we see today is so well applied that we don't even recognize it as CGI.&&Well the thing with CGI is that if it's used right you often won't notice it. 2D animation is supplemented with 3D animation all the time but when it's well done you can't tell. &&You're complaining because you can see the floor?&&As a kid, I never thought it had bad style or bad animation. I thought it was so damn compelling exactly because it wasn't humans in wacky art styles. It didn't have the forced greek 'look' that Hercules did, or the weird 'round & flat' designs of Pocahontas.

It was just a compelling movie starring a bunch of bad-ass lions and other wild life. It tried to be 'fun'. (Quotes because fuck this Mufasa scene.) The others watched like a 'kids will watch anything, how can we make this artsy' project. It made kid-me sad.&&But little did he know of his future cameo in Bob the Builder &&Definitely had long successful careers if nothing else. So long ago...&&Imo it was better than Frozen, albeit very predictable.
Though I don't like Frozen very much, animation was great though.&&Not just the big Disney movie, they wanted a nomination for Best Picture. This was before Best Animated Film was a category... Beauty and the Beast was their last nom, and they thought Pocahontas had a chance at getting another. It's why they tried to adult it up a bit.&&I'm not crying, we're all crying. ""Dad get up""&&""Moses""

Goosebumps, everytime. Though the dead son scene also fucks me up.

On a side note, wtf happened with DreamWorks animation? They had so many hit or miss movies (like the joseph one). &&I know exactly what you're talking about.

As long as you're empathetic to other real human (and other) beings who cares about crying in movies?&&True, but it's basically all because of that one shot of the hyenas at the top of the crest that makes it look like the stampede ends. It is odd that they didn't change that shot so that the stampede would seem like it was endless for the rest of the scene.&&Pretty sure I'll be laughing from now on too...&&I should have know, all of my favorite musical scores from movies 
are by him.  With Inception being my absolute favorite.  I still listen to it whenever I just want to relax.  Its great airplane music for me.&&I see pride!&&i think you may just have an emotional trigger for Matthew Broderick movies&&Listen. I've tried to talk about the emotional toll Godzilla '98 took on me as a child--watching as it's revealed that Godzilla is actually a mother trying to protect her children, her dying in the rain, on a cold, dark city street--and have always been laughed at because okay, it's not a good movie. But *YOU MAKE AN EFFORT TO ANTHROPOMORPHIZE THIS CREATURE, GODDAMMIT, AND THEN YOU EXPECT ME NOT TO FEEL FOR IT???*

Anyway thank you for making me feel less alone in the world. &&I haven't watched The Lion King in years, but just reading this line is breaking my heart. &&'98 Godzilla fucked me up too.

My fiance said it was just like Lion King, I told her that's the cruelest thing she's ever said. 

Growing up I loved that movie. My aunt constantly retells the story of when she was baby sitting me shortly after the movie came out and I couldn't sleep so she put it on. When the scene began I walked over and said ""I don't like this part, don't let it happen"". The movie still finds a way to haunt me after so many years. &&Oh shit I thought I was the only one!

We call them playblasts now (not sure if they did then too), but those are ""pencil"" tests for the computer animator and they allow for review of the animation without rendering. Even that would've taken a while for the tech at the time to output. That assumes they had this feature at all since entirely new software was written for the stampede sequence alone. It was a tiny team of technicians and animators that knew how to animate CG (5, if memory serves). &&if Lion King was worked on my ""amateurs"", what were the pros working on?&&That jogs me memory a bit actually.

Without fail my eyes are at least watery...  &&I legit shed a tear.&&an all-timer&&The Lion King soundtrack really blows me away. Everything about it was awesome&&I saw him in concert a couple weeks ago and they preformed a Lion King medley. It's a great show if you ever get the chance. &&I was already on the verge of tears just thinking about mufasa dying, and then you do this to me? I don't even have any tissues in the house!&&Thats the one. And that music too.&&Dumbo's mum's trunk reaching out of the caged window. &&That scene made me feel really bad about getting fish eggs on my sushi for like, an entire day.&&The real fucked up thing is when Nemo goes to school and all the other families only have one child as well...&&Except it hits much harder if you're older.&&Pocahontas, iirc&&They were all working on Pocahontas. It's why they hired Elton John to do the music, instead of tried and true Alan Menkin, who did pretty much every other movie in the Disney Renaissance. &&Reminds me of Boeing around the same time - they had all the big-name talent working on their supersonic jet to compete with the Concorde, and put their amateur engineers in charge of the much less important temporary stop-gap solution, the 747.&&TIL: All scenes in Lion King took 3 years to make&&The parrot filmed it.&&NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!    NOOOoooooo&&Mufasa equals Nedd Stark.&&how is your day going and/or how are you&&Hand drawn/traditional animation?&&Back in my days, we were really gamers! Starting the whole shit over if we failed, you kids have it too easy nowadays! GET OFF MY LAWN! &&Yeah,back then they had to add artificial difficulty to make it feel like you got your moneys worth from a game. Contra only takes like 10 minutes to beat if you dont game over, but making every attempt basically a strictly enforced ""no deaths"" attempt (something people only do for a challenge these days) meant a kid could get months of playtime out of trying to beat it. 

It was a cheap trick and anyone who claims to miss those games is full of shit.&&Dear God, I'm going to download this game and never tell my children this trick.&&F&&Still one of the most underrated Disney movies. &&Generally because animators know what to look for. You can get the point across to general audiences in most things, but making it move properly and really bringing it to life is a whole other level. This scene is somewhere in between. Didn't move perfectly, but still moved really really well. Better than anyone I know has ever animated at least. Disney don't hire no fools.&&The same can be said for just about any art form.&&True. Nowadays I am quite unforgiving when it comes to animation and quality, which mostly shoes in me being highly picky about the anime I compliment and want to erase from the earth.

But even with those things in mind I think the animation here is decent: every frame is different (no lazy doubling), human touches were applied to make it seem natural and for the scene, a variety of unusual angles is used to great effect. All it lacks is quantity and variety of wildebeest models, but both (the latter especially) are excusable when you remember that SD quality was going to be the measuring stick. Sure, the cinema had far more detail, but that is where people were expected to be wowed by the whole package. And even then film grain and wear and tear would have been finer in detail than what the majority of cinemas could offer in terms of film. And video cassette or DVD are simply not good enough to call out the technical shortcomings of these scenes.

For the standards of its time, this was superb CGI. Nowadays, I think it is very well-aged CGI. It beats stuff like a  molten terminator or the repetitive matrix smith flood battle effect hands down. (Not to say they were bad movies or were full of bad CGI: just saying there are things that have not aged a tenth as well as this scene which manages to hide its CGI nature quite well for the most part.)&&Yeah, especially because the public doesn't really notice the animation unless it's horrible. /u/Black_Handkerchief didn't say a single thing about the actual animation on his post.&&I am with you on that one.&&I don't care why it was. I just know the forced style stuff was jarring to kid me.&&good thing shes not your wife, almost made a huge mistake there!&&I always think of Election. It's that film where he's a teacher who has a grudge against Reese Witherspoon. Reese Witherspoon plays a teenage bitchy Leslie Knope basically

 &&Personally, I most closely associate Matthew Broderick with *WarGames,* which I guess just reveals that I'm a huge nerd.&&""I could be the walrus, I'd still have to bum rides off people""&&> The fact that somebody's first takeaway from Broderick is Inspector Gadget and not Ferris Bueller is baffling to me. 

after watching The Producers, I can't think of him as anything other than the accountant.

given, I *am* like addicted to that movie now.&&Huh. My first thought whenever I see Matthew Broderick is always FATAL MOTORCAR COLLISION, but each to their own I suppose.&&Haven't watched the Day off movie. Watched Godzilla multiple times, because childhood.&&What's weird to me is that Matthew Broderick was so goddamn suave and naturally charismatic in Ferris Bueller, I can't fathom why he has been playing awkward, nervous characters for the last 20 years. It's the Fonzie effect. Henry Winkler made a name for himself as the fucking embodiment of cool for like ten years. Then he started playing all these nerdy, meek characters. Why do these actors do this?&&Wow you just blew my mind bc I did not realize that Inspector Gadget is Ferris Bueller. &&Adult Simba was, Cub was voiced by the boy from Home Improvement.&&Adult Simba*. Young Simba was actually Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
&&...same lmao &&Holy wtf I didn't know this either and must tell my 10yo.&&The middle of that movie is essentially the lion version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, so it makes sense.&&Same. Don't think I'll ever see the movie the same now&&༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

Thank you. I'm so sorry for what you went through.... but I'm glad we all found each other in the end!!&&[deleted]&&Bawling. Balling is like if you scoop out melon.&&According to the 98' movie, Godzilla is hermaphrodite, so both male and female (that's why it didn't need a male partner to become pregnant). [Good article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/05/16/godzilla_male_or_female_what_gender_is_the_movie_monster.html) on the complicated history of Godzilla's gender.&&I'm honestly floored by how many people had similar experiences!! RIP Mother Zilla, YOU DID NOT DIE IN VAIN!! 🐉&&Love killed the beast.&&>""let's have it be raining the whole time and have almost every scene be outdoors.""

>""do you have any idea how difficult and expensive that's going to be?""


MAKE IT RAIN!&&The Super Mario Bros. Movie maybe?&&Funny enough when America got the original Godzilla movie to dub they decided to add and remove a bunch of scenes and completely ruined the message. &&Well, once Broderick kills, he's got the taste for it.&&You have forgotten who you are and so forgotten me. &&[deleted]&&You think that's bad? I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF WORK READING THIS!&&I still think about it every time I have sushi&&Incidentally, that's exactly why fish lay a shit ton of eggs in the first place. It's kind of the shotgun approach to parenting, just shoot out a bunch and hope that at least one of them makes it to adulthood.&&those poor men. missed out on the favourite classic&&2 Sultans 1 monkey&&[deleted]&&Hah, I was raised on Sega Genesis I was just saying. &&Exactly. 

I would love to see what those same animators could do with this same scene today though.&&Out of curiositiy, what do you look for in anime animation? I see different standards of what constitutes ""good"" among people.&&No, no, it just proves that she's young

It's like Barney's Ewok rule from HIMYM&&Sex and the City &&I always think of The Road to Wellville, such a weird movie especially as a young man but they always played it on Comedy Central when I was young.  I don't think Ive ever actually watched it all the way through but the oddity of it all always sticks in mind.  

Cable Guy is a close second but Jim Carrey is the memorable one in that movie. &&> Reese Witherspoon plays a teenage bitchy Leslie Knope

Holy crap, you were not kidding.&&Jesus lmao&&Holy shit, this is very different film to the one I remember watching when I was 15. I definitely need to rewatch this.&&She really nailed that nerdy cute look.&&See, I watched both War Games and Day Off but the former always stuck with me when thinking of Broderick. 

That and his last name is the same as my first boyfriend. So I guess I just associate things strangely. &&FAAAAAT! Fat! 

*Fat.*

Fat fat fatfatfat fattyyy!!!&&He went there&&> the boy from Home Improvement

SOMEBODY wasn't in the JTT Fan Club.&&I recently rewatched the movie for the first time in about 5 years. I was actually pretty surprised how few lines Matthew Broderick actually had lol&&JTT!&&Young Simba's singing voice was Jason Weaver. He played young Michael Jackson in Jackson 5: An American Dream and Marcus in Smart Guy

Edited 4 spelling&&JTT!&&Godzilla supporters unite! &&Also nine when I watched this, ran into the other room to cry my eyes out when she died. I guess 9 years old was a terrible time to see this movie. 

~~My parents~~ Santa Claus got me a 2ft tall 1998 Godzilla action figure for Christmas as a way to make me feel better. I still have it and I'm close to 30. She sits atop my refrigerator. &&I'm 28 and I'm working on NOT crying so much haha. A good cry now and then feels good, though. &&You're totally right. Autocorrect? Wine? It was both their faults. &&Or going Gucci at the Gucci store. &&Trust the fungus dude&&I feel like that whole opening sequence where it explained that the asteroid split Earth into two different dimensions with two different evolutionary paths was a pretty interesting concept to explore for a movie or even a video game, can't believe it was wasted on Mario Bros.&&[deleted]&&God... I forgot about that movie.&&[deleted]&&I just looked that up on wiki and now I fucking hate you. (Hate the father more, obviously, but still.)&&It was Jafar's second wish.&&Why did you put a space before your question mark like French people 

I'm all right, pretty good I guess.&&Consistent quality in both fluidness and detail, enough keyframes to not make things feel stunted or suffer the typical pan and scan filler. Few things Pius me of as much as an audience that might as well be a painting whilst seconds rock away with a camera packing over that still scene. Another useful thing is to have the action scenes (or whatever other CGI stuff there is) blend in with the rest of the series.

Of I can tell that your mecha is a 3d object with fancy shading being rendered on top of a typical anime scene, you are doing something wrong.&& Anyone who saw inspector gadget before Ferris Bueller simply doesn't have a television in their home. That movie is on TV once a week. &&What is said rule? &&I have literally never met another person who has seen The Road to Wellville. It's an amazing, completely fucked up film.&&It's hilarious and also a lot darker then you'd expect based off the brief summary of it being a comedy about a ~~student~~ teacher and pupil who don't like each other. Well worth a watch if you've not seen it.&&*swoon*&&Check out [lil dicky lion king](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RlH7rnAqg) if you haven't seen it yet your in for a treat.&&Bae. &&Great voice&&I have a Toho Godzilla on my fridge!

Conversely, if you were young enough that the ewoks reminded you of your teddy bear when Jedi came out (and therefore you love ewoks), then you're young enough to be attractive.&&Oh it's great! I believe it is sort of a true story. Mr. Kellogg really was a crazy health nut and had real places like Wellsville.&&Which one's the student and which one's the pupil?&&this was awesome thank you for this&&i don't have the energy to meme you, sorry&&",2017-08-27 13:41:07
