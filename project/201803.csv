Jordan Peele is the first black writer to win Oscar for best original screenplay.,101737,8235q9,http://www.etonline.com/jordan-peele-is-first-black-writer-to-win-oscar-for-best-original-screenplay-97223,4107,1520221816.0,,"First MadTV cast member to win an oscar i think &&Ozamataz Buckshank is an Oscar winner. As is Donkey Teeth. 

What a wild time we live in! &&Looking at the competition Jordan was up against, this really surprised me. Well done Black Ice&&Insubordinate and churlish&&Now THAT is how you put the pussy on the chainwax&&ITT: key & peele jokes&&I said Bitchhhh&&Pretty excited to see another film by him.&&If you had told me a few years ago that one of the Key and Peele guys was going to win an Oscar I probably would have laughed in your face.

Good for him though, clearly he's talented in more than just comedy.&&SLAP ASS!!&&An indie horror film just getting nominated is a big deal. Jordan taking home the Oscar is a major victory.&&Pretty strong competition as well. The difference maker for me was that ""Get Out"" was so cleverly written.&&First member of Key and Peele to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.&&Well deserved. I would‚Äôve been happy with Lady Bird too... or The Big Sick or Shape of Water or even Three Billboards. It was a good year for original screenplays. &&More than him being black, I think his career path has been the most interesting/impressive. Going from comedic actor on Comedy Central to all these nominations and a win for horror in such a short amount of time. That can't be too common, can it?&&I'm the motherfucker that plays mother fuckers mother fucker.&&The player formerly known as Mousecop finally wins. Well deserved, he's made one of the best movies in a long time&&[deleted]&&He's no longer in the sunken place.&&I was bothered he didn't mentioned Key on his speech.

Edit:Yo, I know he probably wasn't involved in the project but I like to think of them as bros for life. &&Before I saw Get Out I totally thought it was going to perpetuate slavery and how modern man still enslaves yada yada yada but after honestly I‚Äôm disappointed in myself for judging a book by it‚Äôs cover bc that movie was fucking dope y‚Äôall, Secrest out  &&Nooice&&I'm really happy for him. I went in to Get Out not knowing much about it but with curiosity and excitement to see what he could bring his first time directing. I was hoping it would be good but wouldn't have thought I would love it as much as I do. I get that some people love it like I do and others not so much, and that's fine but I personally enjoyed everything about it. It just kept going from 'what?.....*what?*......**WHATTT???**' for me lol. 

It was such an enjoyable experience, it really was. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a film *the way* I did Get Out. I am looking forward to his future films big time.&&Where were you guys when the media proclaimed Damien Chazelle as the youngest director to win an Oscar for *La La Land* last year? 

I didn't see you guys rushing in to complain. &&His speech was so relatable and endearing! Congrats man!&&If Kumail Nanjiani had won would the same hold true but for a Pakistani writer?&&More excited that a horror film won something, tbh&&Question... as a non-American, why is he considered to be black when he is also half-white?  ( I guess same goes for Obama)

I wonder, if say, Chloe Wang/Bennett won an award, would the media portray her as first Asian-American to win such-and-such?

&&But did he say bitch tho???&&Oh, yeah?  What about Dustin Lance Black, who won for **Milk**? /s&&lol Reddit racist af&&I think this is the first time I've missed the oscars in years. Didn't even realize they were happening. I moved, so wasn't even on my mind. Now I feel like I missed a piece of history. :\(

Grats to one half of one of the most amazing comedic duo's in modern history. I've not seen the movie yet, but if Key and Peele was any indication, I'm sure it is well earned.&&>*Get Out* has been seen as a satire on the dynamics of **so-called ""West Wing liberals"", who consider themselves to be allies** of movements against racism yet do more harm than good. 

>The Guardian wrote, ""The thing *Get Out* does so well ‚Äì and the thing that will rankle with some viewers ‚Äì is to show how, however unintentionally, **these same people can make life so hard** and uncomfortable for black people. It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester. 

>http://www.pajiba.com/film_reviews/get-out-review-a-masterful-combination-of-horror-and-racial-commentary.php&&NOIIIICE&&Nooice&&Considering the amazing, ridiculous escalations that most Key & Peele sketches become, I can imagine Keegan-Michael sat in an apartment festooned with empty takeaway boxes desperately scribbling away on a script to rival Key's.


This is amazing news though, Jordan Peele is incredibly talented and I'm so happy he's been recognised with an Oscar. Will he ever write skits again? I hope so, because I love K&P.&&I liked Get Out but after Reading both Screenplays for both Get Out and Three Billboards, the latter had more depth and living breathing characters.  Get Out was just a good movie to watch just because.  The story was meh and the characters were not too engaging apart from the TSA friend.  Also, Get Outs story was a predictable one on knowing what was going to happen next whereas with Three Billboards I had no idea where the story or characters were going to go or do next.&&Hopefully he gets around to making gremlins 2&&Incoming downvotes, the screenplay was not the strongest part of that film and was probably its weakest point. People love the concept and a few jokes/moments but the pacing and tone were all over the place. Looking forward to seeing peele develop but it was evident this was his first major script. It needed more meat.&&Don't get me wrong I love him and I love key and Peele but I honestly didn't think get out was all that good. Like the lead actor was good but I don't think it was Oscar worthy. &&As a ""black"" guy and an amature screen writer, I would hope that if I was recognized it would be because what I did was significant and compared well to the work of all my contemporaries, not just the one who I share a similar skin hue, and often little else.

But of course the insinuation is that it's a greater accomplishment because he's the first black guy to win in spite of biases against him. You have to already be looking at the world through a racialist lens to see things that way however.

I will grant that Hollywood may be a sick enough place where racism actually is a real problem (like the issue they have with sexual harassment) but it's not the case outside their fame-for-booty subculture. There probably hasn't been a midget best screen writer either.

In reality, if you're willing to put people into arbitrary categories then of course you'll find some who haven't done certain things and if you're suffering from a strong confirmation bias that says racism is everywhere, you'll see it. And when you don't, you'll see a triumph of progress lol

Jordan Peele can just be a writer, he doesn't have to be a black writer.&&So?&&Oh man. I'm so happy for him, but i might be the one person who didn't like the movie.

Do a search, and you'll get many results from people who genuinely believe it and are trying to spread it. 

I learned about the con theory from Facebook friends who fell for it. The late comedian/activist/former presidential candidate Dick Gregory was a respected authority that helped spread it. He genuinely belived that Trayvon Martin and Kendrick Johnson were just two of hundreds of  blacks that were killed for their organs. https://www.google.com/search?q=dick+gregory+stealing+organs+video&rlz=1CAACAG_enUS782US782&oq=dick+gregory+stealing+organs+video&aqs=chrome..69i57.14581j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&&Naw...but you really said that?&&Didn't some studio hand him fistfulls of money and say do w/e?&&He's writing a reboot of the twilight zone.

Yeah what a groundbreaking thought, definitely best screenplay right there.&&It actually *did* **have a deeper meaning.**

If you refer to [The Q&A with Jeff Goldsmith](http://www.theqandapodcast.com/) he interviews Jordan about the sunken place. Peele explains that the reason for the screen above the main character as he is falling into the ether of the sunken place, is it's representative of a theater screen. 

The deeper meaning behind get out is the black audience of horror movies and how they have never had a voice in horror. Movie after movie, the black audience screams ""Get Out"" at the screen as their vicarious character body walks into a trap and dies.&&I don't get how they could see that as a b-movie. Even if you take out all semblance of a social commentary it is still a solid concept. &&[deleted]&&this is the best argument for the ""awards are meaningless"" people&&tbf Key stole his joke&&[deleted]&&Why would he?&&Yea I went in thinking it would be about a couple racist red necks dropping N-bombs left and right, and some hamfisted preaching-to-the-choir about how evil they were, based on what friends said and what I saw on reddit.

I wasn't prepared for how clever the movie was. I'm fiending for something else by Peele.&&In America there's a huge focus on skin color as being part of one's identity so if you're 50% black and look black, you're black. if you're 50% black but look white, you're ""biracial"", which is the equivalent of ""You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.""&&There was this thing called the ""one-drop"" rule where anyone who had even one drop of ""negro blood"" was considered ""tainted"" and were automatically considered Black.

Ideology still kind of lives on today.

Also, what you look like plays a factor. Thats why Logic is often considered to be a White rapper (even though he's told us he's mixed on every song) while J. Cole and Drake are considered Black.&&One drop rule.&&This goes far back into the times of slavery, when one's *whiteness* determined one's place in society. Having ""one drop"" of African blood, as they said, made you ""black,"" legally and societally. [It's explained in more detail here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule#Other_countries_of_the_Americas)

That wasn't long enough ago for our collective memory to have forgotten. Also, if you are going to refrain from calling the former president black because he is only half-black, then you must also refrain from calling a huge percentage of the African American population black, for the same reason. If two people are of the same race, then they should be known as the same race, whether they are a rapper, a housewife, an actor, a homeless person, or the President of the United States of America. 

Also, there is no common word for a mixed-race person in most of the U.S. In some Caribbean countries, he might be known as ""Creole,"" depending upon his features and complexion. 

**People only ever ask about this in the context of a black/white person who has achieved something great. It's never asked about the poor or the criminals, or those common people who struggle... a great many of them are of mixed ancestry, and they are just called black without any question.**

We have to be careful.&&One drop in the bucket rule. It is a thing.&&It goes back to slavery, see: [the one drop rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule). &&Slavery. Mixed white/black children born to slaves were considered black as to provide more slaves and disallow the ""freeing"" of children born to female slaves.

This has extended to the modern day, though people will claim it's because most mixed people tend to favor their black half, like Peele or Obama. Which does factor in.&&Hypodescent (or the one-drop rule) is the notion that anyone with a single drop of ""black blood"" is categorically black and not white. Historically, hypodescent was enforced to maintain the distinction between slaves (blacks) and slavers (whites). It prevented an in between category that would have challenged the slave system. Believe it or not, hypodescent was practiced by the US government until 2000. It is no longer a federal practice, but people still use it as an individual practice. &&Don‚Äôt confuse race with ethnicity. There‚Äôs no scientific basis for what constitutes ‚Äúrace‚Äù.

A long while back Joe Rogan and Hannibal Buress I think we‚Äôre talking about Amy Schumer‚Äôs show being accused of stealing an idea for a sketch. It was brought up that there are a lot of similar ideas in comedy and it can be hard to be completely original. They said with Key and Peele though they could never be accused of stealing something because all of their skits are so original and creative. And it‚Äôs true, all of their skits touched on such unique ideas.&&Sketch comedy is always hit and miss, and those misses take a lot of effort to write.&&I agree, they were extremely well-written and even the ones that I didn't like, upon further review, I realized was because they took the joke just a tad bit too far. But it certainly wasn't due to poor writing, acting, or comedic timing. Those things were always A1 even in the ""lesser"" skits.

&&I didn‚Äôt feel like it was preachy at all, which is one of the things I appreciated&&I feel like the commentary was being telegraphed the whole movie.  Maybe this was a real eye opener for people who don't get out much but I think their sketches are more profound and in a tenth of a the running time.&&Maybe that‚Äôs why they kept voting on if they ‚Äúliked‚Äù someone/thing. They talk about adoring DDL, but then hating his character in Phantom Thread, so they couldn‚Äôt vote for him. Uh, yes! Yes you could! That shows his acting ability. If you love a person but hate a character they played, they‚Äôve done a great job.

This voter pissed me off. &&Probably why this voter didn't understand Get Out at all. Or why The Post is relevant in 2017. This is an octagenarian white female who grew up in the Jim Crow era, she literally has no connection at all to the present time&&It was a she, and how she managed to become a voter on the academy awards is beyond me. Look no further than this person abstaining for sound mixing and editing to determine that they have no place in the academy. 

>Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing
I really don‚Äôt understand the difference between the two, so I pass. My Vote: I abstain.

That is ridiculous. This person is unbelievably incompetent in film, as well, look at their criticism of Daniel Day-Lewis...

>Next out was Phantom Thread‚Äôs Daniel Day-Lewis, who I absolutely adore, but God, did I hate his character ‚Äî there wasn‚Äôt one thing likable about the guy, which isn‚Äôt Daniel's fault, but I couldn‚Äôt get past it.

You couldn't get past the idea that a character made to be unlikeable... is unlikeable despite a a tremendous performance from the actor. The category isn't best ""Best Character"" It's ""Best Actor"". If anything that's more reason for you to prefer DDL.

A lot of what she wrote reads like something a ditsy blonde played by Anna Faris would say.

Both are biracial but J Cole is the one pretty much seen as black while Logic isn‚Äôt.&&Or just black. Generally, that is how certain members of my family view it. &&It's all about ""passing"" and it's interesting to see that a very antiquated and arguably racist mentality persists today, even if it's subconscious. &&So, as a half-black person, let me expand on this.

It's not about ""favoring"" your black half. It's that you can't deny it even if you wanted to. If someone walked up to me and I told them I was white, they'd ask me what I'm mixed with because I'm obviously not just white. It's easier to just say black or mixed. &&And you're confusing ethnicity with skin color. Bob Marley is not African-American like Peele.&&I think you might be confusing scientific classification with anthroplogic definions.

The whole movie was a critique on race, specifically a commentary on modern white progressives and the microaggressions they display towards black people.

Seriously, a portion of the country is shouting ""Four More Years!"" to a president that openly calls other countries shitholes. The fact that this sort of racism used to be part for the course makes this article no surprise.

&&Critic doesn't seem all too concerned with really looking beyond the surface value of movies imo.

What he said though, was completely obnoxious. The critic is outwardly oblivious on being black in the United States.

There are other interpretations than it being a mockery of the way some non-black folks, even supposedly liberal ones, fetishize black people and look at them through a lens full of stereotypes rather than seeing them as actual people?

To say they played the race card is an understatement-- of course they did, but I'd argue that the producers deserved to play it since that's what the film was about.

&&Good. Fucking. Riddance.

The biggest open secret in Hollywood for a long time was how gross and predatory the Weinsteins were. Bob has escaped the scandal thus far. But to think that he wasn't complicit in Harvey's bullshit is to be disgustingly na√Øve.

They championed films that no one else would. Netflix has been more than willing to take up that mantle.  Difference is that the Weinsteins cut those films to shit, i.e. to their own liking.

Netflix is giving their filmmakers creative control. And they are championing filmmakers that no one else is willing to take a risk on (Duncan Jones comes to mind). And they don't require you to fuck them to get your movie produced.
 
TL;DR: I am glad that the Weinstein Company wasn't bailed out. Netflix is an example of a company that is picking up their slack without the authoritarian bent.&&Guess this sort of thing happens if your founder is a slathering rape-beast. Hopefully some of the money goes towards building very strong walls around Harvey Weinstein.&&While I completely understand how things got to this point, it's still sad to see the demise of the company. Mirimax's films defined my early movie-watching days, and to a lesser extent, The Weinstein Company.&&coincidentally, I just finished Inglorious Basterds. What a film

Oh and fuck Harvey Weinstein&&Make a movie about it&&On his Birthday of all days bahahaha &&Thought they were continuing under a new name. Meaning this 'bankruptcy' is perhaps meant to publically kill the 'left-overs', while the rest has been placed under a different company.&&how many will lose their jobs&&I don‚Äôt condone what Harvey did, but damn this sucks for the company itself. As I‚Äôve grown up with a few films that were distributed by it, I can‚Äôt help but feel down for them. &&Harvey Weinstein is one guy.
It'd be pretty sad if the whole company went under, just because of the actions of one person.
&&People who are celebrating this probably don‚Äôt realise that it probably represents moving all assets to remote-controlled entities and fucking over the people who are owed money.

THE SHOW MUST GO ON &&I get the idea of boycotts, but at this point it feels more like petty revenge. It‚Äôs like when someone is shamed out of a job because of an Instagram post, then any new employer is threatened from hiring them.

At some point advocacy has to target the person, and allow our legal system to handle it. The idea people need to worry about paying their mortgages and won‚Äôt be left alone until they‚Äôre permanently jobless seems wrong.

I‚Äôm not defending HW, but I‚Äôm sure a lot of innocent people who had no idea about this are losing their livelihood.&&Boys, it‚Äôs time for a reboot!!!&&So I'm hearing one of two things here:

(1) Weinstein used all of the money in his company to settle out of court with as many women as he could, and now he's bankrupted his company

or

(2) He hasn't seen a day in court yet and is dissolving his company before any of the women he abused can sue him for everything he has. Or put another way.... redirecting his finances into a place that can't be touched through legal proceedings.

Or... I don't know what I'm talking about... which is pretty usual.&&I think it's fucking stupid that this company is going to be ruined now because of one person's terrible actions. Harvey Weinstein is a piece of shit. But hey, Sing Street was still the best film of 2016. Nothing will change that. 

""Hurr durr Harvey Weinstein sucks so I'm never gonna watch any independent film picked up for distribution ever again! Yeah! That'll show him!"" 

If the company changed it's name and continued distributing films, would any of you give a fuck? Of course not. You don't actually care about independent films or distribution. You just see ""Weinstein"" and freak the fuck out. And because of it, this company will eventually go under, and a lot of amazing filmmakers will be fucked as far as distribution.&&Someone has to get rid of all those gooey plants in the office.&&Kinda what happens when your reputation is gone. &&[deleted]&&I Actually feel bad about this.

DECLARE

BANKRUPTCY&&Weinstein produced a lot of good movies. His character, conduct, and private life have nothing to do with the hard work that many directors, actors, and other people put in in the movies he produced. I absolutely hate when other people belittle the work simply because Weinstein himself was involved in a scandal. 

I wonder if people will say that Inception and The Dark Knight are horrible movies if Nolan gets involved in some scandal. &&For those wishing that the company would go insolvent, you need to look at the bigger picture. The Weistein Company has 150 employees, many divisions, and Harvey's brother, Bob, owns a considerable share. If the Weinstein company went out of business, there would be more than just food off the table for one individual. This would impact many families and innocent  individuals. 
I've got a hunch that Harvey would be the least affected by insolvency of his company in terms of a risk struggling financially.  Don't be that person who is okay with a hundred good people suffering just to see one bad person suffer too. &&Why is their business model no longer viable? Really. I'm sure I don't know that much about the film industry but I really have no idea why a company can't keep on producing relatively inexpensive art house films and still make modest profits. &&Exactly. Bankruptcy is not for broke/poor people/companies. &&I honestly can't believe we are still making new movies and TV shows on a regular basis. 

There's has to be something like a million movies out there right now. 

I collect movies. I like and I probably have 200 or so ones I really like on hand. 

Then there Another thousand or so that I know I like that I want for my collection.

Get a personal loan, pay off student loans.

Personal loan should be dischargeable in bankruptcy.

They usually take a look back at previous financial transactions to make sure you aren't trying to do anything shady, so you'd need to maintain that loan for like 18-24 months?

That all seems relatively traceable though.

Alternate method:

Get a *bunch* of credit cards.

Buy a bunch of shit, computers, TVs, a jetski, whatever.

Use the piles of crap for a few months, then sell them. Use the funds from those sales to pay off student loans.

Basically, if your aim is to file bankruptcy (and therefore trash your credit), then the aim is to pre-emptively trash your credit in a way that it doesn't look like you're doing it to intentionally pay off a specific debt (as my understanding is that the courts can basically ""reverse"" a payment if they deem that it unfairly favored one creditor over another.&&[deleted]&&Those movies are still great and I will forever hold them in the same esteem.

There's two different kinds, one where you have exhausted all your spendable money and so now the gov is either going to force you to sell your stuff to raise money, or decides that basically all of your assets have been tapped and the collectors are SOL. Then there is ch 11, which is similar to the first half, but with a difference. Basically, it says that you have run out of liquid assets, but you can still cover your debt with illiquid assets, you just need to sell them off. For example, If I had 1 million in cash, 5 million in debt, and 15 million invested in real estate,I could file ch 11 and show that I'm good for the money, I just need some time to sell my properties. This isn't a scheme like tanking the company to buy it with an ""unrelated one"" and dodge debts and taxes if that's the case, and honestly the confusion pops up enough that they may want to consider changing the name.

You should see a few episodes of RedLetterMedia's ""Wheel of the Worst"". Viewers send them old VHS tapes with shitty low-budget movies and they review them.

What you'll come to realize is that even in the 80s, movie/TV content was already in volumes that no person on Earth could see all of them.

Yep.

We need Peter Francis Geraci. &&And in 6 months plus we‚Äôll see a TIL on it &&No duh, they're looking at having to sell their house if they don't file, it's only their second summer home, they can't give that up&&Not really. Bankruptcy is for people and businesses that will fold without assistance, and that can be salvaged. The intention is to keep people from losing everything when the market screws them, and to encourage people to take that risk of starting a business by providing a safety net of sorts should it go tits up. 

Weinstein‚Äôs company is exploiting the system to save money, even though it could survive the situation it is in. &&What I've found is that everything you say is true about pretty much every topic. You generally only notice it when the news happens to report on something you're an expert on.&&Read a news article covering something in your field of expertise.  Note how much of it is wrong.  Realize that is not unusal, that is how much is wrong in all news articles.  &&As a fellow lawyer, welcome to the land of fake news.&&You absolutely shock me that people will bullshit about the law.

Next you'll tell me mainstream journalism publications aren't to be trusted when they discuss scientific journal articles and medicine, and then I'll know you're a horrible person!&&I‚Äôm a very left wing person but I have to say the left is definitely far worse for attacks on legal procedures and independence of the judiciary than the right &&That‚Äôs because any idiot with a keyboard and an internet connection can be a ‚Äújournalist.‚Äù It used to be incredibly expensive to produce and distribute mass communications and there were actual fact checkers and editors to avoid disgraceful ‚Äúreporting.‚Äù But, when you peg your revenue to eyeballs and emotion, you get shit reporting/propaganda.&&I can feel your pain. 

I'm no attorney, but I've been exposed to several medium-large chp 11 bankruptcies and there's an impressive amount of nuance involved in pulling them off. It's always a fascinating topic and I give massive props to the folks that guide companies through those processes. &&Yeah, you'll see this problem whenever you have journalists covering anything related to law/accounting/most of economics. The people writing these articles aren't lawyers, they're journalists who spend a day googling the subject so they feel like they know what to say.&&I think anyone with even a modest amount of professional or academic training in a field feels this way when their subject is in the news. &&Not necessarily. If, for instance, they go through with a 363 sale they‚Äôll expose the company to some form of court-sponsored auction. While they‚Äôll have a stalking horse bidder, the most knowledgeable potential bidder and the one friendliest to the debtor/equity, it‚Äôll still run the risk of third party bidders. Considering the Weinstein Co. has a lot of valuable film assets/IP, you could see some of these potential bidders with a lot of money arise (private equity, film studios, streaming services). If they‚Äôre end up being the successful bidders, equity will lose control. 

That‚Äôs all speculation as to potential interest in a sale, and could be moot if they instead try to simply do a plan of reorganization, but it shows bankruptcy isn‚Äôt as cut and dry as it may seem. &&> Well, right. My point is that the ""loophole"" is the proceedings themselves. Do it right, have enough cash and assets when you begin along with a good lawyer, and you can come out nice and rosy.

As someone who works in the PE space (my shop in particular has two primary funds, one focused on growth capital and the other in distressed/restructuring)... trust me, companies and their external counsel don't have shit on distressed shops that restructure debt for a living.  

The creditors are 10/10 with the upper hand in a restructuring.  Even 2nd liens aren't going to take a haircut without equity holders sacrificing a significant amount of control (usually by 2nd liens converting into/diluting equity and becoming majority holders).  ""Coming out nice and rosy"" is more like, you now own 25% of the company that you used to own 100% of.&&I have no proof but when I see something with 30k upvotes on something like r/movies I just assume it's sponsored. &&Your dividend, sir.&&Or trying to make it in the entertainment industry :(&&Why stop at faking it? *Laughs nervously*&&Did you apply for an income based repayment plan? &&I think you missed something. Your payments aren't lowered on the forgiveness plan. They're income based, which is significantly higher than the lowest cheapest option.&&I believe you can have your payments lowered if you are an income based repayment plan? &&Yes, I agree.

This was not meant to be taken as serious advice. 

I figured the fact that it advised trashing your own credit, and deceptively abusing bankruptcy laws kinda made it self evident that I was not seriously advising doing those things. &&Well, I mean yeah, student loans aren't dismissable by bankruptcy, so it's gonna take some shady dealings. 

I figured my up-front disclaimer that I'm not American, and was just spitballing was clear enough for someone to understand that I wasn't trying to give actual financial/legal advice lol. &&Debt transfer?&&I never said it had to be a good loan. 

Maybe an assload of Payday loans?

Hell, assuming you earn enough that you put *any* money towards student loans, you could probably approach a bank and basically say ""I hate my current situation, I want to consolidate all my loans into 1 lump sum - I currently pay $X per month - can you help me?"" And I'm sure they would at least consider your application and how theoretically viable it would be for them to issue the consolidation loan. 

I hear plenty of stories of people in the US who are crippled by debt on top of having large student loan bills - go get money however those people were getting money - apply for shitty loans and whatnot. 

If the plan is to go bankrupt and not pay back most/all of the loan, then all that really matters is that you get a loan. The terms don't really matter as you'll never be paying them back. &&Then my argument (probably) does not apply to him. I haven't thought about it enough.&&...and put many of those artists through hell (see: Salma Hayek)&&I think it depends on context.

American History X, for example, would be uncomfortable to watch were Ed Norton discovered to be an actual neo-nazi&&I think it is more of a concern when the person is still actively profiting from the works.  Also, sometimes the subject matter is just tainted by what the creator does.  For example, I don't know if I would be able to read a Marion Zimmer Bradley book since the nature of her crimes came to light because of how sexuality is such a major theme.  &&I think the ‚Äúthis movie will never be the same‚Äù thing is more tied to actors/actresses. It‚Äôs hard to see Cosby as the loving father figure when you know about everything that‚Äôs come out about him. Movies work hard to get viewers to suspend disbelief and buy into the characters. If a person is outed as doing terrible things, that‚Äôs harder to distance from their character in the movie. &&It can reframe the material in a way that changes how it lands on an audience.

Luckily in the Weinstein case, being the money behind the film doesn't really mean a lot to the actual product we see so it's very easy to still enjoy the movies.&&Roman Polanski got standing ovations long after he drugged and sodomized a girl.&&> Yeah I never agreed with the whole ""fuck that person's movies""/""this movie will never be the same"" 

Sometimes, though, their work isn't the same after learning who they were. For instance, The Cosby Show was a massive part of my childhood, as was Cosby's standup, but I cannot watch/listen to any of it anymore as all I can think about is how much of a monster he was all that time. To a lesser extent, it's like that with Spacey, too, though as he wasn't usually playing a wholesome character, it's not as hard. I can still appreciate just how good of an actor he was in those films, but I can't deny the impact that these allegations/actions had on all their work. It's much easier for producers/filmmakers who we never see on the screen, as it's easier to separate them from the work.&&What about all the movies that had actresses in them that Weinstein assaulted? They likely wouldn't exist in their current form if not for the fear of Weinstein's retribution. These movies, while they still might be great in substance, are definitely tainted in my eyes.&&And also, I sometimes wonder where this leaves us with artists we've known were scumbags to women for years but still liked their work anyways.  Like, half the rock stars that still have their music playing on the radio treated women like shit, and there's plenty of rappers who have done other terrible things.  If someone came out and said that Steven Tyler objectified women, the reaction would just be ""no shit"" and he'd still have his Super Bowl commercial.  Dr. Dre beat women in his past and everyone still wears his headphones.    &&That said, Kevin Spacey‚Äôs scandal tanked Baby Driver‚Äôs chances at the Oscars.&&This is how I view Kevin Spacey. He might be a shit person, but good damn his work is amazing.&&While I normally agree with you, I have met people who cannot separate the art from the artist. The biggest example being the guy from the band Lost Prophets who ended up fucking babies. &&[deleted]&&It's difficult to separate the art from the artist. Just like it's difficult to separate the product from the company. And I'm sure everyone has or will refuse to do business with a company at some point in their lives regardless of whether their product would be beneficial. You vote with your dollars every day in every situation. Why should movies be different?&&For me it's easier to enjoy these movies because so many other people worked to make them great and Weinsten himself is kinda behind the scenes. With stuff like Kevin Spacey and Ian Watkins from Lostprophets i find it a lot harder to view their work objectively as they're so much more in focus. &&> But can you really look at them, the same?

No. I can't. I obviously hold the *person* in a different esteem.

But the opinion I have of their *works* does not change. The message the cosby show conveyed don't magically become false simply because the lead actor wasn't practicing the same values.&&Maybe. But that's not what I'm discussing. I'm talking about past works that come out after the world finds out the artist's true nature. I already watched and indulged in the work. I love it. I'm not going to pretend now that I never did. And knowing something new about an artist changes nothing in regards to the quality I already admitted the work has. It's also true that Polanski's new movies could actually be masterpieces. We consider Spacey's movies to be great. He was past his incident with his victim when they were made. Therefore it's still possible that new works are, indeed, quality pieces of art. I'm not seeking them in order to support him, though.

The only real thing we should discuss is whether or not to allow them to continue making movies. One would argue that it's inappropriate to let them profit by virtue of them being a baddie that we dont like. Ok, take their profits and give it to victim charities if that helps stroke your justice/revenge boner. Can't it be argued that the world would lose artistic opporotunity if we blacklist them?

Usually, the guilty are imprisoned anyway. Polanski's tremendously lucky he gets to continue producing his works.&&Thanks, I KNEW it was too pure to be made by those sinister cons!!! <3&&Mia Wallace was.&&The Weinsteins left Miramax over disagreements with Disney.

There was a recent situation in (I think) Australia where a government funded artist was forced to change their work because it was too anti-government or controversial or something like that - I‚Äôd hate to see that happen in America.

Yes it's true. Many of us are told by editors to keep it simple stupid or at least keep technical details out of it. This is because 80% of readers don't read anything beyond the first or second sentence. Editors are scared to allow too much technical information into an article because they believe (almost rightly, I'll add) that no one will tolerate boring yet correct information. 

Readers share some of the blame, as do the journalists and editors.

&&Payday loans might work.

A ton from a ton of places, get as many as you can as fast as you can and never pay a dime. Ignore everything, pay of student loan at a large rate as fast as possible. Eventually get served, declare bankruptcy.

The nature of payday loans is to trap you/to have a certain failure rate.

I watched Lucky Louis probably three times. 

Now most of it just comes off as creepy to me.&&Wow, I never knew of the accusations against Bradley and her defending her pedo husband within their respective fan bases. I could see how it's easier to defend reading  a book rather than watching  a film as there is no visual connection with the person, though I do think, any royalties if they are convicted should go to their victims or a charity. I don't  think there is a perfect answer, everyone should judge the work and if they want to consume it on their own beliefs. &&Yeah Cosby was a bit different, for instance, because he *is* his product. It's harder to enjoy a show that was basically about his wholesome home life when you know he's a creep.&&I think people have a hard time with the movies because there could be an actor who was violated in order to get the role.&&I don't wear his headphones. It's really not hard to opt out of this shit.&&Even named them Beats after what he did to Dee Barnes at that club &&You do realize that ""objectifying women"" is not the same as raping, beating, or even sexually harassing women, right? So yeah, if an artist I liked was ""outed"" as objectifying women, that might not be such a big deal for me. It could simply mean he prefers to have sex with groupies rather than maintain a monogamous relationship - because, yes, he sees women as sex objects, but it only manifests in a sex vs relationship manner. It doesn't necessarily mean he's telling his assistant to blow him daily. And as long as the women having sex with him are informed, consenting adults who know he just wants a one-night stand, then I couldn't care less if he's ""objectifying"" women.&&On the other hand, should their punishment be for life? There are a lot if variables in that question, but I tend to think not - especially when someone's offense is more or less ""being shitty."" But even people with more serious scandals in their past should, I think, at least have the freedom to try to re-enter society.  We, of course, are free to reject that effort - both individually and collectively. I just can't bring myself to be mad at Chris Brown, for example, for wanting to be a musician again - even if I will never personally have anything to do with him or his music.&&Did it have any chance at the oscars from the beginning?&&Probably my favorite movie last year&&There's heinous, and then there's *heinous*. &&Youre also supporting the hundreds of people that worked their asses off to make that movie and bring home a paycheck to their families. While I completely agree that continuing to give money to shitty people sucks, it's literally how our world works. Show me one thing you consumed today that was completely ethically sourced and made. It wont happen. Instead of focusing on the small part of these movies that taints them, instead, watch the credits scroll past at the end and look at all the other people that just wanted to make good movies.&&> rewarding them for their behavior

That's definitely a stretch. If they cheated their way to their position, maybe. But if they assaulted someone at a party, I fail to see how that connects in any way&&I agree with your point to a certain extent but it's really difficult for me personally to watch something created by someone who turned out was a shitty person.

I used to watch the Cosby Show growing up and now there's no way I could watch an episode without the thought of Cosby sexual abusing someone at the front of my mind.

Same goes for Louis even though the things that he did weren't nearly as bad.  Watching his stand-up is impossible for me because he'll joke about masturbation and I'll immediately have think of the shitty situation he put his fellow comics in when he started masturbating in front of them.

For actors like Kevin Spacey it's not as bad.  I can watch something like American Beauty or Baby Driver and enjoy it just as much as I used to.  I was never a House of Cards fan but I'm sure watching that is a bit tough for some people.

Separating the artist from the art almost impossible when the art is that person performing.  For directors and authors it's a lot easier to still enjoy the art because you don't have to see them, but for actors and comedians it's in your face and you have a constant reminder that the person is not who you thought they were.&&you sort of had me till ""Ok, take their profits and give it to victim charities if that helps stroke your justice/revenge boner.""

so then you argue for artistic value, 

""Can't it be argued that the world would lose artistic opporotunity if we blacklist them?"" 

sure, we might lose artistic opportunity, who cares? weighed even against the suffering of one individual I'd deprive the world of the pianist, a polanski film, fuck it, it's just some fucking meatbags on film pretending to be in misery versus someone actually facing hell, so yeah art can go fuck itself if it means less people get raped.&&They just kinda slide into place &&A fool and his money are soon parted.  But if it's enough money, the fool hires slippery accountants and lawyers to hide said fool's money.  Fool claims to be smart.  Fool runs for president.&&Milking a cow for every drop and then butchering it when it runs dry is not a bad strategy at all.  &&And the funny thing is that searching for that GUID doesn't turn up that article.&&What are you guys saying?&&In a way it is.

How are the re-recorded vocals an improvement? &&>For the record, I think Countdown to Extinction is superior to Rust in Peace. (Pls don't fight me)

I *strongly* agree with you.  That album is nothing short of spectacular.&&The counter argument would be that classical performing arts are less profitable than most popular performing arts but are often more expensive to produce. The NEA in theory would help with that. (Does it actually in practice? I have no idea)&&I'm not sure evidence of a substantial art scene isn't evidence that it wouldn't be more substantial with more government funding. The truth is, we only have a small example of the impact of substantial government funding would be in the US--the arts programs that were created during the New Deal. 

My background is in theatre, so I feel most comfortable talking about the Federal Theatre Project. It only lasted a few years, but had a huge impact on the development of theatre in the US. It focused on developing new work and new styles, and it set an important precedent that theatre can be *accessible*. FTP companies all around the country were performing children's theatre, performing shows in hospitals, and performing shows that were socially and politically relevant to their communities. There were even African-American theatre troupes, which probably would have been struggling for funding otherwise in the 1930s.

The FTP had a huge artistic and cultural impact, and it wasn't even supposed to; it was literally just created to put jobless theatre people back to work during the depression. I think putting that level of money into the arts today would certainly increase the diversity and accessibility of the type of work that's being done.&&There is a connection between progress of a society and progress in the arts.

It's just so much of his comedy material ends up not being as funny because it comes across as ""guy who knows better still behaves like a shithead"". Ends up kind of killing the joke because the audience typically thinks (without actually thinking about it) ""this is funny because he wouldn't actually act that way so we're getting a hyper realized version of reality."" And it strips away that barrier of someone *saying* something fucked up vs actually *doing* something fucked up.&&[deleted]&&That's a fair point. I guess I'm of the opinion that the person suffered for their art so I'm not going to, post-revelation, be creeped out by their actual performance knowing they got taken advantage of. It's like why a lot of filmmakers leave in as much footage as they can from their stunt people who get hurt or even die on set. Like, they suffered for that take so you gotta use it.

I just pushed up both sides with my fingers.&&:(&&There are always loopholes in legislation, but, not necessarily, grammar. 

well enough*&&Back in the day, being a pilot was a prestigious job, and they made a lot of money and got big pensions.  Now, the business is way more cutthroat and pilots are more like glorified uber drivers.  Airlines filed chapter 11 bankruptcy in the early 2000s to eliminate their pensions owed to pilots, among other things.  &&Not only don't they read the second sentence, they don't even read the first.&&Exactly. The lawyer was complaining about journalists twisting facts in order to push their agenda and generate outrage. Not about simplifying articles, but about actually writing this that are flat out wrong.&&That is actually how newspaper style writing is supposed to be done. First few sentences just say the main subject of what you are trying to get done. Then as you scroll down, more and more detail is revealed.

Let me take a random Nytimes article for instance, [from today's front page](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-alex-stamos.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news).

The first sentence is its own paragraph:

""As Facebook grapples with a backlash over its role in spreading disinformation, an internal dispute over how to handle the threat and the public outcry is resulting in the departure of a senior executive.""

then the second paragraph:

""The impending exit of that executive ‚Äî Alex Stamos, Facebook‚Äôs chief information security officer ‚Äî reflects heightened leadership tension at the top of the social network. Much of the internal disagreement is rooted in how much Facebook should publicly share about how nation states misused the platform and debate over organizational changes in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, according to current and former employees briefed on the matter.""

This second paragraph is simply a more substantial summary. The rest of the article gets even more in depth in case you still want to read!&&Because hes a journalist, he doesnt read either.&&Wastes money on ink?

Heh just kidding, but not really. There‚Äôs just not enough readers in the world interested in the nitty gritty to completely support, financially, these kinds of journals. 

&&Because a click is a click, and news organizations are getting on by the skin of their teeth. All that time a journalist is putting into the nitty gritty details that <5% of the readership will actually read could be spent researching, interviewing for, and writing another article to get clicks, and thus, ad revenue.

It honestly does not matter to a news organization's bottom line if people with short attention spans don't read a single word as long as they click and the page registers that someone has seen the ads on the page. The news is (unfortunately) a business, and every dollar, every ad, every click counts.

This is why listicles and Buzzfeed-esque lists have become so popular: faster to produce and more pages = more clicks.&&You can, but you might have to pay a bit extra for it!

FT, The Economist, NYT, The Times, The Guardian etc have all got subscriber content that's really detailed. But it can't be supported by ads alone.

I love Kevin Spacey as an actor, despite recent occurrences.

I loved Lostprophets as a band, but the news put a stop to that.

&&Chris Brown has some of the catchiest hooks in modern pop, but I‚Äôll be damned if I get caught dead listening to him.&&It's an odd discussion right now, given that those who profit most greatly from paying for these things are those we don't want to give money to but we're also depriving those who make less and need what we can give them.

Complicated subject. &&I hope Louis gets to come back. The thing about his allegations is that there was never, seemingly, any firm ""no"" or a definite lack of consent. I mean what he did is pretty weird and wrong, and definitely an abuse of his position and power, but lumping him in with men like Weinstein and Spacey isn't right. If this stuff had come out at any other time, I don't think the public response would have been quite as severe. And on top of that, he seems genuinely remorseful. Most of this stuff has already impacted his life. For example, he deserves to be divorced because what he did is  shitty to his relationship. But that stuff has already happened, you know? I just think he deserves a second chance.&&The saddest part about CK is that he made it pretty clear that he understood what he did wrong and seemed to have cut it out. The problem was that he let the accusations linger as rumors for years. If he'd owned up to it and apologized to his victims when he got his head straight instead of when they went public he might have been fine depending on how forgiving the women were. Instead the women had to talk about it in hushed voices and have their abuse compounded.&&That's not how forget-me-nows work. &&What you just say?

thank you for the response&&Actually, I find that most people don't read the first sentence even. &&Yeah, I deleted their music after his hensious crimes came to light.  I'd seen them perform a few times lives as well - I felt weird for a while after.

I feel sorry for the other band members because they genuinely seemed to know nothing about his actions.

I loved that band back in the early 2000‚Äôs and not too long ago picked up a physical copy of the first album. Then looking through reddit comment sections, found out what really happened to that band. &&Yeah, I guess it's kind of personal as well, like, I know someone that has a history with sexual abuse and she completely cuts out of her life any artists/actors or I guess just people in general she finds out to be abusers.

Because it resonates with her story and when she sees someone like that it makes her think of the poor person he or she abused, it's not a trigger it's just heightened empathy for that type of story.&&Yeah man I wish I could still listen to them...

The second camera handlers isnt going to get the cut of the profit from me going to the movies. They‚Äôre the ones probably needing the money most. The asshole directors or company owners get the profit. When the movie is released im guessing everyone who needs the money aka the ones with low paying jobs has already been paid. Cmiiw.&&Idk about all that. I'm just saying it wasn't surprising.

That's patently false. Deadpool has a lot of great stories that fall on the more serious and dramatic side of things.&&It itself isn't a game changer, but its existence and success definitely is. For a long time, Hollywood has seemed reluctant to market any kind of R-Rated property on a wide, multi demographic scale, outside of raunchy teen comedies, and even those started to peter off. Definitely not a superhero IP. Then Deadpool comes along and breaks a dozen different records, which demonstrates to the studios that the PTA groups aren't gonna burn down their building if they start allowing directors to shoot for R occasionally, rather than trimming everything down to appease the PG 13 crowd. 

Hopefully, it also taught them to give their directors some creative freedom as well - Deadpool succeeded not (solely) because it was raunchy, but because it was original and different from the existing competition. But that may be asking too much. The Hard R Gritty Caillou reboot is just weeks away from being announced, I'm sure. &&It's already earned more money than Justice League. &&She's listed as ""Copycat"" in the credits, so I think more interesting things are in store for her in the movie. &&She's also trolled him back a few times, only time I remember was a man crush monday post or something and it was Ryan Gosling instead of Reynolds&&He probably got some help scaring Bandhoo into staying quiet.&&Friendship ended with Bandhoo, now deadpool is my best friend.&&You mean the blood from the carpet in his trunk?&&Hard to say. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. &&Thank God.  Creative control is such a big reason for the success of Deadpool, and Ryan appears to see and know how Fox has fucked the franchise.  &&Ryan is smarter than I look.&&Isn't that how he fell out with Tim Miller who wanted it to be much larger scale this time round?&&Lol, typical studio thinking. The first one was so profitable with x million dollar budget. Maybe if we put 2x million in it it will be twice as profitable. &&I'm sure Fox is super excited for a a new successful franchise, but you have to be out of your mind to think having a $250 million budget is reasonable for a movie slated to release 3 weeks after Infinity War and a week before Solo.

Edit: I'm not arguing which will be better or what will make more money guys, so stop with the ""Solo looks bad LOLOL"" crap. The release strategy is what I'm talking about.

> After surviving a near fatal bovine attack, a disfigured cafeteria chef (Wade Wilson) struggles to fulfill his dream of becoming Mayberry's hottest bartender while also learning to cope with his lost sense of taste. Searching to regain his spice for life, as well as a flux capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship, and flavor - finding a new taste for adventure and earning the coveted coffee mug title of World's Best Lover.

The reason why Deadpool left the guns in the cab was because they couldn't get funding to do a giant shooting scene at the end. &&That's a backhanded compliment if I ever saw one.&&Basically what happened was Tim Miller got his CGI Studio, Blur, to do the beginning of the film for basically free in exchange they were supposed to use Blur exclusively for the sequel. Then the movie made more money than any other X Film in history and Reynolds decided that the low budget and total control was crucial to the success of the franchise. &&If it pays off, certain executives are getting x million dollar bonuses.&&They make this joke in 22 Jump Street, there's a lot of meta humor in that movie.&&Specially when they didn't have any faith in the first one and Ryan had to wait so long to make it. 

Studios really don't know jack shit when it comes to creativity. Which is why so many of them failed and bailed from my country. They lost huge money thinking the same thing.&&Reminds me of 22 Jump Street and the running gag about sequels they keep talking about in terms of catching the dealer the same way. ""do the same thing you did last time, that worked.""&&> I'm sure Fox is super excited for a a new successful franchise, but you have to be out of your mind to think having a $250 million budget is reasonable for a movie slated to release 3 weeks after Infinity War and a week before Solo.

True while at the same time showing they completely misunderstood what made the first one so successful.&&Big money comes with strings and those strings are generally tied to very stupid people. You don't want stupid people in a creative position with power over the production.  &&Less budget means less to lose when it goes up against 2 of the biggest movies of the year. Terrible time to release this movie. They need to wait til after solo or release before infinity war.&&The bigger the investment, the more control they are going to want.&&Deadhard.

**Francis:** Are you here on business, sir?  
**Wick:** I'm afraid so, Francis. [pause] Why don't you take the night off?  
**Francis:** [Takes off his earpiece, turning around] Thank you, Mr. Wick. [walks away]  

Such a great scene that says so much with so little dialog.  We know Wick and Francis have worked together.  He knows him well enough to see the weight loss. But they aren't close friends or Francis wouldn't be so nervous.  Yet Francis, played by 6'10"" tall, 300 lbs. Kevin Nash knows so clearly he is outclassed by Wick.  His body language shows he had no intention of trying to fight because he knows he would lose.

Just a great scene that establishes the world, the scene to come and the character of John Wick in less than a minute of screen time.

One of the lines that stuck out the most to me wasn't one of the countless jokes, but Wade in the doctor's office: ""Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z... Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face, like it's the first time I'm seeing it... or the last.""&&THAT'S RIGHT, I remember it better now.&&Anyone have a link? That is hilarious lol&&I‚Äôd love to see that as a little 15 minute short tbh. Deadpool and friends trying to Shawshank Dopinder out of jail.&&Bet it felt huge in his hands&&Important to remember it wasn't just him, but Tim Miller as well. His goal of doing Deadpool was a huge motivation for him to lead the visual design of Scott Pilgrim. 

Yet for some reason him and Ryan had a falling out over this movie. &&Imagine if they'd had *this* Deadpool in *that* movie, though?  He would have outshone... anything and everything about that film.  I can **almost** understand why they made him mute, if for no reason other than Reynolds would have been the highlight of that film.

Swords out of his arms?  I've got nothing for that, though...&&The second time, the first time it was always in the script.&&Curious, do you have a source on that?

Cause if I recall they still had a shit ton of explosions and gunfire and a fucking aircraft carrier falling over. Can't see how him having guns would put them that much more over budget.&&not if hes ass ugly&&That‚Äôs a shame because Blur are absolutely amazing, I‚Äôm sure the collaboration wouldn‚Äôt have hurt. &&Yeah, I know everyone loves latching onto the ""Tim Miller wanted to sell out Deadpool 2, Ryan Reynolds wanted to keep it cool and cheap"" but it really seems like Tim Miller got fucked here. I also don't think it's even true (this trailer has TONS of expensive choreography and CGI in it).&&It seems like good will on both sides. Here's how I can see it happening. 

Tim Miller cares primarily about the bigger picture and ambition. He wants to go full budget and show everyone what both him and Reynolds can do, potentially setting a precedent for further blockbuster scale projects, even more Deadpools. He maybe also, or even just, wants to risk the studio control so they can be more ambitious on this project as far as set pieces, length, etc.  

Reynolds cares primarily about Deadpool, and what's worked. He wants to keep the budget smaller in order to minimize studio interference and retain the creative control that made the first movie successful.  He wants to play it safer with the scale of the movie, keeping the set pieces more down to earth, keeping the length shorter, etc. This may also just be in keeping with his vision of his own Deadpool: it serves to foreground the character rather than the plot. &&That beginning was a solid 11/10. It's a shame Miller got the shaft after holding up his end of it. I assume there was compensation? &&X gon give it to ya&&I prefer 22 JS to 21 JS purely for that reason. It's incredibly self-aware&&> NUMBER ONE GOOD ON LOW BUDGET, NUMBER TWO BE GREAT ON BIG BUDGET

&&About the size of a KFC spork. &&The size of your budget doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs how you use it.&&Miller wanted a high budget super hero movie.

Not Reynolds. &&I find it amazing how quickly fans turned on Miller, given that he was a major driving force behind the success of the first one. In my honest opinion, the action set pieces were the best part of the first movie, way more so than the Waypool humor which is usually hot or miss.
Edit: Cmon guys it was a slip of the thumb. I and O are right next to each other.&&Can you expound on the Scott Pilgrim factor? Link?&&Barakapool&&Fun Fact : Because the Wolverine Origins script was so bad, Reynolds improvised all of his lines.  Hugh Jackman had to leave during the elevator scene because he couldn't keep a straight face.&&They did have this Deadpool in that movie for two scenes. And he totally stole the film.&&It shouldn't have been the real deadpool. But the point is that there was no need to even have him in the film just to not use deadpool. They should have went with a different character. &&Well it was a wolverine movie and that was their cash cow and they were probably worried about some unknown character crowding out the star attraction. Just imagine if deadpool has been some big obnoxious character in that movie pulling oxygen away from wolverine and deadpools jokes fell flat with audiences?&&Honestly swords out of his arms would have worked for regular DP. I can very clearly imagine him pushing swords through his hands after wolverine takes out his claws while saying 'I can do that too' followed by 'oh god that hurts!' after they come out. 

'Why are we even doing this? We both regenerate. Are we just going to keep cutting each other until we tire out like a fat emo girl?'&&Didn't he also have laser eyes? &&Was it? From what I remember from reading that leaked script (other than being shocked how informal it all looked) was the fight at the end with Colossus vs Kane (replaced with Angel in the actual movie because then they didn't have to CG the cybernetic parts, but Angel Kane is a cute joke) there was a lobby shootout scene that was reminiscent of The Matrix and then Collosus and Kane basically fought so hard the building came down instead of the whole aircraft carrier tipping over thing.

EDIT: They also cut two montages from the movie probably because each little blip is a whole scene that probably costs as much as a full scene for only a few seonds of footage, to anyone interested they are as follows:

* After escaping Deadpool simply tries to kill himself. They play it off as a trailer for a silly movie ""Wade Wilson is... hard.... to... kill"" and with each word a grandiose suicide attempt is shown. (I think crashing a car and jumping from a building are two I remember) I imagine each of these shots, the wounds, and regeneration would have cost a lot which explains why it was cut.
* Angel and Francis are supposed to take over Hellhouse and pick up loads of money picking up the backlog of despicable jobs they wouldn't do. There was supposed to be a gut-wrenching montage of them doing despicable things instead of just being your friendly neighborhood anti-heroes as Hellhouse was portrayed. Also probably cut for budget.&&Be quiet, Deadpool was a small indie masterpiece &&https://www.cbr.com/movie-legends-revealed-why-deadpool-really-lost-his-bag-of-guns/

Damn it m√≥vies you're cool as frick&&The only thing I don't agree with in the analysis is when he assumes Francis is turning around to ""hammer"" wick. If you watch the body language, you can see that he actually relaxes as he turns around.

This would tell me that Francis is shit scared of John, knows that he is out matched and that he is relieved that John isn't there for him as well because the outcome would be grim for Francis.&&Does he kill 60+ people in the club?&&Such an honest, ‚Äúthank you sir‚Äù&&That 'oh' tells you that what Aurelio just said made this Russian mob boss completely forget that the guy he's talking to knocked his son to the ground.

Deadpool is about giving great fun, without trying to be too serious about it, and still deliver a story somewhere under it all. It has expensive CGI and a lot of explosions (seriously, have you seen the first movie??), but without the super expensive over the top and ridiculous expensive and pointless writers, that can keep it both in decent budget and still make it work.

Well we all want smaller suitcases to throw our budget in!&&In the first place, it's not as if 100 million is some low budget indie flick where they have to film in the warehouse with paper-mache sets.&&It does, but nowhere near what Miller wanted. They cut several action sequences for budget reasons. It's why Deadpool forgets his guns at the last showdown.

I've read the original script. It was great, but it gained a lot losing those scenes in favor of more time for the cast to joke around. A lot of the best jokes weren't in the script and a lot of what was in there was derivative or straight up stolen. Like the ""brown pants"" joke that was featured in all the trailers. That joke is really old. It works from Deadpool, but there were too many jokes like that in the original draft. It's pretty clear Reynolds and Miller really punched it up with improv, which they might not have gotten to if they were busy in mocap or action sequences.&&I could see some Weapon X intern fucking up the installation of lasers behind his eyes, that ended up obliterating said eyes every time they activated, and they just left it like that because he can regenerate.

Edit: I'm sorry! I meant Spider-Man not Spiderman. I must have confused him for [Chandler's Friend](https://goo.gl/images/CEn5S3)&&Now they need an Asian super hero movie. &&So why is this movie so successful?  I haven‚Äôt seen it but plan to.  

Is it just that good?  Is it from the support of the black community?  What‚Äôs the deal?&&Movie tickets are so expensive it feels like you're buying vibranium &&This is why I don't understand how DC can keep fucking it up.&&The weird thing about Black Panther is that the film was excellent but the actual Black Panther character in the film is really dull. &&Well, its target audience is domestic.

Edit: a word&&What movies like Wonder Woman & Black Panther have shown is that it isn't JUST that ""diversity equals money"" but that a good plot, with good writing, and good acting ALONG WITH a diverse cast can make tons of money. Diversity is definitely a player in the success of both movies but had they been garbage, neither would have done as well as they have.&&Yeah, I can see that. I live in a majority-black Caribbean country. The movie was sold out here for 3 straight weeks. It was literally impossible to watch unless you purchased your tickets days before. &&Best part of the movie was the son calling out the father for leaving the boy &&Its insane to think that just a little over a decade ago someone would've probably laughed their ass off if you said comics are about to take over the movie industry. &&Glad to see it. Black Panther was a fun movie, hit most of the best spots. Not the best Marvel movie, but definitely far from the worst. Considering the Infinity War trailer had a lot of Black Panther and company in it, I'm going to assume having watched the movie will help people not get lost, too.&&Let's get it, I spent $20 a ticket&&Sad that record is only gonna last a little bit, til infinity war.&&Infinity war said ""hold my beer""&&I don't really think this has anything to do with the quality of Black Panther as a movie. I thought it was pretty good, but besides the soundtrack there was nothing special about it among the MCU movies. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that it's become so heavily politicized. A lot of people are buying tickets just to see what all the fuss has been about.&&Ragnarok was better.&&What an insane run. Nobody would have believed this ~6 months ago.&&For real though why is basically every comment here a passive aggressive criticism.&&Possibly an unpopular opinion but Thor Ragnarok was way better, and Black Panther was mainly supported by the black community. 

It was an okay movie, but nowhere near Dark Knight and Avengers level.&&Went to theatre last night to see Black Panther, every seat sold out.

It managed to be a great film on its own merits and theme and it‚Äôs a shame that all people are talking about is race  regarding the film rather than how good the film was.&&Cinema tickets are expensive as fuck though.&&Good for Black Panther. Personally it was just good for me. Still think winter soldier was better. &&I feel like it's all hype honestly. I watched it after loving the character in Civil War and I thought it was just fine. It's on the same level as Doctor Strange for me. It's not bad, but there are about a dozen other MCU movies I'd rather watch again than this one.

But Disney knew what they were doing. This was an event more than a movie in my eyes.&&[deleted]&&They should make the pink panther to beat that record.&&Oh easily, IW should be setting records unless they screwed up horribly&&Everyone keeps saying this but it seems like the market for IW is just people who are invested in MCU, while black panther is selling repeat tickets to people that wouldn‚Äôt see any other marvel movie. &&I love how the MCU is so far ahead of everyone else that they're going to break their own record twice in a year. &&It will be, rumor has it they are spending a billion on its production. The film is gunna be insane.&&IW is going to smash any record that's out there.  I'm going to do my part 3 times over at least.&&Infinity War has to compete with Deadpool 2 just two weeks after release.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like it came out that long ago.  &&I went to see it a few weeks ago and two tickets in a non-3D theater was twenty eight damn dollars. I don't have much to add to this conversation but I have to bring up how ridiculous it is. 

Edit: to clarify $14 a ticket&&The only reason there's always a new box office record is because of inflation, otherwise it would just be Gone With the Wind lapping the field forever like Wilt Chamberlain on steroids.&&[\*Spider**-**Man](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/137/624/a42.jpg)&&They should use number of tickets sold as a reference, because when this puppy hits the $1 theaters it's going to sell bunches more.&&Much more important metric &&I saw it yesterday and the theater was sold out. It's still crazy popular.&&Was looking for this. I had serious doubt that Black Panther could really get past the hype that was avengers.

4th is still incredible for a superhero that isn't exactly a household name.&&Big Hero 6, but yeah we need another one.&&Prediction: The first Asian lead in a superhero movie will be a race change from a traditionally white character. &&I'll take any major movie with an Asian lead. I was psyched while watching altered carbon on Netflix but then the Asian guy dies and gets transferred into a white body and I was like god damnit so close.&&How about Amadeus Cho? Chinese superman?

Positive press due to the diversity aspect of the film and the fact that is a great standalone marvel film that does NOT require knowledge of previous MCU movies to thoroughly enjoy
  
EDIT: I mispoke, diverse is the wrong word. I meant have an underrepresented group under the spotlight&&I work with a black woman who has never seen a single superhero/comic book film before and she went to see it. I'd say a huge factor would be the black community.&&[deleted]&&Novelty and cultural significance.

It's set in the vastly under explored region of Africa. 

And does not portray large groups of black people as criminals, slaves, oppressed, fighting for civil rights, etc. But in a positive light, and in normal roles. 

Which is unusual. &&As a huge fan of the MCU I thought it was pretty average honestly. The world building was really cool and I liked the social commentary (that‚Äôll be one of the only times you hear me say THAT haha) but the main plot is super bland and the pacing in the second half is weird. I think it‚Äôs getting huge support due to the fact it so accurately represents African cultures which is something we‚Äôve never seen in a superhero flick. 

Edit: I didn‚Äôt mean accurately reflects African cultures, I shoulda said it offers a cool view of it that just feels right. Obviously I‚Äôm not saying that there are Africa countries like Wakanda out there. It just feels like there‚Äôs a lot of tradition behind everything that suits the country really well. &&i know a lot of black people who took their whole family out to see it. this was the first superhero movie that a lot of black people have ever seen. it may just be another marvel movie to some people, but it was culturally significant to a lot of people. 

i'm half black. it's a big deal to me.&&Normal Marvel movie sales + huge cultural lift sales

It was going to do better than the average Marvel movie either way, it's actually a good one on it's own.

But this amazing performance is do to the whole cultural relevance thing going on, you're getting in a crowd that don't really care for super hero movies and they're watching it multiple times.&&It's good, it's Marvel Movie good. It has one of the better villains in the Marvel universe because his motivations aren't only a selfish grab for power, he's still an asshole but at least he's complex.&&While it has been getting a ton of support from the black community, I think it also helps that it is a more ""serious"" take on the subject matter and deals with some more serious themes than many Marvel films. Its quality is more along the lines of Winter Soldier than Thor Ragnarok, if you have seen these other Marvel films.&&Right I went to see Pacific rim at a non 3d non large format showing and it was still over $16 a ticket. I worked at this theater in high school and I remember when I thought $8.50 was a lot. &&Its more like you and me and mostly everyone is poor&&Went last night with the wife - 3:40pm showing, $4.99 tickets due to matinee price. Theater by us is typically $5.99 or $6.99 for non-matinee prices. 

Cinemark is the theater. Highly recommend them if they are in your area. Comfy seats and clean too&&They‚Äôre rushing it because there‚Äôs a chance that after Infinity War, superhero films might start seeing a decline.

DC was trying to force the issue so they could get a chunk of that box office but they totally fucked it up. Hell, they contributed to my personal superhero fatigue, I can imagine others might feel the same as well.&&Hahaha, me either.  I don't get it.  The Nolan Batman series of course , and Wonder Woman are pretty great, but other than that, WTF are they doing?  I had such high hopes for Suicide Squad and Justice League, Batman vs Superman, they were all bad.  Maybe Aquaman will be good?&&He's the straight man in an insanely colorful world. Makes sense to me&&He was much better in Civil War, not sure what happened&&I‚Äôd describe him as thoughtful rather than dull. It‚Äôs definitely a nice change of pace from the Peter Parkers, Peter Quills, and Tony Starks that MCU is famous for.&&100%. Women of Wakanda saved the film.&&Looking back on it you're absolutely right.  Even within the Marvel formula they developed out Killmonger WAY more than T'Challa.

I've been a little upset at how little they've gone into how intelligent T'Challa is.  Literally just the brief mention of ""his"" design of the black panther suit before they show off the new suit, which most people would probably miss.&&It's doing quite well in Africa too.

https://www.npr.org/2018/02/22/587840019/black-panther-sells-out-african-theaters&&They knew it would do well here.  And Europe seems to like it.  Only thing I've heard is killing it is China where they're so indifferent to the cultural connotations and just want more explosions.&&And even if you have both, like Annihilation, it still doesn't equal money necessarily.&&WW is not what i would use as an example of good writing or plot. very good actors and acting thou. you should checkout the animated version if you want a good writing and plot.&&> Diversity is definitely a player in the success of both movies but had they been garbage, neither would have done as well as they have.

Being completely honest, having the Marvel logo at the beginning (and all the hype that entails) is the reason the film took off at all. The rest of it is just what took it to above and beyond.

Even the worst Marvel movies turned massive profits.&&I dont really understand why people like WW so much. The plot was meh, the jokes awful and the visuals standard. 
I liked the theme though.&&I‚Äôm not gonna lie I really didn‚Äôt get the hype for it. I‚Äôd honestly rate it rather middle tier for a Marvel movie - entertaining as they all are, but not necessarily engaging. 

Good acting I‚Äôll give you that, but I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the writing and plot. &&Was Wonder Woman really written well though? It was pretty good but the back half got sloppy. I feel like it benefitted from being simply the first DCEU movie that wasn‚Äôt wholly terrible. &&Good writing 

Um.

Edit: I thought the movie was perfectly fine. No more, no less. &&I just love that Marvel goes in different directions thematically with each movie. The thought of watching dozens of ""superhero movies"" would feel like it would get repetitive and boring, but Marvel managed to give each their own unique touch, especially more recently. You got Thor: Ragnarok with the retrowave 80's aesthetic, and Black panther with the afrofuturism. You got movies like GotG that are far more light hearted and comedic, while others are much more serious and action focused.

Each one has its own personality and that's what made Black Panther so great.&&I'd give it a solid B+.  It beats about Thor 1 and 2, Iron man 2 and 3, but loses to Cap 2, Iron man 1, Doc Strange 1 and the First Avengers.

Middle of the Pack, but its a damn strong pack.&&In Tecate, M√©xico we pay short of three dollars, 4 if it's 3d. Though you can pretty much scale that to our minimum wage c:&&I feel as though Ragnarok will be rewatchable for a long time&&Agreed. To me black panther is as good as the first Thor when it came out. Fun but not that good&&Ragnarok came out in November, and was followed pretty closely by Justice League.

Black Panther was out in Feb, and had nothing competing with it for ~4 - 5 weeks, if you count A Wrinkle In Time, or Tomb Raider, which just came out, and both of those are being received very poorly.&&Many black geeks believed it.....&&You kidding? It was the first big super hero movie that was predominantly black. And nobody nowadays gives a shit about Blade or remembers it.

Of course it was going to do amazing. 

E: relax guys I didn't say Blade was bad, but it's not as good as demolition man. fight me&&You mean 6 months ago people wouldn't have believed that a Phase 3 Marvel movie would hit a billion?

I call you a liar, sir.&&Really? What world are you living in lmao&&As I was scrolling through, I was thinking the exact same thing. wtf.&&Honestly. Im seeing ppl legit bothered that this movie did better/getting praised over their favorite movie. So they retaliate through passive aggressive go-against-the-grain commentaries. &&You know why &&I share your unpopular opinion. 

I bought 2 tickets to BP because of the hype and unfortunately contributed to the current chest thumping about box office earnings.  

Missed Ragnarok in the theatre though but caught it on a plane and bought the itunes and watched it 3 more times. &&Ragnarok was a glorious parade of increasingly brilliant absurdity.  Definitely 'better' films in the MCU, but i'm not sure any of the others could match the pure joy produced per frame.&&Winter Soldier is still my favorite marvel movie to this point.&&For me plenty of MCU Movies were better. BP was good but TWS, CW, the Avengers, Ragnarok were all more enjoyable&&[deleted]&&This probably says more about the Reddit demographic than anything else.&&Its already breaking records.  If you want a litmus test for how well Infinity War will do in the box office, Black Panther held the record for ticket presales for a Marvel movie until Infinity War tickets tickets went on sale and obliterated that record.  [It only took Infinity War a *mere six hours* to do so](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/17/17133514/avengers-infinity-war-ticket-presales-black-panther-marvel-cinematic-universe-box-office).&&I am equal parts hyped and terrified of IW. It's been a long time since i've been this emotionally invested in a movie before its release.

Edit: Wow, so this is what RIP inbox is like...

A quick thought. I was 12 watching Iron Man with my dad in the theatre. It's been 10 years, an entire decade. I've grown up with these movies, and everything hinges on the next movie. That's a feeling I've never had before.&&Infinity War has stronger competition than Black Panther did (and does). 

IW won‚Äôt get to dominate weeks like BP did, as Deadpool 2 and Solo will come out and take up audience and screens. 

I think IW will gross more globally, but fall short of US domestic.&&Also know as justice league &&Then reason I'm skeptical of that is because there were a lot of non-super hero movie fans that went to see BP to support it. I don't know that those same people will go out to support IW&&This. IW is going to benefit from a GINORMOUS opening weekend that will crush Black Panther‚Äôs because of the Marvel fans but it‚Äôs not going to have anywhere near the staying power of Black Panther, because it attracted people who didn‚Äôt care for superhero movies. &&Agreed. Black Panther appeals to a new demographic as well as an existing one. I don't think infinity war will bring in as many BP viewers as BP did from the MCU. &&It's 500mil for A3 & A4&&And inflation is at record lows currently ~2%. But, over 6years that ~9% makes a big difference when it‚Äôs billions of dollars. 

Edit: corrected figures &&The worst part is that I know *for a fact* that if they lowered ticket prices, I would absolutely spend more than I do now on movies.

EDIT: Haha, to everyone recommending MoviePass I really appreciate it, but it's not available in Canada, and the alternatives aren't nearly as good.

SECOND EDIT: So, a bunch of people are recommending Sinemia and I had honestly never heard of that before. It seems pretty good at first glance, so I might be investing in that. Thanks!

THIRD EDIT: Now it seems people are saying not Sinemia. Because apparently they randomly jack up the prices or something? Oh well. I'll definitely keep looking for alternatives.&&[deleted]&&Tickets here are $12-18 each non-3D, or $18-22 each 3D. I feel your pain. &&There's also way more people in America too. But how much entertainment competition was there for movies back then though? Now you have cable, internet, video games, etc. And you can just wait til the movies come out on redbox, DVD, or TV. Couldn't do that back then&&Dang, you weren't kidding. Gone With the Wind adjusted for today's inflation would be 3.4 billion dollars.&&Gone with the Wind benefited from being re-released multiple times in movie theaters over the decades and adding each release together cumulatively. Give any of these other movies on the list the same treatment and any one of them would have mopped the floor with it&&Hiro was more like a hapa, though. &&That film is set in a fictionalized *California*, not Asia.&&Big Hero 7?&&It'll kind of have to be.  I honestly can't think of any Asian superheros off the top of my head.  I'm sure there are some...but...&&Namor the Sub-Mariner

Who says no?&&And it will make a bazillion dollars&&> The first Asian lead in a superhero movie will be a race change from a traditionally white character.

[Hulk.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_Cho) Banner dies (or steps down. Thor 3 already established he's sick of being a super hero) and the new ""Hulk"" takes over. Helen Cho (his mom) was already in Age of Ultron (although they changed her character and they didn't mention Amadeus). They could easily have her come back in a new film and work him in. He and Spider-Man could totally work together as a ""new generation"" of younger avengers.&&given the history of asian roles and white actors i‚Äôd say that‚Äôs just parity &&It'd only be okay with the original Amadeus Cho, not the Hulked out version. That one just never resonated with me, honestly. I don't know if th writing for his book is any good, though, so feel free anyone who wishes to enlighten me.

And, sadly, I'm sure the studios would reject a Chinese Superman movie, because general audiences would find it too confusing to have two Supermen in different countries, but FUCK THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.&&I wish there was a popular superhero that started off Asian and not just an Asian person who took the mantle of a superhero that was already popular and started off as black/white. &&As an Asian, I could live without having China being the one representing all of Asia yet again.&&I would die a happy man if we got a billion dollar dragon Ball movie&&On one hand I'm excited. On the other hand, I don't just want a sort of makeover of an existing super.&&There aren't many asian comic book characters in general that have their own series. That's been the problem with getting one out. Black people had Black Panther as a very prominent historical character (it's been out for more than 50 years), white people have had a ton obviously; Latinos and Asians have smaller characters that tend to be side kicks than anything else. Latinos have had the most recent Ghost rider for the most part (and he's been played as such int he Agents of SHIELD TV show), who had a very good comic until the writer went off the rails and made a ghost rider comic book without featuring Ghost rider. Asians have Daisy Johnson (also on Agents of SHIELD). The best bet for asian american representation would be Kamala Khan, who is Pakistani american.&&Russian&&East of course, since that's the only part of Asia people seem to push for in the Asian representation argument.&&Indian&&Unless you are watching the Hungarian Dub.

""Did he freeze?""

""Like Captain America.""&&I understand how ""diversity"" is interchangeable with ""mainly black cast"" but what I don't get is why the portrayal of Wakandans (sp?) is positive. They use an antiquated form of government that appears functionally identical to a dictatorship in which a fight to the death determines who's in charge. When the government inevitably collapses under the coup, the movie devolves into Africans killing Africans. It's a horrible portrayal of Africans.&&Not a bigoted question, but how can someone call a movie cast diverse if it is 90% one race?&&stronk independent movie that doesn't need no universe&&That community was no doubt an untapped demographic for the superhero genre, but as a percentage of the population, they are increasingly smaller. Many regular movie goers who wouldn't ordinarily consider a Marvel film showed up.&&I thought it was cool too see half of the audience being everyday black families and the other half being nerds of all kinds.&&Honestly I think the timing of the release is a pretty big contributor to the success. February/March isn't exactly a time period with a bunch of big name, highly anticipated movies.&&Pretty much hit the nail on the head.&&That's a great point about the timing. We're conditioned to believe that spring/summer is the time for blockbusters but BP came out at a moment when there wasn't much serious competition in the box office, at least not genre wise&&The entire confrontation is based on oppression. That's why Killmonger wants to rule. To give black people all over the world the power to fight back and be on top. &&Isn‚Äôt that a given that a fictional location and society is under explored? &&I agree. It's awesome, culturally, it's great to see a good mainstream superhero/role model that black people can identify with. But from a critical point of view, it's just okay. I thought T'Challa was kinda bland. He didn't say much, had no internal struggle and his only defining quality seemed to be ""he's a good guy"". I was hoping they'd flesh him out into a more complex character. Michael B. Jordan's character was fun as hell though

Edit: I still liked it. Hop off my dick&&My wife like how kick ass all the women were. That's something you don't normally see. Like usually there might be one or two bad asses but never like generals and scientists and warriors equal to the men. It was a big deal to her. I think there was a lot in this film for everyone. I've grown up my whole life getting certain really shitty information and images about all of Africa. Even if it was make believe it was cool to see a vision of an African nation not mired in civil war, atrocities and soul crushing poverty. That was a big deal to me. &&Two of the better villains. We didn't get much time with Klaue but I loved every moment of it. I wish we could have more.&&[deleted]&&I don't have superhero fatigue I have DC fatigue, their movies just aren't any good so I'm not watching them anymore.&&I have a suggestion, stop watching DC movies...at least the ones that are clearly not going to be enjoyable. I still regret going to see JL and BvS despite my better judgement. 

Wonder Woman is the only current exception to this for me. 

I really think that WB thought they could rush out JL as a big team up that everyone's been waiting on with a Thanos wannabe villain but they totally fumbled the ball in every way imaginable.&&>  I had such high hopes for Suicide Squad and Justice League, Batman vs Superman, they were all bad. Maybe Aquaman will be good?

That sentence has been said over and over ever since BvS, and is the biggest source of DCs income. Fight it! You are stronger than this!
&&I liked that we got a main character who was the straight man. Not every protganist needs to be hilarious too. We've got plenty of those.&&Here's your options for sci-fi/fantasy:

a) extraordinary people in an ordinary world (good example is Tony Stark in the first Iron Man or Thor in the first Thor)

b) ordinary people in an extraordinary world (Harry Potter, Farscape, etc)

Tchalla is B. He's the king of a hidden supertech nation but he's just trying to do the right thing&&Probably because he‚Äôs on a vengeance-fueled murder quest for all of Civil War. He‚Äôs pretty much just chilling out for most of this movie&&He was a much more active character in Civil War.  His actions and decisions had a driving influence on the plot of that movie.

In Black Panther, he's more reactionary.  Ironically, in the movie in which he's king he feels much less in control.  Also, his main bit of character development in the movie is his decision to bring Wakanda out into the outside world.  Which would be more impactful if it didn't feel like a forgone conclusion, especially after his role in Civil War.&&His action scenes were much better in CW, that's for sure. My main gripe with BP is the action scenes. I feel like they really fell short on showing BP's powerset besides being a skilled fighter. If any superhero could pull off a stealth skillset, it should be BP! In fact, they could have played up his stealth as the way to defeat Killmonger because he lost fair and square in hand-to-hand combat against him. They even mentioned 'sneakers' with no follow-up.

Really besides the action, BP is a very well made film.&&In _Civil War_ he was on a rage fueled revenge quest chasing his fathers murderer. In _Black Panther_ he was the new ruler who had to act stoic so as to reinforce the notion he'd be a good king.

Most of his character arc could be seen externally in CW due to being able to express physical regret and anger. His arc in BP was largely internal, fighting with the different ideas of where to lead his country. I felt both worked for the stories they were trying to tell.&&Yeah, super refreshing to have a hero that isnt cracking jokes every five seconds&&Agreed! He wasn‚Äôt dull. He just wasn‚Äôt the main humor of the movie. The scene where he talks with his dead father and shouts ‚Äúyou were wrong‚Äù ... how could anyone see that as dull? It was moving.&&The amount of snark when they'll combine Stark, Quill, Strange, Parker, (and to a lesser extent Hawkeye,  and Ant Man) in IW shows exactly why we need a straight face like Tchalla to balance out all the fun cynical quips. Not every player has to be the face of the party.&&The general was my absolute favourite especially when she refuses to back down to her husband.&&Even if they were not there I think Killmonger would have still carried the film.&&Not entirely surprising. If they made a Captain Britain movie, I'd go see it. &&Am in Kenya, and when it came out, it was damn near impossible to get tickets to the show.
I paid 1000kes(~10usd) for the show when I finally got a spot, after booking a week prior to the show date&&That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused there isn‚Äôt a Chinese main superhero yet. They‚Äôll literally make millions from China alone.&&Annihilation isn't a giant popcorn blockbuster with broad appeal. It's a dark sci-fi thriller with horror elements and an ambiguous ending. Diversity or not that type of sci-fi has a niche market. One of my favorites for sure though.&&Black Panther opened in twice as many theatres. It had far more marketing and was on the back of arguably the most successful franchise of all time. Annihilation also doesn't need to be a box office success as it is a Netflix release so its success will be a combination of box office plus Netflix internal measures of success. &&I only watched Annihilation last night and it was done so goddamn well I never felt for a moment that it was like ITS GUUURRRLLLS DOING THANGS GIRL POWER!! As a woman there's nothing more patronising than pushing girl power movies on us. Annihilation does a spectacular job of portraying normal women just doing their job and getting down with it. No song and dance. They're not mad warriors, they're down to earth army soldiers and scientists. 

&&> And even if you have both, like Annihilation, it still doesn't equal money necessarily.

True. And ANNIHILATION may end up as the best movie of 2018... that no one saw.&&Didn't I see around this sub that there was next to no advertising efforts for Annihilation? I know I only heard about it from some film buff friends on facebook&&The third act was such a mess. The rest of the movie was *fine* and was much better than other recent DCEU movies but that doesn‚Äôt mean it was amazing. &&Gal Gadot&&The third act was boring as fuck. &&Gal Gadot's hotness really contributed too, even if no one wants to say it&&Yeah I don't get the WW love.  People kept talking about how much presence Robin Wright had but I didn't see it.  She was in the movie for all of 5 minutes, they never explain WW's AOE attack/defense or why no one freaks out when she uses it, the ending dragged, there was way too much slow motion, and there was no need for the actual Aries person, it would have been a stronger message and given her stronger convictions if he never existed at all. 

Edit: or even better, if he's only teased at the end and she believes that he doesn't exists. &&Same. It was just the normal Marvel formula with a different cast. However, the Marvel formula is very good, so it was still a great film. It was just average in comparison to their others (again, average does not mean bad).&&No, they clearly decided it was too long and chopped out enough to make it lame. It had a bit of almost a Bond flick feel, but then it ran short.&&Wonder Woman is like a 7.5/10 movie until it turns into a 3/10 with the final act. &&Then you have Winter Soldier and Civil War which had as much espionage and intrigue as they had action, you've got Ant-Man which was more of a heist movie than an action flick, and the Spider-Man Homecoming which just did what everyone's been wanting the last 2 times they made Spider-Man by just actually making him the Spider-Man from the comics. They've done good work, I hope they keep it up.&&Huh. I agree with you on all of these. I'd also place it below Thor 3, about even with Cap 1 and Avengers 2.&&Damn you rate doctor strange that highly? That was one of my least favorites &&The opening scene alone, with Surtur. My dad and I have not laughed together like that in years.&&Just rewatched it. I'll do it again. &&Saw it twice in theaters, bought it on digital the day it came out and have 3 more watches already. I love that damn movie&&I loved Ragnarok. Contrary to other people, I actually enjoyThor 1 and Thor: The Dark World quite a bit even though they were weaker than Captain America and Iron Man but Ragnarok was amazing. I loved the scenes with Korg especially. &&Exactly, just as I have no desire whatsoever to rewatch Black Panther.

I want more of that afrofuturism settings, I loved the scene when they were in the Wakandian villages, but sadly there's mostly none of that in the movie. &&The untapped Black Geek market is ripe for the taking, brb writing a Vegeta movie&&Hey, I still give a shit about Blade. Hope that comes back.&&I remember blade..and then came twilight, and was left wondering wtf was becoming of the world&&Fuck you I love blade&&>And nobody nowadays gives a shit about Blade or remembers it.

First off how dare you&&Same. I still can‚Äôt get over that casual knife flip during Cap and Bucky‚Äôs street fight &&[And at Disney](https://media.giphy.com/media/n59dQcO9yaaaY/giphy.gif)&&Infinity War is the first film in maybe ten years where I honestly think if I show up early to get tickets I still might not get a seat.

EDIT: I do live in a small city, and what I meant to say is, close to ten years ago I went to see a movie and showed up early and couldn't, and nothing has done that since where we live. Me wording am clunky.&&As someone who works at a movie theatre I'm terrified of Infinity War but for a completely different reason.&&Kind of crazy that it's basically just Disney competing with itself at this point.&&Yea but the pre-hype for that was low since Batman Vs Superman was so ass.&&And I think everything that has come out since BP has been lackluster, pretty much all the big title ones have been flops, when you‚Äôre still number one with 23 (or 33 I forget) million then that means everyone else is doing bad imo&&I feel like a lot of those people would watch IW - I mean T'Challa and Shuri will be in the film - not to mention the fact that once you get into Marvel universe you're going to want more even if that's the only one you've seen. &&[deleted]&&Where the hell are you going to buy paper? &&""Over 6 years since Avengers came out""

I'm getting too old for this.&&Also I'm not sure if cinema tickets are following average inflation. Didn't study it but I would say they are increasing higher than it. &&AMC on tuesdays is like 7 dollars..thats what i do haha.&&If they were smart they'd do some marketing to dispel the social stigma on seeing movies alone. I do it because it's great and who cares but I think theatres would be a lot more full if people felt comfortable watching movies on an impulse.&&Moviepass&&As sketchy as it seems, I highly recommend Moviepass while that shit is still going.&&As a Canadian who moved to California, I consider my Moviepass to be pure gold. I feel for you, fellow Canuck!&&I used to go constantly. Especially to the dollar theaters that don't seem to exist anymore. But even the normal ones when they were 7 or 8 bucks. Now? I go maybe twice a year. TV tech has gotten so much better. I have a projector and surround sound that I bought for 600 bucks. Theaters are great, but why would I pay 14 bucks to go when I have this at home? If they were still half that price I know I'd make more of an effort to go and see new movies. The prices now are insane.&&Well to add that Gone With the Wind replayed in theaters for decades. Most older movies did because you couldn't watch them at home.  So they'd bring it back like a stage production. &&There were different kinds of competition. You're forgetting how affordable hookers were back then. &&People were MUCH more busy working. This predates the availability of fridges and washing machines in most houses. Women spent a large portion of their lives maintaining the infrastructure of the house, and many men had full time jobs in addition to a variety of economically beneficial activities (doing their own carpentry, mechanical work, small engine maintenance and repair, hunting/fishing for meat, or working side jobs.

People have no idea how easy they have it and how lazy it's made them.

For the record, there was VERY little competition, but much less time was spent on entertainment. For the most part, people listened to radio in the evening as a family, a radio was a serious investment, think about FDR's fireside radio chats, or they went to a local fair or circus or something, or they went to a movie. That was pretty much it.&&Yeah but back then successful movies had ridiculous runs in the theater. GWTW was in theaters for 4 years and then had 8 re-releases.&&>  Give any of these other movies on the list the same treatment

Yeah, man it would be kind of cool if they re-released, like, Star Wars, for example. Maybe they could add some new FX shots...&&Go-Go, though?&&It's set in a fictional hybrid of California and Japan, like the Phoenix Wright games.

Thor 3 already established he's sick of being a super hero) and the new ""Hulk"" takes over. Helen Cho (his mom) was already in Age of Ultron (although they changed her character and they didn't mention Amadeus). They could easily have her come back in a new film and work him in. He and Spider-Man could totally work together as a ""new generation"" of [younger avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Avengers).&&Jubilee from X-Men is honestly the only one I can think of. And I'm Asian so this blows.&&All their movies make a bazillion dollars&&i'm asian and i didn't care for hulked out amadeus cho. the whole point of the hulk is that bruce banner hates being the hulk and can't control him. and amadeus cho likes being the hulk and can control him so it defeats the purpose.

I mean we have Samurai Jack but uhh he was voiced by a black guy&&I agree, but Hollywood puts Chinese people in movies in particular to take advantage of the box office numbers, so it'll take a lot for them to acknowledge other Asian countries. &&South asians are Asians too :( would love a Kamala Khan movie targetted to kids and young teens. &&We got it lol it sucked ass &&Black Widow movie.&&Wait really?&&They should've used that line in the original.&&That‚Äôs a great line &&Damn. That's actually better than the original line&&#**FREEZER BURN**&&I neva freeeeze. &&Better than the German dub which uses ""Wakanda √ºber alles"", akin to the 3rd Reich and ""Deutschland √ºber alles"". Mit really bad but I really think they could've chosen better words.&&I think that was kind of the point. Wakanda for all of its power and advanced technology, has so isolated itself from the world that in some ways it has not progressed at all, which leaves it open to the risk of losing the benevolent part of the dictatorship they enjoyed for so long.

T'challa realizes this and decides that the best future for Wakanda and the greater world is for them to become less isolationist. Sure he doesn't emphasize the part where Wakanda will change as well, but no good politician would do that since a populace will be much more open to the idea of them positively changing others rather than being changed themselves.

TL;DR: The idea is not to portray African people as great in every way, that would be boring, the idea is to portray an African society that developed advanced technology without exposure to the greater world.&&Perhaps I'm reading too much into it but I saw the portrayal of Wakanda's system of government as a byproduct of and implicit criticism of their insular protectionism.&&> They use an antiquated form of government that appears functionally identical to a dictatorship in which a fight to the death determines who's in charge.

A major premise of the film was showing how the country was changing from that to accepting more progressive principles for the greater good. They make a point out of how backwards their old system was.&&Challenging Wakanda's idealized self image is kind of like the WHOLE POINT of the movie though. Who is idolizing their form of government or isolationism?&&A positive portrayal of Africans or of Black people doesn't necessarily have to portray them all positively. The fact that black actors get to be the heroes, villains and the morally gray is progress. If anything, a 100% positive portrayal would be patronising because no society is perfect. 

Asgard, the other comparable ethnocentric society in the MCU is full of flaws (as explored in Ragnarok). &&[deleted]&&I don't really have any special insights on it, but I would say that it was portrayed in a very realistic way and that not everything positive is 100% sunshine and daisies.

You like the Wakandans because you are introduced to them before you find out about their politics and structure and history.  They are just people, and the ones we've seen thus far seem to be pretty good ones.  In previous movies, in earlier scenes of this movie, they are just and strong and compassionate and loving.

You find out as things go on how they came to be that way, how they live, and some of the shitty things their country has done in the past which everyone in every country on Earth can relate to.  But you find out while the main character is finding out, and when he finds out he reacts as we react.  

He doesn't want to believe that someone and something he loves could have done bad things, but when finally confronted with the evidence of that he decides not to just accept it and go along with things but to confront it head on and try to right the wrongs, like heroes do.

The movie shows us a lot about what's wrong with just blindly following tradition.  It shows us the problems with just having a ""fuck you, I got mine"" mindset in the world.  And it's trying to teach people who are watching it, a lot of whom are young and impressionable people who are looking up to these characters, that they don't have to go down the same path their parents did.

They can find their own way, make their own choices.  They can recognize when the adults got it wrong, stand up to them, and do things a better way.  It's a problem that isn't unique to them or their country but they are the first ones we see in the MCU who actually band together and try to change something when everything is said and done.

I think that's a pretty cool portrayal to see Africans leading the way in the world in the MCU to try and get the whole planet moving forward.&&has nothing to do with a ""positive"" portrayal of Africans. It's about a majority black film that doesn't involve something like slavery or some dumb Tyler Perry bullshit. It's a fictional movie in a fictional world with great black actors playing parts they normally do not get to in Hollywood. That's the point. Whether Wakandans are ""right"" or ""wrong"" is irrelevant. They aren't real.&&But a major part of the movie is the critique of Wakanda? That‚Äôs what makes Jordan‚Äôs character so compelling/sympathetic. 

As for the dictatorship aspect, you can easily say the same for any fictional society not set in a modern democracy or communism. Thor and Asgard is an even worse version of this, &&>I understand how ""diversity"" is interchangeable with ""mainly black cast"" but what I don't get is why the portrayal of Wakandans (sp?) is positive. They use an antiquated form of government that appears functionally identical to a dictatorship in which a fight to the death determines who's in charge. When the government inevitably collapses under the coup, the movie devolves into Africans killing Africans. It's a horrible portrayal of Africans.

I think it was an intentional flaw. As a writer, you have to have some flaws built in or else you get strawmen.&&Wakanda is made up of five culturally distinct tribes who all sit on the only source of the most valuable resource in the world. Their system is designed to avoid civil war, which would almost certainly open them up to foreign influence and/or outright foreign invasion. A lot of regions have devolved into chaos over much less, so Wakanda is a stunning success in that regard.&&'Diverse' has more recently been used to mean 'non-white'.&&It's the number 1 most watched movie of all time in Africa.

I think the international market also played a big role.

Edit: title says domestic.. forget what I said.&&Your mom wasn't an untapped demographic last night.&&movie and game releases continually ignore this at their own peril

almost completely killed Titanfall2, and did ruin Battleborn&&This is crucial too, I think it's the combination of a black society untouched by colonization and slavery with actual conversations about the oppression of black people and how best to address it&&Yeah. I wouldn‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt portray blacks as oppressed. It‚Äôs honest about their treatment in the rest of Africa and America. Wauconda is your perspective though, which most certainly is the opposite.&&A fictional part of Africa, but definitely adhearing to African music, aesthetics, and containing a few nods to several real African cultures. It's a fun way to see those elements on screen, since they tend to be relatively rare, and generally non existent in blockbusters&&While the location is fictional, it follows culture of the surrounding area, but mixed with a futuristic theme. This is actually called [afrofuturism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism) and it's a highly underrated aesthetic.&&Thor 3 was also set in a ficional world but didnt do as well.Or Thor 11 for that matter.&&>I thought T'Challa was kinda bland. He didn't say much, had no internal struggle and his only defining quality seemed to be ""he's a good guy"".

I don't really get why people say this a lot. While the rest of the cast did go through more obvious development (and in the case of Killmonger, have more depth), T'Challa was perfectly fine imo.

His arc was much more internal, with him initially sticking with the status quo like his father, but later realizing that such a way of governing wouldn't work in the current climate and by the end (through the advice of his father) deciding to become his own king and rule the way he wanted.

It's nothing groundbreaking, of course, but perfectly satisfactory for a superhero/blockbuster. I think a lot of people think T'Challa bland because the rest of the cast is so full of personality/color, but when he's able to drop the monotone/calm/collected ruler thing when in the presence of friends or family he's finally able to relax and act a bit more happy/cocky.&&I thought T'Challa had a good internal conflict of fighting between conserving the existing culture and evolving to become a part of the new world. You have characters on both sides arguing for one way or the other, and in the end he has to make the choice whether to break the tradition he's been taught his entire life and has lasted for thousands of years or stepping up and helping people around the world at the risk of losing part of their culture. I thought that was a really dynamic internal struggle, how do you reconcile between the viewpoints of your dead father and your dying cousin? He wasn't as obviously struggling as he could've been but that was a huge internal conflict for him.&&my girlfriend, who is white, took her sister and niece to see it because of all the kick ass women. &&Agreed, the women in the movie were fucking fantastic. &&I convinced my gf (who doesn't like superhero movies at all) to go see it. She was reluctant to go. During the casino scene when Okoye is kicking all kinds of ass, she lets go of my hand and goes ""yasssss bitch"". 

That's when I realized that this movie succeeded&&I wonder if Klaue is a great villain it if Andy Serkis is a great actor who pulled something from nothing.&&The movie wasn't about him. It was about establishing his motivation moving forward and exploring Wakanda.&&Yeah, exactly. He had a purpose in Civil War and the plot moved forward because of his actions whereas in Black Panther he was just responding to the plot happening around him. This is very un Black Panther. T'Challa is supposed to be a schemer and a man in charge. He felt weak in this movie. Also they made him much less composed, dominant, and arrogant in this than in Civil War, which is also a dilution of his character. There were so many good lines in Civil War that captured his regal powerful essence. When he tells Clint ""I don't care"" or when he very calmly decides that his next mission in life is to execute the man who killed his father or when he tells Steve that he will not be able to keep Bucky safe from him. In Black Panther he's some mildly goofy big brother who gets flustered by his ex. This is a man who has been groomed since birth for the throne. To be a brilliant, powerful, public figure. #notmytchalla&&> They even mentioned 'sneaker' with no follow-up

Did you hear any footsteps?

Yeah, thought so.&&I made these shoes absorb all sound!

Never uses them. &&I'm not sure any villain can carry any story where the opposing side has no interesting element unless the story is told just from his perspective. Killmonger was the perfect villain for the story told in this movie, I don't think he'd be as good otherwise.&&I think you'll find they already did mate. It's called 'Alan Partridge Alpha Papa'.&&Didn't Paddington Bear get a sequel already?&&Excalibur movie when?&&You guys have Harry Potter.&&Poorly marketed too, that was my favorite movie of the year so far and I never would have seen it if I didn't find out that it was written by Alex Garland. Marvel has spent billions in marketing over the last 10 years and it has paid off in spades for them. I wonder if Annihilation was marketed as Lovecraftian, which it very much was IMO, it would have done better by drawing in all the Lovecraft weebs (which definitely includes me). Anyways, the only way I can see for myself to help get more of these dark, philosophical sci-fi films in theaters is to support the ones that do come out as much as possible. I saw BladeRunner 2049 4 times in theaters not just because it was fucking amazing but also because I wanted to show the powers that be that there is most definitely an audience for these kinds of movies. &&I dunno, the ending was pretty clear in the sense that contact with whatever was in the lighthouse mixed attributes of the lifeform with the woman.

It's not arguable.

I didn't pay any mind to the fact that it was a movie starring mostly women, it was just a good movie that I enjoyed.

Using your comparison in your other comment; Ghostbusters 2016 which seemed to only exist in order to have a female-starring-cast, so they could then use the excuse of geek-sexism to explain why the movie would do poorly.

Eventually, once all the shows sold out (even after we put in more last minute shows), I got the fun job of informing people that they couldn't go see the shows their friends already bought tickets to. 

Every once in a while I was sent to theatres to help managers seat people. Which meant if the movie hadn't started, I would yell 'THIS IS A SOLD OUT SHOWING, I NEED EVERYONE TO MOVE IN THEIR ROWS TO FILL IN EVERY OPEN SEAT.

IW
DP2

All three major May releases are now owned by Disney.

Either way, From April 27th through the 18th of May, IW has 3 weeks of uncontested glory. Even then, I don't see DP2 or Solo impacting its numbers.

With all the bells and whistles theaters are offering now, going to the movies has gotten really expensive really fast&&I tried going to a cheap tuesday to see Wonder Woman but apparently everyone else had the same idea. Couldn't find a damn parking spot.&&$5 for stubs members. I usually go in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays and only pay $5-8 anyways though.&&Imagine how shitty your life must be if you make fun of someone going to the movies alone.&&I love going to movies by myself. My wife got me an annual pass to movie pass just so I could go by myself. It's great!&&I didn't know this was a thing. You're literally in a dark room where no one is supposed to talk - where is the stigma of being ""alone""?&&Leeloo Dallas&&THEY KNOW IT'S A MOVIE PASS! &&Unfortunately, not a thing in Canada. And there's not really a good alternative.&&Its the best. Saw the movie three times in one month. Only paid $9.99 once.

Edit: I can't spell.&&Well it's depends on how bad you want to go see a movie. If you don't go see something in theater you'll have to wait months to see it at home &&I wish they would do this more with older movies. A few years back when they re-released ""The Lion King"" in theatres me and all my buddies went and saw it and it was great. I felt like a little kid. I can think of a bunch of good movies that would be great to see on the big screen again&&To balance the scale a bit here there are also a ton more movie theaters nowadays and way more people than there were in those times.&&>You're forgetting 

How *old* are you?&&""Hey, babe let's bring the kids to see Cherry, today. She doesn't kiss but she's got a great set of gams.""&&Gone With the Wind has no true comparison though. Fucker played in theaters for like 3 years straight.&&Ooh yeah! Like ‚ÄúSpecial Edition‚Äùs or some shit! I‚Äôd love to see Han walk over Jabba‚Äôs tail or something. It‚Äôd be hilarious. &&Or added digital effects to Gone With The Wind.

Rhett gave a damn first! &&A single side character. Compared to Black Panther...&&I have to assume that this takes place when japan wins the war&&Me either.  Someone else here mentioned having an Asian person play Namor and I think that's a pretty good idea.  &&Blindspot? Is he like Daredevil but less blind? &&The Totally Awesome Hulk is always where my mind first goes for Asian superheroes and it seems pretty easy to work him in, since Banner as a character is already at the point where he wants nothing to do with superhero stuff. Or you could follow the comics and have him die, that works too. Though obviously we're a long ways away from a Civil War II arc in the movies. &&No. In the movie she says something like ""a deer in headlights""&&To use a Civilization reference, they're really far down the tech tree but very early in the civics tree&&""we let them in, they bring their problems with them"" -Wakabi

yep sounds like insular protectionism for sure&&Yes, they are practically early 20th century Japan.&&Hell, that's *the* major premise of the movie...&&I really appreciated that it used a black villain. I was somewhat apprehensive at the start it was going to be a pretty simple black=good, white=bad film. Instead it was a morally complex situation driven by and for the black characters, much more satisfying.&&> Asgard, the other comparable ethnocentric society in the MCU is full of flaws (as explored in Ragnarok). 

Except they deliberately made Asgard less white, especially in Ragnarok, where there were plenty of other (human) races including a black Valkyrie.&&^yep!&&Yeah, it's less about ""positive"" it's more about ""identifiable/relatable/authentic."" Not the same as ""realistic"" but also the opposite of ""bullshit."" Which is also what makes things interesting to people.

Jack and Rose aren't ""positive"" people in Titanic. But they feel identifiable, relatable and authentic. Same with John McClane, same with RDJ as Tony Stark.

A Wrinkle in Time had a 100% positive portrayal of a black protagonist at the same time and it failed - at least in part because it smelled like bullshit. None of it made any sense. It was a tough adaptation of already crazy material that erred on the side of making everything positive, and as a result the group of people who connected with it ended up being very small.

Black Panther is great heroic fantasy because it is both imaginative and crazy but also feels grounded and makes sense.&&I can actually quantify that: The international market contributed exactly $0 to the domestic box office.&&Battleborn was less about the time of year and more about Overwatch releasing so close to it. They weren't very similar games but that wasn't obvious from the marketing.&&I think it's about the juxtaposition of an independent, prosperous black civilization with an oppressed, post-slavery society closely resembling our own. Mainly to highlight how far society still has to go to fully heal from that era but also inspire us and honor African-American heritage. &&It's a lot like the conflict between Professor X and Magneto in the X-Men storyline&&Wakanda.&&For the curious, Afrofuturism is the formal name for this concept. Makes for a much easier google search.&&Yeah, the region itself (somewhere west-central near the Congo) along with the names (Njobu, Wakanda, Mbaka) explicitly suggests Bantu origins to me. So not just some generic African ideas, but specific historical/cultural references to real life Bantu peoples. &&I think Thor suffered from a weak second movie and the fact that, on the whole, most people (that I know) find Thor to be the least exciting/interesting&&[deleted]&&Yeah, he is a ""thinking first"" character. He's smart and intellectually savvy with his emotions (mostly) under control. We see him in Civil War forget this about himself for a moment, then Black Panther got to really flesh out his personality and why that was out of the norm for him. I am ***SO*** glad we don't have another Stark/Thor/Loki/Quill/[insert witty banter from someone that eventually molds them all into one character] type of scenario. His personality--along with guys like Dr. Strange--add in a nice spice, for me. &&I mean, he is a king. He has to portray himself as a king. &&People keep forgetting the fact that he lost his father a week prior to the film. How animated would you be while grieving? Stoic was the right play. &&T'Challa also already had an arc in Civil  War with Bucky killing his Dad. Now that he gets his own movie he doesn't need to have a personality rehash or spend a lot of time introducing his character&&Yeah, all the really kick ass women are locked in the X-Men, ha ha. Now that Marvel has them back, hopefully we can get some Storm, Jean Grey, and Emma Frost MCU action.&&The supporting cast stole the show, honestly. When I think of the film I think of literally everyone BUT black panther. Not to say BP wasn't awesome, because he was, but they just killed from all sides.&&I'd give the credit to Serkis, Klaue didn't have much story or a ton to do but Andy made so much of him that he was a standout character in the movie and he was killed off in the first 45 minutes. He was just a fun character who absolutely walked out of a comic book into the big screen but he was so enjoyable that I just want more.&&Agreed. I also think it‚Äôs funny that this comes up constantly in criticism of Black Panther, yet never in criticism of TDK, even though Batman suffers from the exact same thing in that movie.&&I enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it did a good job of exploring Wakanda. We only saw some overviews and like 1 actual street.&&Don't get me wrong. I love the ending. General movie going audiences don't want endings that leave them with more questions than answers though.&&> studios only want to push dumbed down flashy blockbusters.

Netflix's CEO specifically stated this when defending Bright.&&Do we know when it will be on US Netflix? I missed the theater run and really want to see it. &&[deleted]&&Scared the absolute piss out of me. I haven't felt that tense during a scene in a long ass time.&&It's one of those movies that is even better after you see it... it sat with me for days. I'm still thinking about it.&&Literally just finished watching Doctor Strange again, the effects and the action are simply amazing. I really like Cumberbatch and Madds is incredible as always. Not quite sure why it divides a lot of people. &&[removed]&&What about the Droid attack on the Wookies?&&It might come out a little dodgy.&&for real

COOOOORRRBIIIIIIINNN!!&&My sister named her cat ‚ÄúLeeloo Dallas MultiPass‚Äù&&Multipass&&I do that with 90% of the movies I want to see. It's pretty easy once you get used to it. It's really no different than waiting for it to come out in the first place. &&Some local theaters do this! Just last week a theater by me was showing Spaceballs.&&This happens all the time in bigger markets like NYC, typically at repertory theaters and the like. 

Even so formal re-releases like Titanic last year are still all too rare. You would think they'd want to capitalize on all this 90s nostalgia and do a few 20th anniversary re-releases every year nowadays. For example, one of my biggest regrets is missing the Shawshank Redemption a few years ago. &&Check out of there is a landmark theater near you, they do this on the weekends all the time. Most Indy theaters do it to.&&Don't make me take this onion off my belt, sonny.&&Believe it or not, there really are some *old* people online. TBH some of the most knowledgeable people about computers around, are the dinosaurs who worked on the systems of the 60's-80's.&&3 years straight in the rest of the country maybe, but here in Atlanta there are multiple theaters that still constantly run it.

That film will be showing in at least one theater somewhere in the universe from now until the end of linear time.&&That movie also had 8 re-releases in theaters and has been accumulating money for almost 80 years.

Not Hungarian. &&Found a natural wonder that gives 50+ science a turn and doubled down on it; built tall.&&Oh, you mean the character who turned into a villain at the end and betrayed his king?&&T'challa and killmonger were both right but for different reasons. Killmonger was just wrong about his approach it was nice having a good villian in a morally grey area&&I really appreciated how killmonger was so outraged and extremist in his view, but instead of just casting his issues aside T'challa understood what was the root issue and actually took it into mind. &&Except he's talking about Aesir ethnicity. A good comparison is that the society isn't racist, it's speciesist.&&Lol you're right. I didn't read to title properlymy bad.&&Goddamnit. The town near me is wauconda. I keep doing that hahaha get your shit together Lame... it‚Äôs African, not Native American.&&Super cool concept, I'm only discovering my favorite genre (science-fiction) has a whole new delta to explore&&I have a feeling that will change after ragnarok. Chris Hemsworth's comedic timing is perfect.&&Even though Ragnarok is in my top 3 MCU films. It was fanastic, and injected much needed life into the Thor Franchise and the character of Thor as well. As a lead up to his role in A:IW it couldn't have done better.&&>  His personality--along with guys like Dr. Strange

But Strange is just like Stark/Thor/Loki/Quill etc. A highly skilled and arogant wise-ass who loves to hear himself talk and thinks he is always right.&&I can‚Äôt upvote you but more than once and am too poor for gold, but I love this comment&&Exactly. He was raised to be king, and he took it very seriously and felt the full weight of that responsibility. Add to that the fact his nation is trying to fly under the radar and it makes sense that he‚Äôd outwardly be an extremely reserved, measured, neutral person.

Now that he‚Äôs shrugged off the legacy of his father and decided to go his own way, I expect we‚Äôll see a bit more personality in future portrayals, but he‚Äôs still a king.&&Perhaps Wakandan culture and politics would be better&&yeah, ending was awesome. Really liked the movie. That type of ending is pretty common for the genre though (horror/sci-fi) and maybe doesn't agree well with audiences. I remember the ending to ""It follows."" So cliche, but it was great.&&I thought Bright was pretty good. It's a reliable watch with an interesting universe. I hope they do some sequels tbh. I would definitely watch them. &&Nup, fuck it.

Deadpool 2 I can see doing well for itself but it‚Äôs not going to be able to get quite near Infinity War either. Also keep in mind Solo isn‚Äôt a main Star Wars film so it‚Äôs not going to have the impact that The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi had in the box office. &&10 years actually.&&Oof, yeah..&&Just rewatched Iron Man (the start of my MCU binge in prep for IW) and it is funny seeing all the old tech in the movie, CRT monitors, crappy desktop computers, Tony's ridiculous phone, etc.&&Savage.&&When do we get theaters where you can just pee right there in your seat?&&Visit the Alamo.&&I watched Black Panther a few weeks ago and there were these teens that walked in and were loud during the commercials and movie trailers, playing on their phones and moving seats, distracting everyone.

Did you know that Luke Skywalker is actually Darth Vader's father?&&r/me_irl&&I travel a lot for work. I love nothing more than being done with my day at 1pm on a Monday/Tuesday and finally catching a movie that came out a month ago in a theater that consists of me and a guy that works there who showed up early to catch a movie for free. 

And a lot of times I end up in a rinky dink town with a decent cinema, pay $5 for the ticket, $3 for a popcorn and be like, I love this shit. &&I don't know how much of it is a stigma as much as it just being unusual. It's an ""outing"". Most people probably wouldn't go to the zoo by themselves, or an amusement park (granted some are inherently more social activities than others). Humans are social animals, so while there's nothing explicitly wrong or weird about it, it is unusual. 

I say this as an introvert who does a lots of stuff alone and has no issue with the idea of seeing movies solo, it's just most of the movies I want to see in theatres I'll have at least one person I know would be interested and want to see it as well.&&BITCOOOOOOOONNNNNNNEEEEECCCCTTTTTT!&&Yo i have a new ginger cat and I named her Leeloo Dallas Multicat &&Now, to see a movie cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em.

Now where were we... oh yeah.&&Gone With the Wind came out in 1939 tho&&And probably well into nonlinear time, too&&Also, there was no home video for the first several decades after it was released. &&It‚Äôs pretty damn rare that a character legitimately has to be one race or another. People tend to think because the character was that race in the original version of something it has to remain in any recreation of that thing. No matter what you do or people will get upset and call it some type of ‚Äúcolor washing‚Äù but there‚Äôs nothing you can do about that. 

Black Panther is the rare exception to this. The lore and background of the character has to do with an African nation that was never colonized. That character has to be African, it wouldn‚Äôt make sense otherwise. 

But for the most part any type of person can be any type of person. &&Ah, of course.  what were they thinking!?&&The point of the movie was going away from Wakandan tradition. His worldview was antiquated, but it also was the modus operandi of the Wakandans for a millennium.  &&Every good villain thinks he is the hero in his own story.&&Plus that cool ass hair cut&&Thor: Ragnarok was good because Kevin Smith was like ""yo dawg, Thor 2 sucked balls, here's what you should do to prevent your next Thor movie from also sucking balls"" and Hemsworth was like ""yo Marvel, K got a point, imma actually read up on Thor and be more involved in the next movie's writing and shit""&&It was a full blown adventure comedy which was a huge breath of fresh air in terms of presentation. It still got stuck in the standard Marvel ""save the world  boss fight"" in the end, but it explored so much more in between. It allowed itself to be weird, alien, and funny. It was fun side adventure that ended with major ramifications for the MCU.&&Yeah, I can see that, too. I see him more prickly than the rest, more of an asshole but yeah.

I almost noped the fuck out there and then.&&sooooo ur gonna watch the 3D version?  elitist..&&Ha, I went to the movies the other day and there were no less than seven people behind the concession counter (with only two of four registers open), plus those at the front and waiting outside theatres to clean (and probably in theatres cleaning already, and whoever else I didn't see).

Also rogue one is my favorite star wars&&Someone (I can‚Äôt find the article I read it in, but I believe it was Jon Favreau) said in the last couple years that if you go back and watch ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù now, it feels more like an indie action film (with a big budget) compared to more recent MCU movies, which I completely agreed with when I last watched it shortly before ‚ÄúDoctor Strange‚Äù came out. &&That's called a home theater.&&Oh, you can't?&&can I just remember it instead?&&Dude.

edit: spelling&&Nah. Kevin Smith literally left a review on...I wanna say Rotten Tomatoes (don't quote me on that).

... seriously, what has this world fucking done to me?&&Paul Newman is the most beloved member of my fraternity Phi Kappa Tau, so much so our national philanthropy is an organization he started for terminally ill children, SeriousFun. Hearing stuff like this makes me very proud to be associated with him in even just this small way :)&&#Aw no, the corn! 

^Paul ^Newman's ^gonna ^have ^mah ^legs ^broke&&Paul Newman had an affair with Jessica  Woodward and abandoned his family of 3 children. He carried on an affair with Woodward for over 5 years, having his third child with his first wife during that time.

A time when his first wife dropped out of acting to raise the family, while Newman spent her family money to go to Yale for acting, then dropping out and moving to New York to get a broadway job. He enjoyed the nightlife and clubs and women, while his wife was at home raising children and trying to find a way to make each month's rent. 

Eventually he made it big in Hollywood. His wife knew of his affair(s) and yet still tried to make the family work as they had 3 children. 

it was only when Newman knocked up Woodward that his first wife agreed to a divorce. she led a struggling life of a single mother with 3 children and a modest alimony, while Newman became a hollywood star and pretty much abandoned his first family.

Newman rarely gave interviews about his personal life, but did acknowledge to a biographer ""'Guilty as hell' was how he described himself about his first marriage, adding: 'And I'll carry it with me for the rest of my life.'&&Paul Newman started a record breaking non profit for shits and giggles and never took a dime. This is a man. 

Go watch Cool Hand Luke if you haven't seen it. Or Butch and Sundance. You must know these to be serious about movies. &&Paul Fuckmothering Newman was too good for this goddamn world. I used to live a couple blocks away from him in Connecticut and let me tell you not only was this man Gandhi levels of humble (I‚Äôm talking the Ben Kingsley version not the slightly shitty real life version) but he also was too kind.

And I know this isn‚Äôt much in comparison to Susan Sarandon‚Äôs story or many others. But this man didn‚Äôt know the meaning of the word mean. And every year before he died he and his daughter would make my fucking night on Halloween. &&You gotta love Reggie Dunlop!!!&&> Susan Sarandon has revealed that Paul Newman...

Newman and Hackman were not only A-list in the mid 90's, but were essentially screen legends. Both had twice as many Oscar wins as Sarandon and Newman also had twice as many nominations. Based on that alone I wouldn't expect them to all be paid the same. Beyond that though, the perceived value of Newman and Hackman, whether correct or not, was greater than that of Sarandon at the time. 

Even if you ignored all that, an actor may be paid more than their costars simply because a role was written specifically for them and it gives them a better negotiating position. Kirsten Dunst may be worth more than Jennifer Lawrence if the role she's being hired for *needs* her and the role Lawrence is playing could be played by any number of people. 

I don't understand why Hollywood is used as an example of pay equality when the basic structure of how people are hired and valued is so completely different than the vast majority of industries. &&I did a fundraiser last year for Paul Newman's summer camp, Camp Hole in the Wall Gang. A couple coworkers and myself raised a thousand dollars, then went to the camp for an ""adventure course.""  If you've never heard of the camp, it's in Connecticut and they take in severely ill children for free. They give kids with debilitating illnesses a happy summer memory. We toured the camp, met the staff, and even one of the campers. It was beautiful and looked like a ton of fun. From what the camper told us, it was an incredible experience to go. Newman started it and its run by his foundation. Truly a great man.&&I will never forget local news referring to Newman as being famous for his salad dressings...Not his film career, his legacy of class wins in motor racing including Lemans 24 Heurs, or just being a damn nice guy from everything I have read about him.&&He's a phenomenal actor. His wife runs (or did anyway) a small community theater near me. They put on a play he was in and he was damn good. Still sexy as hell even for an older guy.

I knew a lot of people who ran into him or helped care for him towards the end. Nothing but nice things said about him and his wife. He was just one of those genuinely lovely human beings.&&Paul Newman  is one of those people you really really hope nothing bad is ever revealed about him. Half a century of being an amazing dude could be ruined. His life story really gives me faith on humanity.&&Sounds like Susan Sarandon needs a better agent&&A better love story than Twilight&&I don‚Äôt agree with this concept. If Jennifer Lawrence (who is the most paid female actress at the moment I think) gets lots of money for a movie, why should the male co-stars get the same? Maybe they‚Äôre shit and the people only go to see her, not them. &&The way he did it shows it's a legit understanding, too. Under the table, not expecting any press about it. He's also an early bird in that he was sympathetic before it was a wide complaint. &&Dont agents negotiate in hollywood.  She should be upset with her representation at the time.  &&Yes, because Paul Newman was a more bankable star. It has nothing to do with gender. 

Just like how Jennifer Lawrence or Meryl Streep are often paid more than their male counterparts. If you are a box office draw then you will be appropriately compensated as such. &&Love that guy, he made one hell of a salad dressing in his time.&&Don't these folks have a whole industry of hangers-on (agents, managers, etc.) who are responsible for them to get paid as much as possible?
  
Don't the whole hangers-on industry responsible for contract negotiations?
  
Paul Newman shouldn't have given her money, he should have given her the number for his agent/manager.&&I was gonna make a joke about Newman's Own salad dressing but I looked it up and found out it actually was Paul Newman who started it. And 100% of the profits go to his foundation.&&Multiple foundations. You're probably thinking of the Newman's Own Foundation that distributes 100% of the food company's after-tax profits to charity.

But he also founded the [Hole in the Wall Gang](https://www.holeinthewallgang.org/about/) summer camp for severely ill children in 1988, which also does outreach to hospitals and clinics. That charity serves 20,000 kids every year. 
&&Same. I will forever upvote these ""Paul Newman was a great guy"" stories&&So fun fact, Paul Newman is an alumnus of my fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau. Our philanthropy work every summer is typically something related to Mr Newman's foundation. Along with Mitch McConnell, Paul Newman is our most famous and certainly most well-loved alum. &&and coincidentally he has also the best brand of salad dressing &&Paul Newman was a spiritually awakened being.  The stories of how he treats people and how his business that donates all profits to charity AND they are conscious of the ingredients.  I just want to know more about this person.  It almost doesn‚Äôt seem real that a person that aware really existed!

The Susan Sarandon story doesn‚Äôt surprise me at all. Everything I‚Äôve ever heard about Paul Newman makes me think this man was like a modern day Jesus or something.&&Paul Newman had an affair with Joanne ~~Tandy~~ Woodward and abandoned his family of 3 children. He carried on an affair with Woodward for over 5 years, having his third child with his first wife during that time.

A time when his first wife dropped out of acting to raise the family, while Newman spent her family money to go to Yale for acting, then dropping out and moving to New York to get a broadway job. He enjoyed the nightlife and clubs and women, while his wife was at home raising children and trying to find a way to make each month's rent. 

Eventually he made it big in Hollywood. His wife knew of his affair(s) and yet still tried to make the family work as they had 3 children. 

it was only when Newman knocked up Woodward that his first wife agreed to a divorce. she led a struggling life of a single mother with 3 children and a modest alimony, while Newman became a hollywood star and pretty much abandoned his first family.

Newman rarely gave interviews about his personal life, but did acknowledge to a biographer ""'Guilty as hell' was how he described himself about his first marriage, adding: 'And I'll carry it with me for the rest of my life.'&&On top of his great charity work I forgot how adorable he was about his wife, stolen from wikipedia:

""When once asked about his reputation for fidelity, he famously quipped, ""Why go out for a hamburger when you have steak at home?"" He also said that he never met anyone who had as much to lose as he did. In his profile on¬†60 Minutes¬†he admitted he once left Woodward after a fight, walked around the outside of the house, knocked on the front door and explained to Joanne he had nowhere to go.""&&Not surprised. They still play radio ads of him endorsing a nature conservancy. *He's helping from the friggin' grave.*&&Right!? That was a rollercoaster headline. 

**Susan Sarandon has revealed**... oh no, shit here we go, great, who assaulted her....**that Paul Newman**... FUCK, oh no man, not Paul Newman... **once gave her part of his salary**... WHEW! My man. &&It's a stretch, but we'll allow it.&&Scott Aukerman?&&Found Scott Aukerman &&Hot saucerman?&&Forget the haters, that‚Äôs solid.&&He garnished his own celery&&Very good!&&Had to check to see if you were Chef John&&I figured he was a nice guy based on the fact that his brand, Newman's Own, donates all profits to charity....but man, all these stories people have about him just makes it so much better.

that's interesting considering that your screen name is Ima_Grab_Yo_Snatch&&Well this story does involve some harassment. Paul Newman wouldn't leave Susan Sarandon alone until she accepted half of his salary.&&I liked what Penn Jillette said about him in one of his books or his podcast.
He said about meeting Paul Newman in person that, if anything, cameras were unkind to him and made him look worse. He said he that Paul Newman was one of the most physically beautiful people he ever met, and Penn is straight.&&Lol, well played. Your comment reminds me of Steve Martin's description of Tom Hanks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3KiSJqK2VA&&Well if it helps, he did admit that he cheated on his wife and they almost broke up.....&&Where does the mixed feelings come in?

Used to walk by it on my way to class for 2 years. I associate it with skateboards, snowboards, long hair, tie dyes blue smoke pouring out of the windows all day long, jam bands and metal. I should have joined. &&[deleted]&&Ay! What chapter? (Gamma Tau, ODU here) &&[Simpson's Reference.](https://youtu.be/RWsUAvRhup0)&&> Jessica Woodward 

Minor correction: She was [Joanne Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Woodward)&&That's fucked up. I still have a lot of admiration for Paul Newman, but it's more nuanced now. Thank you.&&Why is this post all the way down.

Not saying he should be crucified for this, but he's not as perfect as people in this thread make him out to be.&&At least he owned up to those mistakes. Not condoning what he did, but it says a lot about a person when they can admit they're wrong.&&Shhhh... You're going against the obvious narrative of this comment section. 

Next you'll be telling us that John Lennon was some kind of family abondoning asshole.&&In the case of this movie there was a previous agreement that the top billing actors would recieve equal payment (their names alone in the poster and commercials attract viewers) but it was later revealed that only Newman and Hackman were included in the agreement while Sarandon was left out for some reason, despite having equal billing in all promotional materials and enough name recognition by the time the movie was made.
He was just being fair on a personal level, in a time where such crappy practices were even more accepted and widespread than today.&&In 1998? Sarandon was very high profile. This was after Bull Durham and Thelma & Louise.&&>He was much higher profile than her back then.

Really? Sarandon's star was still high in the sky and his was on the descent. She had won her Best Actress oscar only three years prior, and she's been nominated 4 times. She's a hell of a star. &&I think it sort of depends: looking at the [poster for that movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119594/mediaviewer/rm208819200), Sarandon is equally billed with Newman/Hackman (potentially even higher than Hackman), so it's a bit odd if she was making significantly less. 

Of course, billing is something that's 'publicly' negotiated versus salary which is private. Imho, that's the crux of the issue, more than hollywood or even gender specifically, you only need to go to /r/jobs et al with lots of ""I just found out my coworker makes more money for the same job"" sort of posts.&&Studies have shown that women tend to be seen negatively when negotiating compared to men. Not only are men encouraged to negotiate more, but when they are aggressively negotiating its seems as positive. For women negotiating can be intimidating, and the same aggressive negotiation hurts her chances.

Let‚Äôs not pretend that men and women are see as equal value to one and other, either. People will bend over backwards to assert that the actor is far more famous, so he deserves more. They don‚Äôt acknowledge the fame of the actress. Examples of actresses earning more are always, like this, of TOP actresses of today, not a mid level actor vs a mid level actress.

They also completely discount opportunities available. Actors have more chances to star in lead roles in big films than actresses have. There‚Äôs not even a lot of female lead films to begin with. It‚Äôs going to be harder to make yourself as well known when you‚Äôre always the supporting character.

And don‚Äôt even bother looking up the pay disparity when race comes into play because a well known, accoladed black actress isn‚Äôt going to ever get paid her worth.&&This was my criticism, when the actor who played Claire Underwood on House of Cards complained(and likely derailed the series) that she wasn't as well paid as *Kevin Spacey* who was both a universally well known actor and the *lead character* on the show, who interacted the most with the ""audience"" and who actually did more than fuss. Her role was then expanded beyond her ability(or the writer's ability to write for her) and the series suffered terribly for it, particularly in season 5. 

Course now the series is ruined because of Spacey being a fucking horrible person but had that not happened it'd still have been pretty terribly derailed.&&I really have a hard time getting upset for female multi-millionaires with teams of people who negotiate salary for them. They are getting the price that the market will bear which is directly related to how many people come to see their movies. The agent has a vested interest in securing the highest pay because they work for a percentage.&&Society has always paid more for the brand name. Whether it's a product or a person. It will never change. Those brands can divvy it however they like. But in the end society pays more for the brand name.&&The pasta sauce is also pretty good. I know they make other things too. &&The story for how it originated is pretty entertaining.  Paul would insist on mixing his own dressing at a restaurant, and that led to the idea to bottle it and sell it.&&That would be one hell of a coincidence if the guy on the package named Newman that looks exactly like Paul Newman was a different guy now wouldn‚Äôt it. ;)&&his face is on every bottle yo&&That's a surprise?

The guys face is on the bottles...&&Wait Newman's Own is a charity? &&I thought that everyone realized that was the point of Newman's Own. His face is literally on the products.

Never realized his salad dressing was so popular though, it appears of all the products of his, we only had his cookies. I didn't really like them either, which I guess is why I haven't seen them in this thread.&&[Just looked it up](http://newmansownfoundation.org/files/file/NOF%20990PF%2012-31-16%20Public%20Inspection%20Copy.pdf), according to their tax filing those profits given to the charity last year were almost half a billion USD. &&he had a funny line on a (I think) Letterman appearance about it. something like: ""if I knew it would be so successful, I would have kept the money. It's too late now, though.""&&His face is on the bottle, how could you not know?&&I attended Hole In the Wall twice in the 90s, along with the Double H Hole in the Woods Ranch which is in upstate NY. Both great camps providing great environments for us kids who couldn‚Äôt easily have a normal sleepaway camp experience.

It's pretty damn good.&&Also not a bad race car driver&&Let's not forget the lemonade.&&He also was big in the automotive/racing community, racing in his younger years and supporting race teams and schools later on.

Can‚Äôt remember if its released yet but it covers his racing years and the food company &&A good reminder that it's possible to do really fucked up things and really great things all in the same lifetime. &&Do you mean Joanne Woodward? I'm pretty sure it was with her that Newman had the prolonged affair, which led to marriage in 1958. They remained married for 50 years. Jessica Tandy was quite a bit older than him too.&&Just want to point out, I don't think it's true that he entirely abandoned his kids from his first marriage. Both his son and daughter grew up to work in film, and both worked with him repeatedly in acting, producing and directing capacities (his daughter has an Emmy nomination as co-producer of one of his films, I forget which). When his son died of a drug overdose, Newman started a drug recovery centre named in his honour. 

He seems to have maintained something of a cordial relations at least his kids, of not his wife. Also, his second wife was Joanne Woodward, not Jessica. 

I also think you're mistaken about him leaving his first wife because Woodward was pregnant. It was at least two years between his divorce and the birth of his first child with Woodward. &&That‚Äôs too bad. But man if I‚Äôm judged on what ive done, specifically in my 20s, then I‚Äôm fucked forever too.&&Joanne Woodward not Jessica. They met on the set of THE LONG HOT SUMMER. He then admitted his mistake and stayed faithfully with Joanne until the day he died. 

When he was in his last days and struggling with dementia, Joanne would wake in the middle of the night to find him gone. She‚Äôd walk downstairs and find him passed out in his favorite chair. To prevent waking him, she would curl up on his feet to make sure she woke if he did. If that‚Äôs not the kind of love and devotion we should all hope for, I don‚Äôt know what is. &&[Here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1176388/Dark-heart-Mr-Sundance-A-new-book-claims-Hollywoods-golden-boy-Paul-Newman-drunken-philanderer.html) and [here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1176910/Im-guilty-hell--Ill-carry-Paul-Newmans-marriage-secrets-revealed.html) are two Daily Mail articles those stories appears to be based on.

Both of the articles are written by Shawn Levy, who also wrote the book the articles are based on. (He oddly references his own book in the article as ""a new book about to be published in America"".) It is not an authorized biography, but I didn't see anyone calling it inaccurate. I don't know much about Newman so I have no idea if any or all of the claims in the book are true or well-sourced, but I am wary of that combination of salacious detail and scant attribution. 

Shawn Levy is a film critic for The Oregonian. He is the only source I saw for the ""guilty as hell"" quote and certainly that quote is presented in the article as a response to these stories, but it could not have been because the author [never interviewed Newman](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/08/AR2009050803704.html). Levy says the biography was based on large part on interviews Newman had done with other reporters that Levy pieced together on his own.&&Well yeah but we've all done that. &&I think you‚Äôre confused and have the name incorrect. His first wife‚Äôs name is actually , Jackie Witte. His 2nd wife and fellow actor was Joanne Gignilliat Trimmier Woodward .
Scott Newman was their (he & Joanne‚Äôs) son died from a drug overdose. After his death they established the Scott Newman Center in his honor, dedicated to preventing drug abuse through education
That‚Äôs when they started doing charity. Everyone has faults. No one is perfect. Perhaps this was his way of paying it forward for his imagined ‚Äòsins‚Äô. Idk &&*Joanne Woodward.

I love Paul and Joanne, but the details of how they got together are almost always glossed over. I'm not condoning cheating, but sometimes it happens that the person you try to build a life with turns out to not be the right one for you. You meet someone else with whom the chemistry is undeniable, and that was what happened with them. &&OH Here we go, All enjoying a nice talk about Mr. Newman and this dingus has to come in and ruin it. Yeah, ya know, Like ok. &&Reminds me of that Johnny Cash movie&&If I'm not mistaken Newman, with Woodward, actually had custody of all six of his children, including the 3 from the previous marriage. &&> **Susan Sarandon has revealed**... oh no, shit here we go, great, who assaulted her....**that Paul Newman**...

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/82zcxk/susan_sarandon_has_revealed_that_paul_newman_once/dve6rrn&&Hey, so I was a camper for about 10 years and later a counselor for several summers at a couple of SeriousFun camps. They're camps that are made available to kids with chronic and life threatening illnesses, free of cost to the camper and the parents.

They're all remarkable, too. The staff is trained to the gills in terms of safety, and a heavy emphasis is placed on emotional development for children who spend much of their lives in the hospital. 

Check out their website for more- https://www.seriousfunnetwork.org/

Also, I'm super happy to answer any other questions&&To be honest I'm not 100% on everything they do, I never had the privilege to volunteer at one of them during my time. I think the gist of it is that it's a series of summer camps designed for terminally ill children to go to during the summer completely free to charge and tailored for them so that they can spend a summer just being normal kids and forget about their illness as much as possible. 

When I was in the fraternity as an active member my chapter was in a poor state, but I and many of my brothers did our best to improve things, so now my chapter at SFSU is able to send brothers to the camps every summer to volunteer. Our closest camp that we send active brothers to is here in California at Painted Turtle and they always say it's a life changing experience to give back and volunteer there. Very proud of what Paul Newman started and the all of the efforts my fraternity does to donate to that great cause.

*Edit: The camps may be open outside of summer as well, not sure though*&&Burt Reynolds is Phi Delta Theta. Not that they are really related or anything, but that's our big alumn I guess&&Every chapter's different. For one my chapter doesn't have an official house because we're fairly young, less than 30 years old, and in san francisco so since we don't have 200k to drop on a down payment, no house.


As someone who doesn't skate, snowboard, or smoke, still sounds like a fun chapter of guys to me haha.&&My chapter was a mess when I joined, but by the time I left we were able to get things in order so now they're able to send actives to volunteer there every summer. They always talk about how life changing volunteering there is.

One thing we've really improved upon was our philanthropy donations which go to SeriousFun. When I was active we'd be lucky to donate $500 a year, but now the chapter donates between $3000-$5000 every year which is really an accomplishment for a chapter our size, just under 50 guys, and a greek life at SFSU that is very small. Of course we want to improve on that and one thing I'm working on is our alumni relations so they will donate to the chapter and SeriousFun. Being able to donate $10,000 one of these years would really be great and a personal point of pride knowing where my chapter came from. Slow and steady, one day we'll get there.

Anyone interested in donated please google SeriousFun and check it out, every dollar helps!&&Ayy Zeta Lambda represent&&Heyyy! SFSU, Epsilon Theta.

but in his young adult life, he was a horrible human being. selfish, self centered, almost a dozen drunk and disorderlys, callous with women and a bad father. 

perhaps guilt is what motivated his public work later in life. it was clearly a wound that never healed, but i've always had issue with the Newman-as-saint portrayal.

Knew a couple over at PT, too.&&You mean Turd Ferguson?&&A more apt comparison would be Robert de Niro and Jennifer Lawrence.  Paul Newman wasn't exactly a blockbuster draw in the 90s.&&I am old enough to remember when this movie came out and Paul Newman was a legend but he hadn't actually been in a hit movie in years, probably since The Color of Money in 1986 whereas Susan Sarandon was at the height of her career at that point, just coming off an Oscar win and a bunch of hit movies.  I'd argue that Gene Hackman at that point was probably a bigger draw than Newman but I don't have any data or anything.  &&It also depends on how much less she was making, though. By that time, she had also won an Oscar and had four other nominations (one being for Thelma & Louise). This film also came out around her peak popularity, so her name would have been a significant draw. &&My point was more that both billing and salary are negotiated - i.e. there is no formula saying your draw is X based on XYZ so you should get this. But the one negotiated publicly she was able to secure equal footing (or potentially higher than Hackman) but not the one privately negotiated.

&&Of course it's true that box office numbers don't equal what actors are paid, but it's not so straightforward. A lot of the industry is based on a kind of gambling. If they think they can make a lot of money based on the perceived star power of someone, they might pay them more. The same is true in lots of industries. I don't think Annie Leibowitz's contribution to Vanity Fair is necessarily worth 500 times what they probably pay for normal commissions, but they evidently do. I don't see the injustice in that. She should get as much as she can and it's up to Vanity Fair to decide her value to them. &&Yep. Have you tried the limeade? It's also incredibly delicious. &&THIS.

honestly sounds like my 20s.. I was pretty terrible toward people who showed me love (i.e. partners, parents). Makes me cringe looking back. &&I‚Äôve always liked this Doctor Who quote (which I think is relevant): 

The Doctor: ‚ÄúThe way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things, but vice-versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.‚Äù&&Everyone is flawed.  It‚Äôs the people that learn from their mistakes that are less flawed. &&Well, not to nitpick, but many of the most admired and cherished actual saints spent their youth as lost souls too. Many of them did things considerably worse than Paul Newman, like St. Augustine or St. Paul. I'm sure you didn't mean the word saint literally, but I guess the point I'm driving at is that no one is a saint and everyone deserves the chance to make up for their mistakes and Paul Newman did a far better job of it than most.&&It‚Äôs almost as if people can make mistakes, or that they don‚Äôt always stay in love with the first person they marry and sometimes do irrational things in order to compensate.

As far as I know, he didn't kill or rape anyone.  And he seems to have been a decent father to all of his kids, including the ones from the first marriage.

Lots of bruises, needles every few days of my life, but overall its extremely well managed, and doesn't impact my life much these days (im 25 now). The large majority of the children that go to camp (at least the ones I've worked at) have campers that are at least moderately medically stable. For example, most campers with cancer that come are in remission.

So yeah, absolutely, with a big caveat. They all have pretty robust medical centers, and usually climate controlled, comfortable cabins. So outdoor time is available but generally less than what you would expect at most summer camps. Also, the camps are all extremely regimented on programming times. There's not much free time to laze around as it were, as there is a big focus on developing skills of campers through events like archery, woodshop, and teambuilding/climbing.

lol, the top review from August 24th, 2014:

>I wish I could give this product 10 stars. I really do. You see, I have been in a very unfulfilling relationship for 2 years. I started out happy, but gradually, I lost that loving feeling. The trouble was that his deeply passionate affection for me had not abated in the least; if anything, Brian had fallen so much in love that he would cry every time he said, ""I love you,"" which was a few dozen times per day. This may have contributed to my growing apathy. I am a caring person and I DO love him (like a brother); I certainly didn't want to break his heart. This is why I have remained in the relationship for so long. I have wracked my brains trying to come up with a way to make him want to leave me. His mother had me over for Thanksgiving dinner. She had flown her long-lost brother over from Poland and had spent days preparing a sumptuous feast. Right after Grace was said, I climbed up on the table, pulled down my panties, and took a massive dump on the sage-infused turkey and stuffing. His family has shunned me; he not only stayed with me, he also shunned THEM in return. Even after I doused all his clothes in gasoline and put them, his state-of-the-art home media system, and the teddy bear his deceased grandmother had given him as a boy in his beautifully-restored Shelby Cobra 427 SC and threw in a burning book of matches, he didn't even get mad! He smiled, pulled me close, and said that I was the only thing he couldn't bear to lose. Well, heck, after tat, what was I going to do? So cut to last night. We had just sat down to watch ""King of the Hill"" (the one where Boomhauer gets his heart broken by that dang ol' rich girl-I love that one), and it was going to be a casual dinner night-Tostitos and dip. I had seen this salsa queso dip at publix and thought it would be tasty. I handed Brian the jar and tore open the chips bag. He unscrewed the lid. An unearthly stench immediately assaulted our nostrils. I spontaneously blew grits into the brand new bag of chips. My vomit and the substance in the jar were indiscernible. Same look, same odor. Brian flew into a rage. ""WHAT THE H E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS ARE YOU TRYING TO DO-KILL US BOTH????"" I shook my head in confusion, unable to answer. He strode into my bedroom, grabbed the few belongings of his that were I my place, and shouted, ""DONT EVER LET ME SEE YOUR WICKED FACE AGAIN!"" That's it. He's gone. Thank you, Newman's Own, even though my pet ferret got into the stuff and licked a little of it, then promptly fell over dead.&&SHUT YOUR MOUTH, THOSE MINT OREOS ARE THE STUFF LEGENDS.&&No way, Newman o's are a substantially better cookie. &&You can't out-Oreo the Oreo. &&Truth be told, the dog treats make a great biscotti.&&Butt-salmic&&I agree the tomato basil is superior.&&What Paul had there was a failure to communicate....how he wanted his dressing to be prepared.&&That's Cool Hand Luke... who's gonna stop him.

They still have a couple of stores around shopping malls and the like, but the funniest was when they opened up on Lygon Street which is our Little Italy and for which has a reputation (along with the rest of Melbourne) as being HUGE on quality coffee. Seriously, we're absolutely snobbish as fuck about it. Everyone kinda laughed about the arrogance of it all. It closed pretty quickly, along with 70% of other Starbucks stores.&&Look up Paul Newman, he's a Hollywood icon with a great catalogue :)&&> Source: Father of 3 year old that's obsessed with the Cars franchise.

He is an animation great, and it's sad to see him leave, but he left an amazing legacy. &&He went out with a bang because Moana is beautiful.&&A retirement well earned. He and Ron Clements made my childhood. Treasure Planet is underrated.&&[deleted]&&Odd to say, but this guy helped raise me&&>Musker had been a key figure at the Disney animation studio where he co-directed seven features with his creative partner **Ron Clements: The Great Mouse Detective**

Must've been great to be paired with someone who also had a career solving rodent-related crimes.... &&Very panicky couple of seconds until halfway-ish through that headline. Damn you, aging idols.&&It's a shame what happened to his and Clements love-child Treasure Planet,being delayed by Disney for a decade and then sunk in favor of CGI over Deep Canvas.  Regardless, a fantastic career.&&It amazes how Disney continues to make great classic films. Moana is the latest one in that list and I knew the moment I saw it that Disney did it again. These guys that made all these wonder films are reaching that age that retirement is a must and that makes me wonder if the newer generation of talent at Disney can keep the legacy going.&&Aladdin is still the best Disney movie ever IMO.&&Thank for the awesome childhood experiences. Aladdin  4 Life.&&This is the first positive retirement post I've seen in two years. &&I nearly had a heart attack when I saw John at the top of reddit. I though he had possibly passed away. My fianc√© worked with him at Disney on Moana. She‚Äôs said a few times he‚Äôs been one of the best directors to work with. Met him at the Moana premiere and he took photos with every cast memeber that lined up. He must of been there for two hours. One of the best people in Animation. It‚Äôs upsetting he‚Äôs retiring. &&The Little Mermaid will always hold a special place in my heart. My now 21 years-old daughter and I would watch this movie, together, over and over again. At the end she would always get a little sad, and one day she explained to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sad because she has to leave her daddy.‚Äù Hard to fight back those tears even as I wrote this. So, thank you, Joh Musker. Although I doubt you‚Äôll ever see this, I still wanted to let you know just how special this work is to me. &&I met John a few months back when he came in for an interview at my school, this guy is the best. I was in a class that produced and broadcast the interview, and he remembered all my classmates and my name after only being introduced to everyone once. The way he tells stories in person is just as magical as the way he tells stories in his movies. Also Moana is the best movie ever&&Loved *The Great Mouse Detective*.&&My aunts husband was an illustrator for Young and Rubicam in advertising back before computers when you had to draw the entire ad by hand and his dream was to work at Disney. I remember the whole family was on pins and needles when he submitted his book to them and they rejected his work even though his book was pretty much all Disney and to my eye was flawless(his book is a family treasure and I have seen it as an adult and it is flawless and just looks like any the story of Disney book except the drawings are all hand drawn and painted). He told me to work at Disney was like working for Spielberg. Just to get into Disney was impossible let alone having a career with Disney producing this kind of filmography. It's mind boggling to me to be that good at what you do that when you list the filmography all these titles come out [EDIT] I remember as a kid the man would sit me next to him at his desk he would take a legal sheet of paper draw circles across it and then from those circles out would come out lady,from lady and the tramp,walking and then running then stopping and then looking up and down and turning her neck and coming back to look you in the eye with a smile. magic to one kid, I can imagine how satisfied this man is that he created magic for a bunch more kids.&&Yes but who is the one responsible for hiding dirty things in these films?&&Fun fact: Around April fool's day, the staff at disney have a showcase where everyone can submit caricatures of other staff members. John Musker was renowned for making really crazy ones, and he would often submit wayyy more than anybody else. &&I think now would be the best time to watch the reasons why another one of his movies, Treasure Planet, is the best Disney movie: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sycdSkngA&&More than likely he'll stick around as a consultant. A lot of Disney legends do this when they retire&&Very well deserved&&Ah damn that sucks. At least he went out on a high note!&&I want to shake his hand and thank him for making my childhood bright. &&As I read the title I was increasingly worried that he had died until I reached the end.

This has been a sad few years.&&Omg.  I have a drawing he did of me nearly 20 years ago.   He is so sweet.&&They need to do a case study of kids raised off these movies and kids not raised off these movies. I‚Äôve learned some powerful lessons from them and will pass their messages to my kids.&&I hope he retires knowing how awesome the public thinks his work is! I hope he has a sense of satisfaction and knows how much his work is admired and appreciated. Good job, Sir!&&Thanks for the awesome childhood!

&&I'm glad he wasn't fired just days before retirement.&&Thanks for the movies! Loved Aladdin and Hercules sad to see him leave but he left behind a legacy of movies that we will show are kids for ever.&&He will be missed. Hope he and Ron have cameos in the new Aladdin movie&&Aladdin was so enjoyable for me&&Animation has lost a few good men this month. Brian Kesinger and Nathan Greno have moved on this month as well.

Edit: Should clarify ""Disney Animation""&&As animation geek this is kinda heartbreaking. &&I had no idea I owed much of my childhood to this guy. These movies were amazing!!!! &&One of my favorites. The man helped bring to life my favorite movie of all time, Treasure Planet. Here's to hoping Disney revisits it once they make billions more off of their streaming service&&That's a shame.  He's a very talented man!&&A retirement well earned, I hope he enjoys it.  &&Usually, these titles end a lot differently. Very happy to see that it was the word ""retires"" as opposed to anything else. Wishing him a happy retirement!&&Elon may be Musk, but John is Musker.&&But how am I going to get the treasure planet sequel?! &&Wow 40 years! A ton of changes in Animation over that time.&&What legacy to leave behind. Not many directors can say, ""I'm responsible for helping make ___ become the behemoth it is today. When the company was in a bad time""

These timeless characters, songs, and moments to enjoy with the family. And, they're iconic, you can instantly recognize them. This man has influenced a generation of artist. And, indirectly help create a large amount of Rule 34.&&You've done good work, sir. &&A part of me wondered if Moana would be his last film. There were little throwbacks to a bunch of his previous movies (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Hercules off the top of my head). It felt like a career retrospective to a certain degree. 

What a beautiful way to end a remarkable run. &&dang. This guy helped raise my childhood in the 90s.&&So, out of curiosity, was he employed by Disney and paid a Disney salary for directing or was he under a development deal and separately employed as a Director on each of those films? I feel like he would make more if he was retained as a Director separately for each of those films but I don't know how the union rules work for that.&&Yeahhhh let's get some love for Basil the great mouse detective. To this day it's still one of the greatest and darkest Disney movies that nobody seems to remember.&&Definitely thought the title was going to say he died.. *Fshew*&&Sad, but completely understandable. From what I'm hearing ""Treasure Planet"" was his passion project, he didn't really enjoy working on the ""classic"" Disney movies like ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Hercules"", but pretty much had to do them in order to be able to make the kind of movies he liked. But with ""Treasure Planet"" flopping and the far more traditional ""Moana"" breaking the bank, it probably convinced him that he should pursue his vision elsewhere. That, and the fact that the production of ""Moana"" was unbelievably stressful, with scenes being written, storyboarded and animated within a very, very short amount of time to the point where entire characters were added, cut and completely rewritten (originally the pig was meant to be the sidekick and not the chicken, which was essentially saved by one final draft where they completely rewrote his character into being dumb as a doorknob, and from what I'm hearing Tamatoa wasn't part of the story until very late in development). I mean, I'm just speculating here, for all I know dude probably just wanted a happy retirement after many successful years, but if I had to guess I'd say that Disney was pushing him and Ron Clements to do another princess movie in the wake of ""Moana"", but he turned it down and chose to walk away.&&Met the guy at an Oscar event last year. He was super cool and talked all about his time on The Little Mermaid and Moana... I even got him to sigh my program!  Hope he enjoys retirement!https://i.imgur.com/Sv9MOy7.jpg&&Just wanted to thank him here bc he really my childhood great with the movied he worked on. &&Reading the title I half expected it to end in ""has died.""&&Ok I‚Äôll just get it out there, don‚Äôt hate me. Elon might be **Musk**, but this guy is **Musker**. I hate myself..&&The Little Mermaid and Aladdin are two of my favorite Disney movies. I hate that they don't 2d art anymore. &&Wait, a 40 year Hollywood vet is retiring and it doesn't involve trying to bang kids or raping women? Haven't seen that in a while&&Awwww, so sad to see his tenure end. He‚Äôs an amazing director and I loved what he did for ‚ÄúTreasure Planet‚Äù as well. &&Man, reading the title of this was an emotional rollercoaster.

""Aw shit he died? Oh wait, is he a sexual predator of some sort? Oh no he's just retiring, thank god!""&&Hope he enjoys his retirement. It is well deserved sir, from the child in me. &&Aladdin was my very first movie as a child. Thanks Mr. Musker! Retirement well earned. &&Hey, it's my day to say you're welcome&&Typical brain starts reading the title, and before finishing it, felt bad that we lost another legend. I'm pleasantly surprised that that's not the case this time. Too much bad celebrity news lately makes you start to assume :(&&Gotta go watch treasure planet for the 172nd time. Ya know, for old times sake.&&His Genie-themed leaving banner was pretty neat:

https://instagram.com/p/BgfC3cbj6n_&&I wonder if it was his idea for that classic scene in The Little Mermaid, right at the very end, where the priest has a boner... Anyone else remember that? Showed that to my mom when I was in 9th grade, me and my three younger brothers are all dying laughing, and shes just staring in disbelief at what she's looking at.&&Is he why I enjoyed Moana so much more than the other recent Disney stuff?&&My family LOVES Moana. We love it so much that we made sure to play it while my wife was giving birth to our daughter. Lol 
Truly a Disney gem that doesn‚Äôt get its recognition. I think it‚Äôs better than Frozen&&The first two got my attention but what is Moana
&&Moana was better than Frozen. &&[deleted]&&What's interesting, is that Musker/Clements wanted to make Treasure Planet since the '80s, but it was going to cost too much, and it was in the period after The Black Cauldron where Disney was struggling. The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, Hercules, etc. were all done so Disney would give them the green light on Treasure Planet.&&Since he hasn't won an Oscar yet, I wonder if he'll get an Honorary Oscar because those movies he directed has made an impact on Disney. Specifically Aladdin, Hercules and Moana&&Man, Great Mouse Detective is a classic. Vincent Price was amazing as Ratigan. Probably one of the most adult animated Disney movies I've ever seen. &&[deleted]&&Treasure Planet is my shit.&&This guy made my two favorite Disney movies, Great Mouse Detective and Treasure Planet.  Hot damn.&&If I remember correctly Treasure Planet was the movie he wanted to make for years and after working on 4 highly successful Disney films he finally got the chance to make it and it's a great film too bad it didn't do well in theaters.&&He basically directed my childhood
&&All of which are absolute bangers. The guy is a Legend. I mean Tresaure Planet ftw.&&He and Ron Clements also have what Disney considers as one of their worst films on their resume.  The Black Cauldron.&&Really though, you could just list 7 random Disney theatrical releases and it would be a pretty impressive filmography.&&I loved treasure planet&&Wow he did some incredible work. 

&&Damn, a seriously impressive resume.

One of the greats.&&I guess the question now is, which Disney park window will his name appear. They put the names of retired Disney employees who have made a huge impact on the company on the windows at places like Main street USA.&&Great video by Lindsey Ellis on these guys, during her review of Hercules:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KznZcK7ksf4&&These are basically my favourite movies &&My 2 year old makes us watch Moana every day.

Damn him! Damn that man!&&I was gonna say, just 3 films? did he only work for 5 or those 40 years and just relax the rest lol&&At least he didn't die.&&>You're welcome

-John Musker &&Herc and treasure planet are two of my favorite movies, guys a legend in my book&&He started off with Basil : The great mouse detective. Instant legendary starting status. Still to this day that film terrifies me in the best ways.&&I love Treasure Planet one of the most underrated movies Disney has produced. Beautiful animations, great characters, and a story line that is away from the typical love story and singing. God bless that man for giving us so many jewels &&I somehow have seen literally none of them&&God it makes me angry Zootopia won over Moana. I know I‚Äôm in the minority, but I really didn‚Äôt like Zootopia that much.   It was just okay that was ridiculously heavy handed. &&To say that he left an amazing legacy is sort of an understatement. Every single one of those films are held in high esteem and are loved by just about everyone. This dude did some amazing work. I just want to shake his hand and thank him for all these wonderful films. &&For whatever reason Princess and the Frog is the one Disney movie since my childhood that I just completely missed, but apparently I really need to watch it since I love every other movie on that list.  &&So true. I honestly thought it looked like a turd when I saw the ads but watched it recently and it was absolutely beautiful. Since have seen it three times. &&[deleted]&&It sure is! My two boys just adore this movie, and listen to the soundtrack all the time.&&Sounds beautiful too. Lin-Manuel Miranda (the guy who wrote and starred in Hamilton) made the soundtrack and it‚Äôs amazing. &&My niece knows 7 words. 4 are Moana characters if you count ‚ÄúHei-Hei‚Äù as two words. &&seriously. maybe the best Disney of the 21st century so far. &&It truly is. Easily my favorite Disney movie of the last several years. I haven't seen Coco yet, though.&&Weirdly I think it's his least great work. I mean fucking hell, treasure planet is great. I haven't seen the black cauldron tough.&&Imo, the best Disney film ever.&&I love this film. I love it more than Frozen.

I have a 4 year old daughter and a 2 year old son. She loves it for the song Moana sings when she sees the spirit of her Grandma. He loves it for ""You're welcome!"" (""AND THANK YOU""). They both know that my favourite is Shiny.

It's a film where the young girl isn't defined by a romantic relationship. She has something she wants to do, but she puts her village's needs above her own. But when she realises she can solve the problem she's not afraid to set out on her own, against her parents' wishes. And she comes back having proven herself. 

She won because she realised a thing that was worth doing was worth doing even if everyone else says you can't do it. She won because she was tenacious and because she put the effort into learning the skills she needed. And she took those skills back to her village and her family, and taught them new ways of doing things. And in so doing, she became an adult, and her parents' equal. 

It's one of the best films for young girls I've seen.&&Moana is awesome! My daughter is 4 and I never mind when she wants to watch it yet again. I always want to sing along to ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Welcome‚Äù!&&MOANA!!!

It‚Äôs all about knowing who you are! Moana feels something inside her calling her to follow who she really is, Maui believes the hook defines who he is, Tamatoa is trying to make himself look better on the outside, Tala the grandma knows exactly who she is and even tattoos a future rendition of herself, Moana‚Äôs parents try to deny who they really are. Just know who you are and see how far you‚Äôll go!!!&&Definitely. Moana instantly became my favorite Disney film. I wish I had seen it in theaters instead of netflix.&&I agree that Treasure Planet is underrated.&&one of my favorites, and also the one of my best friends daughter, whenever i babysit we must se the ""the cartoon space princess movie""&&[deleted]&&Probably didn't help that it came out the same year as *Spirited Away*.&&One of my favourites of the New Disney stuff :)&&Then I guess it's a good thing they hadn't been hired by someone else in the meantime:

&&Aladdin was my life as a child. I couldn't get enough of that movie. Robin Williams as the genie was incredible. I love that I can watch it now and pick up on jokes and references that I didn't get as a kid.

[*I can't believe it, I'm losing to a rug*](https://joshubuh.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/genie-robin-williams-quote.gif)&&Most people could say the same if they're under 40 or so.&&Odd but true! I was 8 when The Little Mermaid came out, so the late 80s/90s Disney Renaissance hit at the perfect time for me. A big part of my childhood.&&I'm not crying, *you're* crying!!!!!

üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò¢&&I was half expecting the headline to end with ‚Äú... due to sexual assault allegations‚Äù&&This is the first I‚Äôve heard of this CGI piece. Care to elaborate?&&I think they can. People like Bryon Howard got his start as an inbetweener and animator for Pocahontas, Mulan, and Lilo & Stitch. Since then he's co-directed Bolt, Tangled, and Zootopia. Chris Buck, though a little bit older, was an animator for Rescuers Down Under and Little Mermaid and went on to direct Frozen.

While the greats are starting to move into retirement the people who got their starts in those movies are starting to take over directing duties and I'm sure in the future animators and storyboard artists working on Zootopia and Frozen will go on to direct their own projects.&&Coco is technically the ‚Äúlast one in that list‚Äù it‚Äôs pretty much a masterpiece. &&Coco was just as good&&One of my favorite things to do recently has been watching the credits of Disney Renaissance films and playing ""spot the talent"" as people like Brenda Chapman, Chris Buck, Joe Ranft, and others who went on to have huge impacts later at Pixar and WDAS were in those smaller supporting animator roles honing their craft.  

I think we saw a drop off in quality after Walt's death in part because he was gone and in part because there wasn't that active training of the next generation during his life.  That has been fixed in part by CalArts and in part by the personal drive that so many animators have had to mentor (started by some of the Nine Old Men as I think they realized the dearth of talent out there during the 70s.)  That's what annoyed me the most about the recent Lasseter revelations: that so much potential talent may have been demotivated by a less-than-supportive environment.


&&I would rank it among my favourites. 

-Great animation

-Great characters and character development

-Great story, with complex elements and lots of twists

-Great songs

-Great action

It has everything that makes Disney movies great.&&Beauty and the Beast for me. And I‚Äôm a 34 year old male... &&Yep. For me, top 3 is:

1. Aladdin
2. The Lion King
3. Robin Hood
&&That's an odd way to spell The Lion King&&I've tried to think of something that I could throw in the ring against that but I think I gotta agree with you. 

A lot of Disney movies have some of the qualities that Aladin has but not all of them at once.&&My only real complaint against Aladdin is a lot of the jokes are incredibly dated. Things like the William F. Buckley, Jack Nicholson, and Rodney Dangerfield impersonations, while I find them great, really won't stand up as well to younger audiences without needing some explanation.

To me that's the only thing really holding it back from being in my Top 5 Disney animated films.&&[deleted]&&And from a Disney employee no less.  I wonder how many of their employees are paid a living wage.&&I‚Äôm jealous, you heard him tell a story. That imagination must have been incredible. üòä&&I haven't seen it yet. I am trying to watch or re-watch all WDAS movies, and so far I haven't come across it yet. 

Hope it is good. &&[deleted]&&Not everything that's been hidden in Disney films were perverted, things like hidden words such as ""SEX"" in reality spell out SFX as a shout out to the special effects crew.&&Thanks for this. Always up for watching some good Disney content. &&It's really quite the masterpiece.&&I swear this video is everywhere now. Just a pleasure to watch.&&Deliver&&Lucky for him Michael Eisner isn't still running things.&&Foreal..disappointing world we live in.&&> the production of ""Moana"" was unbelievably stressful

Former Disney animator here who worked with John on Moana. If he didn't enjoy working on Moana he certainly didn't show it! He was relaxed and hugely enjoying himself throughout. He contributed massively creatively. He was always an absolute pleasure to work with. Certainly I didn't find the production stressful compared to other movies.

Last minute story rewrites and character changes is standard operating procedure at Disney and happens on *every* movie.  If anything, I'd say Moana had less of that than other recent movies. Zootopia and Frozen in particular had very drastic story changes very late in development. 

Tamatoa was part of early drafts as I recall. It was just one of the last sections to be fully animated so there was more scope to make last-minute changes. And if there's a chance to make last minute changes Disney always does so! HeiHei the chicken wasn't added late in the development either but was there from the start. They changed the character - sure - but it wasn't a last minute addition.  Again, changing character traits late in development is very normal based on test screening feedback. One of the reasons Disney stories are so strong is they aren't afraid to make changes. Nothing is untouchable. Nor should it be.

I mean, it's nice to be acknowledged, but it's not really important, is it?&&Why on earth is this comment being downvoted?

The Great Mouse Detective is a lesser-known Disney movie, but it is *definitely* an underrated classic. It was a favorite childhood movie of mine and I recently rewatched it with my son fully prepared for it to be much worse than I remembered... But it *really* holds up... and this is weird to say of an animated movie - but the ""acting"" is fantastic. The characters have so much personality through the script, voice work, and animation... And [Vincent Price](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001637/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm) *was* amazing in his role. He even said it was one of his favorite roles he's ever done which is saying a lot for a fairly legendary actor.

Also, it is a bit surprising how adult the movie is in parts - particularly the bar scene. And there's a lot of violent/dark themes throughout the plot too.

Anyways... such a good movie and I'm grumpy that people downvoted your comment. So there.&&The opening scene scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. &&Aaaaaaaand now I have his theme song suck in my head. I hate you.

But for reals, that was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid.&&I dunno, Hunchback was pretty adult with its themes, I mean Frollo burned down the city hunting down Esmeralda and then tried to burn her when she refused his advances.

But GMD is amazing!

Great for trivia and stumping workers at Disney World. &&The mixture of 2D and 3D animation was incredible for its time, still holds up really well&&English slang sure is strange.&&Treasure Planet is one of the best Disney movies of the 2000s.  It is an underappreciated masterpiece. &&Both super underrated. I absolutely loved the Great Mouse Detective growing up. Hercules has always been one of my favorites as well and now Moana is a modern day classic imo. So much talent.&&He didn't direct that movie.&&Home on the range

Actually harder than I thought. I stuck to only movies released by the Walt Disney animation studio. &&Each film takes multiple years (at least 3-6) to make. &&Disney don't just hire people to be directors. He started out as a character animator, and then worked as a story artist. He has also been involved with pitching/early concept stuff, and worked on several projects that didn't get off the ground. I don't think any career at Disney is really relaxed, they're too demanding for that!&&I thought Zootopia was better than Moana in every other aspect than it's soundtrack, but to each their own. &&What I love, and will always love, about Disney is their ability to move me--the [moment the grandmother dies and follows as a spirit animal into the water, passing Moana](#spoiler) left me completely broken up crying. 

And that is not the first Disney film to do so (nor, I doubt, will it be the last). Sometimes their films are ""eh, that was ok/fun for little kids"", but I've never walked away from their animated movies thinking, ""That was downright *terrible*"".&&Absolutely agree. I don't know what it was, but after seeing the previews for it I was oddly... against it for some reason. Maybe because I just did **not** like Frozen nor did I understand why it was so massively popular. Then our 4-year-old wanted to watch Moana on Netflix and immediately afterwards I was going ""Why aren't more people talking about how awesome this movie is??""&&I watch it almost every day because my two year old daughter is obsessed with Maui. She sleeps with a tiny little Maui action figure every night! We bought it when it was released I‚Äôm not even sick of it. 

I love the story, and it‚Äôs visually just gorgeous! 

&&I've watched it about 20 times plus.

I also have a toddler.&&I saw it at a 2-for-1 drive in. Rogue One and then Moana.

It is the perfect pairing if you watch Rogue One first and then Moana. That Star Wars movie was pretty intense and serious, and Moana was light and funny. The contrast was awesome.&&You can't run from me, oh wait, yes you can, you keep surprising me.

I love the crab, me and my late 20's mate sing drab crab all the fucking time.&&Yeah, I mean, what else can you say?&&That GIF would dominate this thread if they were allowed - Man Moana is a great movie.&&That‚Äôs the Lin-Manuel Miranda effect, IMO. ‚ù§Ô∏è&&It's the first movie my kid actually wants to watch from beginning to end.  I don't mind; it's a solid movie with good music.  I even find myself humming the tunes from time to time.

They also got bonus points from me for having Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as the voice of Tamatoa.  That was an unexpected surprise.&&I had no idea he made the soundtrack! That's fantastic!&&I don‚Äôt think you could ever count ‚ÄòHei-Hei‚Äô as two words. &&Coco is pretty spectacular IMHO but it gets a lot of hate for being similar to Book of Life. &&And the music! so good. &&It's not underrated by viewers, it was underrated by Disney tho.&&I think it is rated&&[deleted]&&bombing at the box office=not a lot of people saw it=not as many people know about it=not as many (absolute number of) people like it as a bigger Disney flick=underrated&&More people need to watch Linday Ellis, she's fucking brilliant.&&Why did it bomb? Poor marketing?&&> It just bombed in the box office but people all say they love it. It got an oscar nom too if i remember correctly.

I don't disagree with you generally but although the movie did get an Oscar mom, Oscar nominations for Best Animated Movie mean very little.

It's a lot of work to put out an animated movie which means that anything that comes out and ISN'T complete garbage gets a nom. Any Disney movie is likely to get a Best Animated Movie nom even if it is a total stinker - and half the time they only get pushed out bevause of OTHER Disney movies (for example Treasure Planet and Lilo & Stitch were both in the same year).

Not *every* movie can be *Boss Baby*, after all.&&[deleted]&&Mine too. I just find it amazing how they can humanize animated characters. How could he have made a more Robin Williams genie, I don‚Äôt even fucking know. &&Dude I totally sympathize. Aladdin came out when I was ~3 or 4. That was ""my movie"" when it eventually came out on VHS. That was the cheapest babysitter I ever had.&&Yup. His movies are some of my favorite of all time, animated or otherwise. I'll always watch Aladdin if I'm flipping through channels and see that it's on. &&I was expecting it to say he‚Äôd died. &&[Here](https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA) is a really good video that extensively covers this topic.&&I first learned of it from [this video essay](https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA).  The theory goes, Pixar CGI was becoming a cash cow and Deep Canvas remained expensive.  They had already planned for a sequel so they sank the first one so they could quietly kill the old tech and not have to make a second.  Whether or not you believe that, you can see them cheaping out on marketing and even released it against The Santa Clause 2, their own blockbuster.&&I can hardly wait, the Easter Bunny is bringing Coco to my kids.
&&But Coco is a Pixar Studios one, rather than Disney Animation Studios. I know Disney owns Pixar, but Pixar has its own studio location and way of doing things. &&Exactly! And it had just enough stuff to be thrilling/semi-scary growing up; the Cave of Wonders coming to life and eating the unworthy, the Sultan getting hypnotized, Jafar turning into the snake.&&Plus it had probably the greatest singular acting performance in Robin Williams. &&It's my go to example for describing how to make effective magic systems.  The climax of that movie work really well because the rules of how Genie magic works (phenomenal cosmic power, itty bitty living space) was well established earlier.  Vs say Tangled where the flower magic does new things during the climax.&&Honestly it's probably Disney Animation's No. 2 behind only Beauty and the Beast which is probably the most perfect animated movie of all time.&&-	Robin Williams &&Think we're very closely aligned, provided we take Disney/Pixar movies out the mix. &&Ahhhh me too! So glad to see Robin Hood get some love, it never seems to rank high in general. I'd be hard-pressed to round out a Top 5, after these... so many great films. &&Lion King is a close second to Aladdin.

My problem is that Scar isn't quite as good a villain as other Disney movies. At first he's excellent (the Be Prepared scene still gives me chills), but then just kind of walks in and becomes whiny. 

 I think if they kept the [deleted scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl8gDjaHWWA) in, it would be better in my books.&&Those jokes were for the adults anyway so I don't think kids today will really give it a second thought.&&Maybe the references give you a greater appreciation for it, but I remember as an immigrant child watching Aladdin I loved it even though I didn‚Äôt understand any of the impersonations- he was just a goofy character to me. Just my 2 cents&&[deleted]&&Then you'd hate the educational edit, *Al: Addin' 4 Life.*&&It seems to slip under the radar a bit. It was one of the only Disney movies my Grandma had, but it's great. The villian is a mad man. Or rat, in this case.&&I saw it recently, and I‚Äôll try to give my nostalgia-free two cents. 

It‚Äôs good, maybe even very good, but too slight to be considered truly great.&&If you‚Äôre ever in Burbank check out the Story Tavern. Their bar gives discounts to studio employees, so there‚Äôs a wall of sketches that Disney, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network animators have left. My personal favorite is a snail eating a dick taco.&&Can confirm. Visited a friend who worked at a major animation studio a few years back and saw more furry porn than anybody would ever have to see in a lifetime.&&But the artist isn't the one who gets final say on what art gets shown. &&Of course.  I was referring to the hidden penises in The Little Mermaid art.  Things like that.&&I probably won't... Need to dig it out, as it is likely buried in a container in the garage.  It's from my old days of working at Animation.  It was just by lottery that he pulled my photo from the employee picture directory for the building. &&That's super fascinating to learn. What I know about the production comes from third party sources, so admittedly I may very well be wrong on any or all of these points. I actually really appreciate that you took the time to correct it! I knew about the redrafts of Zootopia, though I assumed they happened before any animation was done, which was probably wrong. I'm pretty curious to learn about the changes to Frozen, however, since I know very little about that. Were they related to making Elsa less of a villainous character?&&Google it, its everywhere. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEKH-972Jws&&The movie going public liked Frozen a lot better. &&i think it was a troll i had to check man thank god &&deleted it after i found website was fake &&rip to the planned sequel. i hope one day Disney goes back and revisits it. i doubt that will happen tho. &&Oh mate, you should [watch this video](https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA). It explains exactly why the movie flopped. 

Tldr; Disney didn't want to do classic drawn scenes anymore and *needed* the movie to flop so that they had a reasonable excuse to leave them behind forever and move on to 3D animation. This makes Treasure Planet the most technologically advanced old style Disney movie ever made, but also one of the least succesful movies they ever made. Which is a shame since it also had one of the best stories (written and directed by two of the most experienced directors in the entire animation movie industry).

It's a really interesting watch for anyone who loved that movie. &&it was up against the second Harry Potter movie, and no kids had any connection to Treasure Island which made the source material a bit weird in that regard.

it was a pirate movie in space simply put and I don't think that had the enticing draw it could have had.&&Yeah, I really loved this movie. Never knew it was a flop until recently&&Yeah I never understood why it wasn't popular when I was younger. I really liked that movie as a kid and then even more as an adult knowing what I know about art and animation. &&It's been my favorite Disney movie since I saw it in theaters when I was five, I'm glad it's starting to get the respect it deserves now.&&https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA&&Probably my favorite Disney animation. It really showed the possibilities for animation and the kind of fantasy worlds it can take you to.&&Agreed, wholeheartedly. Arguably, it's my favorite Disney movie of them all. Partially due to nostalgia, but I always love the feels and the father/son relationship Jim and Silver have. It's a pity that it was probably a bit too ambitious for its time, and I wonder how it would have done if it was released more recently or in a better timeframe.&&Treasure planet is one of my favorite 2d animated Disney films.
&&Titan A.E. and Treasure Planet were both excellent movies that were underappreciated in their times. &&Worth the watch for every Treasure Planet fan https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA&& It really is SUCH a great movie. I remember being so moved when they played ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here‚Äù by john reznik while Jim cloud surfs.. &&Honestly, I think that came down to poor marketing.&&This song is insanely beautiful! https://youtu.be/7fXBKOyAa7w&&In the early 2000s Disney wasn't doing great.

I think they might have sabotaged it to give a priority to Pirates of the Carribean, which was coming out the following summer. If Treasure Planet was a hit, it might have been an issue to release a classic pirate film, regarding audience perception. 

2003 ended up being a huge year for Disney with Pirates and Finding Nemo, but afterward, it was a bit of serious up and down. It wasn't until they bought Marvel they started to become the powerhouse we know today. 

Also, 2003 was the last year, and the only one in the '00s, which Disney actually was the best studio at box office. They had to wait until 2016 to be on top again.&&Why Disney would want their film not to succeed? I never understand these sabotage comments. Not handling a film well does not mean you want it to fail.&&It's cool idea untill all three times you go when the toys are there gets you three left arms&&Seconded. 

Watch it, it‚Äôs great!&&Wow, I didn't think I'd watch all of that but it was very good! Thanks for sharing &&scared the shit outta me as a kid. that and the sword in the stone. &&Black Couldron is the reason why Disney didn't produce Lord of the Rings, not even through Miramax. &&Not just the '90s; it more-or-less defined what every modern Disney animated film ought to look like. E.g. the similarities to musical theater; before *Little Mermaid* Disney films didn't really have ""soundtracks"" per se, a few random songs but not stitched together like a musical would be, but pretty much every Disney film since has followed that format.&&And because of that they finally got to make Treasure Planet after years of wanting to. That movie deserves way more praise than it gets imo.&&Yep. The Little Mermaid was the turning point for the modern Disney. They were pumping out shitty b-roll direct-to-video live-action crap up to that point, still trying to find the right direction. It seems obvious now, but the idea of going back to big expensive music-focused animated features was seen as a pretty big risk.&&And to think I used to hate being named after that movie. &&It began the Disney Renaissance!&&Possibly more than Hercules, Aladdin and Moana combined. ;)&&[Here!](https://youtu.be/b9sycdSkngA)

Careful though, once you watch the first few minutes of it you will almost definitely end up watching the entire thing.&&Pretty sure it only bombed cause Disney thought it would fail. Everyone loves the movie though and it would‚Äôve been a major success. &&I'm on mobile and didn't even notice, but thanks! I rewatched it on Saturday. It definitely holds up. The suspense in the toy shop scene and even the comically elaborate death trap is impressive for an animated film. And Toby is still awesome. &&Not to mention that if TGMD had flopped, like Black Cauldron did, it might've been the end of Disney. I know Little Mermaid gets a lot of credit for bringing Disney back to its glory days, and rightfully so, but TGMD was the first little spark of hope that allowed the studio to keep going long enough to get to that point. 

(TGMD is my favorite movie of all time, XD)&&The scene where Ratigan feeds a drunk lackey to his cat was pretty traumatizing to little kid me. But it really is one of my favorites. I see so many nods to the Sherlock Holmes stories re-watching it as an adult that I was unaware of as a child. &&Agreed. You know how Belle borrows the same book over and over again? That was me at Blockbuster, renting this movie. I loved it <3 &&The battle between Basil and Ratigan on top of Big Ben is beautifully animated, but it scared me to death as a kid. The artists nailed Basil's expressions as he's being clawed at.&&[deleted]&&You really like it? I find it to be a terrible adaptation, and the art to be uninspiring (they tried some cool new stuff but the character design is bland and doesn‚Äôt fit the tone).&&Thanks for the post I need to watch it asap.&&You know it my dude&&Avoid Coco if you don't want tears... Good movie, but it will extract liquid from your eyes. &&The grandma scene in Coco will turn you into a puddle as well.&&The scene where Moana walks through the parted ocean in slow mo singing to the giant monster lady is honestly one of the most beautiful scenes I've seen recently.&&Chicken Little would like a word with you...&&I feel the same, i started crying in the theater and even after that when i watched it again .it hit close to home cause 2 of my grandmas passed away and i couldnt be there at their last moments and could not visit their graves until a few years after they passed. The guilt‚Äôs been eating me ever since so it makes me feel better thinking my grandmas will be the same, that they‚Äôll be watching me and following me wherever i go. &&I'm usually not one for crying at movies, but Moana had me tearing up about 3 different times. &&I finally had a bit of time to see La La Land over the weekend, only to be completely bored and couldn't even finish it. City of Stars also seems like a dud, I can't believe that won as best song over ""How Far I'll Go"".&&[deleted]&&One of my toddlers earliest non-family words was Maui, and that's what she calls Moana. She has plush she drags around, who is currently sleeping in our bed. Such a fantastic movie. &&I feel like at this point I want to watch it more than my daughter does &&Just saw Hamilton last night for the first time- CAN CONFIRM!&&She knows *six words. &&Which is weird because it‚Äôs really...not the same plot. Do they both involve going to the land of the dead? Sure! Do they both involve music? Yes. Are they both set in Mexico and do they draw visual inspiration from Mexican art and culture? Well, yes, they are set in Mexico, of course they draw inspiration from it. That‚Äôs about the end of it. Coco was also in production before Book of Life was released. It‚Äôs no Antz vs A Bug‚Äôs Life.&&Had Disney actually given a shit about it, Treasure Planet could've been a powerhouse&&It also came out the same weekend as Harry Potter which didn‚Äôt help.&&It also got a lot of negative press at the time of release from people questioning the ""relevance"" of traditional-style animation.&&Maybe ""underappreciated"" is a better description? &&It was released the same weekend as the 1st Harry Potter movie. Disney didnt really want the movie to happen at all.&&Came out a week or so after Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&&And it was way more than just a more ergonomic office design. If I remember the documentary right, Ed and John were given the kill order on Disney Animation Studio by Disney itself. Only they both loved The D so much they basically revamped the creative process to be more like Pixar's, which they left separate so it could do more Off-Brand stuff (Not Disney like). It's a creative process where everyone on the creative team, and everyone working on the animation for that matter, can add a story idea during the story boarding process. And everything is very fluid and Democratic as far as- if it works it flies, no matter who came up with it. Good stuff.&&IIrc, they gave Robin a *lot* of space to improvise the character. &&As soon as I opened the thread, I started singing A Whole New World in my head.&&It‚Äôs not 2016&&I fucking love ""The Princess and the Frog"". I'm a 36 year old man. The fact that they said it would be their last hand drawn movie almost makes me cry. I didn't know that this guy directed almost all of my favorite childhood movies.

Growing up as a kid I wanted to be an animator for Disney more than anything.&&Robin Williams dressed as a cheerleader&&The flower magic still makes sense in the climax.

But yeah, the rules of how Genie's magic works and it's use in the end of the movie was just genius writing.&&Haha I think we definitely are, especially considering I also specifically kept them out as I have my own separate top 3 DisneyPixar:

1. All 3 Toy Stories (because who can choose?!?)
2. Monsters Inc.
3. Sways back and forth yearly between The Incredibles and WALL‚Ä¢E&&Lol wooooow, I've never seen that scene referenced before. It's dark -- with the exception of the threat to Nala in the middle and the beginning intro being a little slow-boil, I actually love it from the hyenas' introduction onward. Very Scar-worthy. &&That explains why Nala left. &&Yeah I didn't get most of those when I was 8 but I still loved the shit out of it. &&Don't call him a rat! &&Funny enough the furry fandom has a lot of amazing artists and some apply that skill animation. &&The what&&Saw no boner .

It has so much potential in live-action, and it has such a unique take on both the sci-fi and fantasy genre. &&I'm praying it shows up in Kingdom Hearts III.&&They almost added a treasure planet world to Kingdom Hearts 3D, but it got scrapped during development. There‚Äôs some files left within the game :(&&I‚Äôm just waiting for Disney to adapt Atlantis and Treasure Planet to live action. They‚Äôve announced Hercules (a few years away), so fingers crossed. &&eh, I think it's good enough to just leave it as a stand alone film&&Time for a mediocre live action remake.&&It'd make a pretty cool live action remake given the vfx available these days. Like pirates of the Caribbean, but in space. &&I just want to say that regardless if you care about treasure planet or not, that YouTube video is a masterpiece in it's own right, it's definitely worth a watch. It's so rediculously well made.&&This is the video I thought of when I saw this post. Thanks for giving everybody else dat link boi&&this should be top comment, give this person reddit silver!&&I would also like to point out that at the time Disney was also being investigated by the SEC and Disney didn't want the news media focusing on that story, so they were more than happy to have ""Treasure Planet Flops!"" in the news headlines.  Michael Eisner (Disney CEO at the time) even came out and trashed Treasure Planet in the newspapers just five days after its initial release date.

Additionally, a number of changes were made in Treasure Planet due to 9/11.  Most of the swords and knives were removed from the film because pirates waving swords on a space galleon was too similar to terrorists welding boxcutters on a passenger plane.  There were some odd changes made after entire sections of animation had been completed -- for example, Captain Amelia originally had black hair and a darker complexion and that was later changed to red hair and pale skin.  And yet Disney execs complained about how much the film cost.&&>no kids had any connection to Treasure Island

Isn't that a lot of Disney movies, though? Frozen, for example. &&It had to do with a lot of things. The topics it covered were not something that people understood. The idea that space travel with this pseudo steampunk theme was not as popular then as it is now. That being said the animation in that movie is fucking amazing.&&Probably a lot of factors really. It had a lot of competition for other family movies. Science fiction was on kind of a dark adult oriented trend. The whole world world was still pretty weird after 9/11. It was just a rough time to make a big animated science fiction kids movie.


Also, I don't think they marketed it like they usually do with Disney Movies. When it first came it they didn't seem to brand it very hard and I actually thought it was from a different studio.&&You should check this vid out if you're interested about why: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9sycdSkngA

Disney may have sabotaged it on purpose behind the scenes.&&Treasure Planet and Atlantis, my dude. ):&&Reading the comments on this thread, I‚Äôm surprised to see that Disney may have intentionally ruined Treasure Planet behind the scenes. It‚Äôs such a great movie, but sadly, people forget that Disney ever made it. Feeling better now that a lot of others also think it is a must watch!&&It baffles me how Disney wasn't #1 in 2015 with both The Force Awakens and Age of Ultron.&&Disney are still a bunch of fucks look at this. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/85hjav/disney_to_ask_toronto_court_to_seal_documents_in/?st=JEYE0ILT&sh=11ae2102&&I don't quite buy the theory either. The studio didn't spend such a huge budget *hoping* it will fail--now it's probably 100% true that they wanted to transition over to 3D animation due to the trend and hype of 3D at the time, but they didn't need the film to fail in order to do so. In fact, the fact that there's so *much* 3D in Treasure Planet indicates to me that they were already trying to transition.

I have no clue why they released it at such a bad time, but I'd be more likely to attribute that to Disney making a bad decision than them purposefully trying to bury a project they'd invested so much into.&&A couple reasons

1. They released a summer movie in the winter.

1. They released the movie against their own movie (The Santa Clause 2).  But more importantly, against the highly-anticipated first Harry Potter movie.   HP was _big_ among kids at the time.

1. Trailers were crap that contained huge spoilers.

1. If Trasure Planet was to be released in the Summer, Finding Nemo (May 30, 2003) and Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl (June 28, 2003) would be it's competition. 
 Both films **boomed** in theaters and the merchandising from them afterwards lasted at least a decade.

1. Treasure Planet was hella expensive, $140 million, and took a lot of man hours.  Curse of the Black Pearl matched it at $140 million, but Nemo was $94M.

Did they intend for it to fail when they first made it?  Probably not.  But as it was in development and looking down the road, there was no future in that animation style anymore so they could have ran it under on purpose.

&&Hand-drawn animation is a lot harder and more time-consuming than CGI. If you create a scene for a traditionally animated movie and then scrap it, that's thousands of hours and dollars down the drain. If you make a scene for a CGI flick and scrap it you can still reuse your assets in a different movie. Even though CGI is more expensive than hand-drawn (adjusted for inflation, ""Lion King"" - an already very expensive movie - had half the production budget of ""Frozen""), it's faster and you can make adjustments easier. Which is why Disney decided to completely fuck up their last few traditionally animated movies, to have a decent excuse to go full CGI, which is more convenient to them. And, let's face it, they were right - their CGI movies pretty much rival the entirety of their traditionally drawn films in terms of box office success and merchandising. &&If you have not recently, you should 100% rewatch sword in the stone, it's fucking amazing&&If 80s Disney had done LotR, we would have gotten one 80 minute movie called ""The Two Towers"" which was a mishmash of the first two books, and Aragorn wouldn't be a character. &&I watched a documentary on the making of the Little Mermaid once were they discussed how they literally created the formula for it that is still used for most Disney musicals today.  I still sit in their movies looking for the  statement of location song (fathom below and daughters of Triton/ where you are),   your statement of purpose song ( part of your work/ how far I'll go),  your cutting the drama song wth a comedic interlude ( under the sea/you're welcome). Plus of course your second act rousing anthem.  I honestly don't care how formulaic it is because it works.  &&That is actually one of my favorite things about Disney. The core animation projects are the only thing really keeping the musical tradition alive for most people. Which is great because I think it is a great format. I recently watched The Sound of Music for the first time and I thought it was incredible. We simply don't make that kind of movie anymore, and it's a really fun way to tell a story.&&It's amazing, if you look at the big animated releases since then, they almost all have two Oscar wins. Best original score and best original song.

The Lion King had three songs nominated for the Oscar. &&It was a real renaissance for sure. I hated old Disney toons and still do (WB 4ev) but even I found something to like with the new musical style ones... still didn't like some of them but Aladdin is a fucking great movie.

They went downhill for a while there but came back with a bang with Frozen (which personally I didn't like but obviously it was a huge success) and Moana.&&It also can't be stressed enough how important Howard Ashman was to the success of that movie, and the Disney Renaissance.&&Never heard of it before just now. But I was slightly preoccupied in 2002, had a baby that year, my first. And a wedding. Must have gone under my radar.&&I guess.  It seemed like a really incomplete movie to me.  I do like that it was their personal pet project though and that they did get to make it.  It‚Äôs better than the reception it got but I think it falls well short of the standard he made with his other films.&&Sebastian?&&You forget Princess Jasmine... The original THOT&&I ended watching Treasure Planet after seeing that video. It still holds up from my childhood.&&That video was so well done and it made me very upset. &&Exactly! I love movies that have stand-out, memorable moments... The toy shop, death trap, and clock tower scenes definitely fit that description.&&Oh I'm not denying it did bad when it came out. Disney hadn't quite made up their mind yet on a direction for the movies and tried to make one that appealed to a older audience. Needless to say, they found their niche afterwards&&Oh man. I cried like a baby during Coco. &&More so than Inside Out could?

That shit left me with an existential sense of relief.&&Hit me especially hard as I watched it knowing my grandma was soon going to die due to dementia complications. The granny reminds me so much of her.&&Papa??? Papa???&&Absolutely! On par with Prince of Egypt walking through the red sea scene. &&Yo bro, back the cluck up, Chicken Little is an underrated gem and was a masterpiece way before it‚Äôs time! /s

But yeah, I mean it‚Äôs an alright movie,&&I felt similarly about Maui's animation before watching it too. It really isn't that bad in motion though, and the film is totally gorgeous in other aspects. But the best thing about this movie? It's a Disney film with a female lead and NO ROMANTIC SUBPLOT! I was so damn happy about that.&&Even as a fan of the movie, I'll agree that the design of Maui's face is occasionally a little off-putting, but it's not that noticeable in the context of the movie. I think they tried too hard to make the character simultaneously look like the Rock and not look like the Rock.&&I‚Äôm so happy for you! Seeing Hamilton live is a life-changing experience.&&I tend to agree with you and I think there is a hint of subtle racism in the insinuation. Like there can only be one day of the dead movie.&&I don't know, Disney marketed the shit out of Tangled and it didn't do too great, which is funny cause I consider that film to be one of the best Disney films made in the past few decades. Not everything sticks even though it seems like it should. Not saying Disney couldn't have done more for Treasure Planet, but even if they did it doesn't guarantee it would've been more of a hit&&I think The Santa Clause 2 had also just come out. &&[deleted]&&They did a great job giving the genie that physicality that robin has too visually. At least that‚Äôs what I remember . I‚Äôve seen Aladdin at least 20 times but all during my childhood on vhs &&I meant the visuals but yeah, Robin basically ‚Äòmade‚Äô the character. It‚Äôs a beautiful work from all sides. &&Hahaha.

Jafar, Jafar, he's our man, if he can't do it GREAT!&&Jafar Jafar he's our man, if he can't do it **GREAT!!**&&I should be more specific: the tear healing flower magic to revive Flynn.&&Shit. Forgot about that.&&The original VHS cover was done by an outside artist. One of the towers on Tritons castle was a penis&&As good as that sounds, I'm kind of happy with how the film ended as it did. It's heartwarming in its own way; maybe Jim sees Silver, again... maybe not. Either way, they're both having their own adventures and finding their way.

*Listens to Always Know Where You Are in the distance.*&&Wait what? Is that real?&&Also that pirate would have been Willian Defoe!&&It would've been a great movie, but the game that came out, *Battle at Procyon* was also an amazing sequel.&&But not in this decade. Disney is busy making profit with live actions of succesful movies. &&Yes, I actually went and found TP after that video to watch it. I wasn't impressed, but the video was good.&&almost all of them. I felt they were really chained to a rock trying to fit pirate treasure in space in there though and think it could have been a lot better than just a treasure hunt.&&What‚Äôs Frozen based on?&&The animation and art direction were legit. As an artist, I love watching it just for that alone. &&Oh yeah, I've seen that. I mostly was talking about how audiences who saw the movie were kind of 'meh' on it. I totally get that Disney was trying to sabotage them since they weren't into the idea in the first place, but I never understood why my friends and family and others who saw it had really ambivalent reactions to it. Like, they were all, ""Treasure Planet? Meh. You know what movie was really good though? Cars!"" Maybe I just have different taste in movies...&&Oh man Atlantis was one of my favorite movies growing up. &&With the abilities Marvel and Starwars have, I wonder what a live action Treasure Planet would be like.....&&TFA was released at the end of 2015, so a big chunk of Box Office went to 2016. 

Also, Age of Ultron was the only movie to pull $1B+ in 2015 for Disney (with TFA being the only other one, but you know how the count went). Inside Out made $854M, and Ant-Man made $519M, while The Good Dinosaur, Tomorrowland, and Cinderella all flopped. 'McFarland, USA' was a success with $45M but only because it cost only $17M. &&That is more related to PR issues. I don't think Disney had an involvement in what Harvey was doing, Miramax was just an asset they were throwing money at with Weinstein having total creative control over that, given his perfect record. The only thing they blocked was Lord of the Rings, for obvious reasons. 

You might ask then why Disney wants to do that? The media will blame them for Weinstein - they wouldn't push too hard to the fact I told you above.

So, yeah, they just want to avoid that. Still shitty, but if the media weren't sensationalizing so much, it wouldn't matter. &&I think it was less about them wanting to bury their own project and more like they saw the writing on the wall with traditional 2D animation being a commercial powerhouse like it once was. The budget was so big for animation that for it to be a success, it would have had to be a major success, like top grossing animated movie of all time success, and that would've prolonged the change away from 2D. Musker/Clements' preferred style is traditional, and if they had a financial successful movie at that time, they would've had sway on what they wanted the next decade to be in terms of style.&&I doubt that highly. Basically you're pointing at the movie competing against larger movies as ""proof"" that they were *intentionally* trying to sink it. This doesn't work at all. It suggests that *maybe* Disney didn't think it would do so well and didn't attempt to hype it like a blockbuster, but that's about it and even that's iffy. At best, you could conclude that it didn't get released at a good time, but as far as intentions go, there's nothing to indicate Disney released it poorly *on purpose*, especially for some bizarre scheme like ""we want to stop using 2D animation and start using 3D animation"". Seriously, why would they flop a movie intentionally just to have an excuse to switch to 3D? Why do they even need an excuse to switch to 3D? Especially since, as you pointed out, Finding Nemo boomed in theaters anyway, which would have been enough of an excuse to start doing 3D movies to begin with.

They ""could have"" run it under on purpose. Seems far more likely they didn't.&&Disney animation even today rarely releases films in summer. Animation is always expensive and it‚Äôs even more so if it has new kind of animation like this had. Tangled for example was 260M. &&but the witch scares me :( &&Yeah, but they had the chance to greenlight it in live-action in the 90s, either through the main label or Miramax, but they declined. &&>I still sit in their movies looking for the statement of location song (fathom below and daughters of Triton/ where you are), your statement of purpose song ( part of your work/ how far I'll go), your cutting the drama song wth a comedic interlude ( under the sea/you're welcome). Plus of course your second act rousing anthem. I honestly don't care how formulaic it is because it works. 

That's the formula? You just blew my mind!&&Watching the video of Howard Ashman giving a lecture to all the animators and directors in the late '80s about how musicals work and the structure to them always makes me smile. You're basically watching the transformation which shot Disney animation back to the top.&&Happen to have the name or a link to the documentary? Sounds really interesting!&&If you have a link on that I‚Äôd love to watch it! &&Part of your world??
&&Disney probably deserves a lot of credit for keeping Broadway alive.&&Also worth looking at *Tangled*, a flawed but quite enjoyable transitional piece as they tried to figure out how to do a princess film in the modern CGI era. (marred by a forgettable soundtrack, but that's why they finally dumped Alan Menken and hired the two best composers on Broadway for *Frozen* and *Moana*)&&Treasure Planet is one of the more interesting movies where the lead doesn't get a girl and struggles with his father issues who has abandoned him. In its key scenes it is one of Disney's finest movies, especially the dialogues between Jim and Silver.

Highly recommended. The movie doesn't need to hide from any other Disney classics.&&Give it a watch, jimbo!&&Hahahaaaaaaa! No, Ariel. ;)&&I've found that animation is better at inspiring real authentic emotions than almost any other disney movie. Not sure why.&&[deleted]&&Me too but I can't wait to see it again.&&In my opinion, yes, much more than Inside Out. &&Depends on where you are in your life.

Teenager finding herself and getting in balance emotionally. Good movie, touching.

But Coco... Family values and individuality, tradition vs innovation, death and loss and dealing with both, remembrance, self-sacrifice vs self-fulfillment, passion, trust and betrayal, effing *dementia* of all things.

Because of that, Coco, much more so than Inside Out, manages to reach every age group. Coco, the grangran in the movie, was my grangran, his granny matron was my granny matron, and I'm somewhere between Miguel and his parents and on top of that, it made me remember those long gone ancestors of mine.

Inside Out was excellent, but Coco absolutely *destroyed me* in a very, *very* good way.

Made it's way into my top 5 movies of all time instantly. (*Mine*, personally, as in ""it speaks to me"", not ""best of all time"" critically/ objectively.)&&A lot more than inside out&&I cried more during Inside Out, but Coco definitely brought the tears. It's a *fantastic* movie, all its awards are well-earned.&&For real. If you have had someone in your life with dementia its a fucking tear jerker&&The game was fun too&&I sometimes watch it just for the nostalgia&&That's the reason I prefer my daughter to watch this over some other movies. I'd never really been aware of the lack of strong female leads in kids movies until my daughter was born! &&It's not that it's underrated, Disney just marketed it as a different movie, gave away wayyyy too many plot points in the trailer, and overall like I said just butchered the marketing campaign for this movie. One of the best Disney movies ever in my opinion and really tackled problems kids of that Era dealt with a lot like a missing father, finding a purpose, and what can happen if you invest your time and energy into the right people. &&Yes, no one will ever accuse me of being a paragon of brevity. You look at the year Pixar took over and everything Disney has made after that year and it is a stark contrast. Absolutely amazing.&&**PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER** *^itty ^bitty ^living ^space*&&RIP /u/airhose, fed to a cat.&&The video game they released, Battle at Procyon, continues the story. It‚Äôs honestly a superb game, a lost gem. Less than ¬£7 on steam as well so definitely worth it if you‚Äôve got a few pennies to spare.&&Yep. We know the basic plot of what it was going to be.&&[Sauce](http://animatedviews.com/2014/buried-treasure-the-ill-fated-voyage-to-treasure-planet-2/)&&Willem defoe was set to play the bad guy if I remember right. &&Ok not making that movie is a tragedy, but denying the world of Space Pirate Defoe should be criminal.&&This decade ends in two years, so obviously won't be soon. 

But since a 'Chronicles of Prydain' (source of 'Black Cauldron') adaptation is in the works, it's pretty safe to say it will happen.

I'm a director myself, and I hope to have a career by the time they start to think about it. I'd really love to make a live-action adaptation of this film. Scares the shit out of me because it would be such a monumental and ambitious project, but it's such a great story I'd take the chance. &&>The film is loosely based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Snow Queen, which was first published in 1845. 

https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2013/07/30/the-story-behind-the-story-of-frozen/&&I have a totally different experience; everyone in my social circles who have seen it love it. Some even have a ‚Äúoh yeah... that was a really good movie‚Äù moment while others have rewatched it recently since it seems to be on and off of netflix. The thing I come across more often than people disliking or ‚Äúmeh‚Äùing jt is just people who haven‚Äôt seen it or only saw it when it came out and don‚Äôt really remember it very well. &&Cinderella flopped? I thought it was quite popular.&&that witch is hilarious. &&I mean.... Those are pretty standard templates that have been used in musical theatre long before The Little Mermaid but Clements, Musker and Howard Ashman definitely deserve credit for realising how well that formula works in an animated movie and distilling it down to its simplest and most effective form. You will see the same formula used in every subsequent Disney musical and for good reason; it's simple and effective. &&Even if they didn't intentionally write the formula that way, that's a pretty clear way to analyze the song structure for each Disney musical. I would probably add in villain song, though not every one has a villain song (Hades in Hercules never gets a villain song, for example, and neither does Jafar, but Ursula, Gaston, Scar, the villain in Pocahontas, and Tamatoa all get villain songs)

Since I already mentioned it, Hercules:

* Statement of location song: The Gospel Truth
* Statement of purpose song: Go the Distance
* Comedic interlude: One Last Hope, I guess
* Second act rousing anthem: Zero to Hero
* Love song: I Won't Say (I'm in Love)

For comparison, Little Mermaid:

* Statement of location song: Fathom Below or Daughters of Triton
* Statement of purpose song: Part of Your World
* Villain song: Poor Unfortunate Souls
* Comedic interlude: Under the Sea, also Les Poissons
* Second act rousing anthem: Part of Your World gets reprised as an anthem
* Love song: Kiss the Girl

Most of them can be divided up this way, with the occasional piece added in or removed (like Hercules and Aladdin not having villain songs, some have multiple comedic songs like Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and Frozen, etc.). Part of that is that with the stories Disney tells in these animated canon musicals, there are only so many kinds of songs they can throw in. There's not going to be a song whose purpose is to, I dunno, illustrate the history of an international conflict between two fictional countries or something, because they're always musicals about coming of age, maybe finding love in the process, and realizing your destiny to save the world/fix a broken person/learn a lesson about love and family. You can't really fit it in there, you know?

If Disney *wanted* to make an animated musical about, I dunno, the leadup to World War I, that's up to them, and the subject of the songs would probably vary as a result, but that's probably not going to happen - and that's okay!&&You can apply the same formula to like 90% of Broadway musicals too. Its part of why Disney films are so easy to adapt into broadway shows.&&Do you know if the full version is online somewhere? That video has been my golden fleece!&&Can't find this with a quick Google. Any idea where I could see it?&&I bet it was ""Waking Sleeping Beauty""&&Probably ‚ÄúWaking Sleeping Beauty‚Äù. Incredible documentary looking into the Disney animation renaissance. Definitely give it a watch!

https://youtu.be/EyeoyRjEiUU&&I'm not saying you're wrong, but I've never heard that claim before. I mean, there's a lot more to broadway (Les Mis for instance) than Disney shows.&&*dumped Alan Menken*

:(

You‚Äôre not wrong...but Menken is an incredible lyricist. Yeah, Ashman was the true genius, but almost 25 years after it came out I still know every word to Gaston and Be Our Guest.&&You shut your mouth, tangled is a damn masterpiece &&Except ""I See the Light,"" which is one of Menken's best. 

The Lopez' excel at doing styles pastiches, but they can't do an entire show of straight MT like Menken. &&Plus The Goo Goo Dolls pop in to make it inspirational af. I was in love with this movie when I was a kid. I still want that glider. &&It's available on Amazon (or at least it was last year). There are also a couple deleted scenes that still have the unfinished animation floating around out there somewhere. 

From everyone I've talked to who works at Disney, and everything I've found online, Disney has done, and continues to do their best to pretend it never existed. 

Although every now and then, a reference or a character will pop up in a pin collection at the parks. &&It's sort of an odd one because the subject matter is pretty dark compared to most Disney, and they were adapting a children's novel rather than a fairy tale, so rather than adding *to* the story, like they usually do, things had to be omitted for time, so you lose some character development and such. But the animation quality is really good, and it's not a *bad* movie for its type. &&People in my screening laughed when Mama Coco became all forgetful. It kinda rubbed me up the wrong way, and my humour is darker than that one period in history with the Plague.&&Like every animated Disney movie has female leads. The only leads that I can think of that are male are Aladdin, Lion King and Cars.  Two of those aren't even human though so it hardly counts.&&I realized my fate a second too late.&&if we're thinking about the same game then the solar glider(?) levels were ADDICTING to play as a kid&&Dude that‚Äôs amazing. Need to go re-watch the original movie asap&&Oh also I think he was supposed to be a robot&&Shut the fuck door. They're working on that???&&Seriously, I thought that Treasure Planet should have chance because it is a nostalgic property based on a literary classic and should have at least made it¬¥s money back through merchandise and DVD sales and the execs have to know that the movies was basically sent out there to die, from what I understand, but the fact that they give Black Cauldron another shot, almost makes it an inevitability. &&Haha.... Dream big huh... You may have a better chance at winning the lotto than you do directing treasure planet for Disney&&Squirrel scene was sad.&&[deleted]&&>If Disney *wanted* to make an animated musical about, I dunno, the leadup to World War I

Been done...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh!_What_a_Lovely_War&&Trying to fit my favorite Disney movie, Mulan, into this. It only has four songs so it's a bit unusual compared to the standard musicals.

Statement of location: Honor to Us All - not exactly location, but introduces the initial situation and culture (girls need to get married, guys go to war)

Statement of Purpose: both Reflection (Mulan's personal journey of fitting in) and I'll Make a Man Out Of You (Shang's purpose is to make Mulan and the rest into better soldiers)

Comedic interlude: A Girl Worth Fighting For

No villain song, with one of the most serious villains in a Disney movie as far as I can recall. No love song, as the romance happens in about two seconds at the end as Shang gets invited to dinner. Fits pretty well other than that though.&&Jafar did have a song for a while. Didn't end up in the movie.&&I haven't seen the whole thing myself, just from clips on various documentaries. The making-of docs found on the Little Mermaid and Beauty and Beast has segments and I saw a few others in some other documentaries but I can't remember which. All told I've seen up to 30 minutes of it and I think on the Little Mermaid doc they said it was an hour or an hour and a half. If you can see any of it I'd highly recommend it.&&For sure, but I think the op means that as kids we watch these musical movies and that primes the pump for us to enjoy other musicals (and of course, The Lion King on Broadway has been so incredibly successful, and functions as a gateway musical for other shows as well). Also, at this point, Disney has had a major artistic impact on the people who write, make, and perform in musicals.  

It's very difficult to say how significant an impact Disney has had on the entire entertainment industry, but it is massive.&&Wasn't Menken behind the lyrics for Galavant?

I mean, I liked the show and hope it'll get continued (somehow), but those songs got really weird....&&Menken is mainly a composer, which is why he worked with top-notch lyricists like Ashman, Slater, Schwartz.

Menken wrote the soundtracks of my childhood, and those scores are something I still turn to when I need some beauty and emotion in my life. Listen to 'You Came Back' and try not to cry!&&Those are still Ashman‚Äôs lyrical work.&&It's so sad that Ashman died. I think that's why Disney movies struggled after, and even now, each movie has one good song but the rest are meh. Every single one of the songs on the Ashman movies were hits. The only person that competed was Elton John.&&True, but Kristen Anderson-Lopez (""my soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around"") and Lin-Manuel Miranda (""Hamilton faces a no less uphill climb / Hamilton's pace is relentless he wastes no time"") are even better ones.&&The wiki page for it is quite informative. The project was full of creative differences that featured a cast of modern day animation legends.

Marketing wise, sure. But not creatively speaking: http://variety.com/2016/film/news/chronicles-of-prydain-movie-disney-1201733058/&&The emphasis is *strong* female leads. In many Disney movies, the female characters don‚Äôt show the greatest messages ‚Äî giving up your voice to be with a man, being kissed while knocked out and that rescuing you, etc. According to research from linguists Karen Eisenhower (North Carolina State U.) and Carmen Fought (Pitzer), on average in the 5 Disney princess movies that followed the Little Mermaid, male characters had 3 times as many lines as women. &&Battle at Procyon was a large scale ship combat game, I remember a cereal box demo CD that had a game where you pilot one of those solar sail surfboards through a course though.&&Go rewatch it just for the sake of it. Great movie&&> Shut the fuck door.

That‚Äôs hilarious, I may have to steal this. It‚Äôs something I could see a toddler Deadpool saying.&&Chronicles of Prydain? Yeah. I mean, they renewed the rights two years ago so I suppose they are planning a fantasy franchise of their own. But it might be something in 3-4 years if not more. 

http://variety.com/2016/film/news/chronicles-of-prydain-movie-disney-1201733058/&&> the movies was basically sent out there to die

I honestly think it was 'killed' because of Pirates 1, which was being shot while 'Treasure Planet' marketing was starting.

Conceptually, if TP was a hit, it would have been a problem for Pirates. TP was a new take on the genre, whereas Pirates was a classic pirate movie, and also a blockbuster featuring a popular actors. 

Given how much Disney cartoon successes shaped pop-culture, they might have ended up having to choose which one was worth more.&&If I win the lottery, I can start my directing career tomorrow :)&&Can go back farther than that, I think - *H.M.S.

Far from the bombs!  

\**cue artillery shells firing in time to the first five notes of the steel drums, followed by explosions in time to the last four notes, with the last note being two shells exploding at once for greater loudness*\*&&It was the best example I could use from Moana, since Moana doesn't have a real villain (hell, the closest thing to a villain is Maui, as he's responsible for the main conflict). Yeah, he's only a sub-villain, but he gets his own song that's definitely in the classic Disney villain song vein (""look at how great I am! I'm so powerful and evil!"").

Frozen doesn't have a villain song either, since the closest thing to a villain is hidden for most of the movie. There aren't as many Disney villains today, which is fine, it's just something that's happened. Back in the day we got Ursula, Gaston, Scar, etc., now the villains are abstract things like ""misplaced trust"" (Frozen) and ""not being trusting enough"" (also Frozen).&&I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it, but I really want to check it out now!&&Omg, you‚Äôre right. I totally switched him and Ashman in my head.

My bad. My newborn kept me up all night. That‚Äôs my excuse.&&I totally agree. But I really think you can see the same genius in Menken. Look at Little Shop of Horrors!!!&&I think people oversell the idea that all Disney Princesses are just vapid waifs waiting for their man. Ariel giving up her voice is one of the best examples. She doesn‚Äôt give her voice up for a man - she gives her voice up to be human. Eric was just the catalyst for that, but she‚Äôd always been fascinated by humans and wanted to live on land. Even her ‚Äústatement of purpose‚Äù song says ‚ÄúI want to be where the people are‚Äù, not ‚ÄúI want to be where my boyfriend is‚Äù.

I‚Äôll make no arguments for the early princesses. But from 1989 onward, the princesses all pretty much have a grander ambition apart from love. &&And that the female leads NEED a man to come save them! Whilst my girl is a princess, she isn't going to be out there looking for a man to ""come rescue her"". &&Agreed on your strong female leads point, but let's not forget Mulan.

Also, really not sure on that study.

Pocahontas talks a lot more than John Smith. So does Mulan, Elsa/ Anna probably equal to Sven and Hans, so is Moana, and Belle is probably quite even with the Beast as is Rapunzel compared to whatshisname.

OK, I'm guessing here, but in none of these cases a 3 times more male lines is even close. So I'd have to conclude that study talks about *all* male lines vs. *all* female ones.

And that would be a very iffy point of view inviting a conclusion that simply isn't there, not telling very much at all besides the numbers.

Pocahontas comes from a tribe with warriors and is attacked by english invaders. So what does one expect?

Mulan joins an army in medieval(?) China. So what does one expect?

Belle and Beast share the screen more or less equally, and the antagonist is male.

Elsa/ Anna... I don't even care here. It's balanced.

Moana, again, a screensharing show between a female and male.

Brave (officially a Disney Princess now) has two female leads.

The study also conveniently cuts of at Mermaid, conveniently omitting Cinderella, a movie from the 60s with a basically all female cast. Or Snow White. The dwarfs probably have more lines there, but protagonist and antagonist are female. Also Sleeping Beauty. The relevant speaking parts are female.

I mean, what does that study try to tell us? Males have more speaking lines, ok, but so? Isn't it more important what those lines say? How *relevant* to the movie they are?

The only ones i could find myself agreeing with are Aladin, could have given Jasmin a lot more to do and say, and sort of Mermaid... but I mean... she didn't have a voice for half the movie.

Dislaimer: Not talking about wether or not those leads are strong female characters, whole other issue I agree with you on, I'm just taking issue with this seemingly trying to mislead at worst, useless at best, study.

Quite open to be corrected though. Maybe I misunderstand its intention.

Edit: Forgot Princess and the frog. Equal with a male antagonist.&&hmm the one I'm thinking of was for the PS2. &&One of my favorites as well. &&I say I‚Äôm a Disney fan yet I‚Äôve never watched or really heard of this Treasure Planet.

&&I worked on a movie that was about McQueen going on a road trip trying to find that GT390.  This screenwriter and the director of the film I worked on should talk haha&&There‚Äôs two of them and the 2nd one was recentlyish found in a Mexican desert and is being restored now. &&Everything about this story is awesome. &&[deleted]&&Why was jay leno allowed to drive the car without the owners permission?&&Note: I really *am not* shitting on this.

This is somewhat of a good example of how statistics and coincidence don't work in the way we intuitively believe they do. When you read the headline, you think ""wow, a guy who wrote a screenplay about a very specific car managed to mention it to the one guy out of all seven and a half billion on earth who happened to own that car.""

In reality, what happened was that the guy who wrote the screenplay had probably been looking for a similar looking car for quite a while, and had therefore asked at least a few people what kind of cars they owned. Specifically, he asked car enthusiasts, because those were the sort of people who might own the kind of car he needed. They also happened to be the kind of people who might coincidentally own famous cars. So rather than the pool of potential owners being seven and a half billion people, it was more along the lines of a few million.

Now consider that at any given moment, there are probably a few dozen screenwriters wandering the U.S. looking for just the right car. Most of them will never find it. Most of them will never make their film. But if each of them asks ten to twenty car enthusiasts a year what kind of car they own, then the chances of something this coincidental happening at least once every few decades rise dramatically.

If something like this happens to *you*, then yeah, you should be downright amazed. Because the odds of it working out for any one person are incredibly low. But the odds of it happening to somebody, anybody... quite a bit higher.

I get the impression that Kiernan didn't quite get that so many people were fans of the car. Maybe just the way the article is written.

but...this story is like an Indiana jones on 4 wheels. that the lad honored his dad by not getting rid of an old, broken hot rod. sort of like saving the mona lisa from the tip when mona passed on....

Undid all the damage I could, put everything period correct in it (bucket seats, console, lowerdash without a radio cut out sawed into it, floor and toe pans, seat belts, fuse box and harness, steering wheel, down to the fucking glove box light) Drove it on the weekends and eventually sold it after having it almost 10 years. Never could keep rain water out of it so I could install all the interior panels, headliner, and carpet.  I was still easily another 10-20k away for a complete basic  restore.

&&I can confirm too. I‚Äôm the screenwriter Sean told and he blew my mind. I handed him a script with a lame copy of the letter McQueen wrote to his dad as the cover, then Sean handed me the original. 

Fiction has the burden of believability that true stories don‚Äôt have. This may be unbelievable, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not true. &&You've never heard of rare ferraris being found in barns and shit 50 years later? It happens dude. 

>So we are supposed to believe that a missing car of this profile stayed hidden all these years even though Ford has known of its whereabouts for 30 years?

Also Ford did not know where the car was the past 30 years, Not a single person alive besides this guys family did. Not sure why you just made that up. The car was not even insured, so no way to track it. People have spent years trying to locate this car.  There's always one idiot. 

>It then suddenly emerges right around the time that Ford decides to release a 50 year anniversary edition?

And if ford knew where the car was, why didn't they do this for the first bullit revival in 2001? Or in 2008? Lemme guess third time's a charm and ford has been secretly planning this since 1977. Dumbass. 

>Not to mention it‚Äôs worth millions of dollars but the son only found this out?

Not everyone cares about money, this was his father's car and a way to remember his legacy. But tell us more about what you don't know. 


&&I would love to talk to them. &&After reading the letter I totally disagree. McQueen wanted ""his car"" back, I doubt it ever belonged to him in the first place. He makes it sound like the car was stolen or something. It belonged to some production company and was sold. He wanted to trade the movie car for some other Mustang and didn't want to spend a lot of money in the process. Quote: ""Otherwise, we had better forget it."" Yeah buddy, that's exactly what I'd have done.   
     
Also it was still their daily driver in '77. Why swap the car you know for some other used car? It's not like McQueen offered a brand new one.&&Kinda sucky that Steve McQueen didn't offer up any of his Hollywood money to a normal family that drove a used, old car as their daily driver for so long.

Guess he didn't want it back so bad after all.&&They daily drove the car for years before Steve tried to buy the car. It was their car, not his. By the time the car broke down and was in their garage, Steve was dead. &&He had the owner's permission. &&i am sure that he had permission no way in hell would ford jsut let him use it without it i mean the legal trouble (they did ALL sign NDA's) ford would be in court in seconds &&He's the dude's boss though. That's pretty crazy. &&In reality I wasn‚Äôt looking for the car and hadn‚Äôt asked anyone. In my mind, was far more romantic to think it lost and make a movie about it than to go searching for it. &&Yes.&&It's hard to put a value on something that was thought to be destroyed in the 70's. I guarantee this thing could fetch 2+ million at auction &&Steve McQueens Mustang from the movie bullitt was thought to be destroyed, lost, crushed, or used for parts 40 years ago. The guy who owned it refused to sell it back to McQueen, and that's the last anyone has heard of it. In 2014 a few events unfolded resulting in the son letting Ford use the car to reveal the new 2019 bullitt mustang, and it's the first time anyone has seen or heard of the car since the 70s. The car is worth millions. Not even Ford knew of the cars existence until some guys writing a movie about the car by chance ran into the son and eventually figured out he owned the car. After a bunch of NDA's were signed, Ford worked with the Son to reveal the car to the world, again, after decades of it basically not existing. 

(not the best tldr but I tried)&&I'm going to be selling the new bullitt and, the minute I put my hands on one, I'm going to have an odd mix of rock hard erection and childhood glee.

Well done my man.&&Yeah, I can understand that. Just a random thing I noticed. I enjoyed reading about this, though. Thanks for making this happen.&&>cos

I can't believe you've done this.&&Wow. You're right. I've never noticed that. Positive coincidences are nearly always regarded with suspicion by the viewer but negative coincidences are just par for the course. &&B E G O N E T H O R P E&&That's the difference. If a coincidence happens early in the story (as you said, kickstarting it) that's fine. If the coincidence happens late in the story, and is to the benefit of the protagonist, that's when they become cheap. If the coincidence hindered the protagonist, on the other hand, then it might work.

Basically, the later in the story you have a coincidence that helps the protagonist, the less likely the audience is to buy it. &&[deleted]&&Staring Lindsay Lohan?&&Cars 4 confirmed &&Yeah, cars 3&&Cars 3.

I just don't buy there are so many people this excited about a car that I've never heard of, with the Ford logo plastered on the thumbnail. Redditors don't leave comments that just say ""wow"". 

For comparison, this post has more upvotes than the heavily anticipated Infinity Trailer posted this week, and that wasn't an underperformance at all. This is looking like an ad. I'm surprised more people aren't calling that out, considering how obvious it looks to me. &&Id call it /r/wholesomeadvertising&&The thing is, they don't delete the whole history.  There's always activity from when the account was created, which is why it leads me to believe it was an abandoned account that somehow got hijacked.&&Quite the asset!&&I'd sell it asap. Now that the secret is out it's much harder to keep safe. Insurance on something like that must be insane and I'd be up all the time just to keep an eye on it. I'd get a couple GT500s/GT350Rs and repeat the process. Sure they won't go into the millions but they will appreciate. There is plenty you can do with the leftover cash. I wouldn't even dream of okaying a car chase with it. Maybe some slow scenes and then a stunt car but no way would I be alright with spirited driving of any kind.&&Can't imagine how much it would cost in Singapore &&My favorite part of the article is where it says the owner never had insurance on it.&&It also says he's been touring with the car the past year, he's definitely making money off of bringing the car to events and shows.&&Neither did the guys making the film, though I‚Äôm surprised Ford didn‚Äôt jump all over that.

The show was the 8th thru 12th, so no telling where Bullit is now.&&Bullitt launch leader here, the first car is going to a guy who bought the first car at the big Barrett Jackson auction. It was for charity. The original Bullitt owner does have an order for an early one too.&&I suppose you‚Äôre right. Id just hate to see it get worse. Maybe Ford could pay for its storage in a climate controlled museum....but cars are meant to be driven....man im so torn. Good thing it‚Äôs not my car. &&[deleted]&&You can do a concourse restore on a vehicle without destroying its value. Some things have to be done sometimes to actually keep a car safe to operate or save. 
My understanding is when people 'modify' the vehicle and start putting in things that don't belong or are not numbers matching, or rebuilt original, is when it becomes a problem. 

Asking someone to not restore a car in the future, 30+/- years ago, may not mean the same thing as what the process can mean now to collectors and enthusiasts, or possibly even be a reasonable request if the intent is to actually preserve the car.  I imagine a lot of time damage has happened to it post McQueen request to return it to its original condition. &&Which is good, because the stunt car got a full restoration.I rather would have seen a rusty smashed shell of a car.  Here is an article on the other Mustang:

I got to play it at MAGFest last year. &&Sony originally got into video games when they were contracted by Nintendo to develop a CD-ROM compatible SNES. When the contract fell through after Nintendo violated their end of the deal by allowing Phillips to license their characters for the CD-i, Sony took the opportunity to release the Playstation. For a long time it was believed that there were no prototypes of the CD compatible SNES in existence, until a guy found a Nintendo Playstation in his attic. It was pretty wild stuff. It's even complete with SNES controllers with Playstation printed on them. &&Ben Heck did some videos on it. The first of which is here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug-CyGXMabg&&It's going to be all over the country (and the world!) this year. &&I dealt with some people in your department back when the GT500 was re-released. I was a tech at the time, and the man who owns the first red 67 GT500 was interested in purchasing a matching 2007 model. Ford heard about this, and his wife decided to purchase one for their 50th anniversary. It was the first model to roll off the line in red. When the car arrived, and I was doing the PDI, the wife drove the 67 into our dealership. She gave me two boxes, asked me too remove the glove box doors on both vehicles, and she had me mail them both to Shelby for autographs.

This happened awhile back, but I still think about what those cars would fetch at an auction if they were sold as a pair.&&Are you in-house for Ford or with an agency? Would love to know more about your job role and how it works both day to day and the logistics side! (just started a small ad agency last year) &&True, the focus should be on preservation. I'm a little nervous about the cross-country driving tour it's going to be on, but I bet Ford or the McQueens wouldn't hesitate to help out if anything should happen to it.

I don't know what I'd do, either! It's such a great piece of cinema history.&&But the sentiment is the same. &&I think since this is truly a one of a kind car, the general rules, to restore or not, kind of go out the window.  The cars value is in it being the only car of its kind and its condition is part of the cars story. Restoring it now wouldn't add or take away any value. So why spend the money?  The biggest goal now should be to preserve its current condition. &&The question being, would it auction more in like new condition or more in the condition that best reflects is history and uniqueness.

I'm guessing that someone that would pony up the cash for this car, would want it exactly as its life has lead it to be, with all of the rust and the intrigue.&&aww man, seriously that comment just gave me goosebumps, enjoy.
I might see if my dad wants to see it again too.
&&Yeah, McQueen offers to help him find another ""like"" it as long as it isn't expensive. It didn't even sound like he'd buy him one, just that he'd help find one for him to purchase. 

I really didn't have a ton of sympathy for McQueen in the situation. Bullitt came out in 1968, he wrote that letter in 1977. He was very well off at that point (died 3 years later), he could have bought it if he really wanted.&&Thanks. You gave me a huge grin. That's rare. Thank you kind stranger. &&Sweet! I meant the tour dates. I would love to see it in person. &&It's super stressful but I do love my job. Been wanting to work on Mustangs since I was 10 so it's a dream come true.

Really weird to think there‚Äôs a black market for Reddit accounts&&That's all true, but it doesn't really negate the previous poster's point. From the article, it sounds like the guy could barely pay to get the car insured for its full value, let alone keep it some place safe. He had to let Ford lock it in their factory to keep it from getting stolen.

In bigger cities, there are high-security garages that cost hundreds of dollars a month (or more) to store cars, but even if the guy can afford that, I'm not sure if those places would want to guarantee the safety of such a valuable, high-profile car.
&&I really want that to be true. I don‚Äôt want to hear it was sold to a phone bidder at Mecum and then promptly disappears into Asia.

Even after taxes you can do some pretty big things. I get overly attached to cars. I still get sad when I think about my MK4 Jetta I sold which i only had 3 years and isn't remotely as note worthy. If anything were to happen to the car that would lower it's value significantly I'd be kicking myself for not selling when I had the chance. He can take 100k and build a clone in showroom condition.

And that touches on something about coincidences in real life: We call them that because we‚Äôre not privy to all the details that resulted in the coinciding.

He came in full Batman regalia and as sick as I was, it certainly made me feel better. He was super nice and I've been a lifelong fan since. Shame he wasn't included in the Memoriam Reel. &&Come to think of it, I didn't see Bill Paxton either - which probably means he is still alive, right?&&[deleted]&&I thought only members of the Academy were included in that reel?&&Michael Nyqvist was also forgotten :(&&Also Tobe Hooper. What the fuck academy - you include a Texas Chaisnaw Massacre scene in the movies tribute montage, but you don‚Äôt pay tribute  to the legend who made it.

Edit: changed word&&This wouldn't have happened if Seth McFarlane hosted. He would have stopped the show to pay tribute to this legend. &&Have they included people in the past that were mainly TV stars?&&None of those mentioned in memoriam had their own Bat Signal on LA City Hall building...
Adam West wins. &&They get a ton of names and only pick a few: http://ew.com/article/2014/02/26/explainer-how-the-oscar-in-memoriam-segment-is-decided/

>So who decides? That would be a committee made up from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who sift through a list of about 300 submissions and decide yea or nay on who makes the cut, depending on their contribution to filmmaking. Roughly 40 end up being included in the film, which is created weeks in advance of the Oscars.

I think it sucks he wasnt picked BUT the majority of what he is known for would be on TV so he would be in the Emmy list.&&Was Bill Paxton memoriam in last years oscars? &&His name would have been more appropriate in the Emmy presentation &&I wish they would just show the TCM memorandum as they do an incredible job every year and gets everyone who sadly passed&&He wasnt missing, he was excluded. &&Makes sense. His most popular feature film was reprising his TV character, a notable actor, but unfortunately without much presence in cinema.&&‚ÄúOftentimes, actors omitted from the Oscars' In Memoriam reel are those generally who have been deemed more closely associated with TV than movies.‚Äù

The reason why was answered right in the beginning of the article. &&I loved Adam West, but I can see how he would be thought of as more of a tv actor.

Of the people they missed, John Mahoney, Frank Vincent, Bill Paxton, and Dorothy Malone should have absolutely been there. 

And Stephen Furst, just for *Animal House.*&&They also overlooked Robert Guillaume. &&i may be wrong, but wasn't adam west only a tv actor? isn't the memoriam reel only movie people?&&Holy omission, Batman!&&Dude, you want to alert ALL of Gotham that the Batman is dead? Are you insane!&&For his film work in *The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood* alone, he really should have been included in the memoriam.&&Good thing the Oscars don‚Äôt matter. &&His line ""Someday's you just can't get rid of a bomb"" is a classic movie line so yes, Adam should have been included.&&Yes, Adam West was famous.

Yes, Adam West was in both Omega Cop and Night of the Kickfighters.


But he was mostly known as TV's Batman. So I'm assuming the Academy committee didn't feel the need to include him, especially given they left out actual Oscar winners from the tribute.&&Wouldn't the Emmy's be where we'd expect to see his memorial?&&They also left out Glen Campbell, he died in August. Granted, he wasn't a film legend to the level that Adam West was, but he was still very influential in the realm of Westerns. He received an Oscar nomination for Original Music in his 2014 auto-biographical documentary ""I'll Be Me."" The documentary outlined his struggle with Alzheimer's, as well as his farewell tour. Glen was well known for his role as La Boeuf, the Texas Ranger accompanying John Wayne and Kim Darby in the Western classic True Grit, which he also composed the soundtrack for. Again, while he wasn't as big as Adam West, I believe that old Glen was a sad exclusion to this year's Memoriam Reel. 

Sorry for the long rant, I just really loved Glen Campbell.&&These In Memoriam segments always manage to piss someone off. &&The academy treats actors that have made their fame in tv as a lower form of life, even if they appear in films.  They treated Bea  Arthur the same way. &&The guy was a television actor. The only movie I can list of his off the top of my head is Batman: the Movie. &&I get it.  You only have so much time.  But seriously?  Powers Boothe?  The man put in his time in some classics both small and big screen.  It's a shame to not give him a moment in front of his peers.

The real insult though?  I'm sure they will claim ""hey we put them all on the website - even Batman/Adam West of TV fame.""

... you just have to endure viewing an ad every four people.  Gotta make a buck eh Oscar?  Couldn't you leave off the cash grab for these folks last curtain call on your website?&&The Oscars are little more than a celebrity circle jerk.&&That's because he is Batman...you never see him coming..or going. RIP.&&They did the same to Andy Griffith several years ago. &&The In Memoriam has been garbage for as long as I can remember. They never get it right, I wish they'd just stop doing it.&&This is why I don't watch the Oscars anymore, they're so over rated&&We don't need Hollywood to tell us who we miss! 

They don't tell me who my heros are.&&There was no Tobe Hooper either, thought it was a weird one to miss considering they put the Texas Chainsaw in the 90 years film reel or whatever. &&They'll regret this, nobody messes with Adam We. &&Is it because he was primarily on television, not the movies? &&Wasn't Adam West more of a TV actor? I don't know much about him outside of batman, which I'm aware had a movie, and family guy so I may be wrong&&Isn't West primarily a TV actor? He's known for the Batman TV Show and Family Guy. Shouldn't he be saved for the Emmys?&&Batman will show his face for nobody, except for justice&&They didn't include Rose Marie either.  Appeared in her first film in 1927 and in her last film (a documentary about her) in 2017. I guess 90 years doesn't mean much to the Academy.&&The fact that 47.6k people have upvoted 8h in makes it a little better. Fuck the oscars. Adam west meant something to real people.&&The Oscars are more and more shabby, and less and less relevant every year. &&West was an early Trump supporter, probably had nothing to do with that but I don't know what to believe anymore, Hollywood has been pretty consistent with shunning anyone associated with Trump.&&Controversial opinion: Fuck the Oscars.&&Probably voted Republican once or something&&I noticed this too and was like ""how the fuck could they leave out Adam West?""&&....but they sure did mention all the producers and publicists.... so.. at least they remembered the money. &&its a god damn shame 
&&Was West not a member of the Academy?

That was the excuse when Joan Rivers wasn't in the Memoriam&&Also OSCAR NOMINATED Mary Tyler Moore&&He was a TV star not a movie star though right? &&Elitists&&The Academy has been fairly clear that they try to include people who primarily part of the film industry. Adam West is more likely remembered for his television work, and Tom Petty for his music.&&Adam west died?&&Well, at least they didn't forget to nominate Meryl Streep... again.&&Was Miguel Ferrer also snubbed?&&Maaaan... Coco afterlife is gonna have one VERY pissed off and Batman-dressed Adam West!&&Holy unforgivable nonsense oscars&&Wow that‚Äôs a huge fuckup. &&Nobody forgets Adam weeeee.&&Unacceptable.  &&That‚Äôs it. Boycott the Oscars. Nobody messes with adam We. &&I guess probably because he was mostly known for being a TV star. 

I was more surprised that there was no mention of Chris Cornell. Has worked on numerous movie soundtracks and was a good friend of the man who was performing the memoriam song, Eddie Vedder. But I suppose he'll be better remembered at the Grammys like West would be at the Emmys.  &&I forgot Adam West died for a minute there this sucks &&Probably because he was a Trump supporter. &&I would release it even earlier, like one year earlier , so the people on the list could know they are going to die.&&There was an article posted saying that this year they had 800 names to narrow down to about 45. &&They do call family members to tell them when someone's been snubbed. &&[deleted]&&It's not like they never thought of Adam West and made some big accident. They made the decision to leave him out for whatever reason, but obviously they were aware they were doing it. &&Powers Boothe, too.&&>I remember when he visited the hospital I was in for my appendix when I was 10.

They say it‚Äôs for the previous calendar year, but whenever a heavyweight dies in weeks before the Oscars (PSH, Heath Ledger), they put them in that year‚Äôs show.&&Sadly, no. 

However, he definitely should have been in the reel. I mean, he was killed by an Alien, a Terminator and a Predator.&&He died late February, which means before last year's Oscars. If he didn't make it into the reel then, I kinda understand why they would leave him out as it's been over a year.&&I think he was in the one last year, might be wrong though. &&He's far bigger to me, honestly. He's been in some really, really big movies. &&> Bill Paxton 

wait...  shit... i had no clue, stroke at 61&&Wait... Bill Paxton's dead?!

( ;n;)&&He was a tomato&&Back in the bag, Paul!&&They had included Sri Devi too, an Indian actor who I am pretty sure never acted in a Hollywood movie nor got nominated in Oscars. Although she was a super big deal in India. &&If Chuck Berry was a member and Adam wasn't, something is rotten in Denmark. &&It's probably anyone who had won or been nominated, but also other actors who were notable from movies, and they probably miss some too, not on accident, but some just don't make the cut.  &&Yeah, and he was even in an Oscar nominated movie &&I totally forgot he had died.  Now I'm sad again.&&Yeah, the Swedish media is really upset about his omission right now.&&The millenium movies were amazing.&&As badass as Keanu was in John Wick, it was Michael Nyqvist who stole the show.&&He's facking dead???!!&&Wait. Shit. When did he die?&&They'll just have Daniel Craig on the in memorium list instead.&&Holy shit you just reminded me he's dead. And I'm very sad now.&&Fuck I didn't even know he died.&&Damn you're right. They dropped...the head on that one &&And Powers Fucking Boothe. &&I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I believe someone representing the deceased (like family or agency) has to put in a request or something like that and then the academy picks from that group of submitted dead people. It‚Äôs really possible the families of West and Hooper just didn‚Äôt do that. &&If they couldn't remember to include Joan Rivers, nothing surprises me anymore (except for the fact that these people are employed in the first place). &&Well ofcourse, he is Mayor Adam We



Edit: So many family guy fans, or Adam West fans, he was a champ

I got to know him from this character, and since then I really got to know him, RIP

However, they hadn't included Andy Griffith when he passed, so an argument can be made that those other people played roles in movies more prominently than West or Griffith did.&&Definitely. Typically as long as they have done a movie (Adam West did Batman '66; absolutely qualifies).&&Weeks in advance? An indian actress just died about a week back and she was mentioned.

""I just wasn't happy. I didn't go home at night and bang my head against the wall, but I was smoking a lot and drinking a lot and it all sort of caught up with me in this dark night of the soul. I finally thought, before I get too old, I've got to try it, and if it doesn't work out, at least I'm not going to be 65 years old, looking back over my life and saying, 'God, why didn't I at least try?'.""&&They mentioned Bill Paxton last year because he died too late to be included in the segment. They mentioned him though. For Adam West: nothing.&&> Stephen Furst

And Scavenger Hunt!&&> Bill Paxton

They had him in last years. &&> John Mahoney

I would consider him more of a TV actor as well.&&He did two low budget movies in the 80s and other than that his 99 acting credits are exclusively in TV along with a few video game voice overs (Half Life). He's much more an ""Emmy"" celebrity than an ""Oscar"". Guillaume is a lot more understandable than West, to be honest.

I wonder if it simply has to do with weather or not you were paid up on your film industry dues at the time of your death/retirement.

That's a silly thought though.

And boring as shit.&&Batman: the Movie though&&Like I said in another comment, Adam West is more known for his TV roles, but he has been in movies. There's a spectrum for actors between movie stars and tv stars: all the way on the movie side, you have someone like Daniel Day Lewis. All the way on the TV side you have, say, Stephen Colbert. 

But there are actors who fall in the middle of that spectrum. James Gandolfini, Mary Tyler Moore, Lucille Ball, and Jackie Gleason were all honored in an oscars In Memoriam. They're all (probably) more well known for TV roles than film roles. So in this spectrum, the academy has to draw a line somewhere. It's not as black and white as just you're a film actor and you're a TV actor. 

Also, this is all assuming West was even in the academy. If he wasn't, then that's your reason right there that he wasn't included. &&But West actually knew the true function of the appendix. It's value is much more than that batarang he bilked you with. Both in financial and sentimental value.&&[You can make those out of old saw blades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpZb1X9smh8).

Adam West had a film career too, no matter how unimportant it was to his legacy. So clearly they're drawing the line somewhere between film stars and television stars, and I'm just trying to help define where that line is. James Gandolfini and Jackie Gleason are on one side of it, and Adam West and Andy Griffith are on the other. Not saying it's wrong or right, just saying there's a spectrum and The Academy drew a line somewhere in that spectrum. &&The contribution part is true.

This happens every goddamn year, the only question I have is why we have to keep having this tired old discussion. OSCARS are for movies, EMMYS are for TV. This isn't rocket surgery. At least save this debate for someone who you can actually name one of their movies. I'm willing to bet no one in here can even name an Adam West movie that wasn't a TV spinoff (Batman: The Movie).&&I get that but they opted to include Michael Jackson over Farrah Fawcett.  &&I could see them doing it like a ""rolling credits"" type thing with occasionally popping up a picture of one of the names in the credits. That ~~was~~ way everyone is honoured, but the greats can truly be remembered, as it should be. &&Adam West doesn‚Äôt make the top 45? &&The whole show is a bit much. It's a giant Hollywood circle jerk broadcasted to the masses in a way that makes the movie industry, the celebrities, and their work appear more significant than they are. &&Right, you can't, which is why the tasteful thing is to just not run the segment, because literally the only purpose it serves is reminding 700+ families that their loved ones weren't as important.  &&I have an image of the producer shouting at the musician on stage ‚Äòjust keep playing damnit we still have 600 names to go!‚Äù&&I didn't watch the show, but I'd be curious to see who the 45 people chosen ABOVE Adam West were.

Also, Adam West did have a film career, just not a particularly successful one. However, at one point he was being eyed for the role of James Bond, before it was given to Roger Moore (who was, of course, honored at this years Oscars).&&Right but they honored Chuck berry. Clearly not about an applied rubric.&&They've done other ""mostly known tv actors"" as well.&&I mean, award shows are just a bunch of mainstream rich people voting for the most popular of the mainstream rich people.&&Also cruelly snubbed by the Oscars.&&some days you just can't get rid of a bomb&&I'm afraid to ask, but I gotta know; what is the true function of the appendix?&&Your appendix will forever remind him of the time he took your appendix from you.&&Oh...&&Being quite a bit older too, I have to constantly remind myself when reading comments, advice, etc that the majority of it is written by the same age group eating tide pods.&&Get off my lawn.

I have Stratego.&&MY GOD! 

Somebodies stealing my water!&&No matter how many times I watch them, there are two things from Family Guy I will always laugh at:

* Adam West killing the Noid and

* Ipecac puke fest.&&Thank you kind person. &&From what I‚Äôve seen he‚Äôs called out Hollywood sexual harassment covertly for a few years, so I could see him respecting that &&Yeah ironically he's one of the better dudes in Hollywood (unless there's something i don't know about)&&Seriously, he and Adam Corolla felt so edgy back then. I mean I know it was dumb shock jock kinda stuff and I was a kid so it prob seemed more extreme than it was, but I remember they were definitely willing to push the envelope somewhat. Now he's so ""wholesome"" and clean that it's kinda offputting&&He made a hooker tongue punch his farting box.&&Or the same movie from a different perspective. &&Hey Adam! It's your cousin, Marvin West! You know that new sound you been looking for?! Well listen to this!


Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na.&&Someone needs to go back and change that. &&He took a 13 year old girl from Mexico to ""work in his St. Louis bar"" where she escaped and went to the police three weeks later, and he was convicted of the Mann Act.

Now the Mann Act is super racist (and a different issue), but transporting a girl to work in a bar in another country is pretty fucking shady.&&I mentioned this to a coworker today and she said that she didn't know about Kobe's sexual assault scandal. I shrugged and said, ""yeah, it was years ago.""

And that's why the Oscars doesn't exclude him or Chuck Berry. It's not some morality play, it's public opinion, and unfortunately, most people have forgotten about Kobe's sordid past.&&That's so incredibly wholesome, like a film you'd cry at the ending, but would be happy to do so&&I still find it sad that Anton is dead. I wasn't the biggest fan at all but he made some entertaining movies.&&It's true. I watched it Christmas Day and now I'm dead.&&Pass me the SHARK REPELLENT&&You are already snubbing them by not showing their names&&Maybe not do pictures then just do rolling credits, that way everyone is honoured and nobody can claim anyone got special treatment.&&Yeah I thought of this but I think most people would be quite alright with at least having the name of the passed up there. I would hope, and assume that the families and friends of the people who didn't have a picture show up would understand that the show can't take up a large chunk of time with the memoriam, and the fact that they included the name should be enough. 

Maybe the academy does a vote on who they feel should be included in picture form I don't know, that way the blame can all be put on them when pictures don't pop up haha. &&They already select out a few with video rather than a static photo.&&perhaps, but I'd certainly rather be remembered by my name and no picture than have no recognition at all.&&I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with
the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61!&&MAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRVVVVVVIN&&*Cloverfield monster appears*&&If it‚Äôs a bootstrap paradox it‚Äôs okay. &&So what you're saying is, you can't drive '55?&&I enjoyed that movie. I'll admit it.&&I actually really liked the movie, and have watched it numerous times.  &&Mine is when the guy is named after three related car brands.&&Yeah, it's called ""the entire movie"".&&Oddly, I remember that theme being polarizing at the time. It's aged well, like the Garbage one.&&See? He's a filmmaker. &&Well that's disappointing to learn&&Yeah I thought about that too. In fact, any time I think of Chuck Berry that's what springs to mind. Its weird how this year the prevailing theme was basically ousting perverts and the like but included a convicted one on their memoriam.

EDIT: he was never convicted, my bad. Still, this is worth a read if you were unaware of his sordid backstory: https://nypost.com/2017/03/21/the-dark-past-of-chuck-berrys-scandal-filled-sex-life/amp/&&Actually, West turned down the role as he felt that Bond should be British. Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood turned down the role for the same reason. Interestingly enough, Dick Van Dyke auditioned, but they had him do an English accent. We've all seen Mary Poppins, so we know how that went. 

Remember, Adam West was being considered around 1970. At the time, only Sean Connery, David Niven, and George Lazenby had been Bond, and Connery was the only one that really resonated with audiences. It definitely wouldn't have been as great of an upset as it would be now. &&For...now.&&Mind blown. An appendix appendix.&&Would anybody like to play Stratego? I have Stratego&&As an Indian person I agree. You shouldn't have her in your Oscars any more than we should have Tom Cruise in our filmfare awards.

Edit: If it was someone like Dev Patel or Priyanka Chopra it would make more sense, since they've been involved in both industries.&&AAAAA

I'm going to get all the As out of my body!&&*Marty starts doing the Batusi*&&Kobe wasn't convicted of rape though. The police dropped the case after they found out that the ""victim"" likely had sex with another man within hours of having had sex with Kobe and thus that she wouldn't make for a credible witness. They didn't believe that a girl who had just been raped would have sex just hours later and it also hurt the physical evidence they had for the rape case. I don't blame them. &&[deleted]&&Can I have your shoes?&&F &&Thoughts and prayers ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§&&It‚Äôs BAT-SHARK REPELLENT.

And unlike Bond themes from the 80s, it didn't make heavy use of instruments that would be considered kind of obsolete 5 years later. Here's to you, synclavier players!&&you made me laugh. now I feel bad&&Allow me to disappoint you further... there's also a sex tape where he farts in a hookers face and makes her smell it.&&Yep. I'm from St. Louis and it was always difficult to accept that one of our biggest icons was a disgusting pervert. Super influential in his contributions to music no doubt but he tarnished his own legacy by using his power and influence to exploit women. &&He also hired prostitutes, filmed them, and farted in their faces. 100% real. Can link if you want(you don't).&&It's better to never learn too much about the personal lives of your heroes.

Unless it's Tom Hanks or Mr. Rogers.&&[deleted]&&Oh dear lord, Dick Van Dyke as Bond hurts me in a place I can‚Äôt describe. 


You can get away with Bond having a Scottish accent, he was half Scottish.  But not goddamn cockney wannabe.&&Barry Nelson, an American actor, played Bond in the first Casino Royale in 1954.


Strangely enough, there have been as many non-Brits to play Bond as Brits. Niven, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Daniel Craig are British. Nelson was American, Connery is a Scot, Lazenby is an Aussie, and Brosnan is Irish.


I would have liked to have seen Burt Reynolds as James Bond just for the cringe factor.&&No one messes with Adam We&&Appendixitis often leads to a full-blown septic incunabula.&&Future old people are wizards.&&#üí°s & üôès&&You're horrible, never change.&&Nice of Sir Patrick Stewart to show up and offer his condolences. &&HE WHO CONTROLS THE PANTS CONTROLS THE GALAXY! &&Actually I think you‚Äôll find that it‚Äôs ‚Äòshark repellent bat-spray‚Äô...

I think the punchline of the whole thing is that she tries to kiss him and he says ""I can't kiss you, you smell like piss."" &&I don't thank you&&So what I'm hearing is that he wrote, directed, and starred in his own films? Why *wouldn't* he be honored at the Oscars?&&Someday we're going to find out Tom Hanks chewed his fingernails or didn't separate his recyclables.  
  

And that will be a sad day for us. &&COR BLIMEY GUVNAH, ME NAME'S BOND!  JAMES BOND, INNIT?&&I kinda feel for the dude.

A whole week sooner, I'll take it!&&Maybe they just moved to the same international release to avoid spoilers?&&Moves it away from finals week, thank goodness&&I guess they wanted to space out the releases of Infinity War and Solo and give both movies room to breathe. Not surprised that dates were moved but surprised that they moved the Avengers and not Star Wars, and that too to an earlier date.&&Has this been done before where such a huge movie has announced this so soon to release date?  Nonetheless, it's one less week for us to wait so I'm excited!&&Definitely a great move. Avoids global spoilers, Deadpool 2, and Solo.

**Lucasfilm** tweets ""On a scale of #Solo to everybody, who is excited to see #SoloFilm on May 25th?""

**Emilia Clarke** responds ""Any chance it'll still be in theaters over Christmas so I can watch it with my dragons?""

**Lucasfilm**: ""How's about we just movie the release date back to December?""&&This date is my wife and I's 5-year anniversary. What a fun gift. :)&&Awesome. May is packed so this makes total sense. &&I was dreading that full week of spoilers, this is great. &&I really want this to beat The Force Awakens in the box office, the MCU is my absolute favourite collection of films. &&I literally planned my vacation week from work around this movie so I could see it over and over and over again. Mother fuckers. Avengers 2, I saw 5 days in a row &&They may have moved it to be the same as international release to avoid spoilers. Also Deadpool 2 comes out May 18 so that gives Infinity War one extra week to make more money. Makes sense they changed it.&&If this means they're gonna extend the movie to something around 3 hours to accommodate all those stars then I'm totally fine with it. &&So does that kid with the racist parents still have the invitation to go to the premier with Ruffalo and Evans? No idea why that popped in my head when I saw this headline...but it did&&I get married on the 28th. 

Fuck.&&This does put a smile on my face.&&So conflicted. I get to see IW earlier but I booked the day off work for the original date. &&They did it so they could put the avengers logo in April. &&This just in: WB to delay Rampage until August 3&&This does put a smile on my face&&Good move by Disney/Marvel. I want this movie to make as much money as possible. Screw Titanic.&&ITT: April 27th is everyone's B-Day.&&It's definitely to avoid spoilers, and everyone who's saying Disney did this because they're afraid of Deadpool 2 needs to chill out.&&What the fuck?&&I know it‚Äôs not that big of a change, but it being in April instead of May is somehow so comforting to me.&&I‚Äôve never seen that happen with a major tentpole movie before. The hype is *insane*. Bravo, Marvel.&&IT COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! I'm so pumped! RDJ ya legend, thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è&&This Spring is shaping up to be fucking great&&Aww, I'm kinda sad that it's not on May 4 anymore. That's when the first movie came out in 2012. Thought it would be kind of poetic. 

Ah well.&&One less week of waiting? PRAISE THE LORD!!!!&&I have been working in movie theatres for 22 years. The first weekend of May has been the unofficial start of the summer movie season since 1999. Prior to that it was the second Friday of May. By moving Avengers up to the last weekend of April, Disney is essentially adding a week to the summer movie season. &&I am overly excited happy about this news. When do tickets go on sale?&&Has any Blockbuster of this size ever moved up around 2 months before release?&&Time to swap those billboards&&trailer 2 gotta be coming soon, hopefully tomorrow&&My wedding is April 29th and then I'm leaving for 2 weeks. This is the best news I've ever received! &&Still April 25 in Australia, that suits me.&&Why did they put the word ""fantastic"" in all caps? Why? WHY??!!!!!! I hate 4play.&&BTW, that record is currently held by Furious 7, which made  around $150 million during Easter Weekend back in 2015.&&Do these records even matter anymore?&&Disney: hehehe&&Disney has control of the industry and the box office, he's too powerful to be left alive!

Disney: UNLIMITED CASHFLOWWW&&Or to give Supertroopers 2 only one good week of box office crushing revenue. &&[The mentioned tweet(s).](https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/969301303682727937)&&I saw someone like a facebook post and was like ""that must be old.""

Then I scrolled further and saw the official Disney page posted it too. So I came here to confirm.&&Definitely planned tweets&&Just realised its new for americans. In India we were getting it on 27 th anyway.&&> Between RDJ's *assistant* and Marvel Studios *marketing team*.

FTFY&&Money. Deadpool was set to release 2 weeks later, surely would have cut the boxoffice of IW a lot. Now they have 3 weeks difference, definitely will earn quite a bit more now. &&Would be awesome if they were like:

""Fuck it, it's on Netflix in an hour"".&&Pretty much this. Means I have one less week to finish my marvel movie marathon&&Pretty sure it has something to do with the fact that may 4th is star wars day and Disney didn't want their two biggest franchises to mix like that.&&Not for me, it was originally going to release so that I could go Thursday night after my last final. Now it‚Äôs right in the mix

Edit: Okay, everyone seems to be concerned with my academia. Don‚Äôt worry y‚Äôall, I know to prioritize my education over a comic book movie&&This is the best news I have ever received. Now I won't feel as bad about skipping out on more studying.&&Yup, I was gonna hand in my thesis 3 days after. Not a good time to spend time on movies. This is much better! Although I honestly wouldn't have complained if they moved it back a few days either, there's nothing like celebrating the end of exams with an anticipated movie. &&They moved it right into my finals week... The original date would have let me replenish my brain juice before I went to go see it. Now I will be brain dead and unable to process what is going on. Oh well, I guess I‚Äôll have to see it 8 times instead of 7 now...&&Be honest. You would have gone if you had an 8am Final the next morning. I know this cause I did this for the first Avengers. &&Star wars is on Memorial Day weekend, I believe, which is just too much to pass up.&&I just didn't understand why they couldn't release Solo on May 4th.  May 4th is a star wars holiday!&&I kinda remember Transformers 3 doing something similar, I have no idea why I have that useless tidbit of knowledge stored in valuable memory bank space. &&I'm not sure there's ever been a movie this huge. TFA maybe, but this is like $100 higher in terms of budget and has 10 more movies leading up to it.

Also am excited. Desperate to know when tickets are on sale.&&Happens surprisingly often. Studios often get a sense for how rival movies are tracking and change the dates by a week or so a couple of months in advance.&&This..does put a smile on my face.&&Agreed, I think we might even get a post credit or even a title release of Avengers 4 as a result.&&Hell, black panther is doing so well, it might still be in theaters while avengers opens. &&""Holy shit are you Captain America?""

""No, mad""&&the beard looks glorious&&Yup! Can't wait for somebody to get this man a shield!&&Were I a betting man I‚Äôd say later today honestly. Buzz is through the roof on social media.&&And Solo the week after.&&It would be hilarious if Deadpool 2 also moved up by 1 week to open on May 11th (which is relatively free btw and gives it a 2 week cushion between avengers and Han Solo).&&It was probably done to avoid poaching viewers from Solo, and vice versa.&&Imagine if even one those tweets had a typo &&All caps 'FANTASTIC' and the original date was May 4th? Fantastic Four confirmed for Avengers.&&Almost certainly a scripted joke, but that's still hilarious&&*Nobody* wants to compete with that brand new Funky Mode!&&You kidding?

They probably loved the character and the location of Wakanda. And you tell them. Well in 2 months, you get more Black Panther and more Wakanda.&&Ugh when you say it like that it feels a lot further down the road&&Perfect time for a second watch then &&ITS ON NETFLIX RIGHT NOW&&If you want to see a lot of unfinished FX, then yes.

I feel like my entire life is a lie.&&Yeah there's nothing significant releasing on April 27th either, so might as well eat up 3 weeks of BO instead of 2.&&I do find it a little odd that they waited until so close to move the date.

^^^/s&&Some disappointed Marvel fan is going to have to sit through the new Amy Schumer movie when they aren't able to get tickets fast enough&&I can't even imagine the logistical mess changing the date would have been. That's my best guess why it took them this long to change the date. 

Or maybe they were hoping Fox might shift Deadpool 2 to a later date because it's sandwiched between IW and Solo, and they waited as long as they could. &&I think it was the success of Black Panther tbh it was such a surprise success (topping the box office for 3 straight weeks) that they probably realized that they had nothing to lose by moving it up a week but a lot to gain. This gives them an extra week for newcomers to see it and for repeat viewings beforehand Deadpool comes for the second-viewing crowd.&&Yeah, but Solo isn't going to do well. (It won't flop, it's Star Wars, but it's not going to make waves at the box office)&&A regular moviegoer that just *kinda* likes superhero movies will probably be choosing.&&If all of us on /r/movies were responsible for the entire boxoffice for movies, that would be really be something awesome, wouldn't it? BR2049 wouldn't have been a flop if that were the case, I can tell you that much! &&What causes a movie to break out like what we're seeing right now with black panther is for people to see it multiple times. Originally not many comic fans would be checking out avengers 3 for their 2nd or 3rd time if they're in another screen Checking out deadpool. &&Many people watch these movies just to watch something. MANY. They don't want to specifically watch one of these, they're just like ""oh the new \*insert famous franchise\* is out, whatever, might as well watch it"". So a lot of them may just go to one of them if they're released very close to each other.&&By 'a lot' I didn't mean 25% of something. By a lot I meant 50-100~M, and that is *a lot*, you can check /r/boxoffice right now, all experts are changing their IW predictions, moving them up.  And yeah Deadpool is going to be damaged by IW, but Fox is being super stubborn about it and unwilling to move it. Though their stubbornness did just make things a bit easier for them.&&But Deadpool 2 also has Marvel Entertainment as a production company. If Deadpool 2 doesn't do well Marvel loses money. It's in their interest to let both movies do well.&&I would pay an absurd amount of money to be able to watch IW opening night in the comfort of my own home, without a bunch of stupid screaming children nearby.

Saw Civil War on the most expensive Screen of my multiplex cinema with the big 4k projector and Dolby Atmos sound and the theater was packed but everybody shut the fuck up because they paid that bigger amount.

Then I saw Justice League on the least expensive screen of the same multiplex and a lot less people in the cinema and it was horrible, every two minutes the assholes around me would talk, play with their phones and one dropped their fucking tortilla chips with cheese dip right at the start of the movie and wouldn't shut up about it for like 15 minutes...

At least this story is focused on the family and human characters and the magic that happens to be using a known real world product called Animal Crackers. Though beat for the beat the movie seems predictable.

- Family/Parents looking for a better life

- They get the circus and animal crackers and start becoming popular and successful.

- Warburton warburtons his way around, and tries to buy the circus which the family won't do.

-Warburton gets the crackers and either opens a competing show or blackmails them into letting him buy.

-Climax happens where everything previously seen comes together and somehow Warburton is turned into an animal, preferably a llama.&&They go for big names because that's how you get people to watch this crap, big names take it because it's easy money mans recording lines is easy when you don't care how the performance is going to be judged, plus it's not their actual face in the shitty movie. After you've locked down the big names that get your movie sales, the remaining crumbs of your budget go to bottom of the barrel writing and animation. Doesn't really matter that those are crap.&&And then somehow get nominated for Oscars. WTF&&I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because they only have to show up for like 2 days and record their parts. Also I‚Äôd assume they can schedule the actors to show up at anytime. They don‚Äôt have to coordinate schedules of the different actors. &&> They get these big-name actors but the movie has no script

They only pay them for a few days/weeks of voice work. As opposed to being on location for months, learning scripts, stunt training etc etc etc

I'd imagine audiences in NYC might be a bit different than audiences in rural Minnesota. The ones I go too in Ohio never seem to have issues. You get the occasional shitty person that will talk but it's hardly typical.

Also, the movie you're seeing, the sort of people that are interested in seeing it, the time of day, the number of people in the theater, the way the seats are arranged, I think it all contributes to how good or bad the audience is.&&It's possible, but for me it's a recent thing. Up until like 2010, I could go to any movie, and 99% of the time, everybody in the audience was absolutely fine.

Dad's Cookie: The First Snackerdoodle was simply amazing.  Who knew you could take that crusty old Dad's Cookie, that NOBODY likes, and make it into a fan favorite?  Absolutely amazing.&&The Woody Woodpecker movie being terrible is faithful to the source material. &&It's not that non Disney/Pixar animated movies look terrible necessarily but the art style is often more generic and the texture work, background and characters tend to be lower quality with less detail and stiffer, less fluid movement.

For instance the animation quality in Space Chimps was offensively bad for a full theatrical release even at the time. With flat muddy textures and poorly animated characters it reminded me of a PS2 game, and although that's an exaggeration you could tell it was pushed out the door for the least money possible and with little craft. That's the kind of movie I think u/Dr_P3nda is talking about. It was obvious they wanted to make a cheap animated movie about chimps in space that you could take your kids too and nothing else, Disney and Pixar usually try and shoot a little higher in terms of quality and artistry and it tends to make for far better movies that can appeal to every age group.&&To be fair, this is just general life advice.&&I keep saying this. But Rogue One felt more like a Star wars movie than either of the other two new films. &&I couldn't agree with you more. It also had one of my favorite Darth Vader murder sprees! That movie isnt number one for me, but definitely number 2. &&Time of day is a big one. Sure, the price of a Saturday matinee is tempting, but you're going to be sharing that theater with large families with loud children.

If I want silence, I go on a Monday afternoon.

One was someone smoking in the seat in from of me(and for some reason they weren't removed)&&Yeah, its pretty hard to be angry while watching F&F or be super critical of it when they aren't trying to hide what kind if movie they're making. &&it's the fact that they embrace how stupid it is and just go with it.

I remember that scene in the last movie when they've all got grappling hooks in Dom's car encapsulates it perfectly.

The Rock: ""He's gotta have 2000 horsepower in that thing!""

*ok, a little silly but not impossible*

The geek dude: ""Try 3000!""

*ok that's just stupid*

Statham: ""Try 5000!""

*ok that's just stupid hilarious*

that's what makes dumb movies great.  When a dumb movie pretends it's smart, it's fucking horrible.  like Batman v Superman.&&Man, when the Rock flexes (**FLEXES**) that cast off his arm.. I nearly died&&>You don't go into those movies expecting complex plots and excellent character development.. 

In the Fast and furious movies, the directors seem to be saying ""This is really dumb, but we both know it's dumb so just have some dumb fun and I'll see you at the end.""

In the Transformer movies, and many other mindless action movies, the director seems to be saying ""This is really dumb, and you're dumb for liking it. Fuck you.""&&The problem is that the ticket price is meant to act as a tool to decrease the crowds but it seems that people are willing to pay regardless. &&As much as I dislike Disney as a corporate entity, it's pretty undeniable that they're *very* good at what they do and set a high bar.  
All the meal-type food I've had at Disneyland was very good, and around a similar price point as a normal restaurant. The snack foods are fairly expensive though.
  
Compare that to Six Flags, where every time I've eaten anything from either their own restaurant, or the franchises that rent space inside the park, it all has made me physically ill, or at least left me feeling like shit for a few hours. I won't eat park food there anymore. Basically the whole Six Flags experience sucks, the roller coasters are the only draw.&&Ha, Samuel L. Jackson&&There's already a porn spoof in the works. &&Sunshine is already trying to get out *Hydrox* before the *Oreo* premiere.&&We all know ""Oreo: Torn in Two"" is where it's at  
and it's upcoming sequer ""Oreo: Two Halves Divided""

&&The only reason anyone ever watched it was because Biker Mice From Mars and Street Sharks were on immediately after.&&Gareth Edwards style of cinematography goes hand in hand with the huge establishing shots of landscapes and planets that the prequels used. It‚Äôs why rogue one felt like such a perfect mix of prequel and original trilogy.

Honesty, after his take on Godzilla I had absolute faith in Rogue One.
&&That's because they weren't so obsessively trying to mimic them, and did a better job of making a real star wars story within the universe rather than purely parroting&&Finally getting to see Vader being Vader was the best. The last ten minutes of the movie was so intense.&&* I watched Titanic sitting next to some lady who was translating each line into Armenian for her mother.

* Last night I watched Game Night with 3 guys talking through the entire movie. 

*  I saw American Hustle and a couple was commenting on Bradley Coopers fat suit for about 30 minutes straight.

* During Fast & Furious 7 two people near the front started arguing and almost got into a fight, the theater stopped the movie and the cops were brought in.  They restarted the movie but we had missed about 5-10 minutes of the movie.

* Age of Ultron, a group of guys were so drunk, one started puking and the others were fumbling around trying to help him.  Movie was stopped, they emptied the theater and gave us each passes to see another film.

These are all the times I remember off the top of my head.  I'm sure there were many more instances that weren't quite as bad.  I really go out of my way not to see movies opening weekend anymore, early mid-week movies that have been out for 3 weeks are great.  Watching at home is the best.  nobody unfolding loud candy wrappers, or the smell of stale popcorn or cheap hotdog mustard.  Seriously I can't wait for all movies to be direct to streaming.

EDIT: Spelling&&7 is the one with the car's chasing a submarine right?

If you told 7 year old me there'd be a movie with a car/submarine chase I'd have given you my allowance for a year.&&It was truly glorious.&&Daddy's gotta go to work.  &&There‚Äôs honestly nothing quite like the Disney park experience. I‚Äôve been to disneyland many times and have ever only had 1 negative interaction. Everything else has been magical.

Def worth the price for me, even as an adult.&&The beauty of inelastic demand. &&Exactly. And the increase of foreign tourists to the parks pushes that as well. When they see on market research that people are willing to spend 40-70 and more for a few hours for a sporting event and even 100+ for a broadway production, they see that they can boost prices for all day park admission. I couldn't imagine how crazy it would be if they reverted to the old ticket book style for rides. 

My wife and I used to have annual passes for DL and I grew up near WDW. Late September and October used to be quiet-ish times. We would hit up the park for dinner and a few rides on a weekday night. I could walk down main street and have my arms spread wide if I wanted. It's gotten more busy and crowded during those times over the past few years. WDW has been slammed with visitors from Europe and South America (Brazil). It's going to be crazy when Galaxy's Edge opens at WDW and DL. But... I'll also say my Disney stock value has been amazing over the past years. So there is that.&&They set up their tickets in a way where it is very expensive to be there 2 or 2 days.  It gets substantially cheaper per day to do a 8 or 10 day ticket. They get people to stay longer, in their hotels, buying their food and merchandise. All because they can go to the parks 10 days for $550 where as a 1 day ticket is $120.&&It's because going to any of the Disney parks is like going to another realm. My girlfriend and I went to Disney World last summer (we're in our early 20's) and it was honestly still as magical as it was when I was a kid. Disney might be this huge scary company to some people (understandably)... But they do still try to make your Disney experience in their parks amazing. In my opinion, the ticket prices are worth it. But for other people, I can see how people think they're over priced... Idk. The Disney experience is unmatched.&&Of course the rollercoasters at Six Flags are amazing, but the one time I've been there, I ended up spending about 9 hours in line to go on 3 rides (3 hours for each ride). Then I had to leave. Sure the rides were awesome but the overall experience truly sucked. This was on a weekday, too. &&My biggest disappointment was when I went to the Japanese restaurant in Epcot and ordered ramen and got cold instant ramen with a parsley leaf on top...got a dope bonsai tree though!! &&Ah, okay. He doesn't have very large parts though as is, they could easily just have him pop up here and there. He isn't even confirmed for Infinity War, unfortunately.&&I wonder if porn spoofs are actually popular. They're probably not good spoofs and they're probably not good *porn...*&&Fuck yeah Biker Mice!  Fuck yeah Street Sharks!&&[deleted]&&I will never forgive the cut to the kid watching TV instead of showing us the kaiju fight at the airport. Fucking asshole. 

Rogue One was alright though. &&If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the cinematic power that you're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You saw what others had done and you didn't take the next step. You didn't create the IP yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of ""geniuses"" to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now

[bangs on the table]

you're selling it, you wanna sell it. Well...

This shit's on another level.&&Well this is going to make 5 billion dollars.&&Bravo on Marvel for providing a trailer that is still a trailer and not a whole movie in a trailer. I have no idea what's going on but I'm super excited!&&Oh fuck!

Star-Lord and Stark looks like a great combo.

Ebony Maw fucking with Strange.

Thanos wearing his helmet.

This looks outstanding!

It's nice seeing Thanos be a physical threat to nearly all of them, Cap, Iron Man and Thor, nice to see him getting his hands dirty.

EDIT- I'll leave this here https://imgur.com/SrVYyvL&&>Oh, we're using our made up names, I'm Spider-Man.

Perfect.&&Remember Marvel trailer fuckery.

Just because you see a character or event in a location in the trailer, doens't mean that's how it's going to be shown in the film.

Ragnarok trailer had Hela attacking Asgard and destroying Mijolnir in a street fight with Thor.&&That shot with Thanos and Cap... Goosebumps&&Steve attempting to block Thanos‚Äô attack is pure Captain America. They nailed it boys.&&All these interactions - Quill and Stark. Groot and Thor. Stephen Strange and Spider-Man. Motherfucking Captain America and Thanos!!!! 

Come on April 27th!

Edit: Respect for the hyphen. &&WHERE THE FUCK IS HAWKEYE&&For a cast this big and a budget this large, I'm walking in expecting two things: fun interactions between characters who haven't met yet, and lots of fireworks. Everything on top of that is just gravy.&&There it is. Can't wait for another month!

Seeing everyone together really is something special, they've really earned this over 10 years.&&A Disney movie trailer is going to surpass that Disney business practices rant post. How fitting.&&>I hope they remember you

Cut to Ironman, cut to Cap, both looking very distressed.... 

Oh no üò¢&&I'm so glad they're showing Thanos in his armor even if its just a flashback. 

Also, the snap holy shit! 
&&Captain America looks like such a bad ass in this. Easily my favorite Marvel character since the Russo brothers took over his character. Glad that they're the ones directing this, too.&&Cap holding back Thanos with his bare hands is fucking amazing. That's going to be the Civil War helicopter holding scene x100.&&Is there any evidence to suggest that Iron man *doesn't* die in this movie? We know characters like black panther, black widow, and spiderman are going to get more movies, but has anyone heard anything about future iron man movies?&&The Russo Bros deserve so much respect. They‚Äôre imo the best Marvel directors. &&Fandango server admins on suicide watch.&&Star Lord talking to Stark felt a lot like Andy Dwyer talking to Ben Wyatt. I fully expected Tony to look into the camera and shrug. &&Feigie: ""fine you don't like the muscle tee armor. Here have some fucking full armor and helmet. Does that make you happy nerds!?!?!""

Nerds: ""yes""&&Oh great. Now Tony's got to deal with two Peters that keep giving him shit.&&Here is the [Poster](https://i.imgur.com/l0in5mU.jpg)

Edit: just noticed hawkeye still nowhere to be seen :( &&Let the Summer of Josh Brolin begin!&&I‚Äôm just here for smarter people to tell me what all I should have noticed in the trailer üò¨üò¨&&Still no Hawkeye and Ant-man&&Is anyone suffering from super hero fatigue yet?  Anyone?

I didn't fucking think so.&&You have really got to hand it to them for these movies. The fact that they all have their own franchises that have been successful and then to merge them into a single movie took a lot of time and planning. Infinity Stones being dropped in here and there and other plots that intersect. It's really cool to be alive to watch them one at a time.

You know what would be insane is if they had a movie like there for VR where you can choose which character viewpoint you take part in. &&It's almost like The Avengers are the bad guys. Just let the guy get his stones, shit. &&The trailer for Disney's biggest movie right below a post vilifying them.


This was pretty great though,CGI looks more polished and the scale is as grand as it gets.&&oh shit they got voldemort in this movie!?!?!&&Poor Dr. Strange. No one will ever get his name right.&&Captain America. Chris Evans literally is Steve Rogers at this point. That is gonna be one iconic fucking scene &&Seems like they‚Äôve got the serious angle down and will pull back on some of the humor without removing it entirely, which is good. 

I‚Äôm so excited!&&Fuck me, lads. That was just an incredible trailer. 

TO THE FRONT PAGE YOU GO!!&&And just a design note to the folks at Warner Bros... See? You can do ""dark"" without actually filming *in the dark*. &&Personally, I‚Äôm excited for the MU version of the battle of Naboo.&&Bah Gawd!!! Thanos in helmet. The Black Order! Dr. Strange getting pwned by Ebony Maw. Cap holding back Thanos! OMG!!!!!!!!&&10k views a minute. Wow just wow.&&How spoilery is this? Im tempted to watch but at the same time want to avoid until seeing the film&&[Disney‚Äôs response to that guy calling them out ](https://i.imgur.com/qSMfRrx.jpg)&&The Russo brothers are making a great job with Cap, every bit that he shows up in the teaser, trailer and clip he gives me the chills or just by the mention of him. The Black Panther part asking for a Shield, him holding Proxima's spear, receiving Thanos' punch. Since Avengers 1 Cap became my favourite hero and is both thanks to the great work of Evans and the Russos. It won't matter how much movies he will keep making as Cap, i will miss him when he lives.&&So the hologram Shuri is displaying, infinity stone in the vibranium. Right?&&Parker has a ton of screen time in this trailer and I'm A-Fucking-OK with that&&I would love to see the Netflix characters make an appearance, even if it's one quick shot.&&Okay so I just want to set the record straight. The stakes are at an all time high right now. In the two trailers so far we've seen:

Superhero| Rekd| Not Rekd | Possibly Rekd
---|---|----|----
Spider-Man| ‚úî| |
Vision | ‚úî| |
Iron Man | ‚úî| |
Thor | ‚úî| |
Dr. Strange | ‚úî| |
Hulk(buster) | ‚úî| |
Captain America | | | ‚úî

This movie is going to be insane!!! Feige, Russos, you beautiful bastards.&&*Please, please, have music as good as the trailers.*&&But who is pulling all the weight while the rest of the group slacks off?&&He's still playing Andy at the end of the day... &&Who's the best: Regular Andy, Space Andy, or Dinosaur Andy?&&This exactly like something Andy Dwyer from Parks and Rec would say.&&Never expected a murder threat back handed compliment&&Of all the badass shit in this trailer,  that line is what made me smile the most.&&[deleted]&&Thanos knows hes a threat and that makes him scarier&&haha 'WHERE IS THE ELDER WAND' 

""I keep telling you, you're in the wrong movie!""

&&Woah, he does look like Voldemort&&He was creepy AF too. I liked it.&&Yeah, who was that?&&Naw dawg, that was Cad Bane&&And he was givin him the ""shh shh shh...""&&Well it doesn't look like Thanos is struggling much, but it looks like he's surprised by Cap.&&Cap>Thanoscopter.&&Cap is going to die isn't he?&&I thought that was regular size Gamora and Thanos was just huge.&&I'm so happy they are including scenes with Thanos' backstory! I can't wait &&Bleeding Edge suit!!&&Yea, Iron Man develops a suit that can morph into different machinery, rather than physically requiring every part to be stowed away in little compartments. It's called the Bleeding Edge suit and it's basically made of nano machines. It's portrayed as a liquid metal sort of thing that can take the shape of whatever he designs and expand/compress to a crazy degree. In the comics, he has the nano machines stored in the hollows of his bones, so he can always have the suit with him.

Less ""Transformers"" and more ""Terminator 2""&&He snaps his finger and Part 2 is about trying to fix shit.

Even odds that a few of the Avengers are among the half that get blinked out of existence.&&That's literally what I've wanted ever since Thanos showed up in the first Avengers&&I am beyond excited. It‚Äôs becoming abundantly clear to me that Thanos is the protagonist of this movie trying to collect the Infinity Stones, and the Avengers are the antagonists trying to stop him.&&The scene of him seeing the spaceship while on the school bus and having to leave and suit up is a literal fantasy I had more than once as a kid&&Spidey will always be my favorite and i think with Tom Holland they have the best Spider Man ever. He has the same Spidey like Humor as in the comics and he is incredibly witty. I cant wait for more Spidey.&&It was like their fun way of reminding us, ‚Äúwe get Spider-Man.‚Äù&&Having read Infinity Gauntlet recently.. I can't imagine how they're gonna defeat Thanos anyways. Maybe if the Hulk swallowed one of the stones and Strange sent him hurtling through that infinite loop thing forever so Thanos couldn't reach it.&&How the fuck is the new Antman going to work coming out in July? I assume this will have a cliffhanger with end of the world implications, and Antman will just go on a cheerful heist with Michael Pena right after?&&I insisted that my MIL watch Avengers 1 & 2 and Civil War because she's gonna wanna watch Avengers 3. She had no idea the Guardians were in the 3rd one until I told her.

Also, she was soooo impressed with ""young"" Kurt Russell, so I had to show her ""young"" RDJ from Civil War.&&I think it may be in Avengers 4 (which is the true climax of all of it really)&&I'm hoping for [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/44/d1/6144d107df838f1c50dc85ce5c8cdce1.jpg) [scene](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ByMq3KLXI-Y/VV30IaW-twI/AAAAAAAAG8k/AnqWz_vGm6o/s1600/Hero-Envy-Captain-America-7b.jpg) maybe in the 2nd one.

EDIT: Better image&&So this Ebony Maw, can you describe how he looked?   

How he looked? He looked like the type of guy that would shush somebody&&In the Cap v Thanks gif it looks like a shield appears when out of nowhere on his right arm when it cuts to Caps close up, is that just me?&&Jesus fuck the whole Black Order is taller than Loki. Even Proxima Midnight. That‚Äôs intimidating as hell.&&[deleted]&&It all started in a cave. With a box of scraps.&&Has there ever been a film project this big? It's ten years and like 16 movies or something. All building towards this. How has this not only worked, but worked so well it's the biggest freaking movie release of any given year?

Young me would never believe this was possible.&&>  I remember walking into Iron Man and being so fucking excited to see a metal man shoot a rocket at a tank and blow it up.

Damnn. It seems so long ago.&&For real. I remember pissing my pants when the first Avengers came out. This is just....so big. It's mind blowing to me.

It's also what the DCMU failed to do. I'm PUMPED to see these characters interact. Star Lord and Stark finally on the same screen together? Hell yeah! Doctor Strange and Spidey? Fuck yeah!! They introduced these characters as single elements and then, ever so slowly brought them together. They gave us proper fore play where as DC rammed it in with no lube.&&Even before Iron Man, I remember saying that a proper Avengers film will never exist. It would cost a fortune and require too many big actors to be done right and it'll just be an impossible task. 

I'm thrilled at how wrong I was. &&I remember being 12-years old and not knowing much about Iron Man when I walked into the theater. Then Nick Fury showed up in the end and I never expected it would ever get this big.&&why make billions, when it can make...millions??&&[deleted]&&There's gonna be so much packed into this movie, it turns out the trailer is literally just 20 scenes in order. Jump cuts for days&&Marvel is great at this.
Terminator Genisys didn't even need a trailer, the poster gave away the ending.&&Bert Macklin has come a long way&&Can't wait for Black Widow to really really shoot him hard with her pistol tho! &&Can you explain who Ebony Maw is? All I thought during the trailer is, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this Lord Voldemort lookin dude?‚Äù&&Dr. Stranges reaction is basically ""I'm fed up of having to explain it's my real name!""
&&I love how Peter is written in these movies!&&I love how excited he seems to be in all the scenes he stand in. &&I'm so glad they're not losing the humor here. Spiderman is great for diffusing terrifying situations with shitty jokes.&&Holland freaking nails Peter Parker. I‚Äôm so excited to see what he does with the role over the next decade. &&""Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except, it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good.""&&Thor wasn't even wearing the patch in the original Ragnarok trailer!


Marvel knows what they're doing with their trailers.&&Tony and Gamora are definitely not talking to one another. Also Thor is holding something when the lightning strikes. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve figured so far.&&Despite realistically being physically underpowered, everytime Cap does something awesome, whether it be almost picking up Thor's hammer, being able to beat the shit out of Iron man or even stopping Thanos's glove, I get chills.

I'm so pumped for this.&&This trailer could have been just been that shot and I'd still be hyped, fuck I can't wait&&True but they better come up with something good as to how Cap can even hold him off like that. Most of the superheroes in the MCU are always weaker than their comics counterparts but Thanos should be able to murder Cap simply by slapping him&&Someone do the math.  How much was Cap benching when Thanos went to pet him?&&That's not even a real attack. That just looks like a mildly assertive grab. RIP Steve. &&Respect the Hyphen.&&No Ant-man either.&&He isn't allowed to participate because if he dies, we won't be able to pee halfway into the movie when they go to his house.&&It's gonna be him and Ant-Man stuck in a van together trying to find Wakanda for the length of the film. &&It definitely seems like it‚Äôll be a special experience, especially since many of us have been along for the ride the entire time&&[Disney comes into /r/movies like](https://imgur.com/Av2HH7D)&&It's like that post shitting on The Shape of Water a few hours before it won best picture
 &&Seems like you can see at least part of his armor in that final shot with  Cap too. &&I've been reading this all the time and I have no clue so: What is ""the snap""&&Holding Thanos' gauntlet like that was insane! &&I was never a fan of Cap in the comics. MCU Cap, however, is incredible.&&Absolutely. Their direction of Cap is why they've been handed the keys to the castle and I couldn't be more hyped about it.&&That fucking beard though.... I'm at full chod. &&That was the forshadowing to this scene&&From what I remember, RDJ's contract is up after the Avengers. Now whether that was 1 or 2 movies I can't remember but don't be surprised if both Cap & Iron Man die in the movie.&&""From now on, we will be using code names. 

You can address me as Avenger One. 

Gamora, code name -- Been There, Done That. 

Black Widow is -- Currently Doing That. 

Hulk is -- It Happened Once in a Dream; 

Stark, code name -- If I Had To Pick a Dude. 

Cap is -- Avenger Two.""&&Worth noting that the full armor scenes appear to be in flashback&&Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Wasp are all missing. ~~Loki as well, though he's.. not really sure what he is at the moment.~~ It's possible they may not be in this movie, but will show up in the next one (part 2).

I'm so ready for this damn movie. &&Yeah I mean half of humanity will still be left.&&The theory is that they're leaning on thanos rebalancing in an attempt for universal peace under his control, which is a very understandable vision. And it's more relatable than trying to kill everyone to appease the literal entity of death&&Disney owns ALL the franchises now!!&&Scale seems epic&&What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?&&And now the view count is broken.. Once again!!&&Not that bad. Some shots of bad guys (black order) and also its recut to hell so I don't think many of the scenes will actually be concurrent in the cinematic release the way they make it seem in the trailer&&definitely shows new scenes. Gives the main goal of Thanos' plan (which should have been super obvious), shows more characters in the Wakanda fight and more scale scenes. Shows some more fights and a glimpse of Thanos' henchmen fighting. I don't think huge spoilers, but it depends on your spoiler sensitivity&&I think that was Vision's head. &&Stan Lee&&I mean, it's definitely Tony. He buys the poster board, brings all the markers, comes with a completed outline, and assigns the tasks.

However, obviously most will be brought back because one stone literally reverses time. &&‚ÄúI can do this all d‚Äù

Look of horror from Tony in slow-mo.&&Let's talk about this comment of yours - I think it's good. Except, it sucks. Let me do the comment and that way it might be really good.&&It's nice that they had Wakandan tech going public just before which gives a perfect explanation for why Stark's suit just materializes on his body now. Because you know Tony would be on that shit in 5 seconds.&&And Extremis enhancements, which give quite a lot&&Nanomachines, son!&&Huh - that might actually tie in with that strange time travel set images from Ant-Man, because Pym Particles don't care about shit and causality and might have granted them qantum immortality by putting them earlier into the timeline or something...&&And then the Mutants get blinked into existence in Avengers 4&&That would actually be pretty great in retiring some of the current actors to explain why the characters look different.&&Yup, its one of the most iconic scenes in comic book history &&His backstory with little Gamora makes me so fucking excited, I think this will be one of the best villains yet &&Yeah, I was wondering if that means Peter is going to change into Spider-Man in front of his entire class.&&His face while Tony and Star-Lord are talking is just pure Spider-man.  Absolutely nails it.  &&I'm glad he's back to being Marvel's mascot!&&Except isn't stranges control over time one of the stones?&&Hulk was willing to take on Surtur. 

I say Thanos kills Black Widow and Hulk gets _Infinitely_ angry.&&It's one thing Joss Whedon could never do greatly; have a great ending fight to the final villain. 

When you think about it, Loki was just defeated by the Hulk from what is pretty much a joke. 

Ultron just gets punched away similarly by the Hulk then does some random shit before Wanda pulls out his *heart* (""He has a heart?"", everyone in the audience).

Let's see if the Russos can match it up.&&Wouldn't Adam Warlock just obliterate him or something since he was introduced in end of GotG2?&&Show her Ant Man&&I think the young Kurt Russell looked so much better than the young RDJ&&I wouldn't be surprised if Cap doesn't make it until that movie.&&By the time avengers 4 comes out Disney will have FOX and with that fantastic four... how great it would be if silver surfer shows up in avengers 4&&https://i.imgur.com/gP15SXi.gifv&&I think it‚Äôs two separate scenes that they cut together&&I'm sorry but I'm not Tony Stark &&19 movies.

My god, do you remember the feeling of hearing the line ""I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers initiative""? Look where we are now.&&--Justice League&&I'm expecting to see a lot more Wakandans in the later promotions for the movie. Since there's such a huge portion of BPs viewers that aren't regular CBM fans or even regular moviegoers, seeing him again so soon might convince them to come out again.&&Macklin you sonofabitch!&&From chasing Hitler‚Äôs daughter, to stopping the next Hitler.&&Nah dude, haven‚Äôt you seen the promotional art? She‚Äôs got a staff now, Thanos is fucked&&and yet Luke Cage is of no use to the Avengers&&People really should respect Mister Doctor's name more, even if it is strange.&&> His last name is Strange

Oh, I get it now.&&In addition to the writing, he said the Marty McFly is his biggest influence for the part.&&Took Hollywood three tries, but we've finally got a Spider-Man who feels like Spider-Man.&&Even with just one movie, he‚Äôs my favorite Peter Parker&&If you watch the wee documentary on the dvd release about his casting, he's like that pretty much at all times. They're setting up a stunt and he's like I'M SPIDER MAN AND I'M DOING A STUNT WOOOOOOOOOO
&&I want to watch a Spider-Man/Deadpool movie so badly lol&&Feels like Andy Dwyer is playing Starlord right there, not Chris Pratt. XD&&Same thing happened in the original Infinity War teaser with Thor and GotG meeting up. They most likely give out a general idea and everything gets shuffled again at post. &&> Thor wasn't even wearing the patch in the original Ragnarok trailer!

Neither in the Comic-Con Infinity War trailer &&Speaking of Thor, the shot of him raising his ‚Äúfist‚Äù with lightning striking looks like he has a new hammer that was edited out&&Cap picking up the hammer is more about worthiness than strength, right?&&MCU cap is superhuman without a doubt and probably a fair bit stronger than his comic counter part.&&Approximately 9/10ths the mass of a dying star.&&At least 12 units &&Thanos looked more surprised and confused than anything&&He was there, we just couldn't see him.&&His house was nice.&&It's so crazy. I remember walking in to Spider-Man 1, when this superhero movie craze truly began, and I remember walking in to Iron Man 1, when the MCU began.

So many of us have been here since the beginning, and we're so close to closing out Phase 3, something I never believed we'd actually get to, because it's been **10+ years**.

Our generation is truly lucky to witness something so epic.&&The whole time I was reading that other disney post, I could only picture the Southpark version of Mickey ultimately calling all the shots, ha ha.&&I thought the gif was gonna be the Thanos  portal scene&&[more like] (https://i.imgur.com/t55uVPw.gifv)&&In the comics, Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to wipe out half of existence just by snapping his fingers.&&I can do this all day&&[removed]&&His sexual magnetism is so strong, even I can't resist. &&I'm just happy they're properly upping his power level consistently after looking fairly weak in The Avengers.&&I'm fairly certain this is probably as far as he goes. RDJ has been kindof vocal about not wanting to play the character any more, and I'm sure his pay has been out of control for awhile now so I bet the movie studio is ready to cut him off too.&&I swear I briefly saw Loki standing with a bunch of new bad guys?&&Loki is not only in this trailer, but also in the previous where he [appears to be handing the tesseract over to Thanos](#spoiler). So Loki is definitely in this movie.&&(‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû&&Honestly, earth with 4 billion people seems better off anyway. &&It's a culmination of over 10 years of stories, it better be epic&&Captain America grabbing fucking Thanos' gauntlet hand? Holy shit that looks like an intense scene &&Pretends to be shocked&&Yeah there is no way Tony was talking to Gamora. She's in a completely different location. &&I heard somebody say that the first person Thanos kills should be Stan Lee. Edit: [Right Here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/236030100?t=02h38m13s).

It gives Marvel a good way to stop the cameos before he actually dies and gives the viewer a reason to hate Thanos.&&Macklin, you son of a bitch...&&""I hope they remember you. You're worth remembering.""

&&I think it's closer to something like this, ""I hope they remember you, so that the next time someone thinks about fighting me they'll remember how useless the last batch of 'heroes' was""&&I got the reverse feeling. I saw it is a threat to their memory.

""I hope they remember you, I hope the survivors remember the people who failed to save them"". I don't think it's a compliment at all.&&#COSMIC PIMP HAND&&He's arguably the oly one who can do it beyond the guy who is currently assembling the most bad ass glove in the galaxy. &&""It makes sense if you read the books!

//Tony Stark runs over and cradles Spider Man 

‚ÄúMY BOY‚Äù&&>Ebony Maw was a member of Thanos' Black Order, not a fighter, but a dangerous thinker of the Mad Titan's army. When Thanos targeted Earth as the next planet he would raze, Ebony Maw was dispatched to deal with Doctor Strange.[1] Ebony Maw used his abilities to gain control over Doctor Strange and forced him to summon Shuma-Gorath,[2] and serve as a double-agent for him when he reunited with the Illuminati. When the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world to find Thanos' son, Doctor Strange found the boy in a hidden Inhuman town in Greenland. Ebony remained in the location and forced Strange to forget about the discovery, and to leave, now freed from Maw's control.&&Wasn't even a punch, it looked like Thanos was casually reaching out to gently caress Cap's face and Cap had to use every single inch of his strength to stop the hand.&&He doesn't even look like he was punching. Just moving his hand forward lol.&&[Wow that's actually a thing](http://thenewswheel.com/lexus-and-marvel-partnership-results-in-a-concept-car-inspired-by-black-panther/thanos-copter/)&&""Thanos"" painted on the side just does it for me, it's hilarious &&RDJ is too expensive now so I would guess they would kill him off. &&Tony can't die, we need him to adventure with the Guardians!! &&I hope he shows up in A4. If Phase One started with Iron Man, Phase Three should end with him as well.&&I actually think there is no reversal.

One of the biggest issues with Infinity War was how there were no repercussions. Everyone died, until they didn't.

I think there will be fewer deaths, but the ones we get are permanent.&&no way thor is gonna die, he just finally made a good movie. most likely his brother is gonna take the guardian eyes and give it to thanos in exchange of their lives &&Wow&&Wouldn't the suit appearing out of his body be because of Extremis? They've been sitting on that story for years now after the Iron Man movie where it debuted in its 'imperfect' form.&&[There's a bunch of set pics from Avengers 4 where they're pretty clearly 'redoing' events from the first Avengers movie.](#spoiler)

&&As much as I want this to happen I wouldn't hold your breath. The Disney/Fox merger still hasn't actually gone through yet and Avengers 4 is apparently mostly done filming.

Then again, nobody thought Spidey had any chance of being in Civil War and, well, here we are. So who knows.&&I'll admit to never reading comic books before the movies started coming out. I'm playing catch up. Thanos is obviously the baddest of the bad, right? In the comics, did he snap his fingers like the reference in the movie? 

I'm intrigued!&&I hope we have more of Nebula too. She and Gamora were the best part of GotG 2, imo.&&It could either be like Digimon season three where the entire class shares the secret and its fun, or Thanos could succeed in killing half the universe, with half including Peter‚Äôs class &&Which is why he's being tortured &&Yes.&&I thought Ultron was destroyed by Vision?


Wanda destroyed one of his bodies, but there were still copies of him out there.  Vision blocked his program on the internet, and the last remaining copy tried to attack him, which he then proceeded to blast with his shiny forehead.&&Show her Bible Black&&Then halfway through, switch to Mac and Me.&&That‚Äôs because young Kurt Russell looks better then everybody. &&If cap is dead before then, it could be a flashback, like he already suggested it, but they shrugged it off. Now, someone, Stark? uses it.&&I thought the 4th was already filmed. &&I swear that Disney knew they were getting back the FOX properties when they semi-quietly scrapped plans for Infinity War being two parts. I wouldn't be surprised instead of Thanos doing the whole finger-snap and killing half of the universe, like in the comics, that he's going to fuck with the continuity of the universe and open up for introducing the other marvel properties from fox.&&Yeah, this looks like some classic Disney misdirection. It actually makes me more hype for the movie knowing we're not being shown so much.&&DC? Is that you?&&I was just about to google the sequence of the story because I lost track of the Marvel Universe since ‚ÄúAge of Ultron‚Äù üò≠&&Yeah, as a Harry Potter addict growing up I think MCU sort of takes the cake here, at least in a sense. Harry Potter came out and the movies started within a few years, so it had less of grounding in a long time form of media (the MCU comics), so it's more impressive in that regard given that it came from nothing and quickly established itself as a probably permanent part of culture; I think the majority of the civilized world could recognize Hedwig's theme within two notes. 

That all being said, the MCU has mainstreamed a love for comic book thematics and is (IMO) a huge part of the uprising and mainstreaming of nerd culture, and it's more recognizable as a huge project given that it comes off as more of an epic with all of the stories converging and the insane cast. Harry Potter's cast was also excellent but it was filled with British stage actors that are less recognizable to the general population, which probably makes it feel less gigantic as well since it's not a movie a lot of people (especially younger) can appreciate for its cast.&&I remember thinking ‚Äúwow, what if they actually do an Avengers movie?‚Äù I almost can‚Äôt even believe we‚Äôre here. &&Nah, dude. She's gonna do that move she always does where she wraps her legs around the persons head 

Death by Snu Snu for Thanos&&Or a girl who can cause Earthquakes.&&Perhaps. Who are we to judge? &&It's Strange&&And he's actually a doctor.&&> the Marty McFly

^^ The correct way to refer to our hero and saviour.&&Which just makes me imagine Tony as Doc Brown.

""Are you telling me you built *an Iron Man suit*...out of a box of scraps?""

Although if Tony was more like [his comic counterpart](https://source.superherostuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/drunkstark.jpg), we'd basically have Rick & Morty.&&Feige to Sony: Let's talk about this Spider-Man franchise of yours. I think it's good. Except it sucks. So let me do the Spider-Man franchise and that way it might be really good.&&The coolest part about his casting is how he‚Äôs going to actually physically age with the role as well&&Tobey was pretty good though? I mean yeah he's heavily skewed in the nerdier/loser aspects of Peter than the comedic side but I thought that he portrayed the aspects of responsibility in becoming Spider-Man and being a hero better than the other two.&&Two movies really (Civil War & Homecoming)&&Not sure if you know, but they actually have a pretty hilarious bromance in the comics.&&I've always felt like Andy was Chris Pratt's normal personality with a few slight embellishments &&<Star Lord looks directly at camera for a beat. >&&I don't want to be that person, but the Guardians are the ones who discover Thor after Thanos destroys the Grandmaster's vessel. 

Thor's specific subplot involves Groot and Rocket. &&Yup! And we saw it nudge in Age of Ultron during the party, showing that it can be moved by someone other than Thor. &&Also it looked like Thanos was just reaching for him, not attacking. Thanos wasn't pushing back or struggling, he just looked confused that Cap was even trying. And Cap was struggling with just holding his hand that was barely moving.&&Fucking 10/10 comment here&&/r/theydidthemathwrong &&I swear this is the same response to every time this question is asked.&&""Fun"" isn't something one considers when balancing the quarterly budget report. But this... This *does* put a smile on my face.&&As you do.&&But what if Thanos punches him dead midway through this line?&&*Thanos adds a little more strength and crushes Cap*&&Good casting, fans of comic books as writers and directors, and good writing. &&I just hope we get another shot of Clint winded and jogging through the battlefield trying to keep up. Although I feel like Antman is going to be the new ""I'm human and I don't belong here"" character.&&> RDJ has been kindof vocal about not wanting to play the character any more

Has he really?  I thought he wanted to quit early on,  like years ago.  But has since realized its a fucking blast and wants to keep going.&&Yep. They all had their weapons pointed at him. 

I will be pissed if they kill him in the first ten minutes. Not only is it a waste of his character but it won't have an impact on people because of his previous 'deaths'. No one will believe it. &&Your chances are 50/50. Not too shabby!&&Which is actually an incredibly short amount of time, yet an equally insane stretch of time.&&Looks like a real ‚ÄúShit, did i really mean to face-tank that.‚Äù moment for Cap. &&I figured at this point Stan Lee recorded a bunch of random shit and they plug it in if it works.&&Do not waaaaaaaant!!!!!&&They'll definitely not do that because if Stan Lee passes after this film (w/c technically and eventually he would, but just say it happens this year) the niche of that scene would all be in bad taste.&&I was thinking he was going to follow it up with ""because I won't.""&&Deadpool is on the phone. He says he wants a word with you...&&""There are infinite universes. There's even one where we are all just comic book characters and movie stars.""&&""It's the series finale of Game of Thrones tonight!

Cap: ""OMG THANOS STOPPPPPPPP-AHHH!!""&&thanos was actually just trying to gently remove a piece of lint from cap's shoulder.&&lol the exchange between deadpool and thanos there feels like they're both high.&&i would also argue that hes the most charismatic and important actor in the universe.

That being said, I'm almost certain the armour comes out of that jacket he's wearing in this one &&I think it's stark tech not wakandan, in Black Panther wakabi mentions that the world is catching up to their vibranium levels of tech, I think that is meant as a nod to stark's work &&Damn.

That sounds fucking awesome.&&[The snap] (http://2.bp.blogspot.com/sJ7eboeI_ZE5jlt42TRJ6xSYEAsvUXMOiJ1sUp_yx_ZMe2DSYg8xDybaeeu30f3e_rNMiTMyyZYh=s0)&&Yep. [During the Thanos Quest book he assembles all the infinity gems and at the beginning of the Infinity Gauntlet book he snaps his fingers and half of all life in the universe just vanishes. This causes havoc on earth as planes start going down and people go into a panic, etc. This kicks off the big fight between him and the avengers (and other people).](#spoiler)&&Absolutely! I really recommend reading the story, its not super long. But at the beginning of the story he has the gauntlet completed, muses about how he wants to impress ""Death"" (a person) because she is upset that more people now are living than have EVER died in the universe, upsetting the natural order of things. So to impress her he literally snaps his fingers and kills half of all living things in an instant. And the page it happens on is a gigantic comic book moment, which is why people have been insanely excited since Thanos appeared at the end of the first Avengers&&Every superhero has their Nemesis, their Big Bad. The one villain that, when he or she shows up, signifies it will take everything the hero has be able to defeat him.

For Spider-man that is the Green Goblin, for Captain America that is the Red Skull, for Wolverine that is Sabretooth.

But for a team, personal Nemesii are just run of the mill villains, to them, they are day to day. But TEAMS also  have team nemesii, the truly big hitters of the marvel universe that can shake it to its very foundation.

For the X-men that is Apocalypse, for the Avengers that is Kang the Conqueror. When Villains like that appear you gather the whole team to take him or her on.

And then you have Thanos.

When Thanos appears, you get EVERYONE. The Avengers, the Fantastic Four, the X-men and all their teams, the Defenders, all the street heroes, EVERYONE.

(The movie Infinity War is based on the comic, the Infinity Gauntlet. The Comic Infinity War is the next chapter in what ended up being a trilogy. Last came Infinity Crusade... but we don't need to talk about that.)&&[Yes he's trying to bang Death and does it to impress her](#spoiler)&&100% agree.

To whichever avengers are left...&&They have. The most we could hope for was a post-credits scene which can always be filmed later. &&It's still a two-parter, it just isn't titled as such.&&I am now picturing MCU being Tony and DCEU as Justin Hammer.&&On the plus side, order isn't exactly required given they're their own trilogies. 

Also good news: almost everything after age of ultron greatly improved on everything that age of ultron got wrong/did terribly. &&Well his order is slightly off, switch thor and cap. &&The mcu also came out just as the international theater markets started up. They've basically become this generation's star wars. And it's a world wide phenomenon, not just the US. I mean, black panther could make a fucking 100 mil in china of all places. That's incredibly impressive compared to what the market was like when ironman came out.&&Which is funny because Thanos wants snu snu with Death.&&Death by Snu Snu from Scarlett Johansson.

I'm sorry, I know that's pedantic.&&Thanos' rival is Adam Warlock. Or silver surfer if you prefer. As for the avengers, tough call, ultron has really been in more stories.&&While looking on that old goodness, a part of me is sad for our current representation of Thor.

Sure, he's bad, but in the comics, Thor's power level was about equal to the rest of the Avengers combined.  Only a couple other entities walking the earth were in that realm (Professor X, Doctor Strange).

He's cool now, but in the comics, he was the guy everyone looked to and respected.  In this universe that's apparently Tony Stark.  &&Until Deadpool comes along and gets her attention

I think people are so accustomed to having constant Marvel quips (which is suitable for spidey) that the Raimi films don't do it for em anymore. 

That trilogy was more focused on getting other features right, like action set pieces and performances.&&I loved it when he said to Winter Soldier ""You have a metal arm?

So there's that. &&She was more powerful than the hammer, so the worthiness charm was worthless.&&Tbh i‚Äôm expecting Thanos to be amused for a moment before just flicking him in the chin with his free fingers. &&Not exactly.

They shot a few cameos ahead of time a while back. They‚Äôve used them all now. (IIRC, the last was the one shot for *Thor: Ragnarok*.)

EDIT: Yep, *Ragnarok* [was the last one](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-stan-lee-marvel-cameos-20160928-snap-story.html).&&That's like Drax and Ronan. 

Drax wanted to kill Ronan so badly because he killed his family, and Ronan doesn't even remember who he's talking about. 

But now Drax actually wants to kill Thanos because he's who ordered Ronan. &&This is getting out of hand. Now there are two fourth wall breaks!&&> every single inch of his strength

&&[deleted]&&Thanos fighting a child for the cosmic cube is just great.&&Honestly, I think it's going to be Hulk.

If they want to establish Thanos as a credible threat that's on a completely different tier from the Ronan/Loki mold, one of the best ways to do that is have Thanos drop the Avengers' biggest gun right off the bat. If Thanos goes toe-to-toe with Banner and kills him at the start of the movie, then the entire rest of the story will have the audiences wondering ""how are the Avengers going to survive, let alone win"" which is something a lot of MCU movies have lacked.&&[deleted]&&Oh nonononono if you're going to quote Samuel L Mutherfuckin Jackson you're gonna do it right.

&&I hope they do ban them. Then they make their own awards. With blackjack. And hookers. 
In fact, forget the awards. &&They are not banned from Cannes or festivals. They are just not eligible for awards. Festivals purpose was to show movie so they get picked up by distributors so there is no point with a streaming movie to be there. &&This is intentionally being presented in a negative light. They can still appear at festivals, they are just not able to win awards. The purpose of those awards is to draw attention to quality films that might not have the platform to meet their full potential. Netflix not only has their own platform but arguably the most popular one in the world right now, they don't need it.&&Oh, jesus. Why am I being asked to get upset for the hardships of multimillion dollar corporations?

&&Who said Amazon? Amazon movies are getting released in theaters and on DVD/Blu-ray. That‚Äôs the whole thing.&&Netflix and Amazon arent being banned. TV movies are banned. The Oscars, Cannes, etc are for cinema released films, or films that intend on having cinema releases. Amazon has had academy award nominations (manchester by the sea, The Big Sick).  Netflix is trying to change the rules and nobody wants to accommodate them. 

Here are the other problems in this article

>Many small indie films get a brief, limited release in a handful of theaters in New York and LA to qualify for Oscar consideration

Wrong. I live in a mid size city and we get them here. Every major city should get the bulk of notable indie releases. If not by the end of the year, sometime in mid winter. 

>They wind up created primarily as award-season creations not really intended to even earn much box office or viewership, instead justifying their existence as art for its own sake

But...they do all make money. Not blockbuster amounts, but a lot of these small indie films make several million dollars if they are getting good press and word of mouth

>People booed the Netflix film Okja at Cannes last year

People boo all sorts of things at cannes. Its a snotty french thing

>Cannes now bans Netflix and Amazon films from competion

No. They ban films that dont get released in French theaters. Its a business choice to protect the french cinema industry, which is very important to the people in it. 

>Spielberg for example surely knows the pain of such blind rejection and dismissal of his work as ""true film"" as opposed to ""popcorn entertainment"" or ""movies, not films."" 

Numerous academy award nominations, routinely touted as the best living American Filmmaker, hasnt had that reputation in ages. Oh, Im sure he is hurting over it. 

>Christopher Nolan spent years waiting for awards recognition for his work because it often wasn't taken seriously due to falling into certain genre categories, or -- in some of the most offensive treatment of an artist for reasons entirely unrelated to their specific work or personal behavior -- due to pure resentment toward Nolan due to the way his fanbase treated critics or awards groups

What work of his deserved an academy award and didnt get nominated?  The Dark Knight was snubbed, an era where the Academy would never have considered a genre film (snubbed when you consider the fucking reader got nominated over it), but I havent seen another film of his that I thought was likely for an award, until Dunkirk. 

>The only reason to block them in the first place is if there's a fear they will get nominated on merit.

As they have, fairly. When they play by the rules in place. Look at Amazon who has done very well with this. Big Sick ran in theaters for ages. Manchester by the Sea made 77 Million at the Box Office on a 8 million budget.  Its literally just netflix who is trying to pull a fast one by ignoring traditional release models. I would have loved to see the Meyerowitz Stories in theaters, but Netflix didnt want to go that route. Their business model doesnt hold up with theatrical releases. Thats fine. The Emmys and Golden Globes award TV movies, and in this era, there is no shame in being a TV movie. Which is what you are if you arent released in enough theaters to qualify for things like the Academy Awards. &&One thing you all might be overlooking, in respect to film festivals, is that the only way to legally watch a Netflix film like Okja when there isn't a cinematic or DVD release is to subscribe to Netflix. 

Which means Netflix are basically holding the film hostage and any award Okja gets is tactility promoting Netflix's streaming service. 

And Netflix's business model is to kill cinemas. Which is hugely antithetical to Cannes. 

As for the idea that Netflix originals have the chance to be... original. I'm not convinced.

Often with independent films, they get made by a production company and then they are picked up by a distributor. So something like Manchester by the Sea wasn't actually made by Amazon and it makes no difference to the creative process of the film. 

And one of the most successful films put out by Netflix so far has been Bright. Which is just as unimaginative as anything made by big Hollywood studios.

I have no reason to believe that Netflix is going to start making experimental films or that it will have a significant impact on how independent films are made in the future. 

Maybe film makers will be less worried about pulling punters in if they know it will be going directly to a streaming platform. But I just don't see that factoring hugely into the creative process. 

What I could see happening is a new mini-series/film hybrid appearing, and more anthology series happening. As well as people caring less about making feature length films because why does a film need to be 90 minutes+ if it's a streaming service? 

&&No it's not. This is Netflix and Amazon buying coverage from Forbes.

These films will already have publishers. They don't belong at these festivals.&&Why is it wrong? It seems no more wrong than any awards shows having requirements. Netflix and Amazon don't meet those requirements. Big whoop.

Is anybody mad that the musical Hamilton can't win an Oscar?&&The only awards I'd ban Netflix from participation in are the Razzies. Given the astounding volume of lemons they produce, they'd sweep the table every year.&&Cannes is a celebration of cinema exhibition in a theater. It's the core of what they do -- it's why you can't even get on their red carpet without a bow tie. Netflix is democratic but is movies on mobile, in your one, AWAY from the theater. It's antithetical to the principles of theatrical exhibition in the first place.&&People are also ignoring the fact that Netflix is actively trying to kill the theatre model. Festivals are based on the theatre experience, so, if I ran it, I‚Äôd be salty about Netflix trying to horn in on the action too. It‚Äôs just for status, until they can kill movie theatres entirely.&&/r/titlegore anyone? I was that close to popping a aneurysm over here&&They do not screen their films in theatre. That is a requirement for the awards at Cannes. They are fine without it, they can afford it. &&Why is it when Tarantino and Nolan do their best to preserve the classic methods of filming and cinematic experience it's amazing, but now it's bad?&&Film festivals are for Movies not TV originals.  If they aren't real releases in theaters then they don't meaningfully meet the requirements.  &&I have been working in movie theatres since 1996, mostly as a manager. I think there are a few different points to make about this subject.

The first point is I don't view Netflix and Amazon as equal players in this discussion. Amazon has more or less embraced the idea of releasing their movies in theatre before releasing them on their streaming platform. Both The Big Sick and Manchester By the Sea were allowed to be seen on the big screen because of this.

On the other hand, Netflix has had a completely opposite take when it comes to releasing their movies in theatres. They want to make their movies available for streaming at the same time as they are available in theatres. For obvious reasons this is a problem for theatre operators. It might be a different issue if Netflix put those movies on a pay-per-view release for streaming, but that isn't the case. The movies are available to stream for free at the same time they would be in the theatre.

Another issue is that while the overall box office has been growing, that is mostly coming from the top of the charts - the blockbusters. The majority of other movies are seeing increasingly small audiences in theatres, in part because of the perception they movie is worth waiting a few months to watch it at home. 

These conversations criticizing movie theatres for trying to protect their business from streaming services are very short sighted. Most theatres survive on very small margins - especially after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 7-8 years to convert to digital systems. If you take too much away from what theatres can make, then there is a serious risk of losing movie theatres - especially in small towns. 

While there may be debate about seeing the latest drama or romcom on the big screen vs at home, I think most agree that the latest Jurassic World, Avengers, or Star Wars needs to be seen on the big screen. However if we cut away too much from theatres then we may lose the option to see these movies in theatres. 

Decisions to ban streaming services from film festivals is an attempt to ensure we continue to have the option to see movies on the big screen as they were intended. I don't think it's too much to ask for Netflix and Amazon to agree to release their movies in theatres exclusively for a period if they want to participate in film festivals with studios who are doing theatrical releases. &&Reddit cares a lot more than Netflix or Amazon does. These ""festivals"" are there to help get distributors for indi movies and shows and entertain rich people with lots of money to waste. Also the majority of people who watch netflix or amazon have no idea what most of these festivals are. &&well if its for festivals that are specifically for theatre films in actual theatres then thats not wrong.&&So many misinformed people here. They‚Äôre banned in part because festivals are auctions for films to get distributed - films on Netflix don‚Äôt need it. 

And I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a bad thing that Cannes is trying to preserve cinema viewing. Netflix wants to kill that off. &&So much salty american :o

The purpose of a festival is to promote film without distributor or not very visible.

Netflx : distributor. So no need to promote a film with a promoteur already.

And already very visible....&&I honestly dont care. All awards have rules of eligibility. If the studio wants it's films to get an Oscar, then play by the rules. Release it in LA for the week and then show it on Netflix, it doesn't make a difference to me. Or set up your own awards, or both&&No it really isn‚Äôt. There are several reasons but the one that sticks out to me is that these films are for public theatrical releases. Netflix is a streaming service and is the one place to access Netflix originals. Same with Amazon. Them winning awards are essentially free advertisement for their streaming services, which they definitely don‚Äôt need and is not the point of award shows. If they want to qualify then they should release stuff theatrically. Simple as that and it really wouldn‚Äôt be too hard for a company that big. They choose not to though because they know they can release more by distributing it through their own service and because it‚Äôs exclusive they and the production companies are the only ones making money off them.&&Nah. Spielberg is right. If you never offer it on the big screen, you're a tv movie.&&If they don't play by the same rules as everyone else. They don't qualify. I don't see anything wrong with that. &&Sorry, as much as I love Netlfix and Amazon, if a movie isn't released in the theater, I have no problem that movie not being eligible. 

Movies make more money at the theaters/cinema. It is understandable that awards that are put together by the movie industry would like to promote the theater going experience. 


edit: since the below guy doesn't get it, many of these awards like the Oscars, BAFTA, etc were created and are run for the purpose of making the movie industry more profitable. It therefore stands that they would limit eligibility to movies that were released in movie theaters --- where the movie industry is most profitable. Why would they promote some format that would hurt its finances? 

And Cannes is there to promote French cinemas. So it therefore stands they limit eligibility to movies released in French cinemas. &&Netflix's award is it's stock price.&&Netflix is still allowed to show their films at the Cannes Film Festival. It makes sense for them to not be eligible for awards. The festival is for distribution opportunities, which a Netflix film doesn‚Äôt need help with. They are their own platform and are accessible in multiple countries around the world. &&In my point of view, ‚Äûthey‚Äú are hindering these producers from the festivals, as ‚Äûthey‚Äú are slowly realizing that their dusty film industry is slowly coming down the drain and that companies like Netflix and Amazon are outnumbering the old system, so ‚Äûthey‚Äú are going to lose tons of money!&&A lot of these festivals and awards are used to shop movies around to distributors, or give smaller movies a bigger profile so it makes sense to exclude movies on Netflix/Amazon. I don't think Netflix/Amazon really need these small awards/festivals anyway.&&It's their film festival. They can ban whatever they want.&&The majority of their films are crap. They shouldn't be banned. They should just continue to lose. &&I don‚Äôt give a flying f^%$ about awards. I only care if I personally like the movie. &&I'm not saying they should/shouldn't...but we gonna start giving YouTube clips nominations? There should be some standard, not saying that Netflix doesn't fit in that standard. Iono...shit on Netflix is pretty weak anyway, for the majority. &&Real art is on rotoscope machines! Everything has gone to hell in a handbasket since full talkies! Don't even get me started in color!

Luddites always lose.&&way to martyr them. well done. massive PR win for streaming services!!&&I don‚Äôt know why people put so much stock into awards. 

Seems like a lot of people enjoy more movies that don‚Äôt win awards than those that do. 

All I ever read/hear is ‚Äúevery year movies get nominated that I have no clue what they are‚Äù. 

Which is true because they‚Äôre less marketed and aren‚Äôt out there for mass appeal, which doesn‚Äôt make them bad but studios should just make movies that they themselves think are good and that‚Äôs enough. 
&&I personally think it depends on the Festival. I may not be using the best terms, but if it's a more Independent or indie festival where Films etc are made on a lower budget then I don't think Amazon or Netflix should be allowed into it. Otherwise I don't see a reason to deny them as Netflix seems similar to any other production company where they fund idea not necessarily make the movie &&Why sense would it make for them to be in festivals anyhow?? The whole point of movie festivals is to sell the movies for distribution. Netflix and Amazon already distribute their films on their respective platforms. Am I missing something?&&No, they should ban. Else the regular TV won't get any awards.&&To be honest, I can understand why, beside the biased feeling, that Amazon and Netflix should be excluded.

Amazon and Netflix can pump hundreds of movies out per months, so many that we can watch them within hours of hours, and it enjoyable, but theater DOES have it charms and sometime, it gives you an excuse to go out and hang out with friends.

What they SHOULD have done, was do a separate category for stream movies so that it doesn't get mix with theatrical film, so those actors/actresses get those regconiztion that they deserve.

Hopefully, both side can come to an agreement on this, and to allow both party to enjoy the award, while at the same time, keeping it separated, so it gives actors/actresses more playing fields than being stuck between televisions series or movie, when they can do Amazon/Netflix TV series or movies.&&I mean the wierdest movies always win so it's kind of pointless to include Netflix.&&Those movies suck anyway. &&No it's not, they already have distribution deals. The awards are to promote the movies looking to get picked up, not to act as culture gatekeepers. Yeesh&&Who gives a fuck about award shows? Its just people politicking to get free advertisement and maybe a second run in theaters.&&freedom. of. association. 

any intelligent person who this actually bothers will start their own award show.&&Festivals and awards shows are lame as fuck. Awards shows more so&&Well they are saturating their own market&&I think the issue is that Amazon and Netflix do not play in the same space as most other movies.   As of right now, Netflix and Amazon are able to reach a wider audience by just pushing their movies to users that have already paid for their service.  They don‚Äôt have to leave home or spend more money. TV and Movie studios have mostly been separate and awarded separately even after being owned by the same companies.  Do I think movie studios should begin to invest in On Demand movies at home on opening day, yes! But until they do, they are someone different markets.  Now, when that happens, a lot of theaters will close and even with the advances in tv/sound, you will lose some of the intended theater experience.&&They aren‚Äôt movies!! If it‚Äôs not in a theater it should

(Coming from a Netflix and Amazon prime subscriber)&&They aren't banned, their movies just aren't eligible for awards. Cannes did this because the movies awarded are suppose to be films developed for the big screen and they view streaming movies as being more like TV movies than feature films. TV movies haven't been given these awards in the past, they have their own awards. Some movies have kind of gotten around this by having ""Theatrical Releases"" in a very small number of theaters that only last for a couple weeks, but most don't even get a theatrical release at all. This is causing problems in the feature film industry and may kill the already struggling theater industry, which Cannes see as a vital component of ""Cinema"" (& I agree). Cannes' goal in doing this is to force Netflix and others to either have true theatrical releases or compete for TV movie awards. Basically, they need to choose a lane. Also, Cannes only requires they show the movies in French Cinemas so its not some global studio powerplay like others have suggested.

Playing a streaming movie at Cannes could get any artist associated with it more work because it was shown.&&It's like ""banning"" graduates from scolarships, no need to make a fuss about it, is an obvious thing&&So much this. Festivals like Toronto International are showing work with distributors already in place, but Cannes is a market film fest, people go there to get distribution. It's not perfect but all these headlines reek of a targeted PR campaign getting people to have sympathy for them.

I don't think the old guard has been doing us any favours but Netflix is turning into the Uber of streaming services, great for consumers but unsustainable from a creators standpoint with less money going to the younger crowd or the people that can't hit their algorithmic stride with them. &&problem is netflix now produces movies for theatrical release as well .

I don't recall what movie it was but it was recent when i was in theater watching something and it came up produced by netflix &&Tbh for serious film companies/distributors, Cannes and Berlinale are ONLY about the film markets aka the backdoor deals for upcoming projects during a festival. Most distributors don‚Äòt even care about the actual festival program (most of the time it‚Äôs pompous self celebrating shit anyway).&&Yup. The amount of people missing the point here is hilarious and shows how uniformed the sub is. Festivals always have been about boosting the local industries and having films be shown and picked up where they might not have in their own country &&Yes, the pitchfork brigade really needs to read the articles and understand why these companies were deemed ineligible.  If Neflix allowed their content to be picked up and distributed elsewhere (through theatres) they'd be eligible.  It's their closed-system approach that got them banned.  Usually Reddit hates this, but the Netflix boner is so large right now, the angry mob can't see past the end of it.&&I get that, but if the goal of Cannes is to showcase movies shopping for distribution outlets, why allow any movie that already has a distribution outlet at all? I understand their rules and they make sense, but the execution of those rules seems arbitrary.&&Yah that‚Äôs always what I thought Cannes was about. Show casing movies to get distributors, kinda pointless for Netflix to be there &&At first I was in the ""this is bullshit"" camp and saw it as an injustice or a shady tactic to take power away from digital distribution, but once you put it that way, it makes sense.

It's still stupid that cinemas need to have a big festival with big names and big media coverage to know about movies, but it's *their* festival and Netflix/Amazon/Etc and we as fans should just not give them the attention if we have a better alternative.&&Those festivals are about movies playing in that country.

Cannes got upset with Netflix because Netflix wasn't showing any of the films it had entered in a french cinema.  Cannes is about previewing what movies in France are currently like, what's the point of having a movie playing at Cannes that you cannot go and see in a french cinema. 

&&That is not exactly true.

Actually, the only way to have a movie in competition now is to ALREADY have a french theatrical distributor, they implemented that rule to keep Netflix movies out, going completely against the argument that movies in the official selection are here to find distribution. And let's be frank the movies in the Official Selection were always by the biggest names in Cinema, no movie on the official selection was ever, ever going to struggle to find a distributor.

Cannes have one of the biggest film market in the world, this is where movies find distributors. They also have a competition for smaller directors called ""Un Certain Regard"" where indeed most of the movies can totally use the exposition. Those things are separated from the Official Selection.

The reality of the situation as to why Cannes now requires movies to pledge to a theatrical distribution is because of the massive backlash by the CNC (National Center of Cinema, that collects money on every ticket sold), big theatre chains owned by asshole billionaires like the Seydoux family and private french channel Canal +, owned by asshole billionaire Vincent Bollore. 

You need to understand that they push to preserve a legislation called the ""chronology of medias"", meaning that if a movie gets a theatrical release it can not appear on a streaming service such as Netflix less than 3 years later. So if Netflix gave their 2017 movie Okja a theatrical release, they could not have their own movie on their own service before 2020.

What you need to understand is that private channel Canal + gets a special deal allowing them to show movies a few months after they got released on video, for example they currently have Logan programmed on their channel. Netflix or Amazon Prime could not have Logan before 2020.

Canal + and the CNC spend a lot of money to make sure the law do not change. Canal + would become virtually worthless overnight if Netflix could have movies as recent as Canal + does. As for the CNC if Netflix movies gets released in cinemas that means millions of ticket sales and millions of euros in their cash register. French legislation have a very nasty habit of throttling and limiting new services and technology in order to protect dying old ones. Not that Cinemas will ever die in France, we are one of the most avid moviegoers in the world, but Canal + and Satellite channels on the other hand can only stay competitive if Netflix is forced to be shit. (I should point out that Netflix do gives 2% of their revenue to the CNC, which apparently is not enough for them)

If Cannes allowed Netflix movies, the CNC and french theatres threatened to boycott Cannes selected movies in return. This is a mafia, and Fremaux bowed to them. This is what is actually happening behind this. And pretending it is about helping the movies or any sort of artistic integrity is utterly wrong.&&But netflix is a distributor.  The point of Cannes is to sell movies to distributors, including netflix and amazon.  If Cannes bans potential customers from their festival, that's not helping anybody sell movies.&&They are banned from participating in the competition, exactly as the article says. So there is a ban in place. Meanwhile, there are efforts to get them banned from eligibility at the Oscars.

Lots of films screen at festivals after having distributors. The argument put forth by those banning or seeking to ban these films has nothing to do with the notion of trying to get distributors or not, it's entirely about whether the films were playing long enough in theaters and whether the production/distribution companies are traditional studios or streaming services. And there's additional claims that the quality of the films are more in line with TV movies than feature films. These are the three consistent explanations given for banning or trying to ban them from competition and awards.&&>	They are not banned from Cannes or festivals. They are just not eligible for awards.

Could you explain what the practical distinction is here? Because it sounds like you‚Äôre just being obtuse.&&Totally agreed. They drop something like The Cloverfield Paradox (which got torn to shreds by critics) with only a heads-up a few hours prior, and it gets millions and millions of viewers in a matter of days. Netflix works don't need more recognition via Cannes or other awards festivals - as you said, they've already got all the attention they need.&&> The purpose of those awards is to draw attention to quality films that might not have the platform to meet their full potential.

Okay, well that's definitely not true when it comes to the Oscars. Those are huge movies, with big budgets, that have already been seen by a majority of the movie-going world. They aren't bringing any more exposure to these huge films starring big names made by big time directors. &&*multibillion dollar corporation&&a lot of people still see Netflix as this small grassroots company sticking it to the ""man"" that is big movie. 

&&Its like being upset because deadmau5 got in trouble for custom painting his Ferrari and got a free custom GT-R from Nissan. &&Because they paid for this post probably&&You misspelled ""multibillion""&&Because people put effort into these movies and deserve to be recognized for them. They‚Äôre part of the industry, why shouldn‚Äôt the actors and directors and composers and costume designers be barred from receiving praise from their  for work they put passion into? &&> Every major city should get the bulk of notable indie releases.

I think most people aren't even aware that indie cinemas are a thing. And even less so, that there is probably at least one in their city. &&Yeah but evil Cannes and the people's champion Netflix.&&This is well said. if this goes to /r/all, this better be one of the top comments here. It perfectly addresses how terrible this article is. &&[deleted]&&This needs to be higher up. The insane amount of ignorant comments on this topic is astounding. &&Exavtly. And a lot of people are acting as if these festivals are some extinct dinosaurs fighting the inevitable future, and throwing around blockbuster as if it's relevant.

The festivals have always been for cinema, and TV releases were always banned from being nominated... I wonder how people would react if instead of Netflix it was some big network like NBC complaining that their TV movies are not nominated.&&To add another layer to this, the difference between TV, Streaminf, and Cinema is decided well before shooting even begins. When you file your SAG paperwork, you have to say whether you will be releasing in what venue. The payment rates for a streaming release are different than than the rates for a cinema theatrical release. &&When it comes down to it Netflix movies are TV movies and should be up for Emmy's. &&> Cannes now bans Netflix and Amazon films from competion
> 
>> No. They ban films that dont get released in French theaters. Its a business choice to protect the french cinema industry, which is very important to the people in it.

This is the point. French cinema's good health is far from an accident. Netflix isn't interested in cinema's welfare.

Power to these festivals for not kowtowing.&&All we need to know about this article is that it's from Forbes. Like Vanity Fair or Esquire or most other publications, when they write about the entertainment industry, that have no fucking clue what they are talking about.

Banned and ineligible for competition are NOT the same thing. There are tons of out of competition movies at Cannes every year. That being said, if Cannes (being the snobby of snobbiest festivals) won't even accept a high profile Netflix film (say The Irishman) for out of competiton screening then technically that's still up to them, but is kind of churlish.
&&Great post! &&Fantastic post. Only thing I disagree with is your snub about The Reader lol. A great movie, in my opinion. &&Sorry, but The Reader was better than Dark Knight. Nolan's films are emotionally empty shells that rely on gimmicks and spectacle.&&> Wrong. I live in a mid size city and we get them here. Every major city should get the bulk of notable indie releases. If not by the end of the year, sometime in mid winter. 


Just for an idea here is a list of the lowest grossing Oscar Best Picture nominee for each of the last 5 years (they tend to be this type of indie film) and their highest theater total. It‚Äôs important to note that this is by week and the actual number of unique theaters they were in was much higher - just not in them all the same weekend.

Call Me By Your Name - 914

Hell or High Water - 1505

Room - 862

Whiplash - 567

Nebraska - 968


**Vastly** different than being shit out into a single theater for eligibility before being available for TV viewing.&&Many excellent, informed points (FYI - ***Manchester By The Sea*** actually *WON* two Academy Awards in major categories, something Netflix still hasn't done).

Here's an irony about the article - they are using a image from ***Mudbound*** which isn't really a Netflix Original - it was picked up at Sundance and unlike most Netflix films was hence eligible for awards because it had theatrical showings before running on Netflix.&&> Often with independent films, they get made by a production company and then they are picked up by a distributor. So something like Manchester by the Sea wasn't actually made by Amazon and it makes no difference to the creative process of the film.

That is what Netflix does more often than not. They pick up already completed films more than they produce things themselves. Both are referred to as ""Netflix Originals"", regardless who's money made the film. &&There is one flaw in your statement that A LOT of people seem to miss.

Netflix does not mind putting its movies in theaters. Theater chains do because Netflix will day and date release on their service because the subscribers pay for the productions. 

So it's the theater chains that are just pissed about that. Not the other way around.&&A month of Netflix is cheaper than a movie ticket.&&Its just people circle jerking and not reading the shitty article because they think Cannes is snobby. &&Yeah, I'm really not sure what people have an issue with.  We have Oscars and Emmys.  We have been classifying them as two different things for a long time.  Just because the Oscars have more prestige and is what the film makers want doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with a movie not meeting the distribution requirements.
&&This whole thing seems like astroturfing. The amount of people jumping to Netflix' aide and the amount of articles being posted about it is really, really suspect.&&yes. this title is yuck. \(and it's from forbes. that makes it worse.\)&&Nope. It‚Äôs a type of ‚Äúheadlinese.‚Äù Specifically in this case is the omission of ‚Äúand‚Äù from lists. Notice that it is usually dropped in most headlines. It‚Äôs stupid as hell but whatever.&&We also have a law in France that if a movie has a theatrical release, Netflix must then wait 3 years before adding it to their VOD service.
So yeah, Netflix won't give a damn about the awards.&&Because Tarantino and Nolan (and Netflix) fall within the positive reddit circlejerk, while Cannes does not.&&If Nolan and Tarantino came out with an impassioned defence of this, a lot of r/movies would turn around to their perspective. This subreddit is awful - a default sub occupied by a lot of young people with little opinion of their own - and the hive mind dictates good or bad. &&If Netflix wants to qualify then they should release theatrically. Simple as that&&For real. Since when is reddit all about changing existing rules so a big multibillion dollar company can be a part of it?&&As a normally slaty American, I agree wholeheartedly and I really don‚Äôt understand why people are seemingly so upset that streaming service movies can‚Äôt participate in getting awards at Cannes.&&This isn't a matter of being behind the times.  Read the original article.  It's about preserving the theater-going experience that many of us value.  

If Netflix is going to put a movie in a few token theaters for a few days just to qualify for awards before moving them to streaming only, they shouldn't be allowed to compete for those cinema-related awards.&&The little guy underdog streaming services!&&Thank you, finally. I swear to God this shit ain't coincidental. They did this with Beast of no Nations and that theatre fiasco to promote it, and I'm now convinced that some redditors running around here are paid shills. The amount of ""ohhh poor Netflix, the underdogs being held down by the movie industry"" is suspect as fuck and I'm fucking sure their PR is behind this&&It affects what kind of movies you‚Äôll get to see, though. There are plenty of actors, actresses, and directors that really strive for awards consideration. 
Meryl Streep collecting Oscar statues is really no different than Tom Brady collecting Super Bowl rings, when you think about it.

My point is that you‚Äôre less likely to see those actors and directors making films on streaming services because they don‚Äôt have awards consideration. 

If you ask me, the best place for those ‚ÄúOscar-bait‚Äù films is actually on a streaming service. I‚Äôm much more likely to sit down and watch a movie like that in the comfort of my own home, than planning a night out to try and find a theater & showtime *(good luck finding either)* to actually go see it. &&The Cannes Film festival is a way for films to find distributors. Netflix and Amazon are already their own distributors. So yeah, they dont qualify.

Getting banned from the awards ceremonies on the other hand; I'm not entirely sure in those specifics.&&Going by the French Open in tennis, the French just really like to boo stuff.&&So does standing ovations. They all get massive standing ovations because the creators and stars are there. Talking about boos or standing ovations at Cannes like it‚Äôs some big news only sounds good to readers who don‚Äôt understand the context and are thinking of a regular movie experience. &&Quirks&&Like throwing spoons at a showing of ‚ÄòThe Room‚Äô ? &&The french lack manners and like booing.&&it got booed before the movie started. Once when the Netflix logo showed up (which was also mixed with cheers which they also forget to mention) and booed again when they had to restart the movie because of a technical difficulty. 

When the movie was over it got a four minute standing ovation&&also how awkward must a 4 minute standing ovation be&&That's what Cannes is like. French movie fans really like to emote after screenings. Fire Walk with Me got simultaneous cheers and boos when it was shown at Cannes. &&I can already see the movie poster:

[picture of main character]

‚ÄúTwo thumbs up‚Äù
                            -Siskel and Ebert

‚ÄúOne of the best movies of the year‚Äù

#üëèüëèüëè BOO!!! üëèüëèüëè
&&Are they saying boo or boo-urns?&&Yes, it was booed when the audience saw Netflix's name. They applauded the film itself after it was over, meaning their booing was purely about Netflix's involvement, not about the quality of the film itself. So from now on, under the new rules change, a film that gets a four minute standing ovation is considered not valid for competition at Cannes if the word ""Netflix"" is at the start of it as a producer or distributor.

That's the point.&&I‚Äôm confused&&booing is also very normal and it also became a ritual.&&So much this.&&A little different if the creators are actually in attendance like might happen at a festival, but otherwise it is just weird.&&Simple Solution.  Netflix gets either their own category or own show. Preferably own show.  If this does go down allow AVN awards to go on air. its been long enough. &&I have a legit question about the AVN awards.  You know how in regular award ceremonies when they talk about the nominations, they'll show a clip/scene from that movie all dramatised?

Its less about the art and more or a power play from an authority of the Old Guard against the new, changing face of the industry.&&Yea, it sounds like they're banning anything Netflix/Amazon under the guise that it's not true art / it's hurting the little guy that needs these awards for distribution, but then they allow big budget stuff like Inglorious Basterds to compete for awards.&&I'd point out everyone thought TV was going to kill theaters. Then they thought VHS would kill theaters. Then they thought DVDs would kill theaters. Then they thought the Internet would kill theaters. Then they thought streaming services would kill theaters.

The past three years, the domestic box office set records for the three highest-grossing years in history, all three years topping $11+ billion. Global box office typically sets new records year after year, with only occasional rare downturns -- usually simply because a previous year had especially huge box office from a record-setting movie like Avatar or The Force Awakens, so the subsequent years have dips by comparison.

Movie theaters are being built at a record pace worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region where Disney and other studios are positioning themselves for major longterm plans.

New technologies in theaters keep upping the experience and resulting in overall strong box office returns, domestically and internationally. Although studios keep a smaller percentage of foreign box office receipts, it's so massive that the quantity translates into a revenue stream that's still massive and largely offsets the issue of lower percentage. There's a reason that the top studios keep having record-setting years. Hell, even Warner Bros -- despite the trouble with Justice League -- had a fantastic year in 2017.

Theaters aren't going to get killed off, people have been predicting that for decades, every time some new technology or additional way arrives to offer more people to see more content. The marketplace is evolving, not ending.&&* director Steven Spielberg stating he believes films from streaming studios like Netflix shouldn't be allowed to compete at the Oscars. Other filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan have voiced similar views

Are these the little guys?&&By that logic, all major studio releases should be banned.&&Netflix supports tons of little guy filmmakers. &&So they aren't singling out Netflix/Amazon, and the language of the award ban is based purely  on studio revenue and is applied across the board? Because that's not at all what this sounds like.&&Every thread about Netflix on the front page is /r/HailCorporate material. &&On the other hand though, could it help them? People may come to the festival to see what Netflix has to offer, but also watch other things, kind of like how musicians can benefit themselves by opening for a more popular act.  To be clear, I'm not asking this rhetorically, I actually don't know if this might help, because I don't go to film festivals.&&> Edit: You guys ever make a comment putting your 2 cents into something you know nothing about, then it accidentally gets attention and you get yourself in all kinds of trouble?

All the time. This is the first time I've ever seen anyone quite put it like this though. Props.&&Netflix does have a lot of goodwill, and personally, it's understandable that people like them: we've have had to pay expensive cable bills to monopolies for crap we don't want, just to sit through commercials to see the few shows we do want, for many years. But also there's this: the streaming services are giving a worse deal to the people creating the shows than the traditional studios. The writers' guild just nearly went on strike about certain things they wanted the streaming services to do, which the traditional studios have had to do for years, involving residuals for tv and contracts and stuff. There's a troubling line in this article: ""It's due to complaints from theaters and unions, about how the different release models for these films impact those groups' pocketbooks and businesses."" Unions are not businesses, with pocketbooks. They exist to represent the little people, the individual artists, creating the movies we love, and especially in the entertainment industry, where there's so much demand for the jobs, without the unions those people would be getting stepped on seven days a week and twice on Sunday (and no, when I say ""little people"", I don't mean Spielberg and Nolan,  although people like them have also been huge beneficiaries of the union contracts that protect them). 

I mean, ahem, yes, streaming services should totally be allowed in awards ceremonies, but just saying they're not above reproach, and this issue, like many, isn't as simple as this dude makes it out to be.&&It's honestly both frightening and amazing how much of a base of support Netflix has built for itself. I can't believe how big of a controversy this has become when it's absolutely the sensible decision.

Except in France where the [chronologie des m√©dias](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronologie_des_m%C3%A9dias) rule imposes, after a theatrical release, a 1 to 3 years delay before DVD/VOD/television release. So, by putting their movies in french theaters (which would solve the Cannes problem) they would shoot themself in the foot (delaying the diffusion on Netflix France). What they are trying to do now, by whining, is imply that the french rule on medias chronologie shouldn't be applied to Netflix, which is ridiculous.

A lot of films get picked up  by major distributors and it helps the film‚Äôs (and director‚Äôs) publicity and profit. But at the same time, a lot of films (even the major award winners from a lot of years) fail to even double their budget.     

Cannes in particular is well known for balancing the celebration of film as art and recognizing the global market., The majority of its competition entries are chosen for their subversive, innovative, progressive, and/or singular approach to the medium or their text. The point of the festival is not just to auction films off in some giant figurative commercialism convention ‚Äî the point is to try and get more progressive, challenging works a larger audience, while also serving as platform to give these often ignored filmmakers/films recognition; a way to to say ‚Äúyour hard work and worldview in cinema is recognize and appreciated.‚Äù    

The guy in the comment chain talking about how Cannes and other festivals are just massive eBay services in the industry because his ‚Äúex was in international film sales‚Äù (implying there‚Äôs no real artistic endeavors going on), is grossly oversimplifying the institution and it‚Äôs an offensively manipulative take on one of the few events left that recognizes the limitless aspirations of cinema.    

I just hate to see a lot of people ITT dismissing or bashing Cannes and other festivals when earlier this year everyone in this sub was circle-jerking about the Oscars ‚Äî which have absolutely nothing to do with celebrating film as art and everything to do with LCD-style popularity, hushed up bribery, and massive appeal to celebrity culture.&&But isn't the old way better if the power is in the hands of many people instead of one corporation that is trying to control the entire entertainment industry?&&Well no, to be valid it has to be exhibited in a cinema.

It's usually a bunch of foreign language (i.e. not English) low-budget and auteur-driven films. 

Closest that they've come to having a big studio release is *maybe* Sicario in 2015 (And even that was still a $30M budget) or Inglourious Basterds back in 2009. &&Well...yeah? I mean how the hell are they going to compete with MGM or Disney?&&Which is why Netflix shouldn't be at the award part.

How do so many people think a couple film festivals support the little guys more than NETFLIX. Has half the thread been living under a rock since 2007?

Everyone is also making the mistake of looking at the concept of a film festival as the beginning of a distribution chain. But IMO if you love films or movies or whatever vernacular you prefer, these are intended to be exchanges of culture for fans. Again my opinion, but I think this goes against the spirit of the original intention of such a festival.

https://www.justwatch.com/fr/plateforme/amazon-prime-video?content_type=movie

As you can see it's pretty bad and the reason for that is that in France no streaming service can have a movie less than 3 years after it got a theatrical release. 

For example the only notable movie they have between 2016 and 2018 is The Big Sick, because it never got a theatrical release in France.

https://www.justwatch.com/fr/plateforme/amazon-prime-video?content_type=movie&release_year_from=2016&release_year_until=2018

Basically Amazon gave up on having a competiting video service in France because of the ridiculous french laws regarding medias. They considered, probably rightfully, that giving their movies a theatrical release in France would make them more money.

That is obviously not an option for Netflix because unlike Amazon, their video service is 100% of their business. And if Netflix decided to relase one of their 2017 movies in cinema, those movies could not be on Netflix before 2020. It's virtually impossible for Netflix to release their movies in cinemas in France unless the legislation change, otherwise they could only get their movies back at a point when they are worthless.&&A theater near me shows independent movies that make little to no money on a few of their screens.

* 3 to 4 months for DVD, Blu-Ray and pay-per-view VOD
* 10 to 12 months for movie-specific TV channels

-First sentence of the article&&Fair enough, Literally seconds after posting that comment I thought about what films are included in Cannes and regretted it instantly.&&Cannes is an award show... Netflix is banned from the Palme d'Or award, not the festival.&&Its not like the two Netflix movies up for awards last year were massive blockbusters either, Okja & The Meyerowitz Stories were both pretty low-key. Not sure how much TMS cost but Okja was $50m so I'd hazard a guess that both movies combined had a lower budget than Inglorious Basterds which cost $70m ($82m adjusted for inflation)&&I don't really consider Villenueve or Tarantino the ""little guys"" of the industry.&&By ""foreign language"" do you mean not English, or not French?&&Does ready player one in sxsw count?&&Every time somebody mentions sicario I'm reminded how much I love that movie.&&But then ALL movies with distribution deals should be banned, not just movies with a streaming service distribution deal.&&No, it isn't. 
First, ""in these festivals"" is pretty broad. Some festivals are part film award shows that recognize filmmakers and films that already have deals/release dates. Cannes does this. 
Here's rule 7 from their website:
Every feature film invited to be in competition must be released theatrically in France in accordance with French legislation pertaining to media chronology rules. Any beneficiary, producer or authorized representative submitting a feature film commits to honoring this clause.

Nowhere in their rules does the competition eliminate big-budget Hollywood movies. Nowhere does it limit entry to indie or unsigned films. 

So, unless you're suggesting Cannes change one of their biggest rules an show only unsigned films that haven't played anywhere, you're argument is flat wrong. 

Yes, SOME festivals are designed to get films distribution rights secured (SXSW for example, though even they screened signed films by big directors). 

Eliminating a film only because it's played on the Internet (this is an actual Cannes rule) is arbitrary. The Internet is 1.) the go-to source for indie distribution and 2.) one of the biggest and most popular mediums for audiences. 

This rule is ONLY going to hurt indie filmmakers as any large studio/big time producer/director will be able to show at Cannes anyway because they'll have the money and resources to do so. &&As does everyone who works on a Netflix film, right? You don't think they have a right for their work to be seen too?&&What about the smaller netflix movies in which the professionals working on the movie hopes to receive recognition on their hard work and further their career? It can be a small independent film backed by Netflix with a director hoping to receive recognition, awards, etc. in order to promote themself and their entire team to be able to make more films in the future&&It was so blatantly a failed sci fi piggy backing on a franchise as a last ditch effort to get some publicity. Utter dogshite of a movie and ruined what I think cloverfield could have been. 10 cloverfield lane I feel in hindsight did a similar stunt but well and got me excited for a weird collection of movies all oddly in the same universe.&&While that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs how the Cloverse works. They take an existing script and modify it. 10CL was originally ‚ÄúThe Cellar‚Äù TCP was originally ‚ÄúThe God Particle‚Äù and we know there‚Äôs a film coming up called ‚ÄúOverlord‚Äù that will get shifted into a Cloverse film. It‚Äôs the gimmick they are going with. &&Too be fair, I'm pretty sure you sign a shit ton of legal stuff when you buy a Ferrari that strictly says that you won't do stuff like that&&That comment absolutely blew mind. Toxic&&I hate how reddit upvotes unoriginal jokes.&&This law is the reason why there is still in France, and for a very long time I hope, french cinema. It assures an equilibrium between author, movies theaters, producers, and distributors (tv/vod/blu ray/dvd/internet). Everybody gets his part of the cake, and actual good cinema is being financed.
 
**Edit** (because there are so much dumb comments on this law):
 
Is it a perfect law? It surely isn't, and, full disclosure, I'm not 100% agreeing with it, but it indubitably had some very positive effects on movies theaters, on french cinema, and even on foreign cinema (we really produce a lot of things).
 
Could we improve it? Probably. But the question is why should we change our law every time an US new commer want to do business on our soil without playing by the rule? It was the same shit with Uber, and in some ways with the GAFA... You want to do business in France? good! You are welcome!

I'm not even a porn enthusiast, but you have to go to the Adult Entertainment Expo at least once in your life. &&Cannes doesn't have big movie studios there&&The new way is a select few online streaming services holding control over film distribution.

Indie filmmakers already have the means to release their movie online themselves, but guess what? People don't buy digital anymore, they stream. So unless the indie filmmaker is going to run their own server for free out of their house, *someone* has to serve that movie digitally and *someone* has to pay for that bandwidth.

Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, they're the big names in digital video streaming, and other studios are trying to make their own. No indie filmmaker can house their movie for streaming indefinitely. If they want their movie seen, they have to use one of the companies that streams content. And those companies aren't interested in sharing with one another, they want exclusivity.

If you honestly believe the film industry, particularly indie films, will ever be rid of distributors, you're dreaming.&&The fragmentation is pretty annoying.

On the one hand why should those filmmakers be unable to receive recognition simply because they have the backing of Netflix? On the other hand, a smaller film without a juggernaut like Netflix behind them would surely benefit more from the publicity of the palm d'or or even an appearance at the festival, so maybe it's unfair to them. &&But they already had a distributor, Netflix.&&Not English. Sorry, probably should have been more clear. &&I was specifically referencing Cannes because their banning of Netflix from awards contention was one of the things that prompted the Forbes article. 

If there were a limited number of awards slots for films at SXSW and one was going to Ready Player One then I think that could be an issue, but as is I think RPO was just one of the dozens of films showing at the entire festival. &&About 10 years ago it seemed like all the studios starting coming up with their own ""independent"" distribution companies. The movie Babel is the first one I remember being big.

This move to cut out Netflix and Amazon is just the dinosaur movie monopolies trying to cut out new media. &&Not really. Netflix basically guarantees a worldwide release of the film.

‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt buy online digitally anymore, they stream‚Äù isn‚Äôt really correct by several metrics. Arguably, people have never bought digital. It‚Äôs been dwarfed by physical home video for most of its existence, but beyond that point it‚Äôs been steadily growing, not declining. While streaming has certainly surpassed it, it‚Äôs definitely still a growth business. The main issue is getting placement and eyeballs on major digital retailers, not that the business is shrinking.

And saying that a few select streaming companies control distribution is laughable. They‚Äôve made their presence felt, and they throw their weight around when they feel like it. They‚Äôve probably shaken the market up a couple of times for content they really want. But by pure volume the amount of original distribution for feature films running through those services compared to traditional studios / distributors is almost negligible (ESPECIALLY with respect to Hulu, YouTube). In fact several of those streaming companies have output deals in place with traditional distributors as the licensees for content in international territories. They are certainly real players in the distribution market now, but by no means are they close to ‚Äúcontrolling distribution‚Äù.

Cannes need to decide what their primary function is. Is their primary function to award the best movies in the various categories? Then have no restrictions on entries. On the other hand is their primary function to award the best movies without major distribution deals to give the little guy a leg up, then ban movies from Netflix, Amazon, Disney, MGM, etc etc etc, not just streaming services.&&It's clearly a move to try to harm Netflix (or save cinema depending on your point of view) by discouraging filmmakers from selling their films to Netflix as they won't be ""legitimised"" with awards, they don't want their work to be seen as direct to video has been in the past.&&I think given that Netflix movies are guaranteed widespread ~~success~~ publicity and viewership and recognition simply by virtue of being able to be featured on the front page of a website with more than 117 million subscribers, smaller movies that may otherwise fade into obscurity deserve publicity by way of a Cannes award because otherwise they will go straight to DVD or some unknown streaming site to be forgotten.

""Holy shit, there's a really store like that here?""


""Oh right...***BIG*** 5....yup that's pretty much it""&&It's pretty much the only place to get a fishing license around here, so there's that.&&But then they sold it off to Kabletown&&Nah, that was all based around NBC's actual ownership back in the day. I'm pretty sure that was a reference to Vivendi (Which started by Napoleon as a water company that expanded to all sorts of sectors before founding it's TV service). Kabletown is obviously Comcast, and GE actually did own NBC when the show started.&&Yes didnt want to go into that much details ,really why i said 5 instead of 6 - cause it starts to get a bit technically and cloudly in the details but 5 1/2 is more like it.

But at the end of the day its 5 companies controlling almost all media and 2 controlling almost all news.

There is free press and blogs for the news as well.  There is a pretty well supported theory that much of the ""fake news"" out there is propagated by these mega companies to discredit independent reporters and blogs and that the reporting they do on those blogs is heavily biased towards pointing people to non fact checked blogs or doing segments on the blogs that are intentionally fake and manipulative and also don't fact check while completely avoiding any mention of reputable ones .

Note im not saying they make all the fake news (the make a lot of it though) but they definitely make sure to give attention to the fake news that want and also are able to wash their hands of it and say O we didnt make it , we just linked you to it. &&I thought the whole Jesus thing was that he was never wrong&&Their primary function has never been to just award the best movies. It's to promote cinema.The idea of cinema to the French is that it is an immediate communal experience (you watch it in a theater not on TV). Their initial push was just to make sure that Netflix was actually giving their films theatrical runs in France and not just dumping them on the service. &&I‚Äôve always thought it was that Cannes is a festival for ‚Äúcinema‚Äù movies that are going to get normal theatrical releases.  Netflix fits into more of a ‚Äústraight to video‚Äù category.  &&What? You‚Äôve completely missed the point -- Cannes is a celebration of cinema, not JUST merit, but that magic of seeing the movie, dressed up, in a theater. It‚Äôs the last vestige of a time forgotten. The best we have now is going to see movies in theaters in general, and even those numbers are dwindling year-over-year. By disallowing streaming services, Cannes is making a firm statement that they care about EXHIBITION of film and not just democratic distribution -- that to go see a movie in its grandest form, you should be encourage to go out, meet up with other members of the public and see it in a movie theater. They are trying to preserve an experience that is dying and will die if people don‚Äôt protect it. It has nothing to do with studio backing......theatrical distribution simply means they exhibit for 2-6 weeks in theaters (using 1200 to 3000 for a large domestic release, under 1000 for an independent film) versus letting you watch it at home.&&Exactly, Cannes are punishing filmmakers based on what distribution company they have chosen to work with, nothing to do with the merits of their work. This is purely a power play by Cannes that is affecting innocent filmmakers who just want their movies to be seen and to make a living.

Getting a movie onto Netflix might be a bit better than having no distribution deal, but winning the Palme d'Or or other awards is massive for a director and opens up a lot more doors than being on Netflix does.&&You need awards to ""legitimize"" your movie to get leverage for a wider distribution. But once your movie is being promoted and available on Netflix, do you still really need awards? &&No, it really isn't. It's merely a continued definition of what is part of their award categories and what is not. Likewise, none of these same films are eligible for Oscars.

This is nothing new. When premium cable television came along (like HBO) they began producing their own films. They are also not eligible for awards at the Oscars or Cannes. Stop acting like this is some sort of nouveau outrage.&&I dont see how it affects them. A lot of films do not have publishing deals while being shown on Festivals and being part of awards. They can win and than sign with Netflix for a publishing deal. A lot of those films are shown for a year in different parts of the world to be noticed by companies.&&Given the distributor, I imagine despite the Cannes film board‚Äôs repeated pleas where they clearly told them no, they eventually submitted and reluctantly allowed the film entry. &&> So did Inglorious Basterds, The Weinstein Company.

Was it distributed internationally by them, though? Was it not sold to other international distributors at the festival via the marketplace? I'm assuming Netflix has worldwide distribution rights to their films.&&I was saying Boo-urns...&&>Careful, we'll get stuck in a loop here

Dear People Who Won't Shut Up In Movie Theaters: You're The Worst,46566,88ht9o,https://www.dailywire.com/news/28858/dear-people-who-wont-shut-movie-theaters-youre-jared-sichel,6135,1522492032.0,,"Glaring phone screens just in your peripheral&&Saw ""Three Billboards"" and some guy talked during it, craziest thing was when something was funny he'd say ""LOL"". Who the fuck says that instead of laughing?

Edit:. He actually said the letters individually &&My local cinema showed all three Back to the Future films in a row one night (think it was for the date that they went to the future?). Anyway, my SO and I were excited because it‚Äôs been a while since we saw them to we went. 

Ended up next to some neck beard that spoke along with the script for the first 15 minutes. I asked him if it was necessary and he said yes it was and carried on. As well as this, he smelled so bad. Ate all his food and kept going out for more. When he didn‚Äôt like certain bits, he would tell his friend how he‚Äôs too good for his job and would probably quit. He‚Äôs too good for any job tbh. He went to the KFC next door at one point!!

No matter how much I asked him to stop, he continued. We left after the 2nd film. He was awful. 

I see him around now and he‚Äôs always wearing his Deadpool hoodie (those ones from Hot Topic that look like the top half of Deadpool‚Äôs suit) and I just want to slap him. 

I hate him&&Went to see Doctor Strange. Guy was sitting behind us. Literally every 5 seconds this guy just kept saying ""wow"". It was like sitting in front of Owen Wilson. If that wasn't bad enough a bunch of noisy kids entered about halfway through the movie and sat at the front, talking. I haven't been to a theater since. 

Wow.&&When I went to see The Last Jedi just as the theater got dark and the film was about to begin, and everyone got quiet, the guy behind me spoke up and said, ""okay guys I only see one movie a year so everyone shut the fuck up.""

I agreed with him in his sentiments and did my part by shutting the fuck up.&&Yeah, that's why I only go to weekday Matinees, mostly old people there, and they don't bother nobody! half of them are pretty much fall asleep in the theater anyway&&Anyone else hate when people put their feet up next to your head?

&&Also fuck you if you bring your BABY and/or TODDLER who can‚Äôt sit still and keeps on talking during a movie rated PG-13 or R. Went to see black panther twice and both times there were kids whose parents let them do what they wanted. One was literally running through the empty front rows. Totally ruins the immersion of the movie. Like if you can‚Äôt find a babysitter then either wait for a day when someone can care for them or take them to a kids movie. Don‚Äôt ruin the other moviegoers experience. &&I'd been excited for months to see Murder on the Orient Express.  And what do I get?  Running commentary throughout the entire thing from a row of middle-aged assholes.  Can't understand the plot?  Try shutting up and watching!&&I have made it my mission to confront people that won't shut up in movie theaters. I am always polite and it has always resulted in them not talking anymore. I usually start off with ""Could you please stop talking"" and it's usually worked.

My favorite was going to see Logan on opening night, movie theater had assigned seating and it was packed. There was a very young couple (like 18-20-ish) sitting next to me talking about all of the things they were going to do to each other when they got home so I leaned over and just said ""Oh man that sounds like fun."" and it creeped them out so much they shut right up.&&My local theater have a hard line on this. 

You get one warning, then you are removed from the theater.

At least 2 people got walked out Rogue One and a pretty big group was removed from the Black Panther screening.  &&Guy above me during Ready Player One kept trying to spill out the pop culture reference before the movie did, and since the movie was different, I was happy to hear him wrong each time. My favorite (SPOILER-ish).... ""a creator who hates his creation"" guy blares out FRANKENSTEIN! I giggled pretty hard when the cover of The Shining popped up.&&reason i will be seeing A Quite Place at 2pm on a Tuesday &&I have a 4D theater where I live, that means the seats movie, most and smells are sprayed from try arms of the chair, and there is a strobe light and fog machine near the screen, for the right movie it's a pretry cool experience.

Well I was seeing the Martian with my grandmother in this theater and about 3 trailers in a couple with three kids around 5, 7, and a baby. If you're unaware of the Martian, just let me say it would be a very boring movie for a 5 and 7 year old considering it's mostly science talk and little action. So the two youngest are running around up front almost instantly while the mother holds the baby in her lap. Once the seats start moving the baby starts crying, hard. It does not like this at all.

So like a rational caring mother, she sits there ignoring the crying baby for about a full half hour. At this point the entire theater isbpretry much yelling at her to leave while the boyfriend just yells back ""we paid for our tickets man, just like you"" and the mom just says ""shhh"" or ""shut the fuck up"" eventually about 30/45 minutes of continuous baby crying the theater employees come to escort her out. Probably half to two thirds of the audience start to applaud then leaving and one guy yells out ""you're a terrable mother!"". Just a total disregard for your children and everyone around you.&&I couldn‚Äôt believe it when some punk answered a phone call during Get Out. When I heard him say ‚Äúhello‚Äù I turned and said ‚Äúhello?! Hang up the phone you dipshit‚Äù.  
The theatres are already are hitting an attendance low, we don‚Äôt need idiots talking and on their cells to ruin it further.  &&people who talk in a theater during the movie and or look at their phone need to be banned from the theater for life - Alamo Drafthouse has the right idea. All theaters should implement their system&&Lady next to me trying to explain Atomic Blonde to her younger daughter she'd brought with her to the film. They'd won tickets to the pre-screening. Given what happened in that movie, I'm sure a young girl that age (like 10) would have been traumatised for a while. &&I got no problems shushing a bitch.  There is a special place in hell reserved for people who talk in movie theaters, take solace in that.&&When I was watching 'It' there were two girls who started talking and moving loudly ten minutes before the end of the movie. Yes, the movie was almost over and yes, some people need to get to the bus or whatever. But when they used their phones flashlight to look around and gather their stuff, I completely lost it and told them to shut up and let everyone enjoy the end of the movie. They were pretty angry at me and one of them hissed back that I should look away and at the screen if the light annoyed me so much. As if I wouldn't be annoyed by flickering lights and noise anymore if I just had turned my head an inch away...&&I remember seeing Rogue One in theaters, 10 minutes in the movie I heard a guy saying the movie is boring. 1 hour in the movie the same guy is sleeping, snoring loudly. I wonder if these people go to the movies to watch or to be an asshole.&&[deleted]&&With MoviePass I've been seeing a lot of movies lately. Every single time there is one of three things happening:

1: Someone wrestling with the fucking cellophane they put on every food item.  
2: Someone using their phone, full brightness, directly in front of me.  
3: Someone talking.  

Saw Ready Player One the other day. This couple is sitting directly behind me, man, woman, and 5 year old child. They are having a full volume conversation through the entire fifteen minutes of previews. It's annoying, but it's the previews so I deal with it. Theater goes dark, movie starts, they don't stop. Fine minutes in I turn around and shushed them. They shush me back, laugh about it, then keep talking. So I say ""you're in a fucking movie theater. Shut up.""

Dude gets all huffy and starts talking back to me. I ignore him, and just walk into the lobby to get an employee. When she walks in and confronts them the guy says ""yeah, there may have been a little talking, but he said the 'F' word in front of my five year old son.""

It's a fucking PG-13 movie, and they say FUCK in it. Fortunately the employee said something similar, and they shut up for the rest of the movie, but god damn it's frustrating.

I'm going to at least 2-3 movies a week now, and I am getting so frustrated with the people that have no theater etiquette. I say something, every time. I don't put up with it anymore. &&I swear, i havent had a good theater experience in years. Im a manager at a theater so when kids wont shut up during movies im trying to watch, which theyll sit right behind and in front of me, i pull the im a manager here and i can kick you out. It works but doesnt change my experience being ruined&&I don't come across loud talkers in movie theaters as often as I do cell phones. One time a guy immediately in front of me kept peeking at his cell for texts or updates on Facebook. After the 4th or 5th time I couldn't stand it. I reached over and firmly pressed on his arm. He looked shocked and said, ""...what??.."" I didn't know what to say, didn't want to make a scene then just decided to stay silent, keeping my hand on him. After a couple seconds he realized he was in the wrong then just nodded. He got the message and put the cell in his pocket. 

I fucking hate cell phone use in movies.&&This is what I love about Japan - I have to pay more, and wait an extra 3 months for a movie to show up (if ever at all), and pay and arm and a leg, but Japanese people come into the theater, shut up, watch the entire movie in silence not disturbing anyone, keep their phones off, and don't leave before the movie credits are done. Thank you, Japan, you are the best.&&This is exactly why even though I have twelve movie theaters near my house, I travel to Brooklyn to the Alamo Drafthouse. Once you have had a mandated good movie experience, it is really hard to go back to a normal movie theater.    

Plus the queso is so damn good. &&Why do they always get *so* upset when you call them out? So many macho guys thinking you've insulted their honor and want to fight. 

Bro. &&ITT: People who need to speak up.

Shame these annoying fucks. Get employees/managers. They might get warnings, but while theaters want to fill seats, they'll tell one repeat offender to fuck off over losing an entire upset auditorium.&&as an american living in Japan, oh man its fucking amazing going to the movie theaters here

absolute silence

no phones

utter slience, no kicking.  

fucking glorious

and yet...i‚Äôm still sad&&[deleted]&&Fuck you if you do this.

And fuck you guy who kept going ""Jack Black!"" and ""The Rock!"" for half the movie to impress your girlfriend. Yes I know they're in the movie...&&>America‚Äôs narcissism ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù is an obvious one. More and more people are increasingly obsessed with themselves, which means they‚Äôre less and less aware of how their actions impact others. And some people who are aware just don‚Äôt care.

I've always felt it's part of that whole ""I'm-a do me"" and ""fuck the haters"" mentality that is promoted throughout social media. Most people use it as a mantra to not have consideration for anybody else, and do what they want to do in spite of common decency.&&Good thread to bring out my A Ghost Story tale...picture the scene...it‚Äôs Sunday afternoon at a cinema in Glasgow. The movie for those who don‚Äôt know is an existential tale of a man who dies and comes back as a ghost. So it‚Äôs not exactly a kiddie friendly action packed and noisy blockbuster.

Enter a family of six. We‚Äôll call them the Noisemakers. Mum, dad, a friend and three kids. One of which was under six years old. No sense of self awareness amongst them. They proceeded to talk loudly, let their kids runs riot and basically ruined the film for everyone else. You could cut the tension with a knife and in Glasgow...well there‚Äôs a real chance that could happen.

Finally someone close to them snapped and lost the plot. The Noisemakers reacted angrily to being told they were ruining the movie for everyone. Shouting ensued and it died down for a bit. The movie reaches a scene where Rooney Mara eats a pie for what felt like eternity and the kids began playing up again. People start shouting again and one female voice piped up: ‚ÄúWILL YOU SHUT UP AND LET THE LASSIE EAT HER PIE IN PEACE!‚Äù. Everyone else bursts out laughing, Noisemakers leave and we all get to watch the rest of the movie without interruption.

I‚Äôm now zero tolerance for noise, texting, seat kicking, talking etc. If you can‚Äôt keep your mouth shut or leave your precious phone alone for 5 minutes please just watch the movie at home!!!&&Honestly it's horrible and unfortunately I find theater goers are becoming increasingly tolerant of this behavior.

I think we in attendance need to become more confrontational when this happens.  Shush the hell out of people who talk.  And the second someone checks their phone tell them to knock it off.  &&I'm never afraid to sush a bitch. Join me in the good fight. &&Theatre manager here.

I agree with the observations. Honestly it's a lot worse than it used to be and people are afraid to speak up. But please get a staff member; I have no issue kicking disruptive people out and do so regularly. They get one warning and then they're booted.

I can't do anything once the film is done, so do yourself a favour and grab me asap.&&""A special Hell, reserved for child molesters, and people who talk at the theatre""

I have nothing to do with them. It‚Äôs just the only movie theater left where you can enjoy the movie. &&When I was younger I went to see Contagion with a friend. I was going through a rough patch in life and not in the best of moods. 

As the movie started a group of teenagers behind us would not stop talking. My friend who is very mild mannered just kind of sat there, made a few comments but she took it.

 After about 5 minutes I turned around and asked them to quiet down. The one kid responded by saying ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do about it?‚Äù I guess he was trying to impress the girls he was with. I proceeded to stand up and tell him ‚ÄúI will fucking end you!‚Äù. 

There was silence and then the kids just kind of sunk into their chairs and we didn‚Äôt hear a peep the rest of the movie. Not going to lie, it felt pretty good. &&This is why I bought a home cinema projector and just wait for it to come out on Blu Ray or netflix. &&I don't want to sound rude but could this be a mostly American thing? Or a major city thing?

Zero tolerance towards noisy son of bitches in theaters.&&I saw theater staff kick out a group of chatty teenagers once. The whole theater clapped as they got out of their seats. &&Went with this friend of mine for the new Tomb raider and she wouldn't shut up for even a second. "" Omg! She touched the rusted plane!

""You're awfully quiet. Don't tell me you're interested in this bad movie"". I finally said the people around us might be trying to watch it.

Going to a horror movie in the theatre and enjoying it is an impossible thing now. Kids are unbearable these days.&&Dear OP,

The people who do this don't give one single fuck about your opinion.

Trust me. I spent most of high school and college working in theaters. I've had to ask dozens of people to leave the theater for various disruptions.

They respond as though you've just kicked their favorite cat and you are quite simply the most despicable person for even suggesting that they need to be quiet in the theater. They bought their ticket and if they want to be on the phone during the movie they will be. (Have heard that many times) The other customers, who paid to hear the movie and not the phone call, don't seem to matter.

It is narcissism, arrogance, selfishness and a complete disregard for their fellow man all at once. &&Just tell people to be quiet. It usually works. &&As if they can read this&&Saw annihilation with only 10 people in the whole theater room.

2 separate couple couldn‚Äôt shut the fuck up about what was happening and a guy in front was on his phone periodically.

My living room is a perfectly acceptable place to watch movies.&&My personal favorite was a case when me and my SO were in Stockholm, Sweden watching a movie. There was this guy, obviously not a local, whose phone started to ring during the movie. If that wasn't bad enough, he actually took the call and just started to blabber random things while everyone else was like ""is this happening?"". Eventually my SO told him ""shhh!"" which made the guy get really angry and start to rant ""DON'T YOU FUCKING SHHH ME, THAT'S FUCKING RUDE!"". &&This is why I only go to Alamo.&&When I saw ‚ÄúIt Comes At Night‚Äù, there were two drunk ladies behind me that brought in actual food with metal utensils and kept saying how the movie sucked. I then lost it and said ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù. Long story short, they got offended and ran out, never to be seen again. One of the better moments of my life. &&A lot of comments justifying this. ""I sit in the back"" or ""everybody laughed at my comment"" 

No, you are the exact problem. It doesn't go one way for others and not for yourself.&&Dear People Who Have No Idea How To Gauge How Loud They Are Chewing Popcorn: You're The Worst.
&&Honestly this is one of the best parts about living in a smaller town. I can only think of 1 or 2 cases of talkers in movies that really irritated me in the last year when I go alone. When I go with friends however it almost always becomes a fight because they love to talk, use their phone, and use Snapchat with the flash on......

There have been multiple times they have left the theater because I haven't been very kind to them. I don't care honestly. They way I see it is I spent $10 to see a movie and so did they. Their money isn't any more valuable than mine. And if they wanna waste it by walking out of a theater before the movie is finished, be my guest. 

I don't understand paying money to see a movie in the background while you sit on your phone the whole time. And what I really don't understand is their excuses for it. They say things like:

""I have to keep my phone on in case (insert family member here) needs me!"" Ok, then why even come to the movie to begin if they potentially need you?

""It's just one quick snap I promise"" I don't care if it's one or eight. Turn the damn phone off. 

""The screen was on minimum brightness!"" It's almost pitch black in this theater! Even minimum brightness with the blue light filter turned on is visible!! 

""I just don't really like the movie."" Ok, you see that over there? That's the door. You can walk out just as easily as you walked in. Use it. 

I honestly think this comes down to the whole argument of especially in teens they feel entitled. ""It's my money that I used for the ticket so I should get to be on MY phone whenever I want."" That may sound like an over-exaggerated comment but I have literally been told that before by friends. 

Movie talkers are worse. There are 3 cases of movie talkers that I honestly couldn't understand any less than I already dont. 

1. People who translate a movie from English into whatever language the person next to them speaks.

2. Nitpicking assholes who feel the need to make every little comment they can think of because they saw Cinema Sins or Screen Junkies do it.

3. Children. I can not stand children who are in a R rated film/any non-animated kids film because their parents think that the kids will keep themselves entertained. Why the hell even bring them?

If you have to translate the movie verbally then wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release and watch it with subtitles.

Don't nitpick a movie during a movie. I know you think it makes you sound brilliant. But, 9/10 times you'll be proved to be an idiot after the movie because a comment you made at minute 15 will be proven wrong by minute 20. 

I don't know any other way to put it so I'll put it like this. Keep. Your. Kids. At. Home. I personally think any child under the age of 8 shouldn't be allowed into any PG-13 or R-Rated film. I think it would eliminate lots of problems. &&I went to go see Black Panther with some friends and this woman sitting next to us took out her phone to take a picture with the flash of the screen. &&My BF takes no shit in these types of situations. He gives them 2 shots: 1 angry eye-contact, and 1 shush; if they keep going after that he will get up, find them and tell them to shut up to their faces. I used to be embarrassed by this when we first got together but now when I know he's getting up I just watch impishly from my seat grinning like an idiot.

So far we haven't had anyone continue talking after he's gotten into their face about it. One guy did try to yell something quippy back but he stumbled over it and stopped talking out of shame.&&I've pretty much stopped going to the theatre altogether.  There are rare exceptions like Avengers, Star Wars, Godzilla (huge G-fan) but I will normally wait for the movie to slip out of the top of the box office to go.  The talking, the babies crying, being elbow to elbow with people... I just stop enjoying it.  I'll be okay when the theatre experience dies out or at least we have more options.  I would be happy to pay more if the experience was better but we don't have better options within reasonable distance where I live.  I'd love to have an Alamo Drafthouse around here because of the rule policy.

I also have a job where I work a half day on Fridays.  So I use to catch Friday matinees but the talking in there is just as bad about 50% of the time.   &&What I fucking hate is when you get there early, a few people teeter in before the movie starts and spread out. No one sits in front of anyone else bc there‚Äôs 200 goddamn seats and no reason for 10 people to be bundled up on top of one another. 

Then you get that fat trailer park bitch who walks in, looks around at all the empty seats and then proceeds to walk up and sit right in front of you, gets her phone out and doesn‚Äôt shut the fuck up throughout the entire time. 

If you do this, seriously go fuck yourself. Do us all a favor and save the 20$ for movie tickets and buy yourself some teachings in consideration. &&Slightly off topic but this is becoming increasingly common at live theatre, too, at least in the UK. There have been a few instances of actors having to come out of character to tell people to switch their phones off. My friend was at a performance of Twelfth Night a few years ago where Mark Rylance had to physically remove a mobile phone from a woman in the third row who took a call halfway through the performance and refused to terminate the call. Even when the actors were so distracted by it they had to halt the play. &&I just want to shout out Alamo Draft house for actually taking this problem seriously and giving me a place to watch my movies in quiet &&I went to see Annihilation when it came out. A lady a few seats next to me took pictures of the screen with the fucking flash on. I couldnt fucking believe it. At least she stopped and said sorry when someone told her to stop but god damn&&Was watching a scary movie on an opening night. The place was packed, and there were a group of teenagers up in the front talking the whole time. Yelling at funny/scary parts on purpose. Then a shower scene came up and they whistle and such. And this lady from the back yells ""ugh! Fucking virgins shut up!"" The whole theatre busts out laughing and applause the lady. It was beautiful lol&&Clapping. In. Movie. Theaters. THIS AINT LIVE, THEY CANT PAUSE BEFORE THEY MOVE ON WITH LINES. NOW IVE MISSED IMPORTANT DIALOGUE&&I yelled ""SHUT IT"" to a trio of teen girls who didn't respond to the pointed staring of everyone else around them.&&I go to the movies usually once a week,  and i know young ppl get crapped on a lot for their phones,  etc. But recently,  I've run into a string of older people,  maybe 60's, or 70's who just sit there and and questions,  loudly,  too the person they're with. So annoying.  &&I was in Ready Player One and this guy behind me kept tapping his foot on the floor super loudly during the more quiet scenes. No one next to him on the same row said a word about it until I had to look behind me and call him out on it. Some people man. &&Ya I haven't had too many talkers in recent memory, but people on the phone with brightness at max is annoying as fuck.&&Movie theater by me kicks people out for using their phone or talking.  They've even made a ""Don't talk PSA"" out of a angry voicemail someone left after being kicked out.  They play this one or another version of their ""Don't talk PSAs"" prior to every movie.

&&People strolling into a movie late after the lights are off and using the flashlight function on their phones to find a seat is also a new ""plz die"" thing for me. Some lady spent like 10 minutes doing this during almost the entire intro of Black Panther.&&[deleted]&&Oh, did I rage on an underage chick in Deadpool for this. She sat 2 rows down across the walkway that split the sides from the middle. She had her iPhone on silent but that blinking cameraflash as the notification. So when the screen was down that fucker went off and lit up the ceiling, surrounding area and my right eye. She then turned the phone on and her screen was on max brightness. She did this about 3 times before I actually yelled ""turn that fucking phone off"". She huffed and puffed. Stood up and walked out. Not my proudest moment but the applause made it worth it.&&I had a bad experience with Three Billboards. A couple comes in five minutes into the movie, ok whatever, sit down next to me in the only available seats. Proceed to whisper to each other throughout the whole movie, girl takes out her cell phone repeatedly. Tried to ignore it until she was holding it so it was right in my vision.

Finally I asked her to please put her phone away. She starts ARGUING WITH ME, saying it's not the light from her phone bugging me, it's the light under the table (it's one of those theaters you can order food in, so bench seating with tables). I tell her no, it's your phone, please put it away. She keeps saying ""It's not my phone! It's the light!"", until the guy sitting on the other side of her boyfriend leans forward and says, ""Your phone is bothering me too. Put it away."" Then she shut up.

The second the movie hit credits she RAN out of the theater, abandoning her boyfriend. I was pissed. I paid to see a movie, not to argue with assholes. I can't believe the gall of people.&&Lol. &&Dated a girl that said this.  
Didn't feel bad that this was on of the main reasons I broke up with her.&&Hey larry david &&[LOL Larry](https://youtu.be/5HxZNeXrFUo) &&I can picture this so vividly. I hate him too. &&I hate him now too&&When he informed me that it was in fact necessary to quote the movie I'd have gone and got the manager. Fuck'em.&&I went to a screening of that in Lincoln Square at Bellevue and holy shit, you could tell that it was the only theater in the Seattle area doing that showing. SO many unwashed 38 year old 'game testers'. &&Missed opportunity to grab the staff between movies. They'll shut someone up who is talking during a movie. Especially talking frequently.

I wouldn't have let that guy ruin my experience. I would have made it my duty between movies to get him kicked out so that I could at least enjoy the last film in peace.

Hell, that guy may have only felt so comfortable talking because nobody else has confronted him/ratted him out to the staff before. If the staff doesn't cut it, you've frankly got to escalate it--stop ""asking"" them to stop talking, and start raising your voice a bit, ""If you don't shut the fuck up right now then you'll be gone."" I swear to god if there's a crowd around you, they **will** start applauding. &&So glad I live in a place where it's perfectly okay to tell people they're out of line and the expected to respect it... and where movie employees will kick you out if you act like a cunt in the theatres.&&Would you have been less mad if you turned around to shush him and *it was Owen Wilson*?&&The wow guy sounds kind of hilarious&&wow&&He actually goes to the movies every week, and this line works every time.&&During my The Last Jedi showing opening night when Holdo crashed the ship into the cruiser and during the dead silence some soccer mom shouted, ""OH MY GOD SHE CRASHED THE SHIP!""

Like... really?&&> I agreed with him in his sentiments and did my part by shutting the fuck up.

when the citizens of gotham do their part&&I guess that's one way to do it.&&I went to the Thursday night opening. 10pm showing. Some 10 year old kid would not shut the fuck up. His dad was with his drinking buddies and had to drag him along because it was his night with him, I guess. 

The kid keeps going ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS HAPPENING? WHAT‚ÄôD THEY SAY? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?‚Äù Not whispering, mind you, but shouting. I shushed them several times. Then he gets up and runs to the bathroom, comes back and goes ‚ÄúWHAT DID I MISS?‚Äù 

As Holdo is preparing to crash the ship at lightspeed, he goes ‚Äú3...2...1...‚Äù and then when it happens and everything is silent, he goes ‚ÄúWAIT, WHAT HAPPENED!‚Äù You were counting down to it, you little shit! 

Movie ends. I‚Äôm livid, I missed so much because this kid wouldn‚Äôt shut the fuck up. I see a boy younger than the shouter in the back of the theater walking out. He hadn‚Äôt said a word. He sat and enjoyed the movie the whole time. Why can‚Äôt everyone be like him?&&A little cheeky to tell you to shut the fuck up when you're actually being quiet.&&The guy behind me who said ""what the fuck Disney"" a little too loudly when Luke was drinking the green milk made the experience that much better. &&My first viewing of The Last Jedi was practically ruined by a couple and their kids who acted like they were watching in their living room. They just talked like they were the only people in the theater. 

When I asked them politely to be quiet they acted like I had the nerve. &&Great way to get people to talk just to spite you&&When I went to watch The Revenant I thought it would be a great idea to go at a noon screening. It's senior special, so what could go wrong?

This was by far the worst cinema experience I had. There was a complete row of senior behind me and they were constantly talking very loudly.

Every actions of the hero were commented. There was a guy who was always doing noise with his mouth when things were bad. We were politely asking them to be respectful of others and they didn't give a fuck. After 6 times we were almost screaming at them and they didn't give a fuck either.&&Had an old grandpa snore in my ear for an entire movie watching a Studio Ghibli film. Do not recommend.&&Oh man, in my experience, the weekday matinee baby boomers are the worst when it comes to talking during movies. Got to hear all about one lady‚Äôs cabinetry woes over the start of Unsane the other day. &&My worst experiences are with that group. One instance that is still burned into my brain was Chronicles of Naria: Prince Caspian or whatever. This old woman behind me must not have seen any film or TV since 1955. Every shot, every bit with Eddie Izzard's mouse character she was just ""oh woooooooow!"" ""Awwww how cute!"" ""Oh gosh how do they do that?"" ""OH NO ASLAN!"" Like shut the fuck up lady.  

The other was this old old old old old old man during Hitman's Bodyguard who kept turning his phone on, sitting next to me on my right. I wear glasses so the glare was literally blinding me from the reflection. When he pulled it out after the time I asked him politely to keep it away I just got up and let the staff know. This was a Flix Brewhouse and they're just as strict as Alamo Drafthouse (thank god!) so he got ejected pretty quick after they saw him do it again. Kept trying to take his beer and food with him but they told him no, he broke the rules and he needed to leave now. &&There‚Äôs 10am discount screenings in my favourite theatre now. Place is a ghost town, it is frankly amazing. Pre-order leather recliners, coffee, still theatre snacks but coffee!&&Happened so often to me. A year ago a woman put her feet ON MY HEAD. Soon after that my local cinema installed recliners in all the theatres making it impossible for anyone to put their feet up. Sure I have to pay a few dollars extra per ticket, but it's so worth it.&&Had a lady put her sandle/flip flop wearing feet on both of my arm rests and then try to argue with me with the arm rests aren't technically part of my chair so it's cool. I pushed my elbows back into her feet until they slide off my arm rests and she went into that tired ole ""I am a 30 year old women, I DESERVE RESPECT AND YOU WILL SHOW IT TO ME""

Lol okay, I just want don't want to smell your feet ma'am &&dude, like a year or whatever ago that movie ""Lights out"" came. I'm a sucker for a horror movie, i gotta see them all. people always rage about how characters act stupid in them. i dont care, gotta see them all.

anyway, my girlfriend at the time and I went to go see it, these asshole mother fuckers sat down in the seats behind us and proceeded to use OUR armrests, as THEIR foot rests. I didnt even notice at first because I was paying attention to the movie then i had that ""something is next to my face"" feeling and thought I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. 

This dude had his foot kicked up on my arm rest, maybe 6 inches from my head. to this day I can only hope he wrapped his car around a tree on the way home&&Oh yea, that's not flying with me. You will be asked to move your dirty ass feet. And if you refuse, I'll move them for you.&&I have a picture from last year of this dude that took off his shoes and put his bare feet up on my friends seat.

https://imgur.com/a/aQg4J&&Jesus Christ, this happened to me once years ago. Some d-bag guy put his feet in the space between my seat the the one next to me, inches from my head. I turned around and said ‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù 
He gives me a shit eating grin and says ‚ÄúYup, this is happening!‚Äù
So I slipped his shoe off and tossed it toward the exit. He starts *freaking out* asking why I would do that what if I know how rude I am. 
The lady behind him screams at him ‚ÄúIf someone can reach your shoe without much effort then *YOU* fucked up! Get your fucking shoe and get the fuck out.‚Äù
This was all before the previews. Before the movie started someone went and got an employee who came in, saw a guy with one shoe and everyone yelling at him and made him leave.&&I had my head kicked by a shitty drunk teenager. I turned around and said, ""Hey, you accidentally kicked my head, would you mind putting your feet down?"" Got a, ""Yeah whatever,"" and as soon as I faced forward they put their feet against the back of my seat and just shoved. I tried to go get someone to kick them out but it was a really busy night and none of the employees would come, and we couldn't move seats cause the theater was packed. 

Edit: I knew they were drunk cause I saw heard the ""*clink* *giggle* Shhh!"" When they got the bottle out and I saw them stumbling in the parking lot after it was over.&&It only happened to me once. Asked him to put his feet down. Guy was with a friend so he was an ass about it. Then a few minutes later he starts softly kicking my seat.

  I excused myself and walked up to his row sat down next to him, leaned over and told him if he did it again I'd be seeing him outside after the show.

  Dude almost squeals ""but I didn't do anything!"". I just got up and went back to my seat. He didn't kick it anymore after that.&&I had a girl put her foot on my arm rest. I did a people's elbow on top of her foot, she couldn't believe I did that.

This was after her and her date were yapping in to the opening scene of a movie. &&This guy other peoples.&&Hell is sitting through Avatar with three small children behind you, kicking your seat and loudly asking their mom what the aliens are saying because they‚Äôre too young to read subtitles. Bitch your mom can‚Äôt even read.&&As a man who has spent the last 4 nights in a hostel, i concur. &&Something tells me he's reading this thread now.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.5566  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/70730)&&https://youtu.be/_gXjQT3w020?t=3m5s&&Doodeloodoo Doodeloodoo Doodeloodoo DIE!&&This is only slightly better than my experience at Black Panther. Ten minutes into the movie, two women started arguing about their seat assignments. This continued for a few minutes, and then out of nowhere, *boom:* popcorn is flying, men and women are screaming at each other, fists are flying. It was a group of like ten people, all hitting each other and shouting the n-word. The weird thing was, I think the rest of us in the theater were just kinda stunned and didn't really know what to say. After what seemed like an eternity, someone in the back row screams, ""YOU'RE AT A FUCKING MOVIE!"" Someone else screams, ""What the FUCK are you DOING?!"" Eventually, the lights in the theater turned on and the group was escorted out. A nervous teenager apologized to everyone and told us they were just going to start the movie over from the beginning. Easily the strangest movie theater experience I've ever had. &&I had the exact problem seeing Annihilation in theaters. This lady and her husband couldn‚Äôt stop loudly exclaiming their every thought. &&I was at The Hitman's Bodyguard. Throughout the entire movie there was a guy explaining all the jokes after they happned, trying to predict lines and even trying to come up with his own one liners and the whole time his wife was beside him laughing at everything he said.

I just don't get it. I would consider it common knowledge that talking during a movie at a theater is considered rude, but so many people still do it.&&[removed]&&During a movie, behind me there was an old lady with her daughter the daughter husband. The lady was always talking so I turn around and ask her politely to please keep it quiet. 5 minutes later, same thing so i turn around again and ask her to please keep it quiet. 

The daughter goes ""If you wanted silence, you should have stay at home!""

I was baffled, couldn't believe what I heard so I said

""wtf? If you can't behave stay at home""

The husband was angry but I just wanted to watch the movie.&&A few years back I went to see The Force Awakens with my dad and now his wife and her daughter. I had already seen The Force Awakens and I am glad that I did because my movie experience was ruined by these two women laughing and giggling the whole time during the adventure! Always had some sort of side comment.

I‚Äôm ready for the box office to come home. &&Watched Interstellar in IMAX (assigned seating) next to an 80yo lady who kept asking what was happening the entire movie. It felt like I won a raffle and my prize was screaming internally for 2+ hours.&&Real MVP right here.&&Best comment&&It‚Äôs baffling how I scrolled this far before seeing a comment like this. 

Resistors REALLY avoid any confrontation it seems. Like hell, notify an usher if you need to. You have paid to enjoy the movie. They can shut it for an hour and a half or get out. &&I believe the Alamo Drafthouse's have those warnings posted and displayed just before the movie too. &&Theater should pause the movie, come over a loud speaker ""person in seat ## may we have your attention"", blast a spotlight on em, ""shut the fuck up, leave, or be escorted out, plz & thx"". &&When I saw Black Panther, there were these girls in front of me going ""YASS QUEEN"" and ""AH HELL NO"" and snapping their fingers throughout the movie. Totally ruined the experience for me&&When we went to see Black Panther there was a couple with a young toddler who would just start screaming and crying randomly. The dad took them out a few times but it just got worse. Finally the kid started having this horrible wet cough in between bouts of screaming and the dude in front of me goes, ""fuck this"" and got up and walked back to talk to the guy. Miraculously, they left without a fuss. 

I felt really bad for the kid. What kind of shitty parents drag their clearly sick toddler to a very non kid friendly movie? &&Saw this last night. Had someone like that above me. So fucking annoying.&&I don't mind people getting excited at things happening on the screen, especially big popcorn movies like RPO or Black Panther.  If I go see it on opening weekend at a time I know it will be busy, I expect that kind of thing.  I saw RPO yesterday and couldn't help from being happy when I saw certain things.  I had to really control myself from singing along to certain songs.  I did laugh at certain pop culture things - I just couldn't help it.  But at least all that shows that I'm paying attention.  

I can't stand it when the noise or talking is because someone isn't paying attention and needs to be ""caught up.""  That happened when I went to see Black Panther.  The 13 year old next to me played on her phone so much during the movie that she'd have to ask her friend what was going on during big scenes.  And then when it was over she declared in breathless wonder, ""that was my *favorite* movie ever.""  For a movie that she missed 40% due to playing with her cellphone!&&This is the wrong movie to see if you don‚Äôt like talking during a movie. I saw it this past week and there weren‚Äôt many in the theater but nearly every person there felt it was appropriate to point and yell at the screen every time there was a reference, and there are lots of references. I was having flashes of throwing my extra large coke at the guy next to me the next time he pointed at the screen and yelled. I could see myself smashing the coke at him while I scream ‚ÄúYEAH ITS BATTLETOADS MOTHERFUCKER, WELL SPOTTED!!!‚Äù&&Thankfully everyone in my theatre was quiet as hell because we were all super engaged in the movie. &&That movie would either be incredible to see in a theater (because of the ideal sound system) or god awful (because the whole premise of quiet can be ruined by a single person. Or more likely, different people constantly eating popcorn, crinkling plastic, and talking)&&""You can't bring children into this movie.""

""Well we want to see the movie, but can't afford a sitter.""

Then you can't afford to see the fucking movie either!&&I had some lady do that during Mother!  twice. First time, was at the start of the movie. I let it slide because I showed up late and she wrapped up her conversation quickly. It rings again right after the baby scene. I was on edge at this point because of the movie. I just shouted, ""Are you fucking kidding me!? Get the hell off your phone!"" After that, not a peep from this woman. Public shaming is the way to go.&&With ticket prices climbing every year, and management's reluctance to deal with bad guests, it's no surprise that some movie houses are struggling to fill seats. &&I work at Alamo! I love our policies, I have gotten yelled at countless times by people being kicked out and it gives me great joy seeing them walk out of the building. Most people aren‚Äôt aware but we do have an ‚ÄúAlamo for All‚Äù day where chatting isn‚Äôt frowned upon and babies can be babies so people if you insist on talking go on a Tuesday. &&I love Alamo for this. When I saw Black Panther, a guy was whispering the whole time...ten minutes into the movie, he was being escorted out. He made a big scene and yelled at the staff, but the crowd just clapped him out the door. Then, a few minutes later, his wife and daughter did the walk of shame out as well. It felt good. &&I refuse to go to any other theater other than Alamo. I went to AMC and had to deal with a mother who brought her kids and a baby in. The baby would cry. A lot. So, like a ‚Äúgood mother‚Äù, she tried to soothe the baby by walking back and forth in the theater.

Ugh never again.&&I like the no talking rule, but 20 servers running around with food and drinks talking to people is WAYY more distracting then someone whispering in the row behind me&&[Arclight Cinemas](https://www.arclightcinemas.com/) on the west coast is also really harsh on talkers.  It was one of the first chains out here that let you reserve an actual seat online in 2002.  They are now expanding nationwide.  They also don't show any commercials... just trailers.  And no one is allowed into the theater once the movie starts.&&[deleted]&&The special hell. https://youtu.be/NVxLz6O6MaI&&[deleted]&&During the midnight premiere of The Force Awakens a guy two rows behind me was just...snoring. Fast asleep. His little kid looked really uncomfortable. After a few minutes I got up and nudged him awake; who the fuck falls asleep at a loud-ass premiere like that?&&I saw The Force Awakens on opening weekend and i sat right in front of a guy who was silent until the Millennium Falcon's first appearance when he exclaimed ""OOOOOO THE MILLENNIUM"" at a normal speaking level and then proceeded to loudly whisper back story and Star Wars history to his girlfriend for the rest of the movie. &&Reminds me of when I saw Dunkirk and these two mouth-breathing morons sat behind us acting as if they were watching fast and the furious. Just yelling and cheering throughout the movie, making machine gun sounds with the mouths and going BOOM during explosions. It was a comically bad experience&&I love my fucking MoviePass, but going 2 times a week to the theater has made me hate people even more.  I had an experience on Thursday night watching Ready Player One.  The row of assholes behind me wouldn‚Äôt shut up.  This was my second time seeing it and I took my best friend with me this time.  I knew The Shining part was coming up and it‚Äôs my favorite part.  So I got up and told them to shut the fuck up.  No talking for the rest of the movie and they were the first to leave the theater at credits.  &&I get so caught up in hating folks for their self-centeredness and total lack of class that I had to stop going to theaters all together. The last instance I had, I had to repeatedly tell an adult to be quiet, which they took offense to. Nothing short of physically fighting them was going to stop them. Left to ask the manager to boot them and was only offered a refund instead. That was my final straw. &&I only go at 9am on weekends now.  It's better for everyone.&&Same, I haven't been to the theater since Thor 2. That was the last straw, the last time I left the theater saying ""I'll never see a movie in a theater again,"" and finally meant it. Even going after a couple weeks on a ""slow day,"" there will still be a couple obnoxious idiots in the theater texting and talking the whole time. I'm perfectly fine waiting for the movies to come out on bluray now and actually have a pleasant experience watching new movies in my home. Sure, there's a risk of things getting spoiled while they're still in theaters if you're not careful, but the tradeoff is worth it.

&&I went to Blade Runner 2049 when it came out and it was super rainy, later at night showing. There was nobody in the theater except me, my friend and a few older gentlemen. Everyone was totally silent the whole film. It was absolutely wonderful.&&R rated movies don't have the annoying kids at least, just annoying adults&&I saw Iron Man 3, Cinderella, and Whiplash in a Tokyo cinema.

What a wonderful experience.&&It's also nice how there's never any trash on the streets there, the trains are always on time, there's actually a really good train system to get around on, I could go on and on.

I gotta get a job in Japan...
&&They closed down the Alamo where I live just last year and it's just not the same going to movies anymore. The difference in watching something at AMC and the Alamo is night and day.&&a few years back someone was shot over a confrontation like this at a theater near me. &&I did that every time. Every time my experience was still ruined by having to do so. Now I just don't go to movie theaters anymore, they should police annoying customers, not me. &&Around here, the trashy people that are being rude by talking or using their phone are also the ones desperately looking for a reason to explode and fight. Shaming someone needs them to have at little a little bit of self awareness/empathy to work. They will, however, start screaming about being ‚Äúrespected‚Äù, which is the exact opposite of what they‚Äôre actually getting from their trashy behavior. 

I have shushed folks, called managers, but it just seems to feed their self-importance and rage control issues. More often than not I just keep quiet because I don‚Äôt want the hassle from them amping up their assholeness, and making the situation even more of a hassle for me and everyone around me. &&Yeah, I've completely stopped trying to to appease folks on this front. If you're talking or dicking around on your phone, I'll ask you to stop once or twice. If not, I'm heading to the front desk to snitch and ask for a refund. &&People get stabbed at my local theater so i cant really do that&&[deleted]&&Hey, maybe she likes a guy with good facial recognition skills!&&You know that part before the movie starts where they kindly tell you to silence your phone and keep your feet off the chairs in front of you? They should replace that with a scene of someone acting rude in a theater and then someone else really doing something about it and then applause from the audience when they leave the room. It might help the rude folks to understand that they're being rude, that they'll be kicked out if they act up, and it would encourage people to confront the rule breakers.&&It's gotten to a point that I get chewed out whenever I try to tell to shut up? Like when did I become the bad guy????&&As a patron, I don't want a warning for them, the social etiquette we all know should know is already the warning. Kick them out, no refund, so they learn. Just check with other people around if they really were talking, and if yes, bye bye. If they start in on, ""well i won't be coming back here again!"" the reply should be to thank them for not bringing their disturbances here. 

If I have to go grab someone, I've already told the bad actor to be quiet, and then leaving the theater, I'm already missing part of the movie. And I can never find an employee quickly. Then they have to find a manager. At this point, I don't want to finish the movie and experience is ruined. Can't the lower level employees kick people out too? Can't they be checking in on theaters for this bad behavior for us? &&[deleted]&&After all the comments raving about this place I'm thoroughly disappointed there isn't one by Boston&&I welcome them to come to Canada. &&Same instead of a projector, I sit about 7‚Äô away from a 65‚Äù

And studios wonder why people don‚Äôt go to the theater as much anymore. Going to the theater sucks compared to the home experience. &&Same. It's awesome.&&Same here.  The first Avengers movie was the last time I set foot in a theater.  &&I‚Äôve had one. Someone brought a baby into interstellar. Also , at a dollar theater somewhere some bitch let her kids play tag in the aisle. I wanted to trip them sooooo bad.

The last one was a while ago. My bad experiences are few and far between. Some people are either very easily flustered or don‚Äôt go to the movies enough to know it isn‚Äôt a terrible experience all the time.&&In England this behaviour put me off cinemas massively. I had an unlimited pass and went at least 3 times a month, now I've only seen 2 movies in theatres in the last 2 years, and 1 of those was ruined by arseholes talking. &&Scotland cinema goer checking in. No major issues I can recall in the cinema and I watch a lot of mainstream crap. Occasional person talking but very rarely. Only once had a guy on his phone in front of me and within about 20 seconds a guy sitting behind me, leaned over me, tapped the fella on the shoulder and went ""oy neighbour, gonnae turn that aff?"" And that was the end of it. Quality shit.

""Oy neighbour"" is now a running joke between me and my missus.&&Nope, not at all. I'm in Australia too and probably at least half the times I go to the theatres, which is 1-3 times a week, there's disrespectful assholes there.&&I'm Brazilian and people are just more awful than some Americans report here. There was this time my friend and I were watching IT and some bitch pointed the cell phone flash at our eyes. I was never so enraged in a theater. Of course, we cursed her, but she didn't answer. There was also La La Land, in which some fucking teenagers kept talking during the songs. Those fuckers wouldn't shut up for a minute. There was also a guy in my Blade Runner 2049 who apparently thought he was in a Marvel movie, he was laughing for 30 seconds no stop at some innocent joke. So, it's not an American thing only. I'd even say Brazilians are worse at these things.&&When i saw Batman V Superman in France a little group of kids was speaking, yelling and using their phones from the beggining to end.At the end of the movie a dude had enough and yelled at them : ""Fermez vos gueules !!"" (Shut up in english) but they didn't stop so the he called a security guard and the security guard menaced them but they still didn't stop since it was the end of the movie. This is the worst movie theater experience i've ever had and i had a same one when a i went to see Jumanji 2.

Edit : And i don't live in a big city.&&As a Canadian I love the experience of going out to the theatre (aside from ticket prices). I go regularly and never run into these issues except for maybe the odd phone buzz, but never anything that's a reoccurring issue.

These people deserve to die, and they're not going to die unless *you* have the moral strength to kill them.&&Ugh that movie was awful for me. There was one empty seat next to me against the wall. There was a kid and his dad behind me and the kid was like maybe 6/7. His dad had bought him boat loads of candy so he was ripping into the packaging, spilling it on the floor, chewing with his mouth open, slurping, etc. it was disgusting. I have a sensory processing disorder too and I can not tune things out. It‚Äôs a real struggle for me. 

Eventually the kids own dad got so frustrated with him that he asked the kid to move seats and sit next to me instead of correcting his behavior!!! So halfway through the movie, I see a child‚Äôs foot dangle by my head as he climbed over the theatre seat and plopped down next to me. His face and hands were covered in some sticky looking blue substance. 

Apparently he forgot his snacks so he tried to climb UNDER the seat instead of just asking his dad. That didn‚Äôt work, so he climbed over the seat again, grabbed some candy, and promptly sent skittles flying across the floor which echoed as they rolled down the slanted flooring.

The next movie I saw was Black Panther. We sat next to a bunch of women in their mid 30‚Äôs to early 40‚Äôs. They laughed and cackled at EVERYTHING. They thought everything was a joke and was soooo funny. If there was a cheap laugh, they were practically snorting and rolling on the ground. They just thought everything in the movie was the funniest thing. Not making fun of it though, just genuine laughing. It was so bizarre. It‚Äôs like they had never heard a joke in their life and didn‚Äôt know what one was so they laughed over every other line. Then they would repeat it to themselves and each other as if everyone did not just hear the exact line from the speakers ten seconds before.&&Hey, sir, yes you with the rectangle of pure light, can you put it the fuck away?

During Red Sparrow someone received a goddamn phone call. He didn't pick up, but dude, where were you when the ""please turn off your cell phones"" message came up not once, but 3 FUCKING TIMES?

And got the finger in response. I was pretty mad on her behalf.&&I was at an Alamo watching 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri and this pair of couples in their 60s or 70s were talking nonstop. I complained and the staff went to tell them to stop. After the staff left, one of them asked loudly what that was about and the guy said (loudly) ‚Äúshe told me to stop talking! Can you believe that?! I paid to be here.‚Äù

They never did kick them out despite how big they talk about enforcing their policies. &&More...

Anyway, the guy behind my wife decided he could put his feet on my wife. The first time he did it, I put my arm around my wife on the back of her chair causing him to jerk them back. I was having a good time and decided to use my arm at on point to clap for the comic and then when I went to return my arm to the back of her chair he had put his feet there again in just those few moments.

Their commentary had a broad scope that included explaining plot details as they happened, questioning why everybody is singing, and that they liked Emma Stone's shoes. &&When I saw that movie, the theater was mostly empty, so my dad, brother, and I took the very back middle seats. (This theater was one where you select your seats when you buy the ticket.) As the trailers were running, what appeared to be an entire family of at least 10 people, all young adult-middle aged, walks in and all the way to where we were. One guy asked if we would scoot down a ways so that they could all fit on the same row. We unhappily obliged because we hate unnecessary confrontation. Throughout the film, some of them laughed/chuckled after many lines of dialogue that weren‚Äôt even funny. I was so confused.

1: Why do you feel the need to sit every single person in your huge party on the *same* row? It‚Äôs not like everyone will have the chance to talk to each other anyway.

2: Even if you wanted to talk to each other during the movie, you shouldn‚Äôt because that‚Äôs douchey.

3: You had to have reserved seats like everyone else, yet you still ask others to move in order to accomodate your party? That‚Äôs just an asshole move.

4: What is so funny about this movie‚Äôs dialogue (apart from the occasional cheese)?&&True, but they should already have the common sense to stay silent & well-behaved as soon as their bums hit those seats. People shouldn't have to be prepared for a confrontation at a movie theatre of all places.

Plus, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a majority that are more passive in situations like these but I also can't blame dudes like OP who aren't afraid to confront these douchewads because they deserve to be called out.  

More people getting called out will slowly discourage more and more disrespectful dickheads from being rude and ruining it for others.&&I mean RPO is literally the movie for this kind of people, it was made for that.&&stop my balls are already blue.&&A local theatre here in Berlin has special screenings for this purpose: They‚Äôre always on weekday mornings, and it‚Äôs understood that parents can bring their babies and are allowed to go outside for changing diapers, etc., should the need arise. For the same reason, they don‚Äôt dim the lights completely.

It‚Äôs a great idea, actually: Everyone who goes to these shows knows what to expect, stay-at-home parents don‚Äôt feel stuck at home or embarrassed for ruining other people‚Äôs movie experience, and the theatre makes some extra revenue in an otherwise unpopular time slot. &&Ugh what the hell is wrong with people?

I swear even Trower eyed them with a ""WTF?"" look. 

It almost ruined the concert for me because I couldn't get them out of my head. &&Manager fail. Your business should have been valued more than theirs. Honestly I use the metric of 20 to 1: if one person has spoken up, guaranteed 20 more people are just as pissed off&&That‚Äôs BS. Manager should have kicked their asses out.

Was it a theater chain? &&Yeah, now I wait weeks after the movie has been released, just before it's on its last legs and go late at night. So much better. &&Where do you live that parents pay attention to ratings?&&When I saw logan somebody brought their little kid and he kept making noise.... people don‚Äôt know how to leave their kids at home &&[Are you sure?](https://youtu.be/po8IPh64rVM)&&Fuck it I‚Äôll fight these idiots&&Maybe she was blind? &&I should have added the qualifier that it depends on the severity. I have straight up kicked people out with no warning. I've also given enough of a warning that people shut up entirely, and I've offended people into walking out just by warning them. So it depends on the scenario.

I try to empower my frontline staff into giving warnings but not in kicking people out. My experience with that is that patrons either get hostile with them (and they're not paid enough for someone to aggressively come at them) or they stand their ground and demand a manager anyway, which prolongs the nonsense.

Every theatre I have worked at has radios and we can respond pretty quick - within 5 minutes.

And the whole time they kept leaning over two seats to talk to each other and giggle about random shit in the movie.

The movie is pretty quiet and slow, so it was pretty noticeable. I kinda hit my limit when those two like flower deer things popped up and one of the dudes made like imaginary shooting sounds at the screen like he was hunting or something? I don't know.

I wanted to say something like what you said but all that came out was ""Can you guys please fucking stop? We're just trying to watch the movie man."" They were easily like ten years older than me but they did the same kind of red faced sullen silence the rest of the movie. Felt great. &&Can you guess that girl's name?&&This is one time when I actually do believe the people applauded.&&It's starting to happen at concerts with those sleeves.

It's truly the best of movie theater chains.&&> an usher should come in before the movie and say ""if you need to use your phone during the film, exit to the lobby. if you use your phone during the film, you will be removed.""

I wish they would, too, but I think a lot of them probably think they don't get paid enough to confront customers. However, I used to be a theater usher for a theme park (not movies, but people can still be annoying shits during live shows) and I had no problem using all the authority my stupid little plastic nametag allowed me. Those people weren't just spoiling everything for other customers, but they were making my day hell, too. And getting minimum wage to clean up puke, tell people to stop sitting in the damn stairwells and trying to keep morons from running onto the stage already had me in a bad mood daily. It was so satisfying to kick someone out who was being a jerk. &&Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, part of the Alamo Victory chain, WILL kick you out w/o a refund if other patrons complain about cell phone use or excessive talking during a film. They need only place an order card w/ their complaint out for their server and it is set in motion. Alamo is very upfront about it and serious. This policy is clearly stated on there website at purchase and in theater at the start of the movie. . . Bravo! I highly recommend the first rate movie experience at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema.

Funny thing is their always surprised when I say no. I got here first now piss off.

Edit: Assigned seating is a different story. I‚Äôm referring to open seating and ass hats that show up late to a movie theater and expect you to move.&&Oh man, a few weeks ago we went to The Greatest Showman and we had reserved seats. We like to sit in the first row of the upper deck so there is no one in front of us.  We select our seats, buy the tickets and head in. We get in there are there is a lady and her kids in our seats. I politely tell her she is in our seats and ask if she can move. She tells me that ""The theater won't fill up so we can just sit anywhere"" uh, no that's not how it works. So I ask her again, same response. So now I'm done being nice. I cut her off and tell her "" Are you going to move out of our seats or do I have to go get someone to move you"" She starts bitching about something so I just turn around and go get a manager. He comes in and checks our tickets and tells her she has to move. She gets up and is complaining about how her one daughter is in the bathroom and won't be able to find them now and then she goes ""My daughter worked her for 5 years and I CANNOT believe I'm being treated like this"" So I peak around the employee and say ""well if she worked her for 5 years she can explain to you how assigned seating works"" That really got her going and she wanders off to someones seat rambling on about how she doesn't want to sit next to a smart ass anyways. I really enjoyed that movie since I knew she was a few rows behind me just stewing mad the whole time&&Is it even good though? Or is the entire things a festival of ""Hey, you see that thing you like over there? Yeah, you must like this if that thing you like is in it.""

Honest question. Can't tell if I'd actually like it or if it's just a pandering palooza. &&The fancy little indie theater in my town does the same thing. Kind of funny because most of the time it's the opposite - you will definitely be kicked out if you disturb the show for anyone else. I think they do the family time to counter their image as a little bit stuffy and snooty (which isn't my opinion of them; I love the place and wish I still lived nearby).&&Visit The Prince Charles Cinema in London! Such a wonderful experience.&& People insist on bringing babies and young kids to all kinds of movies. I got so mad when we went to see Moana at a late afternoon showing, bracing myself for hordes of children, and the entire theater was empty. Next day we went to see some rated R scary movie at 10 pm and there were several families in the audience. Trashy as fuck. &&You'd be surprised. Somebody brought a baby to fucking Logan opening night at my theater, and they wouldnt even leave when the baby started crying, and it cried for an extended period atleast 3 times. &&Happens all the time. I had to start going to a different theater because the one I liked was a baby/toddler magnet. The last straw was going to watch the last Captain America, some 7 year old brat was chatting (really loudly. He was like 15 rows down and 10 seats to the left of me and I could hear him louder than the movie), literally non-stop. The person sitting my him went ""Shh!"". Nothing. After the 3rd time, the toddler's mother leans forward and go ""Stop it, he's just a kid!!!"".

And the theater staff wouldn't do a thing about it. In this area, if you have kids, you have all rights in the world.

So now I just go to a fancier, assigned seating theater and always get the more expensive showings, as parents seem less willing to bring kids when it costs 30 bucks a pop.&&Exactly, sometimes you can tell when asking someone to be quiet is going to become a legit confrontation and that sucks. 

When I went to see The Revenant with a friend it was almost at the end of its run and it was just us and one other couple in the theater (who of course had to sit right behind us). They were maybe seniors in high school, smelled like alcohol, and talked about how bored they were through a solid third of the movie before my friend turned around and asked them to be quiet or leave. 

To which the guy responded with a bunch of vague ""u wanna go??"" type threats and rants about how no one can tell him what to do and we need to stop ""getting in his face"". Like 2 mins later he moved to the seat behind me and started kicking my chair, smh. The Revenant is SUCH a boring movie if you're not into it, why would you even pay money for it? Dumb. &&At that point, the problem is not *just* an asshole, it's also an incredibly poorly run theater. She should have been escorted out. We need more theaters like the Alamo Drafthouse. &&Commercial time = do whatever you want, fuck the theatre for 15 mins of ads. Previews = whisper, cause some people like the previews.

When I told him to shut it off he said; ‚Äúyou worried you won‚Äôt understand what they are saying?‚Äù &&Woops, sorry about the soda there. 
 &&Someone took their toddler to Goblet of Fire. That poor child was bawling in terror, and the dad just shushed and kept watching. I was like...dude...did you even check to see if this was appropriate for your kid? It‚Äôs not like the films got less intense.&&Some lady next to me answered her phone once and started to have a conversation so I just turned to her and told her to hang up her fucking phone and have some class.  She got super offended that I said have some class and started screaming, ""I have class.  I have more class than you, motherfucker.""  It was pretty hilarious and she ended up getting booted along with her husband.  Feel bad for him because he just looked embarrassed from start to finish.&&I've seen people that just have their phones ring in their pocket while talking. They don't even do anything about it. I want to punch them. &&Yea, leaving it on vibrate for too long has me checking constantly because of phantom vibration. Just gotta have the ringer on when I'm expecting a call. 

Edit: Okay, *obviously* I turn my phone all the way off for movies. This is in response to why anyone would *ever* have a ringer on their phone.&&It was pretty nasty. Small show, no mics or anything either&&I‚Äôm from a rough area and that‚Äôs the standard kind of response to being asked to quiet down.  I‚Äôve seen someone respond ‚Äúmind your own fucking business‚Äù, someone else stand up and push the person who asked them to be quiet, and someone else get into a back and forth argument of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not turning off my fucking phone‚Äù until the girl on her phone threw a full soda at the guy complaining and then swung at him.  I got drenched in the soda debacle.  People are so fucking selfish and crazy nowadays.&&People have been killed for asking others to be quiet. 

&&Utter bastard&&The worst part is that I have to interrupt my experience, not only from their talking, but to get up and find a staff member. So now I'm losing 5-10 minutes of the movie that I paid to see. So if it escalates to that point for me, I demand a ticket to a different showing instead. I'm not missing the Shymalamadingdong moment because of someone else running their mouths. &&In these situations, I get nasty. If its bad enough, I'll track down the theater manager and attempt to get them to speak to the unruly patrons. If they refuse, I just demand a refund and leave. I'm not wasting money on a subpar experience. 9 times outta 10 the patrons are threatened to get the boot if they dont stfu. I loathe being that guy, but I *will* be that guy when the situation calls for it. Fortunately, where I live, the theater patrons both for film and plays are pretty quiet and respectful so this doesnt happen often. &&Stand up in front of him and watch him complain.&&I did. And a third. &&I, too, am with you. We need more people to speak up about this. I've been to too many movies (and recently, broadway shows) where my fellow surrounding quiet and courteous patrons stand by while their show gets ruined by someone who talks throughout a very non-social event. Is it really necessary to go to a movie and talk through it? Aren't you missing out on the experience yourself? Why pay 12+$ to talk in a dark theater with a loud movie in the background where you can go elsewhere and talk for free?

The real problem is that these venues don't do crap about it. I go to the lobby and tell someone, they have an usher walk in, stand there, and leave without even confronting the person. Allowing them to continue disruption. This happens at 4/5 theaters near me. I have to ruin my own experience further by leaving during a movie I paid for to have them do nothing. I've also been told if I were to say something to the person causing disruption, I too would be kicked out with them. Going to start doing this so at least they get kicked out.&&A guy took out his phone during a showing of A Wrinkle In Time and someone from two rows back yelled ""PHONES OFF!"". The guy immediately put the phone back in his pocket. I learned that day that public shaming usually works on these yahoos. &&My sister has it because she has a hearing loss. Otherwise, I find it excessive.&&My sister does and my God I want to strangle her when it goes off just at home.

It's never gone off at a movie that I know of.&&Saw Black Panther opening weekend and there were two girls in my row who wouldn't shut up. 

I finally lean over ""hey. Shut the fuck up"" and i was half expecting like a scoff or some shit and for them to continue talking. Instead they just kinda got..red in the face and shut up. I felt so powerful. 

Later on I was waiting for my friend to leave the bathroom and the girls leave right before she does\(from the bathroom\) see me, and glance at each other and walk away kinda hurriedly, like I was gonna get them in trouble or some shit. My friend came out and im like ""they were talking about me weren't they?"" ""Yeaa, they said they understood your point but you could have been nicer about it"" 

And it reminded me of when I was younger, and me and my friends would be dicks at movie theaters and someone would tell us to shut the fuck up. and I would do the same thing, I'd get flustered, feel like that person was going to get me in trouble. That unknowingly irrational fear, since as long as you shut up the adult telling you to shut the fuck up doesn't care about you. &&We had about 5/6 19-20 year old looking guys next to us a few weeks ago who weren't talking, but they were all huffing those e-cigarettes with extremely pungent flavors I can only imagine were called ""blatantly artificial strawberry"" and ""sickly sweet mango.""

My wife and I were both getting very nauseated because it was like having a humidifier that spewed out Bath and Bodyworks soap scents right at you.

We were at the top so of course it was all hazy up there which made it worse.

""Oh it's not a real cigarette so it's cool to fill everyone's space with clouds of nicotine and god knows what else.""&&Her name was Albert Einstein.&&But why? If they applauded that would just interrupt the movie even more&&Or somebody over the age of 16 working there, at least.&&God bless Alamo Drafthouse. &&i love this idea&&I started going to the VIP movie theatres in my city. It costs about double, but the whole experience is loads better; it's 19+ (alcohol is served), seats are significantly bigger which recline as well with much more legroom in front, you get all sorts of meals and drinks brought to you (poutine, coffee, chicken, etc), you get a swivel tray to store all your food/snacks and there's quite a bit of buffer space between you and the person next to you.

But the biggest bonus is that it's 19+... so no kids and everyone who's there has gone in with more or less the same intention as everyone else; escape from annoying idiots... at a price. I've NEVER seen any kind of stupid behaviour in the VIP theatres.&&some of them can. 

at Black Panther a teenage girl in front of me was on her phone. i leaned forward and said pretty loudly, ""Cool phone. What kind is it?""

She said, ""...the Six..."" and then she realized I was punking her. She never pulled the phone out again.&&Or a young comedian named Jerry Seinfeld?&&Holy shit.. I had completely forgotten about that. No lie, on my mom's grave, this family member sounds exactly like that chick. With the annoying vocal fry and everything. &&Man I miss /r/Scrubs&&Wow&&[deleted]&&And I salute him. &&""Look, I have a terminal case of clap.  This is the last movie I'll ever see. Please stfu.""&&Pulling the long con. I bet they have a group chat and everything. They switch up who gets to be the stfu guy every week.&&Shit like that is appropriate for the scene. I still can't believe that people were mad that it had 10 seconds of silence for dramatic effect. And it was beautiful. &&We got an ‚Äúoh no she didn‚Äôt!‚Äù &&We had to kick 15 year olds in the back of their heads for giving a finger to an old dude after he asked them to be quiet. Old dude thanked us, they got quiet&&How are people getting away with stunts like that? That's no different than hand-camming the movie. &&Moviepassable. I enjoy that term. Very apt. &&Think he told that story later? Like  
""There was this total perv at the movie theatre. He started stroking my leg!""  
""Oh my goodness! Was he sitting next to you?""  
""No he was in the row in front of me""  
""Well...did he like...reach back?""  
""No I had my feet up on the chair.""  
""Wait...Like...Next to his head?""&&Nice. If I ever have feet next to my head again I'll have to remember to do this.&&‚ÄúThis guys foot is really turning me on. I‚Äôm fully erect. Should I take it out?‚Äù&&I remember that lady. She was a ho. Fo' sho'.&&I like this&&Yeah, it blows my mind that we come on here and can read dozens of different stories that beggar belief each day, but the moment that someone volunteers an anecdote that's even slightly different from some basement-dwellers lived experience they're calling bullshit.&&""I don't understand why there's so much fighting in this superhero movie!""&&I‚Äôve had people get huffy when I asked them to move from our ASSIGNED seats that I‚Äôd chosen almost a month earlier. It was for a 70mm IMAX showing of Interstellar, so I chose those seats very specifically to get the best view.

The seats are printed on the damn ticket.&&If I select the seats I want ahead of time, and then find you in my seats, I'm asking you to move. I'm not sitting in the front row or off to the side when I reserved seats in the middle of the theater. When I saw Annihilation there were people in the seats I had reserved, and they got upset when I asked them to move. That is rude-- trying to sit where you reserved is not.&&I dont mind filling in from the edges, but when I have a primo center seat, I don't wanna move.&&It's a pretty fine movie. I've heard people say it as a 7/10 film with 10/10 moments. It won't change the cinema world any time soon, but if you like video games and most forms of pop culture from different eras it's a good time. Last like 10 or 15 minutes is a bit sub-par. I'd watch it again for the visuals and action, not so much the story.

I'd say if you want more story read the book, but it's still not a great book. A fun read though, and it's very different from the movie, for better and worse.&&In my experience, I'm less likely to hear a lot of crying and talking kids during a children's movie. Guess the movie keeps their attention better and is less likely to scare or upset them. Only really bad experience with a kid's movie was Inside Out, there was this kid who was talking the entire time. Like, literally, he was never silent for more than 10 or 15 seconds at a time. I know it's a kid movie and all, but that's basic etiquette, and he was old enough to know better, ya know? Even other kids don't want to put up with that. I hated going to the movies with my little sister when we were young cause she would constantly ask questions, ha ha.

Meanwhile, with PG-13 and R movies, kids are more likely to get bored or scared, and that's when the noise happens.&&[deleted]&&You were the entertainment, not the movie. Some people get off on ruining it for others, and if someone goes through the trouble to sit closer to you, to kick your chair so you can't enjoy the movie, then that's clearly someone who takes pleasure in others misery. &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Yeah, none of the theaters around here actually have any staff in as the movie is showing, so if someone is making a scene, you have to go out, flag someone, tell them the situation, and by the time they come and check, the problem will most likely be over. So you missed a few minutes of the movie for absolutely nothing.&&I will always remember when i was at the midnight showing of episode 7, as soon as the lucas film logo showed on screen a guy in the back yelled ""yall better shut your damn phones or ill shove it up your ass""... Wish that guy was at every movie i go.&&I think I just found religion. I‚Äôll follow you to any theater. &&I clap because finally the proper authorities have arrived to dispense justice.&&I'd watch that movie&&> Yeah?

Daniel this is Patrick. I need help knowing if someone is saying words or random sounds to me again. What about ""luminescence""?

Gotcha. This next one.. ""Jamboree""

God damn it. What about ""Nautical""? That has to be nonsense for sure.

I'm just going to stop now. This person has obviously been saying real words to me. I think I can still save this date.

Take it sleazy Maniel. You my dawg.

Other are getting off on doing something disruptive and feeling like people are too afraid to confront them. They take it as an affirmation or demonstration of personal power over everyone else. Point being, they are intensely aware of how others are feeling, but they evaluate it as a positive and not a negative.&&It does. They want someone to speak up. In their head, ""I fucken dare someone to fucken say somethin about my fucken phone! I fucken *dare* them.""&&I think he had that one in the chamber ready to go. Seems a little too clever for a cinema talker to come up with on the spot, especially mid-conversation. Part of me thinks he knew he'd be getting a call.&&Hilarious dick, but a dick nonetheless. &&And my axe.  
  
No, seriously, and my axe.&&This was my experience when I went to see Logan opening night. There were 8 year olds with their parents *everywhere*, and they all talked the entire time, including the parents, and all laughed at the most inappropriate times, and *then* to top it all off, somebody in the theater had brought their fucking baby, which cried 3 or 4 times, *and the person didnt even take the kid out of the theater while it was crying*. I ended up emailing corporate and getting 2 free movie passes. I had a bad experience when I saw The Last Jedi too, but that was mostly highschool age kids talking. I had to tell them to shut up a few times. If you go to the movies, you should shut up and watch the movie, I didnt go so that I could hear you talk, or hear your baby cry. 

edit: here to hear&&**HARRYDIDYOUPUTYOURNAMEINTHAGOBLETOFFIYA**&&Dude, some assbutt took their toddler to Deadpool opening weekend. Right after that scene where he is literally staked to the ground, while the building burns around him, it cuts to black and you could hear this kid who was very near to tears ask his shitty parent if Deadpool was okay. &&Oh man you just reminded me of a supervisor/manager I had when I did inventory. 

He was this 50-something year old dude. His ringtone was Disturbed‚Äôs ‚ÄúDown with the Sickness‚Äù. 

Now I don‚Äôt mind the song but when we would be working a Kohl‚Äôs and be in the kids department counting the clothes and out of nowhere you‚Äôd hear the ‚ÄúOoh-Wah-ah-ah-ah‚Äù then just the hook over and over again for like 3 minutes straight. And he would just ignore it. 

Lol it was really awkward and annoying to deal with. &&Please tell me the assholes were denied their seats after Intermission? If I was on stage and had some assholes like that in the audience, I'd make sure they were escorted out by the Assistant Stage Manager in between scene.

As a theatre actor, that's just fucking despicable of those dudes, and I can't believe there are actually theatre artists out there who support rude behavior like this. I'm sorry it happened: I find it unconscionable.&&Damn. This is why I hesitate to see any movie. I go to Drafthouse but I always wonder if they'd actually enforce their rules.

You should have asked for a refund.&&>and recently, broadway shows

WTF. Are people really paying $100+ to talk and dick around on their phones?&&Alamo Drafthouse.. we need more of them.&&>  I've also been told if I were to say something to the person causing disruption, I too would be kicked out with them. Going to start doing this so at least they get kicked out.

A social suicide bomb.  You'd be a martyr, and remembered as a hero.&&Meh, only reason they said you can be nicer about it is because they were embarrassed and by putting ""s/he was a dick"" on you it takes some of the focus off of them in their minds. If you're talking or on your phone in a movie theater in the first place you're past the point of deserving niceties from someone. Unless they've literally never been to a movie before that stuff is super basic etiquette and they're fully aware they're in the wrong, they just don't care.&&Don't worry bro it's nicotine free, so you just get to inhale artificial flavorings!

Man, vaping is a great tool to quit smoking. It's how I quit, then I quit vaping. But these fucking tools are making it look so fucking bad.&&Her name was Robert Paulsen. &&For that they would need to pay more than 7 dollars an hour. &&I actually think teenagers are naturally much more susceptible to shame.  Plus they're in that limbo area where adults still have some amount of authority, even if they resent it.&&some of them indeed can. I think in some cases they truly don't notice what they're doing and really need that clue by four. like the girl in your story. &&Next time she says it, just imagine her saying ""that's so *money*""&&Wowen Wilson.&&...for steamed hams?&&""Shut the fuck up already.""&&HOW CAN SHE CLAP&&It was the best shot in the whole movie. &&I would have just reported him to management. Theaters really really dislike it when people do that. He‚Äôd likely get a lifetime ban.&&People hate confrontation. I don't know how people ignore bad manners at a movie though. I'll tell people to be quiet and it almost always works. If not, bug an employee to remove culprit. I've only had this problem like 10 times out of years of regular theater trips though. I live in a decent area of the country.


The worst git I ever met was Facebooking at 100% brightness and TAKING PICTURES OF THE FUCKING MOVIE WITH *THE FLASH ON* over and over. Fast and the Furious movies don't attract the best of us I figure.&&He'll probably change the story to make like he's the victim, ""I was just sitting there normally watching the movie, and this guy sitting in front of me turned around and tried to touch my leg!""&&This guys foot is really turning me on. I'm fully erect. Should I stop before I jizz all over his feet?

If that doesn't work, jizz on his feet. &&So damn jealous that I never got to see that in IMAX&&Yes reserved seating absolutely. &&Do they not comprehend the meaning of ""reserved""??&&The person they were replying to (Coaltrain) was being asked to move out of their own reserved seat to accommodate the people who did not reserve them, though.&&See I thought they did a much better job story-wise in the movie than in the book. Much less ""Wade rambles about his encyclopedic 80's knowledge to solve stupid puzzles,"" and more focus on the literal life-and-death stakes war for economic control of the planet. Plus slightly more emphasis on the actual moral of the story that gets stuffed in at the end of both. &&Yeah after the seat kicking we did. Dude told us ""he'd fight us"" if he ever saw us again on the way out...ok man have a good night&&Plus it's usually like a 16-17 year old kid working, and as an adult it feels odd having to go out and ask this kid to make another adult shut up. &&r/EmpireDidNothingWrong&&Only if it‚Äôs done Rashamon style like that. OP‚Äôs annoyed point of view where he ultimately kills what appears to be some annoying black guy. Then the Doctors point of view where we, as the audience, find out we‚Äôre all racists. In the end our man/woman who was supposed to receive the transplant slowly dies wondering why her doctor would forsake her as the last thing she hears is the heat monitor beep... beep... beeeeereeeeeeeeeeeep. &&That's why I advocate bringing a selfie stick to knock their phones out of their hands from a distance. &&This is correct.  It is the sociological explanation of where assholes come from and how they function.&&Yes, this is why instead of being passive agressive, you should just be aggressive aggressive with those sorts.  It's the only way to stop them.  Or you might end up with an opportunity to punch them in the face, which is also good.&&Jerk store&&WE CAN TUNE HIM OUT SO YOU SHOULD TOO

So fucking rage inducing.&&When I went to see Ant-Man, there was some bratty 5-year old girl who wouldn't stop whining about wanting to see Batman V Superman (a trailer for that movie was shown before Ant-Man, if I recall). The theater was pretty empty as well, so it's not like this was a noisy packed theater where that kind of stuff is expected to happen.

That's pretty much the only bad theater experience I've had, but it was awful. I missed a lot dialogue during several scenes because she was running around the theater making a ruckus while the father was trying to catch the brat and calm her down, lol.&&Had a crying baby in a showing a few months back. When confronted by someone afterwards they pulled the ""we paid for our tickets just like you did!"" bullshit. Oh, my bad, wasn't aware your ticket has the ""and you're allowed to ruin the movie for everyone else"" perk on it. Cool, no, my bad.

Involuntary assisted euthanasia. That's what solves this.&&When our oldest was an infant, my wife wanted to watch a movie AND bring him along. Wtf right? Didn't happen. If she had it her way, we would be bringing babies to the movies and naming them Bryson, Braxston, Haiden, Okayden, etc.&&I agree with this article that it happens all the time now. I can‚Äôt remember what movie it was. A couple who sat behind me brought their son who was about 8 or 9 to a movie not meant for someone that age. The kid spent the whole movie asking his parents to explain what happened on every scene and the parents obliged. Needless to say they talked throughout the whole movie. &&Said Dumbeldor camly&&In fairness I complained to the manager afterward and she gave me two free passes. She said they tried to catch them so they could throw them out but never caught them. I had a hard time believing they tried, because they talked nonstop through the whole thing. They never went more than 5 minutes of silence between full volume conversations. &&Short story version is, my fiance and I went to a show of The Lion King. A trashed late 40's woman comes in after fighting with her SO. about 90% through the first act they sit down and continue to talk, point, laugh, lean super far forward (we were in the row right up against the balcony). Me and all 8 people around her were obviously pissed. I reported her to an usher, the usher radio'd security, security told her to get up and she said ""I am not the one talking"" then continued to watch the show while security did nothing. She physically kicked my leg in an attempt to trip me as I was walking back to my seat (which the usher afterwards told me she witnessed). Yet the venue didn't do anything. Over an hour of the venue staff WATCHING her be an overall drunk nuisance to everyone around her and nothing. The venue even listened to her end of the story where she proclaimed to be the victim of my harassment. Still waiting on the guest services team to give me tickets to another show of my choosing. $100+ per seat...&&Yeah, that's how my wife quit smoking as well. I'm thankful they became a thing, but also she wasn't going into enclosed public places with one of those giant car battery-powered e-cigs that billows out smoke like a broken radiator.&&Which is equal to one child size drink at the theater. &&""I was sitting there, reading my Bible, minding my own business... when this SICKO just started jerking me off!""&&They had an Unlimited pass for like $30, so I saw it at least 4-5 times in 70mm at the massive IMAX screen in New York.

I have it on Blu-Ray but I‚Äôve never watched it because I feel like it just won‚Äôt be the same and I don‚Äôt want to ruin it.&&They tried to tell me that nobody pays attention to seat reservations and that you just pick something and then sit wherever you want.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3751  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/69709)&&Peace&&I read about a theater that has an employee watching from the projection booth. They were armed with a laser pointer and would aim it on the phone as soon as someone lit it up. They‚Äôd look around and put it away immediately. I love that idea.&&Any particular reason it's a selfie stick over any other rod-shaped item? Fishing pole, staff, walking stick, broom, etc.?&&That is only one form of asshole. There are many kinds. 

There will never be a unified asshole theory. &&tl;dr It's dominance behavior, just like fully half the shit depicted on r/roadcam videos.&&At least the father was trying to catch the brat. This horrible woman YELLED for her kid and continued to play on her phone while YELLING for her kid. Meanwhile Daddy was just watching the movie not doing a thing to help. Worst part was my sister and I picked as late of a date as possible so we could AVOID those kind of people. I swear people like them are absolute scum. &&Sometimes you gotta take matters into your own hands and scream in their faces, ""SHUT THE FUCK UP! YOU'RE DISTURBING EVERY ONE! WE CAN'T HEAR A GODDAMN WORD OF THE MOVIE OVER YOUR CONSTANT JABBERING!""

People seriously need to start taking matters into their own hands and keep rude mother fuckers in check. If we all stay silent, then we all lose together. We need to stand up and shame these people straight outta public.&&I went to see Les Mis on Broadway during the 2015-2016 winter run. The cast was amazing, and even though we paid the student price, our seats were quite decent. My now-fiancee and I drove up from Virginia to do this. I spent my entire tax refund on the trip. 

The girl next to me began texting about 2/3 of the way through the first act. I waited a moment to make sure she wasn't just checking the time and to psych myself up for it, and then leaned in as close as possible without touching her. In a low, deep, commanding voice I said, ""Put your phone away... Right. Now.""

She did, but I was so amped up from the confrontation it was hard to enjoy the rest of the show. Bonus, at intermission she said to her friend in a voice loud enough for me to hear, ""I guess some people take this sort of thing like, *really seriously*.""

People are dickheads. Can't even go out in public anymore without people using phones inappropriately.&&I work in a theatre that gets all the west end shows on tour in and I am flabbergasted that no one didn‚Äôt anything. We have a super strict policy on people disrupting. Anyone using their phone gets the torch shone on them until they turn it off and we report it to our supervisors. People talking are reported to supervisors and anyone being disruptive is kicked out without refund. What could the theatre even be thinking at that point because now they‚Äôve got to refund or comp 8 sets of tickets instead of just kicking one person out who isn‚Äôt worth the business she‚Äôd be giving &&Yeah definitely. Keep it out of other peoples' faces. If you're in a public place, vape outside like you're smoking a cigarette, unless it's a location that caters to it.

I know it's not smoke, I know it's not quite as harmful as second hand smoke (as far as we know), but it's still annoying as hell.

What these people who are annoyingly vaping don't understand is that there are SERIOUS efforts (by tobacco companies, mostly) to get vaping taxed and restricted exactly like cigarettes, so it's not as appealing an alternative to tobacco smokers. By being a public nuisance, you're only going to give these assholes public support and make it easier for them to pass laws making vaping as expensive as smoking cigarettes (which is much more harmful).&&Or the price of a smuggled, 4 oz old fashioned&&we‚Äôd like to think the world works this way&&Taking a fishing rod into a movie theater gets you some weird looks, and taking a broom just makes everyone think you're the janitor.&&[deleted]&&I agree. It‚Äôs social programming (for normal people) to be quiet & maybe rush a whispered chastisement. 

I had to growl twice last year in the cinema- stood up & very loudly told the respective selfish cunts to shut their fucking mouth or I‚Äôd drag them out the theatre & make them buy me another ticket.

The thing is- everyone else in the cinema was aware of their actions & were undoubtedly as pissed off as I was at the shouting & talking but we‚Äôre pre-programmed to be polite. (Mostly)

On a lighter note one of my pals years ago was fed up with some heavy breather/ gasper sat behind & across the aisle from him so got out his seat to rip into him, only to find that the guy had an oxygen mask on with some breathing contraption sat on the next seat keeping him alive. 

&&Sadly, there are plenty of assholes on the planet doing just fine. &&But no one would suspect the janitor. Heck, if you play your cards right you might even get in free.&&I usually go straight to shut the fuck up because it's the only one that works. &&",2018-03-31 06:27:12

lol this was deliberate&&Best possible release date&&The track record for ""comedy sequels 10+ years after the original"" is not good.  Nevertheless, I'll be watching this.&&There is either two ways it can go. It can be AMAZING because they have been sitting on an decent idea for a squeal and over the years have been adding some jokes/scenes they thought up over time to the script. Or its a blatant cash in riding the success of the old movie and milking peoples nostalgia for easy money. I'd give it a 60/40 chance. &&It's absolutely going to suck. But who cares. The first one was a masterpiece and they deserve my 10$&&I agree, going into this with no expectations. Just like ST1.&&They‚Äôve gone through so many stories and ideas over the years that they must have landed on something good.

I hope the duration of time has allowed the rumination of ideas to produce a new ""debut"" movie years later.

Perhaps I have rose-tinted glasses on, but I'm hopeful.

For the most part these dudes do good stuff and they will get my (MoviePass) dollars. Looking forward to it. üëç&&>  over the years have been adding some jokes/scenes they thought up over time to the script.

That's problematic, I don't remember where and when I read/watch that, but there was a screenwriter describing that re-writes are the worst offender of humour-killer in movies.

Basically what happens is that a joke might be funny, but by the time you're at your 4th rewrite of small details, you might start to think that maybe the joke isn't that funny after all, it starts losing its novelty. 

So time is a joke killer for comedies. &&That's how I feel. And they already got my 10 bucks. I helped crowdfund it.&&The jokes in the trailer felt kind of stale. I'm thinking there's not going to be much to it. &&Dividing the day by the month to equal five?&&stimulating your prostate with a toothbrush handle?&&Going to the theater, then watching Death House on Netflix?&&I thought it was good...

What were your concerns?&&Wait what? The trailer actually looked pretty good. They hardly did any cheap call-backs to the first movie and a lot of the comedy was solid.&&The trailers for the original were terrible, so that might not be a bad sign. &&That full trailer looked incredible, not sure what you didn't find promising about it.

It made me wish I had just rewatched Anchorman instead though &&I don't understand why we've settled on Anchorman 2 as being a good example when we live in a world were Dumb and Dumber To exists. &&Don‚Äôt think so at all. From what they‚Äôve been talking about on their podcast & the trailers this movies gonna kill. They said they worked really hard on not making it ‚Äúone of those‚Äù sequels. A few call back jokes but staying true to their Broken Lizard ways. &&I honestly forgot they even made anchorman 2&&[deleted]&&Or worse... Joe Dirt 2. *shudders* &&The Blue Mountain State movie was crowd sourced and pretty meh.  That may be because they hadn't done a movie before but if they just made a 3 part episode of BMS it would've been better.&&They haven't made anything bad in my opinion.  &&This is an excellent point I haven't considered.&&That is PRECISELY why it‚Äôs more likely to be a gas.  The Lizards are an independent comedy troupe.  Beholden to none. The only question is whether or not they can still bring game.  And I‚Äôm pretty damn sure they can. 

‚ÄúThe lice hate powdered sugar.‚Äù&&Joe Dirt never needed a sequel, though. Everything that made the movie work was very encapsulated within the movie. He literally got everything he ever wanted in the end. He got the girl, he got the family he always wanted.

Dumb and Dumber Too had the same problem, though. They tried too hard to tie it to the original. From the very beginning, the prank Lloyd played on Harry was just stupid and not within the character.

Yeah, it's cool to do a few callbacks to the original, but ultimately, they need it to be it's own  movie.

As for ST2... I just hope the whole ""fish out of water"" plot works. I am scared that it won't. &&I agree. &&I disliked the weird side plot of Anchorman 2 where he got injured and moved to a lighthouse.

Otherwise honestly the movie was solid. The ""Jack Lame"" thing, the cringe-y awkwardness of dinner with the black family, the commentary on Ted Turner & the 24-hour news cycle & the stupidity of popular news, and the [completely fantastic much-bigger fight scence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY5Ug1OW5O4) were all really great.

Plus I don't think they gave too many callbacks to the original.

I don't know why Anchorman 2 gets the hate that Zoolander 2 does, frankly. &&Yes, I Agree.&&Love Bob Saget in that movie though Lmao &&Or even Twolander. As bad as the movie I almost think I'd like it better.

not as subtle&&I like it much more than the other one.&&I remember reading somewhere that Super Troopers was going to be adapted into a TV show after the success of the movie. For whatever reason, something happened in the process and it just became Reno 911. If that‚Äôs correct, it would certainly make sense that you‚Äôd catch those vibes. 

Edit: Yes. I‚Äôm familiar with both The State and Broken Lizard. I also found this page from Jays book where he literally talks about how they wrote a pilot for a Super Troopers TV Show set in Reno that fell through before Reno 911. And then comments on how many similarities they took from Super Troopers and how odd it was.

I love the man to pieces and love Garden State but Wish You Were Here was just bad.

Being fair, I relate to garden state through my mental health and life issues. It's a movie which whilst watching I realised issues I've been facing. Wish You Were Here is very midlife crisis based so in a few years I should watch it and see if I relate again.&&As someone who kicked in $50 for this, either you‚Äôre welcome - or forget I had anything to do with this.

You're stating it really confidently so I'm inclined to believe you with no evidence...&&They‚Äôre working on a tv show right now... &&Whelp, that didn't take long for us to get from Super Trooper 2 to Hitler.&&Movies that do this are the worst, ‚Äúoh this was funny in the first one let‚Äôs do it again but more over the top for every joke‚Äù. Fuck off, write some new jokes.&&I genuinely don't understand fan service. It has always felt super cheap to me, whether in comedy or elsewhere. How hard is it to treat movie number two like episode number two? When you watch a TV series, they're not cracking the same jokes and riding the same story arc as the previous episode. Sigh.&&They did rehash the ""right meow"" joke in the trailer.&&Yeah, the trailer definitely instilled some confidence in the film for me.&&Me! Me! Me!&&Bear.. bear-fucker!&&They've been working on it even longer than that. They mentioned it at a show I saw back in 2012.

Especially with all the positive marijuana news lately and you know, 4/20.&&This is true, this movie has been ‚Äúin the can‚Äù since before summer of last year according to an interview with Steve Lemme that a podcast did with him. The studio felt it would be better that it got released on 4.20, they could have released last summer. Here‚Äôs the full podcast if you want to check it out:

&&As in First Day of Camp? I guess that's kinda a sequel... It was fantastic, though. 

Couldn't finish the reunion season though. &&I think WHAS could get away with it, tbh. The show laughed at itself and made fun of things like the cast being old af despite playing 17 year olds. And, the humor was always farce comedy. They could go extreme with the story and we'd accept it.

Now, take Anchorman 2. I enjoyed it but the movie was pretty much taking all of the best moments from the first movie and taking them to the extreme which doesn't work as well because the first movie was pretty grounded. Same with Zoolander. Same with Super Troopers. All fairly grounded comedies.&&Yes, but Kevin Smith is an outlier in all respects.&&to this day whenever I get bored/depressed I can just ask myself one simple question: ""Why do they call you cock knocker?""

I hope Kevin at least one day releases the script he had. &&Clerks 2 was meh&&I‚Äôm cool with it&&That wasn‚Äôt 10 years after 21 though.&&It was but it wasn‚Äôt made 10+ years after the first one which is what they‚Äôre talking about. &&Dumb & Dumber Too, Son of The Mask, Anchorman 2, Zoolander 2, Blues Brothers 2000, Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser.

Though it wasn't 10+ years after the original, 5+ years and it was awful. &&Personally, I think the trailer looks pretttty decent.&&That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt get. The first is a well known cult movie and is guaranteed to make money as long as it‚Äôs decent and they were able to fund Beer Fest (which is a great movie). Jay talks about how tough it is to get funding in his book but they‚Äôre a known quantity. I don‚Äôt get how it had to be crowdfunded to only raise $2million. Was it a marketing gimmick?&&[deleted]&&Nice.&&>Dividing the day by the month to equal five?

One one of those little 5 dollar oral b vibrating brushes... üëåüòÇ&&Brushing your little sister's teeth *sensually*?&&Not OP, but I thought the funny parts in the trailer we're just extra air sped up through my nose funny and I remember laughing my dicks off during the first movie.

EDIT: I honestly couldn't remember the trailer for the [first one](https://youtu.be/iD2NQ5dZ0So) so I watched it and it also wasn't the best. This actually gives me more hope.

EDIT #2: Yes, plural. They grow back.&&They said there won't be a lot of call backs. Let's hope they keep their word. The trailer isn't the whole movie.&&I can't remember the trailers at all.

The only thing I recall from the sequel is ‚ÄúChicken of the Cave‚Äù. That scene got me pretty good though

 &&Blue mountain state after season 1 became pretty meh though&&Have you seen their first film Puddle Cruiser? 

It wasn‚Äôt great. &&I love Club Dread...&&I know I‚Äôm an outlier for broken lizard fans but Beerfest did nothing for me. I don‚Äôt think I laughed once. Dunno why, as I really like the premise.&&I think people had too high of expectations for dumb and dumber too.

They could just do surprise Broken Lizard movies like they did with that Cloverfield film. It'd be enough to get people to sub for a month.&&Us too! I finally bought it in DVD from Amazon. &&For us it was Club Dread. I think that movie played in the house for an entire semester whenever we were smoking and drinking. &&Meat drapes.. Meat drapes, how come it don't sound like that when I say it&&He was hilarious. RIP&&It's no secret that they've had issues funding past projects.  They've also produced ""slow burner"" movies, and while making a cult classic is good studios want a quick return on investment.  They've staked a lot of their professional (the studios) and personal (the faith that their fans have in them) reputation on the line here.

If they fail to make a good movie, they're fucked.  If they can't make a quick return on investment (after directly rallying fans), they're equally fucked because studios want their money now, not when a new generation of stoner kids discovers your DVD.

They've put a lot on the line to prove that they can do this.&&Yet somehow we got 4 Hangover movies?

Edit: only 3.  Never saw after the first so wouldn't know&&Especially because most of the sequels are to cult classics and most fans have seen them multiple times at least.

And same; I still have 3 episodes left of season 2.  It‚Äôs just not good.&&Isn‚Äôt the first day of camp a prequel? &&...you think Anchorman and Zoolander were grounded comedies?

I feel like I was so hyped about Anchorman 2 and Zoolander 2 because the trailers were so funny.

Anchorman 2... cringe.&&I shan't argue.
&&It's gonna be funny, no doubt about it. But we'll see how good it is.&&I agree with this. 

By the standards of late comedy sequels, Anchorman 2 wasn‚Äôt all that bad. The original was a very high bar and very consistent. 

Its biggest problem, like most of its ilk, is how many gags depend on having seen the first one. 

Anchorman 2 did have some great moments, and they did a great job with redoing the news channel battle royale gag though. 

Anchorman 2 reminds me a lot of Airplane 2. &&Thad Castle is one of my favorite characters of all time!&&I really need a rewatch tbh.

I just feel the jokes got stale. I do enjoy the ensemble a lot but it was very repetitive.

He‚Äôs a giant dickhead. And a funny one at that.&&Well, that's just my observation. Anchorman and Zoolander are similar in their levels of absurdity but not at the level of WHAS. So, when people are saying, ""WHAS had a successful sequel/prequel adaption"", I say it's because it remained at the same level of absurdity as the movie. Whereas, Anchorman 2 and Zoolander 2 surpassed their first movie absurdity levels.&&Time is fucking weird, right?&&The first movie was pretty Great.

I've never had the desire to rewatch&&Why would they share it? Its a personalized video.&&Well, also it tends to be a very polarizing form of selection bias in the first place. Most people who saw a movie and either liked or disliked it will post about it on Facebook, maybe rate it on IMDB at best.

Academy Award-Winning Composer and Conductor John Williams to Bequeath Concert and Film Scores to Juilliard

The John Williams Music Collection Will Be a Resource for Scholars and Students

NEW YORK  ‚Äì‚Äì  The Juilliard School announced today that it has received a bequest from Academy Award-winning composer and conductor John Williams of his complete library of concert music and film music scores as well as his sketchbooks. Mr. Williams, who studied piano with longtime Juilliard faculty member Rosina Lh√©vinne, announced the gift at a special alumni event held in Los Angeles at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills, where Mr. Williams was also presented with a President‚Äôs Medal by Juilliard President Joseph W. Polisi.

Acknowledging this gift, Juilliard President Joseph W. Polisi said, ‚ÄúWe are deeply grateful to John for his extraordinary generosity in bequeathing Juilliard his extensive library of both concert and film scores. John has been a wonderful friend and colleague for many years. His artistry, creativity, and endless imagination make him one of the most admired and respected musicians of our time. His gift will be a unique resource for all of our musicians at the school, particularly composition students who can study first-hand John‚Äôs breadth and versatility as a composer.‚Äù

‚ÄúSince my earliest days as a fledgling piano student, I have looked up to the Juilliard School as the Mecca for the study of music in our country and beyond,‚Äù Mr. Williams said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs therefore a privilege for me to donate my sketches, papers, and scores to Juilliard, to be made available to those students particularly interested in the intimate processes of film scoring.‚Äú

Juilliard‚Äôs vice president for library and information resources, Jane Gottlieb, said: ‚ÄúThe John Williams Music Collection will be an extraordinary resource for scholars, students, and all who are interested in understanding his career as a composer and conductor.

The John Williams Music Collection will be part of the Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections and Juilliard School Archives, which also include the Jennie Tourel, Soulima Stravinsky, and many other notable collections. The Special Collections are housed in the school‚Äôs Lila Acheson Wallace Library. In appreciation of all of these generous donations, Juilliard exhibits materials from these collections on a regular basis.

Mr. Williams, who turned 86 in February, is in his 60th year of composing concert music as well as music for films and television. His next major work is a fantasia for cello, harp, and orchestra that will be premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on August 19 at Tanglewood as part of the Leonard Bernstein Centennial. He wrote the work, Highwood‚Äôs Ghost, for Juilliard cello alumnus Yo-Yo Ma and harpist Jessica Zhou. Mr. Williams holds the title of Boston Pops Laureate Conductor, which he assumed following his retirement in 1993 after 14 successful seasons. He also holds the title of artist in residence at Tanglewood.

Mr. Williams‚Äô works for the concert stage include two symphonies, cello and harp concertos for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a bassoon concerto for the New York Philharmonic, a trumpet concerto for the Cleveland Orchestra, and a horn concerto for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 2009, he composed and arranged Air and Simple Gifts for the first inaugural ceremony of President Barack Obama.

Mr. Williams has received five Oscars and 24 Grammys‚Äîthe most recent Grammy was in January. He has received 51 Academy nominations, more than any other living person. His latest nomination was for his score to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He has composed the music and served as music director for more than 100 films, including all eight Star Wars films, the first three Harry Potter films, Superman, JFK, Born on the Fourth of July, Memoirs of a Geisha, Far and Away, The Accidental Tourist, Home Alone, and The Book Thief. His 40-year artistic partnership with director Steven Spielberg has resulted in many of Hollywood‚Äôs most acclaimed and successful films, including Schindler‚Äôs List (recorded with violinist Itzhak Perlman, a Juilliard faculty member and alumnus), E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones films, Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Adventures of Tintin, War Horse, and Lincoln. Mr. Williams‚Äô contributions to television music include scores for more than 200 television films. He also composed themes for the 1984, 1988, and 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.

In addition to the awards mentioned above, Mr. Williams has received seven British Academy Awards (BAFTA), four Golden Globes, five Emmys, and has had numerous gold and platinum records. He received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors in December 2004. In 2009, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and that same year he also received the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the U.S. Government. In 2016, he received the 44th Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute‚Äîthe first time this honor was bestowed upon a composer. 

The son of a CBS radio orchestra percussionist, Mr. Williams was born in Flushing in 1932 and started studying piano at the age of 6. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was in high school, and he subsequently attended UCLA and Los Angeles City College, concentrating on the study of orchestration. He also studied composition privately with Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. Serving in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, he played, conducted, and arranged music for military bands. In 1954, after having completed two years of military duty, he began his piano studies with longtime Juilliard faculty member Rosina Lh√©vinne and also played jazz piano in nightclubs. He returned to Los Angeles in 1956, securing his first job with the film industry as a studio pianist. One of his first projects was South Pacific. He has worked with a number of accomplished film composers, among them Bernard Herrmann, also a Juilliard alumnus.

Mr. Williams‚Äô relationship with Juilliard has continued over the years‚Äîin 2004, he received an honorary doctorate and in 2006, he conducted the Juilliard Orchestra in the school‚Äôs centennial gala, which was broadcast on Live From Lincoln Center on PBS. In 2011, Juilliard named its orchestra library, which houses scores and parts for the Juilliard Orchestra and other ensembles, after him.

Thankfully he‚Äôs just still fucking old.&&WOW!&&Thank god. What an amazing man to make sure corporations don't destroy his legacy. &&I will recognize almost everything he does till the day he dies for the rest of my life. I have no idea what will happen to movies in the future when he passes to make them even close to as epic as he has done. &&honestly, its a great thing that he did.

Researchers at the University of Utah were working on an artificial heart of their own at the same time, and when they went to patent their design, they found that Winchell had actually scooped them on several features. Instead of fighting Winchell's patent, the scientists asked him to donate the patent to the university, which he did. In exchange for his cooperation, the school let Winchell conduct research in its labs and assist with transplants.

[ROTJ Grand Finale @ 7:57](https://youtu.be/N7-y-A3D5bk) &&Oh there you are Peter! But really, ""You are the Pan"" is one of my favorites of his. Such a wonderful movie&&Yes! The whole Hook score is so beautiful. He did such a masterful job of capturing the wonder and magic of that world.&&I don't know if it's my favorite, but I've always found it to be some of his most interesting work. You can clearly hear so many different Williams-esque moments in it - Across the Stars motif at the start, a building reminiscent of the Superman Theme, and ultimately magical fantasy music that predates Harry Potter by like 15 years. There's hints of the same stylings we heard in the Raiders theme, arrangement similar to what we had heard in Star Wars.

It's like John Williams did a mash up of his own work. And it's brilliant.&&Damn, I didn't realize this was him! Amazing theme. &&I fell in love with movies because of Spielberg and I get that he has reservations about Hook but for me, it's more than the sum of its parts.

I don't think it's a great film. It feels to impulsive, indulgent...maybe too colorful. But I will always watch it when it's on TV.  There's just something about the emotion/themes that resonates with me. The older I get the more it grabs me, yknow?

And as a musician, it took me way too long to realise that this is one of John Williams best scores. It's simply incredible.&&The first soundtrack I ever owned! I was 10. Hook‚Äôs theme which begins when Smee starts carrying the hook got me... well... captivated!

Edit: Just remembered we played this soundtrack, or at least the main themes, in high school band. Loved it. It was a dream come true to play this masterpiece. &&Rip robin williams.

From the press release:

>‚ÄúI have looked up to the Juilliard School as the Mecca for the study of music in our country and beyond,‚Äù Mr. Williams said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs therefore a privilege for me to donate my sketches, papers, and scores to Juilliard, to be made available to those students particularly interested in the intimate processes of film scoring.‚Äú&&Nope. He's just giving them the paper copies of the scores (Looks like orginals too, although there are copies other places), the rights for the music still belong to either Williams or the movie production company depending on the deal&&It's a pretty save assumption. I think there's some confusion about what the gift entails exactly.

Don't say that.  I'm seeing him in April.  &&Well I heard last week that he's retiring for good after he finishes Star Wars IX, so this might be related to that&&That feeling when the post on top of r/all might be above one that says ""xxx found dead in manor"" prevents me from scrolling down&&Apparently not.

I'll be watching my kids' reactions harder during this part than when I first saw it. I can't freaking wait.&&Mine is the finale score from AotC. He closes the medley with Across the Stars, and at the very end of that part you can faintly hear The Imperial March. When I heard it for the first time I got chills and lost my shit - so well done.

Edit: Need to add that the reason i think it is such genius is because, as far as I can tell, you don‚Äôt hear The Imperial March at all in the movie, but the whole episode is building up to Anakin turning to the dark side. That little taste at the end sets up RotS perfectly.&&At least post the real version https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-w-58hQ9dLk&&That bit is from the track ""Journey to the Island"". It's the best part of the score, in my opinion. &&[Buckbeak's Flight from Prisoner of Azkaban.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9kT8PL6ZA)&&Can we all just take a moment to appreciate that while you now can clearly tell they are standing in front of a green screen that cgi‚Äôd dinosaur still looks great&&https://youtu.be/Y9AVTlvbhKM. 

YTMND&&[Watching him conduct it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEZh88vz8b8) really gets me going.&&My wife walked down the aisle to an arrangement of the theme.&&This scene right here is why 20-30 year olds fell in love with Jurassic World the minute the trailer came out.

When Jurassic Park first premiered the generation that saw it and was still able to be mystified by it was a generation that had grown up on animated and poorly put together sci-fi creatures. We were teased throughout the first few scenes about what was to come, but everything finally put together, the majesty of the dinosaur, the reaction of the actors, and not least of all the music that scored it helped truly encapsulate the moment as something special. From then on we were taken away. This was no actor in a cheesy dinosaur costume. This was REAL. Hammond and Lucas and Speilberg had literally brought this creatures to life in front of our very eyes. There they were. They were no longer words on a page and pictures in a book but living breathing creatures. We could see them, and like Dr. Grant, we could watch them, enjoy them, and embrace them. The journey continued on Site B when we saw they weren't just tame docile zoo attraction but living beings that engaged in a complex ecosystem. When let free they went back to their primal instinct, and the movie did us the favor of leaving their destruction out, keeping the dream and the idea intact. 

Finally, Jurassic World. Years had past and the generation that grew up as kids first seeing these movies, first believing has come to age. We have kids of our own now. Jobs, and lives and whatnot. But deep down we still hold on and want to believe. Finally when the trailer premiers, specifically right [here](https://youtu.be/RFinNxS5KN4?t=35s) we are again thrown back to when we are kids and believe again. The dream has been fulfilled. The Park is open. Not only is the Park open but it's thriving. People can reach out and touch these mythical beasts. We can almost reach out and touch them. Hammond's legacy and dream, our legacy and dream, is being fulfilled before our very eyes and we can't wait and see what happens next. Dinosaurs and man, side by sad, once again. 

Anytime after that we could go back and watch this scene (from JP) and it still had the same reverence it did when we first saw it, we were taken back to the first time, when we believed and desperately wanted them to be real. It doesn't matter that this movie is almost 30 years old. It doesn't matter that it is unrealistic. For many it will still be the beginning of a wonderful journey, that has its up and downs, might pull at your heart strings, but ultimately reaches to the deepest parts of your imagination and says ""yes, they are real"", all of which is scored by the magnificent John Williams. &&The acting in that scene is so strong. That's a lot of score for dialogue to shine through, and it does in spades.&&My favorite moment in terms of Star Wars soundtrack also comes from Empire. That moment in Cloud City when R2 finally is able to open the door to Leia, Lando, Chewbacca, and 3PO's escape to the Falcon, and the soundtrack after is just incredible, [the lead up and exact moment heard here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQUEz8gkyw#t=2m30s). The sweeping love theme paired with the driving bass and aggressive horns is so emotionally perfect for that scene, it gets the goosebumps going every time. &&That little bit from [right before the Falcon rescues Luke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkV4ctqDI_c&t=3m56s) is just...I don't know how to describe it. The swirling strings (is that a thing?) remind me of Night on Bald Mountain. Then at 5:06 they take off and it's as tense as it can be. Right up to the very end, we can't be sure that the heroes will get away this time. I really think ESB (and ET shortly afterward) was Williams at his peak.

Edit: added the exact time I meant. &&Disney need to tell John Williams the plot to like the next 10 star wars movie and the star wars cinematic universe so he can get cracking on composing all the scores.

He can be healthiest person on Earth, we ain't taking no chances.&&I also love his score for Episode V. John Williams is a treasure in general. 

That said, I haven‚Äôt seen a score that topped Vangelis‚Äô score for Blade Runner yet. Even on its own, it‚Äôs a fantastic achievement. 

Williams is fantastic but he‚Äôs also consistent. All of his scores are amazing but none of his scores really stand out to me among his work either. 

_One more kiss, dear... one more sigh... only this, dear, is goodbye~_&&His score for the new trilogy has been admittedly lacklustre. Mostly recycled songs and the new ones have no presence. &&It's called being moved AKA the best part of music.&&It stirs up a sense of longing. You aren‚Äôt sad because it‚Äôs a hopeful yearning. You know you‚Äôre meant for a greater purpose you just don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre going to find that purpose, yet. 

That‚Äôs how that scene always made me feel when I was in my teens and early 20s. 

I know people are split on TLJ but I loved it. The last scene with Binary Sunset is also bittersweet. Not because of that longing for a greater purpose, but, because that purpose was served and it was time to pass on. &&Heavily agreed. Something I've found lacking with the new films is the absence of unique and recognizable scores. Its been two films and all that comes to mind is Rey's theme. 

Meanwhile George Lucas's films gave us Imperial March, Duel of the Fates, Across the Stars, Cantina Band, Battle of the Heroes, etc. All which are unmistakably defining sounds of *Star Wars*&&The score of Episode III is also fantastic&&I actually think ""Across the Stars"" is my second favorite of his. I even made a video about Anakin and Padme with this song.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7uH2M7mRnY&&I cry almost every time I hear it. They truly were star crossed lovers, but they just couldn‚Äôt be together :,)&&The scores are easily the best things to come of the prequels and its not even close&&No one has ever had anything bad to say about the score in the prequels.&&The tune itself is ""The Force Theme,"" but its most famous setting is indeed [""Binary Sunset.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dr3W3QuVCs&t=1m53s) Originally, the cue used for that scene was [much darker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYXLmHmTrzU), using the Dies Irae motif, and sounding much more Golden Age Hollywood.&&Yup, that got me.... Jeez why is it so sad&&Honestly i had to google to make sure he didnt write the music for Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Lol&&Star Wars Oxygen on Rebel Force Radio podcast did an entire episode on Across the Stars and it's mind-blowing&&Hey is that clip from a documentary or something?

I‚Äôm not crying &&His work on Empire of the Sun is very underrated.&&Good to see it getting some love. I like some other pieces of his more, but I feel that this one way too underrated.&&By far my favorite of William's work (its even my ringtone). Though I am fond of Princess Leia's Theme and No Man's Land from War Horse&&Which one? There have got to be at least 20 in there, lol. My all-time favorite score, no question. Favorite theme is ""[Remembering Childhood](https://youtu.be/JoZY2dSSxxA?t=5m10s)"" but there's SO MUCH.&&[Imperial Walkers on the north ridge!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1riVCPmtJuY&t=4m2s) That piano bit was cut from the movie soundtrack, but it can be added right back in seamlessly.&&Right. I just wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt get too many people saying that he has much better stuff and I‚Äôm a pleb for liking the popular one. It gets annoying seeing that attitude of gatekeeping from people.&&If anyone's looking for it on official soundtracks, it's part of the Battle of Endor II Medley at 4:53 (the offical cue name within that medley is ""The Dark Side Beckons"") on the 1997/2004 Sony release.&&I feel like the 7 minute mark on on this is the best collection of all the little themes on the score taking off, if you will.&&You are 100% right. ""You Are The Pan"" is one of my favorite Williams pieces. Musically, it is absolutely heart wrenching from about 2:30 to the end. I've never been able to explain why, but there's just something about that section of the song that expresses the feeling of longing to reconnect to your childhood and remember what it was like to just be a kid and play pretend and have the whole world laid out for you to be whatever you want to be.

I don't know what I'm trying to get at, but I will say that it is just a gorgeous piece of music and should make anyone feel a wellspring of emotion.&&Whatever people may think of the movie as a whole, the sets and the score are inarguably top-notch.&&I think of that end more as a ""TSHHHH"" know what I'm sayin?&&The leitmotif is there. Which brings us full circle to the subject of this post. And I agree with other posters' comments. I cannot hum a bar from the most recent films' scores, but ""Duel of the Fates"" and this love theme from ""Attack of the Clones"" are easy to conjure up again. &&Across the Stars is easily one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever.  

I listen to it on repeat sometimes. 

Edit: just listened to the Catch Me If You Can one you posted.  From 1.56 is the part you're referring to? &&You think *that‚Äôs* eerily similar, John Williams uses a particular motif in 3 different movies: [Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones](https://youtu.be/TpIgu4bcVoY?t=4m20s), [War of the Worlds](https://youtu.be/aOZpbnZxu0g?t=47s), and [Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull](https://youtu.be/r9FPOZYmBK8?t=3m22s).&&Yeah, neither of those got a shoutout yet though, so leave me alone. &&As far as I can tell, he just gave Julliard millions and millions of dollars.  It is an incredibly generous gift.  I think that they will try to capitalize on some of it and release other stuff to the public under some sort of free license.  &&Hard to say. With most film music, the studio owns it, not the composer. That's why you can't find a lot of full film scores (printed). The composer doesn't have the rights to give it to you or the public even if they wanted. The studios are sitting on the rights but often don't do anything with it because it's not that big a money maker. In JW's case, hopefully it will be worked out that the public will have access, even if it is just through the college library like accessing other papers, because he is just that full of awesome.&&Hopefully something along the lines of the [Bernstein Collection at the Library of Congress.](https://www.loc.gov/collections/leonard-bernstein/about-this-collection/)&&And even if it did mean that, wouldn't some sort of creative commons or public domain license be better than a university holding it?

What's the ethical calculus on that? &&How is that not a joke? 

You think we have anything near the resolution for that?&&I dun' halved my composer!&&Ya.  Legacy giving basically starts when they enter middle age.  &&Former archivist here: leaving significant works to cultural institutions is pretty common at any age. &&He'll be around in a month. If you said May, that would be a little iffy. I'm kidding, the man looks extremely healthy these days. &&I thought he was just retiring from Star Wars. Is he straight retiring? He deserves it, but it makes me sad.&&He had a concert in the last month where he announced his intention to score Indiana Jones 5. Basically, if Steven is in, he‚Äôs in.&&That makes two of us...&&I had same experience with the movie when I was a kid as you. When I showed my boys JP, they loved it. When you first see the dinosaurs for the first time (brachiosaurus stands on two legs to eat the leaves) my boys told me to take a picture of the tv because they were so blown away. They were 6 and 4 at the time. I thought they'd get too scared by some of the more intense scenes but it didn't bother them at all. Anyways I will always treasure that experience and I'm sure you will too. &&> I'm a newer father to two boys. I was 8 years old when Jurassic Park came out, and I remember seeing it in theaters. It's THE greatest movie experience of my childhood.

I was 10, and although I dont have kids, that movie had a massive influence on the trajectory of my life. It changed what I wanted to do for a living, and the shape of my adult life has been largely formed by the things I did to chase my dreams. The place I live, the friends I have, the company I work for all spiraled out from seeing that movie. Hell, I met my wife because of where I moved for my career. 

I'm always hesitant to ascribe too much weight to single experiences, but I'd make an argument that Jurassic Park might have been the single most influential 127 minutes of my life.&&I was 8 when Jurassic Park came out too! In fact, it's the first movie I ever saw since I have no memory of watching a movie in the theater prior to that. My dad took our entire family to watch it. Had no clue what it was about or what even dinosaurs were, until Spielberg and Williams brought [this scene]( https://youtu.be/PJlmYh27MHg) into my world. I left that movie with my world considerably bigger, and more wondrous than I could imagine. 20 years later, I had the opportunity to repay my dad when Jurassic Park 3d released. Took my whole family to watch, and got to experience being 8 again.

I envy you very much for having kids you want to watch JP with. Someday, when I'm not mucking around with life, I hope to have kids to sit down with, at a big screen and turn 8 again.&&[My favorite version.](https://youtu.be/-5jWtz3rzco)&&Yeah but they left out the [lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428IyxSfsls)&&gets me everytime&&This is never not funny.&&[This is my favorite](https://youtu.be/I-5IjIVMq4o)&&Is it wrong that i can quote the lines along with Journey to the island? I have watched JP waaay too many times&&https://nerdist.com/video-explains-why-original-jurassic-park-special-effects-still-look-great/&&Fuckin A love John Williams. I will hold to the belief that Star Wars was only successful because of the perfect melding of effects and soundtrack. While the effects alone were incredible, it is the score that really pushes the drama of everything. 

The texture of each instrument, the timbre, the presence, he plays with each section so precisely. I'm impressed by most his scores, but the OT Star Wars has a huge place in my heart.&&My favorite is probably the [asteroid field music] (https://youtu.be/KvJDItC6tE0?t=2m12s) from Empire, the way the explosions and noises of the ships blend into the music gives me chills. The [ending] (https://youtu.be/KvJDItC6tE0?t=3m17s) is amazing, where it transitions into the love theme and the camera pans up to the wide open sky&&I love the part where Yoda lifts the X-Wing out of the swamp.&&Now we're talking! This moment gives me shivers as well. The love theme just feels so TENSE here. The stakes feel so high and stretched. The hyperspace jumps can be heard in the music. This is film music at its absolute best.

Fun fact, you can hear (the first four notes of) Darth Vader's theme on the low brass and timpani [right here](https://youtu.be/1F1Feemr1vE?t=362).&&Damn. I could hear it in my head as I read your description. I remember reading the notes from the ESB soundtrack and Williams used Peter and the Wolf's style of music for inspiration (something like that).&&ESB is the high point of his scores. The city in the clouds theme is downright ethereal.&&YEESSSSS that is the exact moment before ""Hyperspace"". And swirling is precisely how to describe it (though I suppose it is an arpeggio technically) it does swirl about the hits of the chords, and fuck that shit is intense. I can only imagine seeing it for the first time. I was introduced to the OT when I was 4-6, so Vader being Lukes father and shit like that were as accepted to me as God is to others.&&The swirling strings is just them playing two notes really quickly. So its like one long bowing while they quickly place and remove a finger on a string.&&The secret to orchestral music is that you can basically use any word you want to describe it. Swirling, leaping, galloping, tossing and curling are all valid.&&He's a muthafuckin American treasure.&&The best part of life honestly. A film, a song, a painting, or someone holding the door for somebody else. It's all beautiful. &&I want to exute that I don't believe you are wrong. That said, I think the movement you feel from an amazing song can be both happy and sad. For instance, when I listen to 'Mr. Blue Sky' I feel the same 'movement' to listening to 'Dream Of Flying'.&&Wow, that explanation was spot on and somewhat beautiful. &&I may not agree with you on the TLJ but the first part is spot on. &&I used to feel the same way, then I started to listen to the soundtracks. Ahch-to, first order, battle of crait and the spark are amazing. Try it out if you have time!&&That was awesome dude&&Well, I mean, that *is* the definition of ""star-crossed"". It means that they're fucked, no matter what. It was never supposed to mean Romeo and Juliet were perfect for each other, it was all about the tragedy.&&[deleted]&&Didn't know this - thanks for the heads up! I'll have to check it out!&&Agreed.&&One of the reasons Hook has so many themes was that it was originally going to be a musical. At some point it production, Williams had time to put together like 20 of his all time best melodies.&&Empire just came right out of the gates with some serious intense and dramatic action to set the audience up for well deserved character development time.&&Heart wrenching is a great description lol. It truly is a magical song.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Those two songs (along with Battle of the Heroes from III) have also been heavily played in the past 15+ years, both before and after the films came out, espeically in video games. We've had the sequel scores for barely 2 years at most. Give them time.

One of the most regrettable things about the prequel scores was how Lucas's editing style meant we'll never have a truly complete official release of AotC or RotS. Even the Ultimate Edition of the TPM soundtrack had to be pieced together.&&You can't remember the March of the Resistance? That's honestly in my top 5 of all his pieces.&&I wouldn't call that a fully formed motif, more just a sort-of generic ""tension pulse."" Now, using the same music from the Coruscant chase in AotC and the Quidditch match in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets? That's more than eerily similar.&&So, just to be clear, did he transfer to them the rights and royalties, or just donated to them the papers in which he wrote the music as he composed it? &&BEST OF ALL...WILLIAMS!&&Normally yes, but some institutions limit online access to students and faculty. The fact that Disney/Lucasfilm owns the rights to much of Mr. William's music might make making scans available to the public more difficult. If you make an appointment, you could see them on their campus.

If they make scans available, chances are they will find their way here:

&&That's a good way to put it. Obsessed. And possibly the worst part is Harvard doesn't even have to bother trying to be good anymore.

Well a decade later the schools have even less funding because the original funding was cut and used for whatever &&Thanks&&thatsthejoke.jpg&&I'd point out for those people who think that ""Julliard doesn't need / deserve funding"" that Adam Driver, the actor who plays Kylo Ren in the new *Star Wars* films (which John Williams is also scoring), went to Julliard. 

He comes from a ""small town"" background and a decidedly-not-wealthy family, was previously in the Marines, and worked extremely hard (I think, in one interview, he mentions doing 3 theater performances per day at one point) in order to get where he is today. 

I'd imagine there's at least some students at Julliard who are in the same boat as he was. I think that Williams donating his scores to the school will help do a lot of good, in that regards.&&A farmer in the Soviet Union, after years of hard work, has finally pulled together enough money to afford a Lada, the best car he could buy.

It will be ready in five years time!""

""Morning or afternoon?"" asks the farmer.

He still had character flaws, but was wise enough to recognize them. Like Yoda and Obi-Wan being unable to go after the Emperor and Vader for decades, he was helpless to directly shape events any longer without making the galaxy even worse off. &&/u/Hekantonkheries it is actually one of the most wholesome thoughts someone planted in my brain in months: I now can't stop imagining real life superpowered beings used for SFX because it's cheaper then CGI, eventually making practical effects new cool on a Godzilla scale.

Humans would probably have made themselves extinct long before then&&They also had a Marvel movie about a guy they kept freezing and bringing back to do gigs every once in awhile.&&I'm kinda borderline starting to hate how every futuristic idea, I mean things that sci-fi as a genre is known for, is suddenly ""black mirror"".

The [full cue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMR54zicBzU), included on the 1997/2004 soundtrack, also includes a mournful horn figure at 1:20 (underscored again by Dies Irae) that shows up somewhere else in the movie; I just can't remember where exactly. More than that, though, the track also has a bonus after 2:45 of silence: five takes of the Main Theme, which were all edited together to give us the version we heard on the first soundtrack.&&We would be friends&&Same with Kylo's theme. I adore how rich and dark it sounds.&&I agree. But I will say, ""Duel of the Fates"" was used in promotional material, as well. It became iconic because the powers that be pushed it. The trailers for the New Trilogy pimped the classic themes. So some of it is presentation. &&The which of the who now?&&Not only that, at the end of that specific part in the Quidditch match music, you can hear the end of the escape from Cloud City music (when the Millennium Falcon takes off from the landing pad, to be specific).&&From the article it seem that he donated his scores, sketchbooks and notebooks.

COOLAAAAAAAA

GRILLED KEEEEBOOOOOBBBBBBB&&Harvard's undergrad may not live up to their reputation, but because of how old it is and how many immensely successful alumni have graduated and donated fortunes, they have one of the largest (maybe *the* largest?) endowment of any educational institution in the world. They put a LOT of this towards research, and a lot of top minds are poached from other schools (because who doesn't want to say they research for Harvard?)

As a result of their massive funds and all they talent they steal, Harvard's grad schools and their research are actually top of the world, and are very deserving of their reputation 

Edit: but yeah, I've heard that one you're in undergrad, you're basically set, because they don't want to fail people and look bad.  &&From what I‚Äôve heard, this is an exaggeration. There is grade inflation, but apparently the classes are still rigorous &&I think they are just taking advantage of their prestige in a way that makes sense.

During HS, I took three college-level math courses (DiffEq, Real & Complex Analysis) at a well-respected nationally-known engineering school.

They were significantly more rigorous and I found them *harder* the second time around even though in theory I'd already taken the equivalent course.

I was a wreck watching it because it filled me with so much feeling. I couldn't describe how much I missed just hearing his voice & concern with children. 

There was a Q&A afterwards with the entire film crew & Yo Yo Ma's son, Nicholas Ma, who was a Producer for the Film. When asked why none of Fred Roger's sons went into children's programing, Nicholas Ma said that's why he isn't a successful concert cellist. 

It truly is a wonderful Film that doesn't paint his life only with the positives but the sides that make him a human. He had his struggles & conflicts but that only made his resolve stronger.

Edit: Credit /u/holyone666 for the much better ""Hold my..""&&I had a pretty good childhood, but there was a time when I was pretty miserable. I had to stay with my grandparents and my grandmother‚Äîwell, the nicest thing I can say about her is she wasn‚Äôt nice. On top of that, I was going through a rough patch at school where I was being bullied.  

I still remember that half-hour of being Mr. Rogers‚Äô neighbors each day, and how I felt loved and special during that time. It would be like that was my goal each day‚Äîjust make it until Mr. Rogers came back on. 

Anyway, today just hearing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood‚Äù will make me cry. So, I‚Äôll be happy watching that when it streams, but I don‚Äôt want to go out in public crying, so I‚Äôll pass on the theater release. &&I will always upvote Mr. Fred Rogers.&&I don't know how I'm supposed to get through that.  I can barely get through the trailer without weeping.  Fred Rogers was the closest thing I've ever seen to Jesus Christ on TV.&&I'm not a native speaker, not from the US and haven't ever seen a single episode of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood - but I've come to learn *of* him over the years, and have watched a good deal of clips.


...It was just surreal. At first I thought *""He cannot possibly be genuinely* ***this*** *loving and caring and nice of a person, but wow, what a great thing he's doing for the kids""*. As I learned and watched more and more, I realized he apparently *was* exactly as open, kind, caring and *unconditionally* loving as he appeared... and when I realized that, and I watched him express his love and appreciation knowing that he *truly* meant every part of it from the bottom of his heart, it broke through every emotional barrier I had and made me cry for about half an hour.

I'm not in any way religious, and have a deep-seated antipathy for cults of personality - but man, I have rarely ever been moved this deeply by another person - it was a... humbling experience, to witness just how purely good a person can be in this world - with empathy, understanding and love. There's nobody I know (including myself) who wouldn't do well to think about what Fred Rogers did right and how to be more like that...&&Man, if this trailer fucked me up as bad as it did, I can't imagine how effective the actual film will be.&&There really isn't a better time for this movie to come out. I cannot wait to see this, and I hope it gets the recognition that it will deserve.

...BUT I NEED MR. RODGERS NOW! 

Honestly, for the first time in over a year, I felt my heart open up and my body relaxed, even while I also teared, knowing he's gone. I'd like to think what he taught us isn't gone; that we carry it inside us and can give it to another generation. &&It makes me sad that my generation was the last one to grow up with Fred Rogers.

My mom, brother and I used to watch Mr. Rogers Neighborhood every single day together. I'm really sad that kids are growing up without him.

I think he was the first celebrity death that really shook me. I was in college when he died, but I cried. And then I looked up [facts about him](https://www.factinate.com/people/40-facts-neighborly-facts-about-mr-rogers/), I cried again.

&&I hope this film is able to spread his spirit to younger viewers who didn't have the chance to see his show when they were little. I lived in Pittsburgh when he passed, and I have never experienced an emotional outpouring like that. The entire city mourned openly, in the most wholesome and friendly ways; people talked about it and hugged each other and talked about the ways he had affected their lives. The whole front page of the paper and most local news for a while was just about him. There was, I think it was at the convention center, a big memorial book that people lined up to write in, just about memories they had or little messages of love and hope.  The person in front of me, a real big, rough guy, wrote ""I love you, I miss you, thank you"", and walked away crying. He brought people together in a profound way; I wish he were still here. I'm gonna cry my eyes out if I can find a showing of this close to where I live, and maybe even just the trailer will be a good reminder for me to keep that soul of goodness and kindness alive, even when everything seems awful around me. &&Reading through the comments so far I'm happy to read so many emotional responses to the trailer. Doesn't matter what day I go see the movie, rain will be in the forecast.&&Wow the trailer alone just tore down my walls.&&I loved Mr. Rogers as a kid, although I did always find it kinda funny that he would come in with a sweater, to only change into a different colored sweater.

I'm sure it'll get linked a bunch here. But if you haven't read this article on Fred Rogers do yourself a favor and take the time. You'll be glad you did, it's genuinely delightful.

It's you I like,
It's not the things you wear,
It's not the way you do your hair--
But it's you I like.
The way you are right now,
The way down deep inside you--
Not the things that hide you,
Not your toys--
They're just beside you.

But it's you I like--
Every part of you,
Your skin, your eyes, your feelings
Whether old or new.
I hope that you'll remember
Even when you're feeling blue
That it's you I like,
It's you yourself,
It's you, it's you I like.

It's You I Like
By Fred M. Rogers&&I'm a new dad and I look to Mr Rogers as inspiration. I grew up with a mentally unstable mom and a weekend dad. I have tons of anger and anxiety issues that I grapple with every single day and the absolute last thing I want is for my daughter to have to deal with the same crap I did. His patience is what is most impressive to me. Patience is the key to everything. His ability to read a situation and figure out how to handle it from a place of love and compassion is exactly what I want to do. It's such a simple concept and so hard for me to actually do. Everytime I feel myself getting angry at a situation, say my daughter screaming in my ear for the 50th time that day, I have to consciously stop myself and think about the kind of person I want to be in that situation. The better me, the me Mr Rogers would be, is slowly starting to develop. I have good days and bad days but its something I'll never stop working on. I thought Mr Rogers was boring when I was a kid but as an adult I fully appreciate what he stands for. The mans philosophy is relevant at any age. &&In Canada we also had [Mr. Dressup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Dressup) with [Ernie Coombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Coombs).  &&I remember talking to Mr Rogers through the television... He was/is/always will be one of my most favorite people. &&What is the music that plays at 1:06? I've heard that before in documentaries...&&I would argue that Fred Rogers was the closest thing we have ever had to an embodiment of Christ. He was a Christian that wanted to become a minister but took a detour into children's television. He understood that the best way to share his idea of God was to simply share the message of love, he did not need to evangelize the deity that he fervently believed in. Somehow, he knew that the message of love itself was enough, or even that evoking a deity may have made some uncomfortable or retreat to their own tribal camp. He was so adhered to the message of love the pure inclusion that he broke past any barriers that can divide humanity and shot that arrow straight into the hearts of all that listened. He was the best of us.  We are so much better for having had him.   &&For those that are unaware, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is actually on Amazon Prime video. &&As an adult man, I cannot see this in theaters. I will await the release date for home so I can cry like a giant baby through most of this movie. &&Now all we need is a Bob Ross Documentary that's actually just every Joy of Painting episode back to back into  one massive feature of wholesomeness. &&What a kind and gentle soul. Mr. Rogers always seemed so selfless.

Excited for this documentary, I just wish Tom Hanks' movie was going to be a biopic about Mr. Rogers' life instead of a slice of life moment.&&I‚ÄôM NOT CRYING, YOU‚ÄôRE CRYING!&&Mr. Rogers was ever so much of my childhood (am 38 for reference).  Watching this, plus Sesame Street and the Muppet Show was the core of my upbringing.  Of course there were the smurfs, snorks, GI Joe, Transformers, Gobots etc.... but I can remember the episodes that Mr. Rogers did on divorce, death and sadness way more than I can recall specific episodes of Sat morning cartoons. 

I am having my first child in August and I know for a fact she will be watching old shows of Mr. Rodgers and be a better person for it.

&&I couldn't watch the whole trailer because I was about to start crying.&&You are special &&I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!&&I saw this at True/False. It is a fantastic documentary. Mr. Rogers is truly a saint.&&Well I've got a huge lump in my throat now.&&Oh my god it gets you right in the feels&&I‚Äôm crying at my desk &&Chills down my back once the song started&&He really was the best of us all.&&Obligatory profile of Mr. Rogers: Can you say...

I still feel blessed for having met him back in middle school when he came to visit my schools garden.  &&He was an amazing person.  Never forget that Fox News called him evil.&&Preschool teacher checking in; we all sure as hell could take a page out of Mr. Rogers' book

>children have very deep feelings, just like anyone does

This couldn't be more true. Just because a child spazzes out over his block tower being knocked down doesn't mean his emotions are any less valid than a grown ups. So what if *you* don't think he should be crying about it. The block tower is *all that matters to him* and it was ruined. Imagine if everything you care about is suddenly ruined. That's how that child feels. Everyone deserves to be told they're loved and they matter. &&Made this 44 year old man cry watching that.  Grew up with that man.  His basic message was ""Don't be mean"", and it was a great one.   
  
Nostalgia from that is crushing.&&His reaction was so honest and genuine. As soon as the young man came out he immediately got up and went straight to him. Didn't even use the stairs. 

Fred seemed like he didn't necessarily mind participating in a bit of pomp and circumstance, especially if he was able to use it to spread his love or gratitude, but he never placed the formality normally expected above how he felt and always acted accordingly. &&Link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcNxY4TudXo&&Thank you for mentioning this! I had never seen that video before and got teary instantly when he and Jeff hugged. &&The only quote I‚Äôve ever found that truly encompasses everything about him is

&&I saw his kids on some of the episodes.. they were not very enthusiastic&&How does one get tickets to these film festivals to see movies so early? Is that like an invitation thing?&&Man I'd hate to see how the media would run his name through the mud if he were alive today and said something controversial like ""everyone should love everyone.""&&If re-runs of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood ran for president I'd vote for it.

We'd be WAAAAAY better off. &&[Especially this one](http://neighborhoodarchive.com/images/misc/other/fredosaurus_rex/DSCF1298.JPG)&&It sounds really stupid but I'm a 30 year old and never really saw at lot of Rogers (I've heard a lot about how great he is, but I'm European so never really heard about him).

I just cried watching that trailer. I haven't cried like that in a long time. I don't know why but his vision of love is just heartbreaking to me in how genuine and fantastic that is. Can there be a better way of treating people as children?

&&I always got the feeling that John Pastore was a dude who didn't tolerate bull shit to such a degree that when he saw someone give a genuine plea to support something they care about, he was totally taken aback. Glad to see Pastore was willing to listen instead of just go in one ear and out the other.&&I think it might be a good idea to present some proper context to the video, because Senator John O. Pastore may be the most unfairly vilified figure in any viral video ever. This video is always presented as ""Mister Rogers facing down the gruff, mean anti-PBS politician who's trying to kill quality children's television"" and that's really not what's happening at all. The truth is, Pastore was there because he was the biggest advocate PBS had in Washington. Pastore hated children's television offerings by the major networks (he had complained so loudly the previous year that it caused the networks to cancel a slew of cartoons that he deemed unacceptable). He thought public TV needed funding because he thought it was a worthy alternative to commercial children's TV.

Richard Nixon was wary that the Ford Foundation, a group that had funded some fiercely slanted documentaries on public TV in the 1960s, would wield too much influence over the newly-formed Corporation for Public Broadcasting and wanted the budget slashed in half because he didn't want to fund programming that he expected to be anti-Nixon. This hearing was held so that advocates for educational TV could come forward and plead their case that they were doing good work with the government funding they were getting.

Pastore, again, portrayed most of the time as being anti-PBS, actually opened the hearings with this statement: ""‚ÄúThe Corporation is now a viable entity. During the short time that it has been in operation, it has made plans for, and in some cases actually begun, providing broadcast programs of diversity and, I must say, excellence; establishing an experimental interconnection distribution project; and supporting and strengthening local noncommercial stations.""

And that's the reason he snaps at Mister Rogers early on. He'd made it very clear that he's in favor of continuing to fund the effort. So when Mister Rogers leads off by expressing his concern that Senator Pastore hasn't read the written statement in advance, Pastore reacts with the tone of a guy who's basically thinking, ""You get that I'm on YOUR side, right?"" As much as we want to think of Mister Rogers as infallible, the truth is, this video shows Mister Rogers committing a bit of a faux pas and Senator Pastore calling him out on it.

As far as Pastore's statement at the end, ""Looks like you just earned the $20 million,"" again, this moment didn't singlehandedly swing anything. It's not Pastore saying ""I'm in charge of this $20 million and now you can have all of it!"" He's telling Mister Rogers, ""Wow, good speech, dude.""

So yes, it's a great speech, and yes, Mister Rogers probably did a lot toward ensuring fuller funding for PBS...but Senator Pastore isn't the villain in this video, and Mister Rogers did nothing that changed his mind about anything. Pastore was trying to get the full $20 million grant from the beginning.&&[Most of the proceeding of this recording is actually in the film. It's really hard to pull yourself together after watching this mid way through the Film.](#Spoiler)&&I've read that Pastore is pretending to be cynical about public broadcasting here, and that he had his mind made up about this and Mr. Rogers was brought out to create this scene to justify his vote to his constituents.  I tried to find a source for this, but google results are just page after page repeating the ""feel good"" version of the story where he melts the icy heart of the curmudgeon.

This is not an attempt to disrespect Fred Rogers or what he did - I think he was an amazing person.  I just think politics have always been politics, and will always be politics, so I think that explanation is more likely than 10 minutes of testimony flipping a politician on an additional $10 million of funding in 1969.&&If he were alive today, I can‚Äôt help but feel things would have ended differently.

Edit: I feel you are misunderstanding me. I mean I wish we had a soft, clear, honest voice to speak the truth to this current administration. If he could get that asshole in the senate back in the day to actually care about something, maybe he could get some of today‚Äôs senators and representatives to take a look at themselves as well.&&My dad when I was 5. This trailer eerily touched on deep forgotten moments. &&My dad is still alive but is a complete bastard. Mr Rogers helped fill that void.&&Mine left when I was 4....32 years old sitting at my desk almost crying in the office right now...&&Mine left when I was 3.  Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross were huge in filling that void. &&Never knew my dad sonce he died when I was a baby, I would watch Mr. Rogers whenever I could up until I got too old to be spending the night at grandma's.&&Right there with you. My dad passed away when I was 4 from cancer. Fred Rogers actually made pamphlets for parents on how to explain to their children about the death of a loved one. During that time, I watched his show almost everyday as a coping method. I watched this trailer and it instantly flooded me with emotion. I might have to wait until this comes out on blu ray cause I'm a weepy, wet mess right now just from the trailer. Don't think I'd be able to compose myself in the actual movie theater.&&I have a three year old daughter. She does this all the time, it is adorable. This is what I love about kids -- they are very forthright and let you know how they feel. &&""Hold my sweater""* FTFY&&it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing.&&Yup. This is the first trailer that ever made me cry. I have no idea how I'll get through the movie, but dang it, I'm going to try.&&I didn't make it past the first fifteen seconds without welling up.&&The trailers for Moon and Tree of Life made me cry &&Jeez, yeah my shirt is wet from drying my eyes. &&Thanks for sharing that, brought a tear to my eye.

I had no idea he was on for so long.&&Saw it at Sundance. The whole theater left in tears. I mean everyone I saw. Everyone.&&So many memories of kind smiles and happy messages, all of which felt like it was directed right to me personally sitting in front of the TV. What a nice guy he was. &&I‚Äôm Jewish and I completely agree with you. Fred Rogers was a man of God. &&Yeah, it's why I will wait for it to come to Netflix or Redbox or something. I really don't feel like crying around groups of people.&&I can't say I got as far as weeping, but I sure became blurry eyed watching that trailer.  I grew up watching him on TV through the 80s.  I don't think there is a single other person out there in the media, be it for children or young adults, that is able to speak as frankly, and as respectfully, about any single topic.  His ability to help us understand, and empathize, with anyone about anything shaped me as the person I am today and I will forever be grateful for his influence.&&He's one celebrity that I'd really vote for president.  &&Yeah... I want to go to a movie theatre and cry for 2 hours...&&And Fox News hosts called him an ""evil evil man.""

&&I'm glad I'm not the only one. &&Im glad this is the top comment, I bawled through out that trailer and wondered wtf is wrong with me.  He was basically my Dad growing up and taught me how to be a good person.  Aaaand now im crying again.&&And to think that 90% of his love and good deeds in life were off camera. I wish I‚Äôd known someone like him. &&> I'm not in any way religious, and have a deep-seated antipathy for cults of personality - but man, I have rarely ever been moved this deeply by another person - it was a... humbling experience, to witness just how purely good a person can be in this world - with empathy, understanding and love.

Well, shit.

Never saw an episode and everything I know of him is from the internet, specially reddit.&&I'm not a religious person anymore either, I don't believe in those things.

But Mr Rogers is pretty much the closest thing we have to a saint.

If there was such a person as Jesus, this is what he would look like, and this is what he would be doing. Not preaching from a lavish mega-church, not shouting doctrine at people who are different, not hoarding wealth or selling a product.

There are multiple statues, roads, and a variety of other things named after him. We have all kinds of athletes, political figures, musicians, etc that come through here, but no one has ever come close to the level of fame and reverence that he has...and rightfully so&&At work, sound off, still made me tear up with joy. Luckily there is a lot of pollen around so I can play it off.

üòä&&If it is, man he really pulled it off.&&Correct; this is a documentary.&&That would be ""You Are My Friend,"" which _is not_ a biography of Fred Rogers, but is mostly based on the true story of a friendship between Rogers and a reporter, and how knowing Rogers changed the the reporter.

Tom Junod is that reporter.  He wrote about Rogers in 1998 for Esquire magazine, and it was [republished last year](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/).  That article gives at least a taste of what that relationship was like.

While I'm looking forward to this movie, I would also love to see a biopic of Fred's life, focused of course on his television career, because it was so interesting.  Of course, that will be covered in _Won't You Be My Neighbor,"" so I'm looking forward to it.&&This should be higher. I had to find this comment to confirm this. I thought possibly it was a teaser and it hadn‚Äôt started shooting with Hanks yet, and they weren‚Äôt focusing on Hanks‚Äô casting here.&&If it makes you feel any better, there is a show called Daniel Tiger that is based on Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Also MRN is available on Prime (and lots of people have uploaded episodes to Netflix).

I never really got into Mr Rogers when I was a kid, but my own children watch him very often.&&It was way worse in Latrobe.  The collective heartbreak really was fascinating to live through.

And to help them express their feelings in ways that will bring healing in many different neighborhoods.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OqyUuCY0s)&&I feel you are missing his message. It's all about how being a good neighbor (person) you can make small changes that when multiplied create a better world.

Don't give up. &&At first I thought, ""Why are we all crying? It didn't even show the 'I stamp my feet' clip."" 

I think you nailed it, though. This is the world we were aspiring to and now we have... ugh &&I just watched his TV Hall of Fame induction speech and found myself with the same thought... We have utterly failed Mr. Rogers. Oof.&&Look into what was going on during the time Mr Rogers was on air.&&Mr. Rogers would never say it was too late.&&What? The world was a worse place when Mr. Rogers was at his peak. We *have* improved since then. Keep living in the ways that he teaches and, naturally, the world will become a better place. 

And there's no reason not to when you don't see others around you doing the same.&&[Michael Nyman - Fish Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzpvJT3t3u8)&&Be the person he believed you are.&&And it's okay. &&Hundreds of millions of years ago, maybe before animals existed, the world was just land and sea. And there were plants on the land - maybe grass, maybe moss. But there had never been a flower. Ever. And then one day, a flower came out.  And then it died. And maybe another long long time went by with no more flowers. And then another one came out. And another. And eventually, there were all different kinds of beautiful flowers appearing all over this planet. Kind, loving, enlightened people are the same. It's the natural course of evolution. 

(This isn't mine, I'm paraphrasing Eckhart Tolle here)&&Fred Rogers was a very special man. Introduced to us as young children, his show, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, allowed to enter Fred Rogers's world. It was a world of life, laughter, and love. Mr. Rogers had an immense love for children. What's more is how he appreciated children. His calm demeanour and gentle tone. Never once did we feel talked down to about life. Mr. Rogers treated us as equals. That beautiful, strong, and caring man came to us from Pennsylvania and taught us that simply by caring, we can be good people too. Mr. Rogers isn't just a legendary teacher. He is one of the greatest men who ever lived.&&Just read [this article](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/). I know it's long, but it's worth every second you'll spend reading it. I had never watched Mr. Rogers before when I read this article, but even I started crying once the article started explaining how much Mr. Rogers means to Koko the Gorilla.

If you only have a few minutes, watch [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q) of him convincing Congress to fund PBS. He was basically a hero from a Frank Capra movie in real life.&&He made a TV show for children. But more importantly, he's the only famous person I know who's always, *always* been kind, calm, and loving. Nobody has ever caught him so much as saying an unkind word about someone, let alone the kind of scandals we expect from our celebrities.&&Fred Rodgers was a tv personality from the 50‚Äôs till I was a middle aged kid (about early 2000‚Äôs) he is one of the many many reasons PBS is and was a thing and shows like Sesame Street were on. He went to congress and made them fund PBS more, and during his speech after getting an Emmy or some big award he made everyone cry with his speech where he simply said they would take some time and have a  moment of silence he‚Äôd watch the time and for a few seconds the place was dead quiet till he said time was up. You may see roomers and bs that he was a sniper in Vietnam bam and be tattooed up that‚Äôs why he wore the sweaters but neither are true. He was a good caring kind man on screen and off he was always himself and didn‚Äôt need to put up an act to seem more appealing. He‚Äôs worked with a lot of people from Bill Nye to Michael Keaton. &&In an attempt to give a serious answer to you, Mr Rogers was one of the good ones. He had this way of explaining things in a way that just made sense, and not just to children but to adults.

Even if you disagreed with some specific viewpoint he had, his way of explaining things was such that his passion was clear but that he wasn't belittling anyone else's viewpoint. There was never sarcasm in the way he presented himself. Nor hate or anger.

It is not that he did not have anger. He admits fully that anger is something we all have and deal with. But he never let hate and anger be the drive for his behavior.

Take for instance the divide between those people that like Trump and the people that dislike Trump. They have such a hard time finding common ground because hate towards the opinions of the other side clouds view points. Mr Rogers is the sort of guy that would have been able to talk with people from both sides that were extremely passionate and manage to have the conversation civil.

Not only that, but everyone in the conversation would come away from it better understanding the other side, and being more willing to find a workable compromise.

There is a famous video clip that I'm sure someone has already posted, where Mr Rogers actually goes and talks to congress about funding for public television in a time were congress was gearing up to cut the funding. Here is a group of politicians that are absolutely sure that this is an area where we don't need to be spending money, but he was able to explain to them why public television is so important in such a way that he didn't come off as condescending or anything like that. And he manages to change the politicians mind on things and get the funding.

It's not even a subtle change in mind either. The politician starts off being almost rude to Mr Rogers but by the end it's clear he's entirely convinced.&&He had a show on PBS for decades called Mister Roger's Neighborhood. It was an educational show that did a great job of explaining things in a way that little kids could understand while at the same time not sugar coating things or avoiding unpleasant topics. Episodes could be about anything from going to the doctor for a checkup to visiting a factory to explaining divorce or war. He also didn‚Äôt play a character in the show, which adds a lot to the appeal since you can tell that he's being his honest genuine self.&&Of course we did. We all deserve to be loved, he just made that path easier to see for so many of us.&&Actually, he made it his life‚Äôs work to help us all believe we not only deserved kindness but could embody it.&&Fred Rogers would say that the person we need most of all in this world is *you.*&&Because it's Mr. Rogers. And he's pure. &&Mr Dressup was also shown in the US.&&Fish Beach by Michael Nyman&&Also he was a Presbyterian priest, not one mention of God or trying to sell the Bible... ever.&&>Fame is a four letter word. And like tape or zoom, or face or pain or life or love... what ultimately matters is what we do with it. I feel that those of us in TV are chosen to be servants. It doesn't matter what our particular job... we are chosen to help meet the deeper needs of those who watch and listen. Day and night. 

>The conductor of the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl grew up in a family that had little interest in music. But he often tells people he found his early inspiration from the fine musicians on television.

>Last month a 13 year old boy abducted an 8 year old girl, and when people ask him why... he said he ""learned about it on TV."" 

>""Something different to try,"" he said. ""Life's cheap, what does it matter?""

>Well life isn't cheap, it's the greatest mystery of any millennium. And TV needs to do all it can to broadcast that. To show and tell what the good in life is all about. But how do we make goodness attractive?

>By doing whatever we can to bring courage to those whose lives move near our own. By treating our neighbor at least as well as we treat ourselves. And allowing that to inform everything that we produce.

>Who in your life has been such a servant to you? Who has helped you love the good that has grown in you? Let's just take 10 seconds to think of some of those people who have loved us and wanted what was best for us in life. Those that have encouraged us to become who we are tonight.

>No matter where they are, either here or in heaven, imagine how pleased those people must be to know that you thought of them right now. We all have only one life to live on earth, and through TV we have the choice of encourage others to demean this life, or to cherish it in creative imaginative ways.

Goddamnit dad.&&I actually have had different exchanges of ways I've attended Sundance through the years. Some from tired attendees that just hand over tickets to see movies (After a few days, seeing movies can be a drain) But I will clue you in a secret: Waitlist. 

If you use the waitlist, you can find where & when the movies are shown. Then, you stand in line, mostly around 80 people that want to get into the Film. For the most part, if you show up about 45 minutes to any showing, you can get in. And it's wonderful! I've seen my last 4 Films that way, with waitlists & patience. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29lmR_357rA

Makes my blood fucking boil. &&FOX news already tries to blame him for millennials being entitled.&&I always thought if Jesus showed up in the 60s,  older conservatives would have just called him a dirty hippie and told him to get a job &&You know what, I bet they would do that.  I bet they'd dump all over him, and Mr. Rogers, being the amazing human being he was, would have said, ""Well that's alright; everyone has an opinion and their opinion is just as valuable as anyone's.  But I still love them for who they are.""

The world is a lesser place with the loss of Mr. Rogers.  I was lucky enough to grow up being able to watch him and learn from him and feel important as a child listening to him talk to me.  I think kids would be a lot better off today if the world had more people like Mr. Rogers to inspire and teach them.  What a beautiful person he was.&&My Trump loving mother in law recently made a remark about how he was probably a pedophile and I thought I was going to scream at her.&&Please tell me the statue is called Mr. Rawwwwgers&&[But NOT this one](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/12/6a/b1/mister-rogers.jpg).&&Would that automatically make us a tyranny?&&Twitch just started a [marathon of his shows](https://www.twitch.tv/misterrogers).  &&He was the first Italian-American ever elected to the Senate, at a time right around the middle of the period depicted in The Godfather; he had a fair amount of bullshit to deal with in his life :-)&&Pastore started off kinda brash, but Mr. Rogers had him all warm and fuzzy within about 3-5 words.

&&Yeah, I don't blame him for his attitude. He probably gets hundreds of people asking for money for bullshit every single day.

We need this message so badly.&&I was a latchkey kid with serious depression by the age of six. By eight my family life was upended (temporarily) and Mister Rogers was the one thing I could rely on. As often as my dad and grandparents told me it would be okay I just couldn‚Äôt believe them. They were as sad and scared as me and it showed.

So every day after school I‚Äôd come home and delicately turn the dial of our old television until PBS squelched into view. He was always there. He told me it was okay to be sad, scared, mad, or confused. He never snapped that he didn‚Äôt have time to comfort me. He sang to me and made me feel safe. 

In a very real way Mister Rogers quiet and unconditional love for everyone kept me alive in a very dark time. &&I'm atheist, but I still stand by what I said.  I think he embodied the ideals of Jesus' teachings - he lived it and he meant it.&&He literally was! He got a masters degree from a seminary and was an ordained Presbyterian minister.&&Plus, he did it without talking down to children or being dismissive because they're just kids. He truly wanted kids to understand what was going on. &&Becoming president takes a stupendous amount of ambition. No one this humble and gracious could ever become president.&&We don't deserve President Mr. Rogers, but Jimmy Carter was a pretty close imitation.&&I don't think one should ever want their idols to become politicians - unless you're prepared to accept they will almost certainly make decisions that will cause you to lose respect for them.

You really can't put *anything* past Fox news.

TLDW: Mr. Rogers is an evil man because he taught a generation of kids that they're special. Well in the real world you're not special. We've got such a problem with this entitled generation! Blah blah blah&&Oh God, that's Alyson Camerota, current new day anchor, saying that :(

I had forgotten she was part of the Fox news machine at one point. &&You will.  Be someone like him.&&My bet is German.&&It  isn't that you're not an emotional man; Fred just helps you realize that it's OKAY for a man to be emotional.

At least that's how it is with me. When I'm watching MRN with my daughter, I forget the social stigma regarding my emotional expression as a man. And I weep like a damn baby.&&I just spent the past half an hour watching, thanks for that &&Maybe I am. But still, it‚Äôs you I like. &&the beautiful thing is, we can all be that man, if we want to be. It's really that simple. 

But as a collective, it's nearly the most impossible thing that will ever be. So as long as our modern day society continues to accept the norm.

&&they're out there, just not on TV atm.&&Every time? I may be remembering wrong&&There's a saying that's something like ""I want to be the person my dog thinks I am."" Fred Rogers was that person.&&yes, this exactly&&Fuck, that got me&&Shit why. Goddamn. Don‚Äôt do this to me&&Exactly. Mr Rogers never tried to change anyone's attitude. He just treated them with love and kindness, and by his example the change came naturally. Don't worry about the world, just act like Mr Rogers and it will become a better place for you.  That's how we start. &&Whenever I feel so burdened and so done with the world, I always remind myself to be the person Mister Rogers knew I could be... and to help others remember that, too. :)

We can always, always be what he believes we could be. Never give up. Always look for the helpers, and be one, too.&&I feel as though as long as you're trying to be the best person you can be and improve yourself daily, he's always going to be proud of you. &&Yes. For me, those periods of time were indisputably worse, despite the fact that we have so much more knowledge of systems of power, corruption, environmental issues today, it was a lot worse to be anyone other than a straight white man and global politics were much more of a mess than they are now.&&And can we just add on that in this day and age where we're finding out that a lot of our favorite celebrities are secretly horrible people, that this man died with his legacy completely intact? 

He was every bit as kind and loving as he presented himself to be, and that's a rarity. &&He taught us that everyone is valuable and worth loving. &&He was also a radical Christian who was not afraid to make his opposition to things like the consumption of meat or war known to the public, but without being condescending. Fred Rogers was a very brave man.&&This is perfect. If I had to summarize Fred Rogers with two pieces of media, this is it. &&""He was basically a hero from a Frank Capra movie in real life.""
Thats perfect&&I like how nice to treats children as well. Never talks down to them or really babies them like other kids shows do. &&Please stop, it's raining too much on my face...&&So true, Bloody_Shits.&&This made me tear up lol darn you!&&I heard an interview with him replayed on NPR from the 80's.  They specifically brought that up with him and he said he intentionally never mentioned it because he found the thought of someone feeling excluded for believing something different to be absolutely abhorrent.   
  
The world didn't deserve Fred Rogers.   &&He didn't need to do it in his words. He did it in his actions.&&You don't need to sell it when you live it. &&TIL. The best ones don't try to sell the bible because they've actually read the bible. &&There's the old story of how a parishioner once asked him for help with his gay son. Fred simply told him ""God loves you just the way you are.""

Also comforted his gay cast member after discovering he was gay and assured him he thought nothing less of him. (He did initially encourage him to keep it quiet because he feared it would result in Rogers being forced to remove him from the show, but he later stopped that).

I totally would consider Christianity if more pastors were like him. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised to find out Fred Rogers was actually the second coming, but later decided not to make a fuss about it and just focus on making people happy. &&Holy crap. I've never even really watched his show or anything, only know what I know of him from internet references, but that was powerful. &&I can't even count the number of times I've cried to Mister Rogers Neighborhood as a teenager. I grew up watching him but when i would stumble across it on TV as a teenager it his messages always seemed so poignant and were always so spot on with what was going on in my life. That man empathized and loved with all of his being. Such a warm person who really seemed to genuinely care. &&Mr Rogers was our commencement speaker for my college graduation. He did that same 10 seconds of silence bit and I can still remember the absolute stillness of 15,000 people in that arena. Such a powerful presence for such a gentle man.&&Jesus... my 38 year old self teared up a bit there. God I miss that man.&&how would Mr. Rogers have felt about Black Mirror? &&Yeah, I've got a reputation as a jaded, salty old sailor to maintain and Fred Rogers is just wrecking that today.

I can't wait to see this documentary even if I'm going to bawl through most of it.&&I cant be doing this at work. &&**N**eighborly **S**miles and **F**riendly **W**eeping&&> 
> How do you expect me to keep my job when I'm crying like a two year old watching this video at my toolbox!

Show everyone else and you won't be alone, they'll understand.&&It's so interesting to me how watching old clips of Fred has the same effect on everyone who grew up watching him- tears. We all cry like babies. 

 He was such a good man. He just wanted to help us all realize how special we are in our own way. His demeanor was so comforting. The uncertainty in the world today is scary, I really wish he was here. &&It's funny meeting the children of people who work in the arts. For people on the outside it's this ""magical place,"" but for them it's their parent's job. It's like having a father who is a butcher or a teacher. &&I think the most infuriating part of this is they're saying millenials are entitled because of Mr. Rogers. *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood* debuted in 1968, and stopped in 2001. These trash commentators would've probably been children at the height of Fred Rogers' popularity. &&Ho. Ly. Shit. Those good for nothing mouth flaps really had nothing better to do besides bash Mr god damn Rogers.

Fox news should be burned to the fucking ground.&&I couldn‚Äôt finish watching that, but my take away from them is that they want a show that teaches kids that everyone is born worthless until they accomplish something and if you don‚Äôt accomplish anything, then you will remain worthless. &&Oh my fucking god they really have no fucking decency do they. I knew they were absolute shit before but I never expected them to go and attack **Mr. FUCKING Rogers.** Fuck Fox News goddamn&&Honestly, at the risk of going off topic, this has always been my real problem with Fox. It's not that they're biased,  it's that they're so needlessly aggressive or defensive about the dumbest shit. It's like they want to champion acting and thinking like a dickhead all the time.

Like what other news channel is going to have a 6 minute segment whining about something some celebrity did that they don't agree with, especially when it's Mister fucking Rogers, what's the point. And yet they do this shit all the time, like a couple weeks ago when Laura Ingraham was losing her shit about something Lebron James said about Trump in some ESPN thing no one watched.&&They misinterpret what Rogers said. He meant what he said when he says ‚Äúyour special just for being you‚Äù, but he never endorsed giving people special treatment. His message was one of individuality and going against the gradient of peer pressure. Not that all kids are special and deserve to be treated special. If someone did misunderstand it as such then they are indeed going to have a hard time in life if they think they deserve anything for ‚Äúbeing themselves‚Äù. To Mr. rogers being yourself wasn‚Äôt special because you deserved anything for it, being special was being yourself because nobody else is you, and you are nobody else.

The fox commentators misread his message, however they are right in saying that IF that was his message it would be detrimental to people‚Äôs well-being.&&> Makes my blood fucking boil.

This is perfect. The people who classify Mr. Rogers as their enemy identify themselves as the source of the cancer at the heart of our society. They are everything that's wrong with the world, and it swells my heart to see them so shamelessly attack the good in the world, it shows that facts, not confirmation bias, guide my judgment of these individuals.

Fox is hell on Earth, and it is populated by demons.&&Hey Fox News: 

‚ÄúOh wont you go......   fuckyourself‚Äù&&I never thought I'd say this but I love those youtube comments.&&So what you‚Äôre telling me is fox and friends has always been shit?&&Legit didn't even have to click on it to know it was fox news, and replies confirmed that.&&Jesus Christ. Fuck fox news. One of the nicest people ever on t.v., tells kids to like themselves (success starts with believing in yourself) and fox has a problem with that? Fuck fox news. Fuck cable news in general. All they want to do I sell me shit and con people into voting against their best interest. &&Which is beyond stupid because we didn't even grow up with him. It was still broadcast I'm sure, but even the older millennials were probably more of the Nickelodeon generation.&&It would have been a valid response. &&It's actually Fredosaurus Rex.&&Yeah we really need to get a replacement. When I first saw that first time I ever went dahntahn I didn‚Äôt even recognize it as mr Rogers. &&It's special in its own way, and we should love it the way it is.&&Isn't the Senator in the Godfather Part II scene based on him?  They look awfully similar.  &&Yeah, that first comment of ""Would it make you happy to read it?"" comes out just demeaning, but within 3 minutes he's asking genuinely to get a copy of the show. &&Pastore was a man used to getting BS from people and was efficient at turning people le down because of it. I think he was genuinely shocked by Fred‚Äôs sincerity and respect.&&What, is the Reddit comment section not a good enough source?&&No, don't be Mr Rogers - that's impossible. 

but you *can* be the neighbor he'd want you to be. &&We have Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood now.  It's nowhere near what Mr Rogers was, but it's based on his shows and endorsed by his family.  It's the distant second place we have on Amazon streaming that little kids can get started on.&&Or when you leave to go get cigarettes. &&These days there‚Äôs Daniel Tiger‚Äôs neighborhood too, which is very, very similar in content but it‚Äôs an animated tiger and his family‚Äôs and friends. His parents teach him most of the life lessons, though it also has other important adults fill those teaching roles on occasion. If you prefer, a talking animated tiger can fill the void left by your  death instead of Mr. Rogers.&&FYI they are available on amazon prime.  

-current dad.  &&Tic tac?&&I love crying and there's few things better than crying in public with a group. Being happy in a group happens all the time but to be with a mass of people all feeling the same raw emotion, knowing that you're not alone, that everyone feels bad sometimes, it really connects you to the group on a much deeper level. Spoilers for Toy Story 3, but that movie is a great example. I saw it in the theater and while it's a sad movie, you could tell everyone was keeping it together. Then the scene in the furnace comes on. When Buzz just looks at Woody and give him his hand, one lady a few rows back just gasped and sobbed and let the rest of the theater know it was ok to let go and enjoy the ride. Crying started in every corner of that theater and as we all left with wet faces and red eyes, we looked at each other and just gave the nod, acknowledging that while I don't know you, we're all brothers and sisters.  &&But why cry at home?

We like you *just the way you are.*&&Well I'm glad to hear it, and I know he would be too. 

How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.&&This is very touching.  I feel like Mr. Rogers is the human embodiment of a dog.  &&I read a comment in a previous thread that mentioned Mr. Rogers, by another Atheist and (paraphrased) it went something like:

> I don't believe in God but if I die and find myself in Heaven, being told by Jesus that he did actually return and his name was Fred Rogers, I wouldn't be surprised. ""I came back and told you everything you needed to know, but a lot of people weren't paying attention so I didn't make a big deal out of it"". &&To dedicate your life to love, forgiveness, and reconciliation transcends all creeds and borders, it is universal. All we can ever do is try and live up to his example.&&Fred be with you.&&The man was a minister, so he took Jesus pretty seriously.&&Fellow atheist checking in, I recently posted something similar when I was talking about Sir Patrick Stewart as a contrast to him. Fred Rogers is probably the most divine being I have or will ever bear witness to. He is the ideal all men should strive for (in my opinion). 

Second place is Steve Irwin (and I'm not sure if I am joking about that or not).&&As someone raised Christian and turned away from Christianity in disgust from the actions of everyday ‚ÄúChristians‚Äù, I agree.

I no longer believe in a God or Christ figure, but I still try to emulate many of the things I was taught about Christ.&&The world today could use a Fred Rogers more than ever&&I'd argue that they COULD become president, but they would never WANT the job in the first place. I believe this is how George Washington approached the job. The country trusted him, but he didn't want that job. He only took it out of loyalty to the newly formed country, and is still remembered as one of the greatest Presidents.&&Jimmy Carter did and America hated him&&Jimmy Carter isn't all that far off.&&He was. I'm conservative and his policies might have been, misguided sometimes. But he was certainly one of the kindest presidents we've ever had. &&They would actually hate Jesus himself if he came back. &&When you‚Äôre on the wrong side of Fred Rogers you‚Äôre on the wrong side of history.&&I remember that and fuck them for this.  &&My heart just sunk watching that&&>*My* generation is full of hardworking people. I'm worried about the upcoming generation!

No, it's the children who are wrong!&&What do I do with the mad that I feel?&&As Mister Rogers's mom once taught him, always look for the helpers. They are here, and you can be one, too.&&He came in with a spring or fall-weight jacket, took it off, and usually put on a knit sweater jacket or cardigan. Man, I  remember that as a little kid younger than my kids are now. He was around for a long while. &&Not to mention he talked about current events in a way to help kids understand. Like JFK's assassination and Vietnam. More of a way to help them understand what was going on in the world instead of trying to shelter them&&The irony of not just admitting you may be crying when talking about a man who made it his mission in life to say it is okay to be emotional and cry.&&Mr. Rogers is truly the hero we've always needed but never deserved.&&Fred thought we deserved him- a genuine friend that loved us when it seemed no one else did. 
I looked forward to seeing him - he took time to spend with us and made us feel worthy. &&Every time I think about him and what he contributed I'm brought to tears. If we found out that he was Jesus reincarnate, I would not be surprised.&&This just made me sad. I don't know why. Maybe because I've never really known anyone personally like him. &&Preach the Gospel, and if necessary use words. -St. Francis of Assisi. 

Profound statement, regardless of your views on Christians, Christianity, and the Church (which, in my view, are NOT at all the same thing).  Live your life in such a way that your words are nearly an unnecessary after thought to your message.&&My mom always told us ""actions speak louder than words""

And I like ""words are wind""

&&Amen. I'm not a Christian, but one of the people I have the utmost respect for was. My OIC (Officer In Charge) when I was an ATC in Seoul, Korea, was Captain David Baskett, an amazing individual married to an equally amazing woman.

Captain Baskett thought of himself as a ""primitive Christian."" He was not aligned with any organized church, he was not an evangelist in any contemporary sense, and he never once invoked God or Jesus in conversation, although in our line of work (air traffic control) you sort of hoped they were keeping an eye on things.

He once told me that his version of evangelizing was to live his life as he believed Jesus did, and if someone noticed and asked about his beliefs, then and *only* then would he start to share his personal testimony. He felt it was better to create a place that others wanted to enter into *by their own desire* than to push it at them.

By their deeds you shall know them.&&[Here's Mr. Rogers single-handedly convincing the Senate to keep funding for PBS](https://youtu.be/yXEuEUQIP3Q)&&Fred Rogers was so exceptionally rare in that he possessed the ability to speak with pure, simple candor without seeming cheesy or false.  His earnestness and honesty was immediately apparent in every interaction he had.  
  
He was the very definition of a self-actualized person.  What was happening in his heart and in his head, was precisely congruous with what he said and did.  
  
Mr. Rogers was completely authentic, and in a world where it seems as though all of my other heroes have turned out to be liars and hypocrites, I can't tell you how much his authenticity means to me.  
  
I grew up with Mr. Rogers.  I'm a cynic and a pessimist.  I have no religion, and no particular faith in humanity.  But I believe in Mr. Rogers, and I'm proud to consider him my [lifelong friend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OqyUuCY0s)  When my kids watch Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, I'm thankful that some of Mr. Roger's legacy has lived on for my children.
  
Also, today is his birthday March 20, 1928.&&Do yourself a huge favor and watch some episodes. It's not a ""kids show"" in the stupid, vapid, brainless way we now shove media at children to keep them quiet or push products.

It doesn't talk-down to kids or treat them as too dumb to handle hard questions and issues. Even adults can learn from its lessons in mindfulness and compassion. 

It's powerful and touching and amazing in a way no show has managed to capture since. I should take my own advice and watch it again.

http://pbskids.org/rogers/videos/&&Everything he does is powerful.    
Like, sucker-punch you right in the emotions powerful.   
  
It hit Netflix a year or so back and my kids refused to watch it. I put it on anyway. They screamed - it's old and boring and they want to watch paw patrol and bla bla bla.... all through the opening credits and sequence they just bitched and moaned.

Mr. Rogers opened his mouth and started talking and both my kids shut up immediately. Stood in place slack-jawed mid-fight, as if they were frozen solid. They sat down and watched the entire episode. Not a damn peep from them the entire time.

That man was some kind of special. &&> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcNxY4TudXo

I read an article about this clip once that made me appreciate it one even more than the other clip. When he first asks audience to take 10 seconds to think the people who made who we are, you can hear people giggle, like ""oh what a cute thing for a children's show host to do."" But then they realize ""oh wait, he's dead serious,"" and everyone gets really quiet and teary eyed. He literally puts Hollywood in their place with just his calm confident presence. &&I certainly don't wanna speak for such a wonderful man, but it seems to be like when he advocated for quality educational children's programming he speaks to how they need it to help proper development.

Black Mirror is a quality show examining thrilling subject matter, but there's no doubt it's for adults to consume. I like to think there's room in this world for both Mister Rogers and Black Mirror, as long as there's a clear distinction between the two, lest children improperly attach thoughts and feelings to the mature themes in the latter programming that adults can easily avoid and/or deal with. &&Agreed. 

Years ago my kids started watching something. I wasn't paying attention, but something perked my ears. I knew that song. I recognized the names. I couldn't be, could it? 

Daniel Tiger. 

I was excited about this and we definitely watched it. &&I did not order this box of friendly, smiling onions.&&Oh for sure, I'm actually in Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers might as well be a god here, and for good reason! &&In the documentary, he says the reason he started the TV show was because he saw a TV show that consisted of people throwing pies in each others faces. He thought it was so rude and ugly.  So he set out to make a show that was the complete opposite. Sadly not much has changed with TV today. Remember when the History, TLC, A&E channel‚Äôs used to be about learning?&&>The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.

I know it isn't a socrates quote by merely a paraphrase of a quote caricaturing socrates but this bitching about younger generations isn't even new. &&Anything to not take blame for THEIR fucking parenting that developed this supposed ""narcissism"". 

Were we shitty parents? No, it was Mr. Rogers that was wrong! 

Fuck them all. 
&&They aren‚Äôt blaming millennials. 

Look at the average viewers age and consider how old this clip is. They‚Äôre talking about Gen-X, my generation. 

The millennial generation gets lumped into the entitlement labels because baby boomers were able to provide for us and millennials‚Äô parents. Apparently having parents raise kids in proper homes with access to basic human rights and services for all is enough to be labeled as being ‚Äúentitled‚Äù. 

Fuck Fox News. &&It's just a completely ridiculous ""study"". I'm 32 and towards the high side of the millennial age and I didn't really watch him growing up. I knew about him, but my friends and I were all about Nickelodeon. Gen X certainly would've been more influenced by Mister Rogers.&&If any children's TV show taught millennials to be entitled, it would be thanks to that little shit Caillou.&&God damnit, I can't believe I wasted time to look these people up but your point is spot-on. The only exception is Steve Doocy, who was 12 at the time of the debut so he was probably too old to care. I get the sense that these people came from money and didn't grow up like 90% of us. They probably wondered ""Why is he talking to the mailman? They're like the help, you don't converse with them."" At this point I am totally projecting since that clip was so infuriating. They might as well be slapping my dead mother in the face for how they are treating such a powerful influence on why I'm 1/2 the man I am today. /rant

I really hope those hosts don't reproduce&&It's just fucking pathetic. &&Fox news needs to just die off&&As opposed to Fox News who makes everyone paranoid and pissed off. Fuck those mouth breathers. Mr Rogers told everyone to try hard too. Gonna mention that? Nope. In pure typical Fox style. Complete PoS news.&&I would feel bad if Fox News was burned to the ground over a difference of political opinion.

I would help you light the torch if they were burned to the ground for dissing Fred Rogers.&&I don‚Äôt think Mr. Rogers would want anything burned to the ground. I don‚Äôt think he would support violence in any capacity‚Äî even if they are spreading propaganda. Who knows what genius thing he would come up with to counteract it, but it would probably involve quietly speaking about proving them wrong with actions, not arguments. Then he would hug them and tell them he liked them just they way that they are. Then tell them a story about how he once met a handicapped boy who would self-harm and scream about how he wanted to die. And Mr. Rogers asked him to pray for him, because he believes that people who suffer a lot in their lives are closer to God. So the boy stopped trying to hurt himself and instead began praying for Mr. Rogers‚Äî because everyone had always prayed for *him*, and he never considered he was someone who could pray for someone else. 

Mr. Rogers stood for love. He did not fight against hate, he just didn‚Äôt leave any room for it.

Even though they have the same core values, there was just something about the authenticity of Mr. Roger's that can't be captured anywhere else, certainly not in an animated show.  He had a kitchen.  He had a fish tank.  He had a mailman and neighbors and a plant to water.  He was just a regular guy.  And that trolley...oh my god that magical wonderful trolley that would disappear into that tunnel and venture into the world of make believe....

I feel niave as fuck even writing this, but I am sure I'm not alone. And if we all just take on our own responsibility of checking our own behaviour maybe we could get there.&&It makes me so upset to see what has happened to educational television. I grew up on that. When I was 12 I watched a 4 hour documetary on Rome on history channel and I loved it. Wound up researching Roman history at the library and just soaked it up.

Now it's mostly junk on the discovery network, so I have to go find documentaries online. Natgeowild, natgeo, pbs, bbc america, and smithsonian are my favorite channels now. It's a shame that I have to swap between so many channels though to get what I used to get on just three. I rarely watch animal planet, history, or discovery anymore and they were always my go-to channels growing up.&&Yeah not like those 70's rockers who respected their parents and authority!&&I know I do it now.

baby boomers are millennials parents&&Yeah, there are *so* many stories out there about how Fred Rodgers just telling kids they were special made a difference in the lives of kids that felt alone and unloved. The reason he was so revolutionary is literally because he saw that kids are humans too, and they can feel like they have made mistakes in life even at a young age, and sometimes just need to be told that regardless of anything in their lives, someone loves them.&&Mr Rogers would love them just the way they are. &&That will only happen when their core audience of 70+ die off. It's happening tho. I live in Texas and only 1 person in my entire 100+ employee office has any support for them or the GOP(I just lump them together since they're on the same team), he always changes the break room tv to Fox and we always change it back to whatever random Dr. Phil episode is on the next channel over.&&Fox is anger pornography for old men who can't get excited any other way.&&There's a huge difference between having a different political opinion, and willfully spreading propaganda that you know is false.&&Basically mr rogers saying everyone is special for being themselves instead of saying ""you have to do something with yourself and become a billionaire to be special"" ruined millennials because it makes them think that they are important as individuals. &&Hello fellow yinzer. Thanks for pointing out where this is. I know Pittsburgh loves its dressed-up dinos but didn't know we had one of Mr. Rogers.

Ever go visit that big statue of him down by the river? Even as an adult I feel the need to sit on it and pretend I was a kid again, when I believed people like him were actually running things.

There is a great video that breaks down this conversation and how Mr Rodgers appeals to the elephant i.e. the opinion being held and not the rider i.e. Mr Pastore.

And it was interesting to see that he was perfectly engaged by watching Fred talk, show him the contents of a box, feed the fish and demonstrate some toys.  He really liked it when Mr. McFeely came.

And this woman was like ""Pfft in my day we had sex, drugs, and rock and roll and that built character.""

"""The Emoji Movie"" named worst movie of 2017 at The Razzies",42899,81poji,https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/entertainment-arts-43269496,1797,1520077440.0,,">Tyler Perry won the worst actress award, dressed as an elderly woman in Boo 2: A Medea Halloween.

OK, that's legit funny.&&This movie ia the perfect example of ""Bad concept, bad execution""&&üí©&&I think congratulations are in order for Transformers The Last Knight&&Nah, man, Book of Henry fucking deserves the title. That is one of the weirdest wide releases of all time. It's so bad it got Trevorrow kicked off Star Wars. 

Not to mention it features Sarah Silverman kissing a twelve year old boy with such force it looks like she's going to fuck him right then and there. &&I want to see a Criterion cover for it. &&üò±&&I had to watch this cause of my kids. This is far from the worst movie of the year. It still is a pile of shit. But not the worst.&&Even winning a Razzie is better than they could ever hope. This recognizes it as a legitimate movie.&&I think I would have been willing to give this movie a chance had they not canned Popeye in favor of it.&&Over the summer I went to the movies to see Dunkirk and there was a mom and her two daughters behind me in the ticket line. I was pretty high and feeling generous after starting a new job, so I asked the mom what movie they were going to see she said they were going to see the Emoji Movie. I bought them 3 tickets to see the Emoji Movie. The mom, with tears in her eyes, thank me for my random act of kindness. I said, "" Don't thank me yet.""&&And to think TJ Miller left Silicon Valley to do this shit lmfao &&Yeah but my 6 year old neice fucking loves it. They made a ton of money. They don't give a shit about the razzies. &&r/Jacksfilms&&I'm surprised *The Circle* wasn't named worst movie of 2017.&&Just watched that on Netflix last night. It was mildly entertaining. &&The Razzies were awarded ""Most Outdated and Strained and Trivial Effort at Critical Satire"" every year since roughly 2003.&&And this was the first movie to be played in Saudi Arabia in 35 years...&&Worst concept? Sure. Worst *movie*? Meh.&&ü§£üìΩüìâüéûü§™&&üò©&&I watched Emoji movie with my 3 and 8 year old I thought it was more than OK, and I hate everything! Seriously.&&People give this movie a hard time but me and my Kids liked it a lot. It was a good movie imo. &&I enjoyed it&&My kids watch this movie when I need quiet in the house. I have watched various parts of it. It‚Äôs not Oscar-worthy, maybe...but it basically looks like Wreck it Ralph 2 is going to be a very similar concept/storyline. 

I hate emojis and smart phones and what they are doing to human communication. But this film? It‚Äôs not like the studio could have looked at it and said, ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs no audience for *that*.‚Äù

I honestly feel like this is a bandwagon thing. The movie is an easy target. What is so specifically terrible about this film? It‚Äôs no worse (and in some cases is much better) than *some* of the crap my kids want to watch.

&&Oh man, don‚Äôt tell my 6 and 9 year old.  They loved that movie.  &&Baywatch was way more painful. All I needed it to do was kill a fraction of a 12-hour plane ride. Pretty low bar to miss.&&I like to have background noise when I'm studying, so I often put on a show or movie that I have no intention of watching, just to have some noise. I put this movie on my Netflix specifically because I knew it would be so horrible I wouldn't possibly pay attention to it. 

I couldn't drown this out. I watched this trainwreck unfold over the top of my laptop screen and I couldn't turn away. The only good part about this movie is that it made me feel so disgusted with myself, I started studying harder to make up for the fact that I had wasted part my life listening to it. I made an A on my exam, so that was nice. &&Good thing TJ Miller left a good show for that one.  That was some great career navigating.  
  
&&Bandwagon hate at its finest. This movie wasnt that bad, and kids liked it, thats what matters.&&Is this movie worse than Left Behind with Nick Cage? Even for the laughs?&&It was pretty good. My daughter loved it.&&This whole Razzie thing seems too easy. They just pick on easy targets. 

I mean, yeah, the Emoji Movie probably wasn't very good (I haven't seen it, I wouldn't know) but what is the point in going on about it? I'm sure it's bad in an entirely normal way. If you're going to pick on bad movies why not have something interesting to say about them?&&I enjoyed it, better than most movies i watch due to having a 2 and 4 year old. Really didn't seem much different from lego movie to me.&&That‚Äôs ‚ÄúOscar Nominated The Emoji Movie‚Äù to you!&&Unpopular opinion, it wasn't that bad. Definitely not unwatchable. I gave it a fair chance and it was fine. I'm not the target audience. It's meant for children. I feel the same way about a majority of kids movies that come out. The only reason frozen was better in my book in was because it had music. It wasn't music I'd listen to or enjoyed apart from the quality of it, but it was music. Both had lackluster stories. I really connected with the main character of the emoji movie. Never really being good enough and trying to be someone I'm not. Definitely a cliche but at least I found myself being mildly connected in that way before I was promptly torn out of it from the bad writing and. I gave it a 5/10.

But I'm also someone who likes the Office better after Michael leaves.

The emoji movie was nowhere near good, but it wasn't truly bad. The only truly bad movies I ever see are horribly low budget movies with trash directors. There are a lot of absolutely disgusting and horrible movies that I could never bring myself to watch even ironically. This movie isn't even close to one of them&&Kids actually loved it though. And you know who makes parents spend most of their money on. &&What a bunch of shit. It is a animated movie made for kids. That‚Äôs it. There were plenty of crap movies made. This one was ok. &&Does The Emoji Movie suck? Yes, yes it does. Does The Emoji Movie provide me with countless hours of silence from my three little ones so I can play Switch or do homework or literally have peace and quiet? Yes, yes it does. All hail The Emoji Movie!!!!&&Is this the first movie to get an Oscar and and a Razzie nod?&&But it has the pineapple pen guy! Surely that is a mark of quality.&&He's won the same award before, apparently. As has Adam Sandler.&&Dude is going to make 100 more of them too he has a $600,000,000 net worth.&&John Candy similarly won for a cross-dressing role in Nothing But Trouble. The Razzies are known for being cheeky. If they actually gave the award to the worst actors that would just be sad. &&They made two of those...wow.&&That's every Tyler Perry movie....&&I have never heard of this actor or movie series until my coworker mentioned it yesterday. Fucking <german_name> effect. &&And Netflix gives it a 95% match for me.  And no I don‚Äôt have kids.  Their new rating system is ass.&&I haven't seen it, but is it actually worse than The last Airbender?  That's my go to movie for ""worst movie I can imagine""&&I think it should just be bad execution at this point since Wreck it Ralph 2 has almost the same plot line and people are drooling over that trailer.&&50 mill budget, 217 mill boxoffice. seems like good idea, good execution; at least in dollars and cents.&&And yet Wreck it Ralph 2 will be basically the same concept, good execution. And it‚Äôs getting praise already.

So is a good execution the only thing that is important?&&Why, Patrick Stewart? Why?&&I came here to see a comments section full of emojis, I leave üòû&&I watch it every week for my podcast with my best friend, can't wait to see what it won!&&I just read the synopsis on wiki. Holy balls, what the fuck&&I haven't seen it but Dan Olson's dissection of it is great https://youtu.be/GMb7-6eg4Zo 

What a ridiculous movie&&> Not to mention it features Sarah Silverman kissing a twelve year old boy with such force it looks like she's going to fuck him right then and there.

Sweet mother of monkey milk!&&>Not to mention it features Sarah Silverman kissing a twelve year old boy with such force it looks like she's going to fuck him right then and there. 

So what you are saying is that I should watch the movie.&&Can I get a link? &&As a general rule, almost every award for ""worst of X"" you hear about will be way off. Because most of the really bad things don't get any attention at all, so you have to go to a *lot* of effort to find them. And all of that effort is spent, in this case, watching terrible movies. &&[here you go](http://i.imgur.com/qUbzdlv.png)&&[You asked for it](https://i.imgur.com/6imP2NE.jpg)&&What is a criterion cover?&&#üòí&&üçÜ&&üòë&&üçïüí©&&Of 2017 movies I watched, the Circle was the worst. How you can take high quality actors and have the worst plot possible with little-to-no actual character development beats me. &&I feel like the Razzies only go for the ""big"" awful movies. If you were to truly consider every single film released this past year you'd probably find some truly inane and nonsensical garbage. 

But when you narrow down it down by budget and general ""reach"" then Emoji movie sticks out as the worst one that a decent amount of people have seen. &&I felt the same. It‚Äôs completely forgettable and has no real purpose but it kept my 4 and 6 year old entertained for 90 minutes before bed. &&I had to as well and I agree. It had the same old ""two or three people go on an adventure, achieve a goal and learn important lessons along the way"" plot, stuck to it like fucking glue, and was reasonably well-executed. It was just another mediocre movie. And they knew everyone on earth under 15 would crawl over broken glass to see it and that they'd make a shitload of money, so who can blame them?&&Just watched this with my one year old yesterday, totally agree, was dumb but, not the biggest heap of shit I ever seen. Nothing has topped the TV show uncle grandpa for pure ocular carcinogen.&&IMO the worst movie goes to Flatliners&&Same here. It wasn't as bad as I expected. Not to say it was good. My expectations were pretty low. &&So Jack and Jill was a ""legitimate movie""?&&Yeah it‚Äôs actually just a 2h commercial for all kinds of apps... ‚Äòmovie‚Äô&&Canned Popeye? &&You monster. &&/r/thathappened. Good joke though.&&I am glad my son found boss baby instead.&&Right? We've got an 8 year old who has watched it 7-8 times since it hit netflix. The critics aren't the target audience for this kind of thing.&&I don't think the razzies care about what kids think of it...&&Book of Henry wasn't even nominated and that film cost Colin Trevorrow a Star Wars film.&&Oh wow, now *that* was a horrendous movie! I was really disappointed because the plot seemed like a pretty cool idea. And they had a good cast....so how the hell did they drop the ball with that one?&&Honestly though, no one who spent money to watch The Emoji Movie thought they were in for anything good. The Circle at least is based off a successful novel so one would assume the plot would be good.&&I was pretty disappointing considering that they had Tom Hamks and Emma Watson in leading roles and an increasingly relevant topic but I'd take it any day of the week over the disgrace for film industry that is emoji movie. &&Yeah ive watched a lot of bad movies with my kids, this was definitely not the worst. &&I think people hated the idea that this was a movie about emojis rather than the actual movie&&Yeah, I was expecting to hate it. It's not great, but I had no problems finishing it with my kid. I dont understand the universal hate it got. &&The best word that could sum this movie up is ""unremarkable"". It's not worth liking or hating.&&The only highlight they have was when Halle Berry showed up to accept her award for Catwoman.&&I used to find it entertaining but they've really lost their way. Rather than being an ""anti-Oscar"" with the same obvious winners in the same obvious categories, they should add some more specific and outlandish awards that highlight truly unusual and bad moments in films.

I would love to see categories for ""Worst Sex Scene"", ""Most Inappropriate Scene in a Children's Movie"", ""Worst Voiceover Performance"", ""Most WTF Moment in a Film"", or even ""Best Moment in a Terrible Movie"". They could create a rotating collection of such categories every year to mock particularly goofy moments like Liam Neeson needing 12 cuts to climb a fence in Taken 3 or Luke chugging blue titty milk in Last Jedi. I'd find this much more entertaining than confirming my belief that Adam Sandler is terrible for the 80th time.&&Congratulations on winning the Razzies' coveted ""Buzz Killington Award"", by the way&&you sound like a bitter winner.    :D
 
I mean we're talking about them here and having fun.   And they provide that recognition and discussion that any other award has.   Seems like a fairly useful thing on some level.
 
&&I‚Äôm still salty about them shitting on mother! to manufacture controversy. &&> Meh

Oh you&&Emoji movie failing film lol?&&To me, the worst part of the movie is it felt like a 90mins advertisement instead of a movie. 

Yea Wreak it Ralph also has the ""go into different games and do thing"" plot but they didn't feels like focusing it to us. Every games feels like it's a lively world and have their own culture, but the Emoji Movie on the other hand? ""Look! It's Candy Crash. Look! It's Just Dance."" Nothing feels right, they all feel like they are just empty boxes and the only reason they are there was because the companies behind the apps paid the most(expect the part with the whale, that was great).&&Yeah imo there are far worse movies. I went to a late showing of this movie when it was in theaters just to make fun of it and while it was terrible, there wasn't much about it that was offensively bad. The only thing that comes to mind is the dance scene, which was just nonsensical and annoying, but the rest of it was just painfully bland and unoriginal. Honestly, without the excessive product placement I think it would be just a below average animated film. Nothing unbelievably bad, but certainly not good.&&And there is also a plethora of much better made children's content out there. Just because children often can't tell the difference between quality entertainment and something with fun sounds and bright colours, doesn't mean people who create shit content to exploit that fact should get a free pass because ""it's just for children"". If anything the stuff we make for children should be held to a higher standard since their minds are still developing. Just  my opinion though.&&I am going to tell them.&&I just told my 8 year old. She gave me a ""who gives a shit, I thought it was funny"" look, then told me she wants to watch it. &&The bandwagon hate lowered my expectations so much that I think I might have actually liked it.&&Left Behind (AKA The worst film of all time).&&Please tell me you‚Äôre joking.&&Sandler won worst actor and worst actress the same year for Jack and Jill. &&> He's won the same award before

That's amazing, really.&&Adam Sandler won that award for Jack and Jill. That year, Jack and Jill won every single award. &&Glass Ceiling even at the razzies.&&As has Kevin.... She goes to another school&&A lot of people don‚Äôt realize how profitable comically bad movies can be if they have a low budget&&Holy fuck I thought that was hyperbole until I looked it up&&What's the point? I really can't wrap my mind around doing anything that would even resemble work if I was worth even a fraction of that much.&&Has any one person ever made a billion dollars making/starring in movies? Because Adam might be the first one to break that mark if he keeps it up.&&It hink the Razzies don't target sincere failures, but failures due to insincerity.&&How could you not at least have heard of Tyler Perry? His name is literally in the titles of his TV shows.&&Their new rating system is transparently meant to cover up bad ratings and try to get you to watch more shit&&Yea I don't understand it. The 5 star rating was good enough. Now every movie is nearly a 95% match for me. The lowest I've seen was 70% match. &&Its as simple as ""you watched X movie, and Y percentage of people who saw X also saw Z movie! Its not that you will like it, but that its related to what you see.&&Well, something's up. I didn't even notice it on mine.

Also, it does seem to work. My girlfriend and I share an account. My Netflix recommendations are far different from hers. Even the video that starts up when you log into Netflix is different (Remove that Netflix. It's annoying.). 

I don't know why it's working for me. But it hasn't been far off. If I'd browse Netflix, I'd thumb up/down movies I've seen in the past. Maybe that will help? &&Bring back 5 star ratings!&&Oh shit is that ""match"" percentage really based on your own viewing? I thought it was like some kind of rotten tomatoes type audience rating stat because my rating make zero sense either. I know Netflix is scared of their original programming getting bad ratings that everyone can see, but cmon, bring the rating system back. &&Criticker.com has a great Netflix sorting option that is miles beyond what even the old Netflix ranking system had.&&It's worse. Because Last Airbender at least has a plot going on and worldbuilding. The Emoji Movie is just one long soulless slog of dated references and audience cynicism. &&I broke down, bought some ciders, and watched the movie on Netflix a few days ago. It was bad.

One of the biggest problems with Emoji Movie is it really doesn't try. At all. And as you watch the movie all you can think of ""Man, they really AREN'T trying, are they?"" The story is overly predictable, and the moment you see the story's main villain you already know it's going to be them. The plot is impossibly transparent, and at some points even appears to try to steal concepts from Pixar... and fails dramatically. Each major scene leaves you with a feeling of ""I've seen this before a hundred times, but better.""

The jokes? Comedic puns a five year old would dish out OR painful dad jokes. Cringe-worthy. I wish I were kidding, too. Y'know the kind of joke people think of and instantly feel embarrassed because they're ashamed their brain somehow churned out something *that bad*? That's Emoji Movie... except they took the cringe and gave it to an actor. There's no intelligent humor, the dialogue lacks subtleties, and it never tries to reach for anything other than low hanging fruit. Poop Emoji in a scene? Prepare for doody jokes from any character that has to interact with him.

The only props I can give to the movie is the voice acting from the main characters is on point. That's it. James Corden as High-Five is genuinely enjoyable, and TJ's pretty good overall, but... that's it. That's all I can point out on a positive. The entire movie I just kind of questioned ""Yes, but... why?"" Emoji are too new to be a cultural phenomenon, let alone get their own movie. Everything about it just makes no sense, and half the movie is an ad for Candy Crush, Just Dance, and Dropbox.&&yes, yes it is.
many of the scenes are literally just adverts for phone apps and games &&It‚Äôs worst because if you close your eyes the last airbender at least has some cool sounds. Emoji movie is a train wreck of all the senses &&Yes, it is.  At least M. Nights movies are so bad they become culturally relevant, like they were so bad they're  good to watch.  Remember The Happening, or The Village?  So bad, it was funny at times.  

I actually attempted to watch the Emoji movie.  I really tried to give it a chance.  I reeeeeallly did.  But I just couldn't get through it.  The best part of it was probably TJ Miller's voice acting, but even some of his lines were cringe worthy.  I felt embarrassed for the other actors I recognized (except Sir Stewart) that they were involved in such a terrible project.  To be honest, I felt like I was watching the Lego Movie on morphine.

To fill anyone in on what the plot could possibly be, it's basically the same as the Lego Movie.  We're introduced to a colorful city full of wacky characters we already know and meet a boring person about to start their day.  The only difference here is that Emmet is actually happy, and the Meh Emoji... Isn't?  It's not really clear what his issue is beyond not being able to be Meh, which honestly sounds like a good thing not to be... I made it as far as when our Emoji Emmet meets Emoji Wildstyle in a bar and can, (get this) make any expression he wants.  He can become a lovey eyed emoji, or be a sick one, or an angry one, whatever.  On Meh's first day at work, he royally fucks up, destroys an emoji scanner while failing to be Meh.  Afterward, he's deemed a ""malfunction"" and is hunted by boots to terminate him.  Oh, and all this is going on inside some douchey kid's phone.  He tries to send a Meh text, Meh fucks up inside the phone, sends a sneezing emoji instead and that's the story. Again, I only made it perhaps half way through and don't plan on finishing it, but it was my testimant to give it a chance and see just how bad the film actually was.

It obviously was Hollywood trying to cash in on young people and whatever is popular at the time, but it didn't work at all this time.  The Lego Movie worked because on top of already being familiar with the toys, the story had relevance.  And it was genuinely funny too.  The Emoji movie had no joke it.  There was nothing funny to begin with about emojis.  The end.  Sorry for the novel.&&In my opinion yes&&I've seared clear of that as I liked the series. How does it compare to my go to worst movie, ""Battlefield Earth?""&&The Last Airbender was a good idea gone horribly wrong. The Emoji Movie is a horribly bad idea gone wrong. &&They‚Äôre bad in different ways. The Last Airbender is worse in the ‚ÄúPlan 9‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Room‚Äù sort of way where the people involved were earnestly trying to make something good and just utterly failed. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is awful, the CGI looks cheap, etc. The Emoji Movie is bad because it‚Äôs such a lazy, obviously cynical knock-off and cash grab in the wake of better movies like Inside Out and Wreck-It Ralph. It feels focus-grouped to death.&&> The last Airbender

We dont talk about that.&&Last Airbender was so awful it was funny at times. Star Wars: Holiday Special however is so bad it is ""special"" bad. There is no fun to be seen in that movie. There's only sadness and cancer.&&Maybe I had a different experince that other posters. But to me it seems that if you get past hating the subject its based on it's just your typical bad movie. It's by no means that bad though, shit tier movies like this come out all the damn time every year. It's not exceptional in any way.

As for if it's worse than TLA, I would say no. It's uninteresting and generic. But TLA was just a complete failure, people are saying the emoji movie didn't try. But they did exactly what they wanted to do.&&Most executions are good in the right hands. The Lego Movie sounds terrible on the surface and it‚Äôs one of the most enjoyable animated films ever.&&I think it has to do with characters. Wreck It Ralph seems like a good idea to people (although personally I disagree) because it's using characters that are proven to be enjoyable. The Emoji Movie starred characters that we didn't know yet and ones that were uninteresting beings (emojis) compared to more interesting subjects (video game characters).&&Wreck It Ralph 2 seems like the kind of movie that will have no shelf life. Or maybe it well, in the trailer thread people were cracking up about a lowhanging buzzfeed joke (these 10 child stars...number 6 will)&&> people are drooling over that trailer.

Eh I thought the trailer was just okay. Seems like there's a lack of an emotional core this time around. Hopefully there's an actual plot for the movie.&&Yeah I don't think they were going for Oscars when making this movie.&&Because why not?  It's a day's worth of work, presumably a nice chunk of change, and he gets to go around saying ""I'm the shit"" and be 100% accurate.  &&In the words of Michael Caine commenting on Jaws: The Revenge: ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!""&&He probably thought it would be a fun thing to add to his resume.

Patrick Stewart - The poo.&&üí∞&&For the money, dear boy.&&I love how this S-tier Shakespearean level actor just goes fuck it and agrees to play a pile of shit for an equally shitty movie, it‚Äôs poetic&&... why?&&The fact that it didn‚Äôt win is why congrats are in order. &&Well that was entertaining. What were the writers thinking making Henry such a know it all dick. &&Oh man I love that video. He really nailed the character of Goddamit Janice perfectly.&&It's this guy, Mr police.&&This excerpt from a review on Rotten Tomatoes is hilarious...

>>[Henry is a child savant of the highest degree played by Jaeden Lieberher. He is a precocious genius, good at literally everything, and a great parent to both his brother (Jacob Tremblay) and his alcoholic mother (Naomi Watts). From the start, one is misled into thinking this might be a quirky black comedy when Sarah Silverman shows up. One is never sure if her presence is ironic, but considering that the movie swerves violently into child sexual abuse, childhood terminal illness, and cop killing, it's safe to say that no one involved with the film was sure what tone they were going for. I can't leave out that Silverman romantically smooches Henry (an 11 year old) on his death bed or that Naomi Watts exhausts a veritable checklist of everything a parent should not do. ](#spoiler)&&This should be higher up than the other attempt in my opinion.

One of the main issues there is that while allowing people to pay to vote sounds funny on paper (the ultimate satire of the high brow academy) it actually just means the people voting don't watch the movies. Which means every year the results are rather predictably easy targets rather that people trying to figure out the worst Oscar qualified films of the year. Worst Accent could be fun ... But it would probably go to Patrick Stewart in the Emoji Movie because the voters won't have watched enough of the qualified films to cast an actual vote anyways. &&No he sounds like Screen Junkies talking about how the razzles are out of touch for nominating *Mother* and how Honest Trailers is clearly the best at this.&&I agree.

And that doesn't include the app or merchandising.&&It's less how low the budget is and more where the money goes.

Take something like Jack & Jill: not a low budget by ANY stretch, but it's agonizingly clear that the money went somewhere other than on-screen.&&I feel like actors and directors that have this much money and continue working just do it because they just like doing it. 

Like Patrick Stewart voicing the poop emoji in the Emoji Movie.

Boooo. &&It's so disappointing. Their old system was actually a selling point, and they even offered a reward to anyone who could improve on their algorithm. I even read an article about how Napoleon Dynamite was like the *one* movie they couldn't accurately recommend to people.

Then they just dropped it. Which is odd, because they don't have the same monopoly on streaming content like they used to. I would have thought they'd make more money by successfully recommending the more obscure titles they *do* have, but I guess they've got other reasons to not do that. :/&&Yep, and every original before percent score always had a high star rating &&I miss years ago when you could see what stars its algorithm (that they outsourced with a million dollar prize to come up with by the way) thought you would give the movie but then also what the average rating from all users was.  Heck, the UI was a lot better back then too before they made everything sidescrolling.&&Ironically, it has the opposite effect in my house. We take fewer risks on movies and now only rely on rotten tomatoes or metacritic for ratings. 

Netflix fucked up royally imo. their numbers probably say otherwise. &&So, more Patrick Stewart movies?&&On my daughters netflix profile, it said that Mulan is a 55% match for her.  55%!!  And her list is loaded with animated movies and especially Disney Musicals.  So there doesn‚Äôt really seem to be any apparent system at play imo.&&It‚Äôs not even a real rating system as far as I know.

All emojis need to be in their box when the kid is texting, and make one face (the exact same face) every time they are called upon so they can be scanned. So instead of doing that and having the potential for one emoji to mess up and get the whole phone deleted, why don't they just take pictures and scan those? &&[deleted]&&Somehow it looks like it even *smells* bad.&&The village was a good movie. &&Dragonball Evolution&&""Most executions are good in the right hands"" I couldn't agree more.

I think everyone agrees the Emoji Movie is nothing but a cynical corporate cash-in. If that's the case, wouldn't it be better parenting to NOT show it to your kids when there are works from legitimate artists trying to tell stories and teach lessons that kids could actually learn from?

Obviously either way you fall I don't think anyone would say showing the Emoji Movie to your kids makes you a bad parent, that would be absurd.

&&Well jokes on them because all I use Netflix for is The Office and Parks and Rec. &&I'm still shitty they dropped Marco Polo.

Admittedly, the Prime Minister from the first season was such an excellently done villain, everything after that seemed anti-climactic.

Once we ignored Marco and his insane gf, the other characters really picked it up.  Kublai, Jingim and his half-brother - they were freaking *awesome.*  Hope those two young actors get more roles - especially Jingim.&&I'm probably just being cynical, but I'm convinced it's only a matter of time until Netflix becomes an unrecognizable corporate monstrosity with no soul. So far, they've got the corporate monstrosity part, but they still seem to have kept their soul, somehow.&&Not always. A few were really bad. One was this comedy miniseries called ""The Characters"" made by a few improv comedians. It did not transfer well to screen and it was pretty abominable. I remember seeing a very low star rating.

This guy is a phony!&&That's part of the mystery of Emoji Movie. It's a film without a genuine target market.

The human characters in the movie seem to be early high school-ish (for what little of them you actually see) but no highschool kid's RELALY going to be like ""YEAH! EMOJI MOVIE!"". At best I can see the movie being targeted to (12 under?) but most of those kids probably aren't running with smart phones.

I read a theory a while back suggesting Emoji Movie never intended to be successful. Instead, their ultimate goal was to corner the market on emoji-based merch. You can't go to Walmart or Target without seeing poop'moji pillows or shirts everywhere, and the theory is that they wanted to corner the emoji merchandise bracket for themselves, and the movie was a cash grab to do just that. 

I don't know if that's true... but after seeing the movie it certainly *feels* true.&&[deleted]&&My 2 year old and my 7 year old love it. The 7 year wants to be a big kid and knows part of that is having a cell phone and part of that is using emojis so he feels like a part of that. The 2 year old is just learning to read faces and the movie is nothing big big exaggerated faces. &&I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt have kids ? My kids loved the movie, and they have known what emojis are for years&&3 year olds nowadays know what emojis are. Go YouTube 2 year old iPhone and see what installing about.

The entire concept is flawed across the board, especially given there's old and new Emoji. So... do Emoji die? Do they retire? Why does a new ""Meh"" need to replace an old one? It really makes no sense in a digital construct that their society would even work like that given data doesn't expire.

I wanted this to be the kind of movie that ended up being so bad it was good, but it wasn't. It was absolutely lifeless. And if it weren't for High-Five the movie would be absolutely lifeless.&&Advertising cynically targeted at children?

Now though it shows as a 95% match because I watched the other Netflix Marvel shows. Along with pretty much *anything* else. Like, I've never watched one of those Canadian sci-fi-horror-paranormal-whateverthefuck shows, there is **NOTHING** that I've ever watched to make Netflix think I'm remotely interested in vampire slaying or demon slaying or whatever the hell, and yet there's about 20 of these shows that are 98% for me.

It's like how I looked up a clip from Frasier of him shouting ""Oh good god Niles!"" for a joke at a friend, and then for **literally a year and a half**, 8/10 videos recommended at the end of every youtube clip was related to Frasier. Media advertising is just retarded.&&Because it used to adjust the number of stars based on what it thought you would rate the movie. You had to rate more content to train the system and then the star ratings would become more accurate. The problem is that many people expected the stars to be more like a rotten tomatoes score or something that was consistent across users. Relabeling the stars as a personal recommendation better represents the actual behavior. But I do miss the degrees, it was nice to know how much netflix thinks I would like a movie.&&Or you were just seeing the ones that had a high star value because that's how content curation is supposed to go?

EMOJI MOVIE!"". At best I can see the movie being targeted to (12 under?) but most of those kids probably aren't running with smart phones.

They're not High School kids, but they look up to them as cool. They may not have phones, (they do though), but they want phones because it's cool. 

You always market to kids by showing slightly older kids so the kids don't think your product is ""kiddy"".&&Executioner Hermann

However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.‚Äù&&Jaws IV.&&I never saw it, but this actually made me want to, at some point, on streaming or something, just because if they did the movie totally 'in' on the fact that this was awful, it could rise to the 'so bad its good' type of movie. 

All the reviews here seem to say it doesnt even do that though. &&Art has always been the playground of rich kids. &&*Sir* Patrick Stewart.&&Now it's a dumb hobby.^^^but_if_they_enjoy_it,_who_cares? &&Well I'm not going to dispute that.&&Isn‚Äôt there a podcast where a bunch of dudes watch grown ups 2 every week?&&Oh man, I was hoping that the book would be better than the movie.

Shit.&&I watch it four times an hour, at 10x speed&&I've watched it on repeat from the time I wake up in the morning till I go to bed every day since its release&&I have ten TVs set up around my house playing them on loop in canon&&You do get variety.

I keep suggesting die hard but the mrs isnt too keen.&&Oh my God. You might want to check yourself into an institution....&&Yeah I can appreciate that. I think we all agree kids aren't the most rational creatures, we were all there once and we kind of understand that. Still, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't treat art for children like it's meaningless simply because they may not be able to articulate the difference between The Emoji Movie and Toy Story. 

It's literally ingrained into our DNA to tell stories, it's part of what we are as a species, and while I don't think it's a tremondously important thing to ensure you show your kids genuine art instead of propaganda or corporate drivel, I don't think it's trivial, either. &&Didn't she also bring a wheelbarrow filled with DVDs of All About Steve to give out as well?

I remember her appearance there/at the Oscars was especially noteworthy that year b/c she'd basically been in hiding since it had come out that her husband cheated on her, and people thought she might not even show up to the Academy Awards since no one had seen her in almost a month, but, like, two days before, she just blazed back onto the scene, announcing she'd adopted a child and that's why she'd been MIA, turning up to the Razzies to accept her award and make a hilariously self depricating speech, then won an Oscar the next night.

TL;DR: Sandra Bullock is a national treasure.&&That‚Äôs amazing.&&Doesn't this happen often though? Popular actors/actresses will take one role so they can take another one?

I feel like Jontron's review was about the most accurate description of it. &&True, I feel like Duff dropped off after that one&&Were Sheen and Duff attached to the film from the beginning? It would have been somewhat awkward if that was the romantic pair when they started making the film in 2002, considering that Duff was 15 at the time and Sheen was 37. &&I can't blame the guy for doing what was probably a day's worth of work in a sound studio for who knows how many millions of dollars.&&Save some time if they just fly past the Great Divide&&Why lie? &&That's true, and some kids do have them, but it's not as widespread as a lot of people like to think.

You can't run an organization built on a comedy/sattire of award shows and expect everyone to be a super hardass about it. They don't expect anyone to take it seriously. When people like Halie Berry and Sandra Bullock show up, they're all in it for a hoot. No one is there to openly scorn these people; It's like being at a frat party and being voted ""Silliest Hat"" and the entire party yells ""SPEECH! SPEECH! SPEECH!"" at you.

That's part of why I love it when these people show up to receive awards.

It's blatantly sketchy as hell - who specifically breaks into the computer-filled office of a minor animation company, and steals nothing at all but a few very specific shitty cheap hard drives?

They put out a few decent trailer clips, claim the film is 90% complete and money's almost all spent on it, suddenly the film mysteriously 'disappears' in odd circumstances. In reality they only have spent a small amount on those few small clips, and pocketed the rest of the money.&&If I were a part of the production team, I wouldn't want my name in the credits.

>Amy dropped what she was doing, went black in the eyes for a second, and wheeled around on him. ""I don't fucking care if you like it."" Jimmy was visibly startled.

Die Hard + Workaholics feels like it should work. I'm hoping it does!&&It looks ok, but I doubt it will be great, unfortunately. Doesn't look like a super original concept.&&Yup! Trailer was TIGHT BUTTHOLE üëåüèº&&That movie with Adam was a chick flick but I actually really liked it. &&What about the cloverfield paradox?&&My understanding of the Cloverfield paradox is that it probably want originally meant to be a Cloverfield movie, but they rebranded it as such because they realised it was a piece of shit and wasn't going to get people's attention otherwise&&They're making another Bright. I'm on board. &&You're allowed to like bad movies. Both films had serious flaws, but they were fun. Not every film has to be Citizen Kane in order for you to admit to liking it.

Bright had severe lore and plot issues, the writing sucked and the acting (aside from that main orc guy whose name I forgot) was pretty dreadful, but there was just something about it that was *fun*.&&I liked both, too. &&I liked them!&&I'm with you there.&&I enjoyed Bright. I though a lot was stupid in it but it was enjoyable to watch and the world is interesting. I‚Äôd watch the sequel. &&True.  A new series pilot on a big network has like a 10% chance of making it past the first episode, and like a 2% chance of getting a second season.  There is so much garbage and crap you just forget about on nbc and cbs etc because its there for 2 months, and then never shown or mentioned again anywhere.  But on Netflix you still see the bad show pop up in the comedies section from time to time, but you can just scroll past it.&&Not to mention that one person's trash is another person's treasure. Netflix doesn't have to make a movie that everyone loves, or even everyone likes. They could make a movie that 90% of the viewers don't care about at all and 10% like, and that's really not a bad thing for them, because they don't have to compete with other movies/shows during the same time, since there's no scheduled slots.

The movie business is like that anyways - for most movies, theaters aren't where a movie breaks even or makes profit. It's the DVDs and then the decades of re-runs.&&Netflix doesn‚Äôt have prime time or off times. so all Netflix releases are kinda equal, within your algorithm. Watch a network for 24 hours straight and as you said, there will be a lotttt of shit on there.&&I enjoyed Polka King a lot.&&Love Rachel Dratch. Fun fact: She was supposed to be the original Jenna in 30 rock.

While the character makes way more sense as Jane, it is still sad she never got a big star shot. &&Might as well remember Gasteyer while we‚Äôre at it. &&Hopefully a drunk Dratch shows glimpses of Debbie Downer&&I am eternally hoping for that breakout role for Rachel Dratch. She‚Äôs freaking awesome.&&I'm not really that familar with her, tbh&&Tina and Amy are so loyal to her and look out for her. Not that she‚Äôs not talented, but when you‚Äôre not classically good looking, it‚Äôs tough to get in front of the camera as a woman. &&mothafuckers act like they forgot about Dratch&&Cameo/bit role &&Maybe small roll? Or maybe she will have other credits (writing?) and that constitutes ""featuring""?&&It means that it's featuring her like on TV but on Netflix so who knows.

There are plenty of good reasons to dislike Amy schumer (mostly joke stealing), and no good reason to dislike Amy Pohler that I can think of.

She was great on SNL and great on Parks and rec.&&Huh, So Jimmy Fallon is really just like that all the time, isn't he?&&I love that book so much I accidentally bought two copies.  

I have a best friend at work for the past six years.  This year, she may be transferred to a new office in another town.  She told me, ""You better still be my friend.  You better still call me all the time!""

I said, ""I know this is corny, but there's this autobiography written by a comedian and I want to read a paragraph to you.""

I read her that paragraph and told her that it reminded me of when she first started working at my company.

edit: in the book, Tina goes on to say that she thought to herself at the time, ""My friend is here!  My friend is here!""

And here I thought that was a pretty great pitch.&&Haven't these people done this kind of movie multiple times by now?&&It's not about women, it's about formulaic garbage comedies. 

I like funny women because I like funny people and that's because I like to laugh. I saw Ghostbusters opening weekend because they were funny people and I was hoping to see a funny movie. Amy Poehler is one of the funniest people on Earth, I wish she and Tina Fey had written and starred in the new Ghostbusters. To reiterate, I'm admitting to seeing Ghostbusters opening weekend, I love comedies, I love comedians, and I shouldn't have to write all this to defend an opinion that I think this is going to be the same shitty movie we've seen crapped out a dozen times since Bridesmaids. &&Am I really a sexist for thinking this will probably be bad? I just don't have any reason to think I'll enjoy this kind of film due to the talent surrounding it.

It's not because ""the wamen"" &&Is it? What's the last film in that vein that Reddit thinks is pretty good? Maybe This Is The End?&&Prove it. People liked Rogen formula the first few times they saw it and people liked the Bridesmaid formula the first few times. Both have grown old. &&Someone hasn't seen many Seth Rogen movies.&&I absolutely love Cougartown! The name is the only bad thing about it.&&Co-created by Bill Lawrence of Scrubs, for those looking for an in.

There's some Scrubs Easter eggs in there for you as well. Along with a certain character just blatantly making an appearance.&&The first like... 4 episodes of season one are good, but not great. Then they decide to drop the ""cougar town"" premise of courteny cox being a hot couger on the prowl, and just make it a show about her and her friends who are also neighbours, and it becomes amazingly hilarious. I cannot recommend it enough.

They were only pretending to make fun of it on community because they actually liked the show, and the cast and crew of community were friends with the cast and crew of cougartown.
&&I name all my favourite things Travis.&&I did, it was awful, made me think Joey was funny and not pathetic &&Does Cougartown have the same style of humor as Scrubs?&&I only recognize Christa Miller&&In my view this person is seriously misusing their headcannon. That's the sort of thing that ought to be used to take over the world.&&[I don't see what the big joke is](https://i.imgur.com/n1le3TE.png)&&I've been told that this movie single-handedly destroyed the US Merlot market for about a decade. You could get great Merlots for cheap because they had a bad reputation. Inversely, Pinots skyrocketed.&&Are you chewing gum?&&It's a movie about middle age and failure and coming to terms with a life that isnt what you quite wanted it to be. Miles is a guy whose aspiration is to be a writer but who never got his break.  Or who maybe just wasn't good enough.  And he's a guy covering a drinking problem with an encycloepaedic knowledge of wines.  And it's implied those things, and his tendency to blow up and get drunk when things don't go his way led to the dissolution of his marriage.  

And the movie totallly strips the little that he has left to hold onto from him step by step.  He learns his wife has remarried.  His book is finally rejected.  His loyalty to his friend costs him his chances with Maya and leads to having his car wrecked. He learns his ex-wife is not only married, but expecting a child. Until finally, he drinks his prized bottle of wine which he's been saving to celebrate the day he is finally published, alone, in a fast food restaurant, out of a styrofoam cup. And that's pretty much how the movie ends until Maya leaves a message on his answering machine, in part about how much she loves his book even though it wasn't published and he drives back to wine country to her apartment.

Earlier in the movie, when bonding with Maya over their shared interest in wines, Miles tells her why he prefers Pinot Noir.

>It‚Äôs a hard grape to grow, as you know. It‚Äôs thin-skinned, temperamental. It‚Äôs not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention, you know? And in fact it can only grow in these really specific, little, tucked away corners of the world. And, and only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it, really. Only somebody who really takes the time‚Ä¶ to understand Pinot‚Äôs potential‚Ä¶ can then coax it into its fullest expression.‚Äù

And that's all Miles can do really.  Move forward into the next part of his life and hope he can find that tucked away corner of the world with the person or people capable of coaxing him into his fullest expression.&&I think there is a distinct mood to the film, that grows on you with repeat viewings. I thought it was okay the first time I saw it, but now I  enjoy it even more and appreciate the humor more. Paul giamatti also makes the movie&&What eschton said. It‚Äôs a top 3 movie for me. Absolute masterwork of dead dreams and loss of hope. Beautifully captures the drudgery of real life. &&Bridesmaids wasn‚Äôt anything like The Hangover. They didn‚Äôt even have the bachelorette party.&&Yeah, you're right. This is more like the female Bridesmaids.&&My hopes aren't even up and I still think I'm going to be disappointed. That or it's going to be like the office sleepover episode of Workaholics and I'll watch it at least twice a year, just because. &&Ah yes, the Spore Principle.&&I thought it was great and I usually don't like rom coms at all&&That seemed like the kind of move I would be all over after drinking an entire bottle of wine, so good to know.&&Saw Devine to standup recently and it was a fucking trainwreck. Really didn't expect him to blow my mind or anything but I felt dirty afterwards. Seriously detailed my ability to watch him (and to an extent the crew I guess) in anything.&&Dogshit &&Contrary to that...other opinion, I liked it quite a bit.&&All they had to say was ""That guy from IT Crowd in space (no the other guy) and then things go wrong"" and I'm watching it.&&If the 2nd one gets reviewed slightly better then the first one, and one more person watches it then watched the first one, they will make 10 more sequels. I read an interview where they talked about how they are trying to make like a marvel cinematic universe type thing with multiple sequels and spin offs.&&Yep. I fucking loved it. And not in a ""it's so bad it's good"" kinda way. I just really liked it.&&Maybe not the best place to ask, but having watched citizen Kane what the hell is so damn good about the movie&&Occasionally you just want to watch trash movies that are enjoyable.  


On reddit John Wick is held up as a godly movie, but it‚Äôs just fun.  Plus the gun fighting is oddly good.  But it‚Äôs so ridiculous.  &&I liked when he slow motion spin shot all of his colleagues&&I definitely likes bright a lot. Where I think they went wrong was Playing up the prophecy thing too much. More movies need to follow the John wick model where they drop you into a world running and have a decent wrap up without ‚Äúbringing down the whole world‚Äù. If it had just been a ride along cop drama set in a crazy world with the main culmination being them solving a tough case and the orc getting respect it would have been a lot better. 

Clover field paradox was pretty good for what it was. &&Same. Bright seemed kinda all over the place, but I still enjoyed the movie and the whole theme of the thing. I think I saw that they're planning to do sequels, and I wouldn't be mad about that. The universe seemed interesting, and it's an interesting take on the ""elves and orcs"" fantasy genre. &&They would have written her different if Dratch had kept the part, though.&&Well, she did get to wrangle a cat in a few episodes. And then of course there was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMv6A3mKVA) breakout performance. &&I saw the pilot.  Dratch was good but it seemed a bit like ""if Tina Fey was the actress, too.""  &&I wonder do they ever use stand-ins for pilots? In other words they knew they needed to recast that part if the pilot was successful? Nothing against Dratch but even from the writing in the pilot she seemed to be out of place.&&Love the 1st season where Dratch keeps popping up all the time as different characters. &&She doesn't really have the face for the part. 

Edit: I realize that might seem like I'm calling her ugly, I didn't mean that. I just meant she doesn't have that aged actress look that I associate with Jenna.&&At least Dratch got to play a few characters on the show. &&Even more fun fact, she ate at our table before us in an nyc pasta restaurant. Our reservation was about an hour late, but she seemed delightful and at a family celebration. Overall she seems dope &&If Dratch got the part, I‚Äôll bet Jenna would have been a legit funny female comedian who got her own solo show that gets upstaged by Tracy and 30Rock would have focused much more on the actual sketch comedy part rather than the screwball work comedy it eventually became.

How Jane Krakowski‚Äôs Jenna evolved made better use of her singing and diva persona, (and likewise was a nice contrast to Liz Lemon‚Äôs bookish nerd) but it didn‚Äôt quite make sense to me that she‚Äôd be a lead for a sketch comedy show since she was way more interested in preening and singing and being an act-torrr than actually being funny. They even did a funny flash back scene where Jenna ignored the basics of ‚Äòyes-anding‚Äô (‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt, Oprah!‚Äù). 

Someone like that would never had made it into comedy (although they lamp shaded this by implying that Jenna basically slept her way to the shows existence).&&Instead she had what, like 15 roles?

For that alone, Gasteyer is a comedy godess. &&Right? I feel like she hasn't been in anything in forever. I'm psyched to see her in a movie. &&She was on You Made It Weird recently, promoting that live A Christmas Story, and she was lightning. Fun-ass episode. &&Happy Valentimes!&&Love her as the temp agency manager in Broad City. I‚Äôm giggling just thinking about it&&She is a SNL alum alongside Tine Fey.

It doesn't have to be a brilliant pitch to make an entertaining movie though.&&Yeah most people fucking loved Bridesmaids, I hope this is similar quality &&And yet this sub don't seem to give a toss when male comedians liken Franco and Rogen do the same type of movie over and over again, but draw the line at female comedians doing the same type of comedy about two or three times.&&>It's not about women, it's about formulaic garbage comedies. 

We literally know the title and nothing else...&&You're only sexist if you think it'll be bad because it's women and not men. &&I liked the (naming shows is hard) type parentheticals they used in the opening credits.  Even they knew the name sucked. &&Fun fact: It's named after the original BBC show, Cougartown Abbey. &&I thought that was a name to spoof on Housewives of Wherever this Season is Filmed. &&Absurd escapist television. Almost perfect in its scope and ambition. Never understood why it was not more highly regarded. &&At least the name gave us all the funny titles :) &&RIP Big Carl&&Except the name got all the funny jokes in the title sequence, so I'd say it turned into a good thing.&&Just looked up the cast and it had a few appearances from FRIENDS stars as well.&&Hooch is crazy...&&And Abed actually makes the cameo on Cougar Town he talks about winning on an episode of Community. &&Yes, but it's most obvious from mid season 1 onwards. The start of the show is completely different to the wacky brilliance from mid season 1 onwards.&&Yeah they‚Äôre both created by Bill Lawrence (cougar town has a co-creator I think) 

But they comment above is a little hyperbolic. Yeah a lot of the cast from Cougartown has been in Scrubs but it was only as guest spots or small  roles. 

Like Courtney Cox is obviously the start in CT but she was only a couple episodes of Scrubs. Or Bob Clenedin who plays Tom is the doctor who‚Äôs always trying to swing with Dr. Cox and Jordan. 

Speaking of Christa Miller who plays Jordan,  is the one person to be what I consider a main cast member of both shows. But she is married to Bill Lawrence. Not to take away from her acting abilities just pointing it out as to why she pops up in both so heavily. 

But they do have a lot of Scrubs alumni come in and guest spot.  Ik Ken Jenkins (Kelso) plays Chick in CT. He‚Äôs in a quite a few episodes. And Zach Braff (J.D) pops up in it as a pizza delivery guy. 

But Sarah Chalke (Elliot), Nicole Sullivan (Jill), Scott Foley (Sean), and Sam Lloyd (Ted) all pop up in multiple episodes. Plus I think the Todd pops up. 

Oh and there‚Äôs nice little continuity between shows. Sam Lloyd plays Ted in both shows. He even says that he‚Äôs going to Hawaii cause his girlfriend Gooch left him for a surgeon named Hooch. 

There‚Äôs a private practice owned by Drs. Cox, Reid and Turk that pops up for a second. 

Now I wonder if there‚Äôs like a connection between a lot of sitcoms cause I notice that these two shows have cast members or guest stars that appear in Friends and The Drew Carey show frequently. 



&&not only that but they make references to scrub on several occasions &&Side note, how the fuck did Paul Giamatti not get an Oscar nomination for Sideways?

I feel like that would actually help a story like Bright. The main issue I had with the movie is that it felt rushed, and would have been better as a 10 part series that explored the lore and characters more.&&It makes for a great platform to patronize people about movies.&&I think you have to amend it with a ""for its time."" Kane was revolutionary in so many ways, but what it did well and the precedents it set are all commonplace these days. It's good in a historical context, the same way Da Vinci's work is surpassed by like... a good deviant artist.&&One impressive thing about it is that Orson Welles was only 25 when he made it.

The DVD commentary by Roger Ebert is a great listen. &&I think with older movies the only quality you can truly appreciate is if it holds up.

For a 1940s movie it holds up vs a movie in the 21st Century. Acting is solid. Story is solid. Camera work and such are solid. 

Compare Citizen Kane to Hurricane Heist made in 2018.

For me the better example is Lawrence of Arabia. It might not hold up in the acting and portrayal but it is still the best looking desert movie ever.&&Go watch ""RKO 281"".  Its an hbo movie from 1999 that is really good on its own, and is about the making of Citizen Kane.  It really shows how fanatical Orson was about making the movie and how revolutionary all of his work on the movie was.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120801/

Also the problem here is the tvtrope ""the matrix effect"".  It completely invented a style of filmmaking and revolutionized things, to the point where everything that came after copied it, and you have been exposed to a million copies, so now the original looks bland when you see it for the first time.&&I watched it in my theatre class and remembered my teacher talking about how ‚Äòrevolutionary‚Äô the camera angles and cinematography was  the time. I think that‚Äôs it. &&Exactly. I thought it was a fun movie and a fun world to explore. &&Dratch's autobiography is pretty good and talks about it. She filmed the pilot as is and NBC went back and replaced all her filmed scenes. &&I like Dratch but don't think she would ever be My Baloney.&&I want to thanknone very special blonde white lady... Shelley Long you are truly an inspiration to me&&But then it wouldn't have been the same show, and I don't know if I would love it as much (just kidding of course I would.)&&I think she played like 5 or 6 small characters in the show. 2 more that come to mind are the Barabara Walters type interviewing Jenna about The Rural Juror, also that blue fuzzy bowling pin character that Tracy kept seeing when he hallucinated. I think it was Tracy, my memory is fuzzy. 

Edit: I just looked it up, she actually played 11 roles on the show. &&I don‚Äôt even have to click the link to know that I wish you a happy valentime‚Äôs. &&Exactly. Just a second Liz Lemon.&&I work in television so I know this one. The only time I can remember PURPOSEFULLY seeing a stand in was for a pilot presentation and not a full pilot. 

Pilots are so expensive to shoot that typically you want to avoid needing to recast anything so you can use it as episode 1 of your series. Now things get recast/retooled ever now and then and you do have to scrap the episode, but I don't think you would purposefully put in stand ins. 

I have seen a presentation where the idea was to replace with bigger names but it was like 10 minutes just to get like the structure of the show and it was shot for cheap. &&A lot of it is scheduling. Some is negotiating. For example:

An actor might star in multiple pilots. If more than one gets picked up, the actor might have to drop out. Same thing if they get a movie. An actor might have to drop because they are given a better role somewhere else. Keep in mind pilots are written and cast in the early part of the year, picked up in the summer, and then maybe the rest of the season is shot in fall, winter or even next spring depending on the pickup order. 

As far as negotiating: an actor might sign a deal for a pilot to a production company. They might attempt to sell to many different networks or streaming services. An actor might sign a smaller deal because the show is supposed to go to Hulu. But then NBC might come in and offer more, so the actors now need to negotiate a deal with the network. 

And then sometimes: the network makes a change. The network produces pilots, but independent production companies also produce pilots. So a network might like a show, but decide to replace and actor when they buy the show. &&The Jenna we know as viewers would've felt different with her as the character and after so many season we wouldn't expect anyone to fit that role either. So what we associate now with Jenna would be something else with Dratch. &&I don't know how to spell it either Cerie? But yes Katrina Bowden character. &&She's in ""People of Earth."" It's even been renewed for a third season. &&Check out Lady Dynamite. Show is kind of as bi polar as Maria Bamford is in real life, but Gasteyer is probably my favorite character.&&> Jenna Krakowski

Either Jane Krakowski or Jenna Maroney, but I like your style.&&She is still in a lot of episodes of 30 Rock as random characters anyways.&&Ann, you opalescent tree shark.&&Great now I've got it stuck in my head for the rest of the night.&&Having Maya Rudolph as a best friend is a great aspiration, she's awesome.

It really made me appreciate the technical achievements of filmmaking at the time, in addition to the stylistic/artistic choices. &&Had to watch that movie in Film Studies in high school.

Thanks in advance :)&&Jane Krakowski was just too perfect for that role.&&She just would not be believable as the ‚ÄòRural Juror‚Äô. &&Her muffin top just wouldn't have been all that&&Right, Janet?&&And Elizabeth Taylor. &&She was great in every one of those. Some people are born to play roles like those, and she is one of those people. 

Jane was born to play Jenna (and has been playing her since Ally McBeal, or maybe Vacation). &&IIRC, they were toying with her being in  most episodes as a different side character but found it too hard to write.&&The first episode she is the Cat Wrangler.&&She‚Äôs also works on the yacht Tracy sort of steals in season 1&&They reshot the pilot of The Good Place with a new Janet, I recall. Must have been a pricey reshoot...there was probably nothing wrong with the first Janet.&&> An actor might star in multiple pilots. If more than one gets picked up, the actor might have to drop out. Same thing if they get a movie.

Maybe in the past. For the last ten or 15 years at least when an actor signs a contract to be in a pilot, they also sign a contract agreeing to do that show and only that show for 6 years. Big names who have the option of doing multiple pilots have to pick the one they like most, and they cannot commit to being in another one until the first one has gone through filming and focus groups and finally aired or been thrown out. So basically you get to do one pilot every pilot season.

  Studios got wise to actors renegotiating for higher raises for successful shows after season one. The actors guild was pissed at it, but lets it happen. And unknown actors are so happy to be in one pilot that they don't care.
&&The other issue is that Dratch as Jenna would necessarily change Fey's character completely. Liz being ugly is a major recurring bit on the show. It works even though Fey is obviously attractive because ""TV ugly"" is a thing. You can put Tina Fey next to Jane Krakowski and the jokes land, put her next to Dratch (who she is very obviously substantially more attractive than) and it doesn't make any sense. It would totally destroy the suspension of disbelief. &&Yeah all I could actually remember was the actress had the last name of Bowen. I'm guessing the original actress looked too plain compared to the replacement. &&I think that's Maggie Lawson from psych! Psych aired over the same time period, and Katrina Bowden did a great job, so I think they both ended up fine.&&and she's awesome in it too. Very good show.&&KAREN GRISHAM! God, she is fantastic.

Anyway. Point is. I would love to see a whole pile of failed show pilots in one place. &&Just checked. It's not there :/&&It's been awhile since I've read it, but I remember being a decent portion of the book. 

If I remember correctly she felt betrayed and disappointed she was kicked off her friends show (remember Fey and her were friends way before SNL). She was upset that it was partly because how she looks, etc. 

However, it's autobiography, so she got over it in time and doing much better and happy with her current life situation since raising a child CHANGES EVERYTHING. &&She's also killing it in Kimmy Schmidt as Jaqueline. Her and Tituss just shine on screen.&&She's my favorite on 30 Rock.&&Jane krakowski is a national treasure.&&Yeah, but dratch is believably, and probably was, Tina‚Äôs roommate in Chicago when they were doing second city.

Dratch was very memorable and hilarious in every one of those ridiculous incidental characters. Jane K. WAS Jenna. 

Still, I can imagine that it'd be devastating to be recast in such a central role after the pilot so I feel bad for Dratch. &&yeah but the Janet we have now is really incredible. could very well have been worth it.&&I don't know if they ever shot that pilot of the Good Place. Originally Janet was supposed to be a 5th human (but played by the same actress), but they retooled the character. 

The show had a 13-episode order from the get go however, so I don't think they ever shot a pre-air pilot. &&Recently discovered The Good Place and binged it. Can't wait for season 3.

Related to your anecdote, I remember feeling very confused watching the first episode of The Incredibly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret, as it was *almost* the pilot I had watched previously, but one of the actors had been replaced. Every scene with him had to be reshot with the new actor. 

One of the scenes in the pilot is this part where the main character, played by David Cross, starts having a nervous breakdown while hyped up on a dangerous amount of energy drinks. It looked like an incredibly exhausting scene to shoot. And because that one replaced actor is in the scene, he had to do the whole thing over for the first episode.

I found the [pilot version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfPReIAKxeQ) of the scene, but couldn't find the one from the actual show unfortunately.


&&We don't really have '-town' words as far as I'm aware&&Personally think it was funnier than Scrubs was, but definitely not in S1.

I think in S2 and onwards they knew they were unlikely to be renewed and so they just said fuck it and threw everything they had at us, and it worked.&&You're probably right. I might appreciate at them more now. But holy Toledo those movies are ridiculously long! What was it with studios back then to make like 4 hour long films of just talking. &&Check out the Dead Pilots Society podcast. The John Hodgman episode is one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time.&&A failed pilot worth watching: *[Lookwell](https://youtu.be/dBQ3HbB0c8Y)*&&Anthology series, I guess.&&I never read her book, but that's what I got out of interviews with Tina Fey over the years.  Tina and Dratch were best friends, and Tina wrote the show with Dratch in mind to star, but NBC overruled her and simply decided she wasn't hot enough to be the female lead on the show and they wanted more eye candy.

Tina wrote a different supporting role for Rachel in almost every episode in the first few seasons though, the wardrobe lady, the cat wrangler, etc.  But eventually Rachel just left completely.&&If we're being honest though, the Jenna character we now know and love and/ or hate could not be played by Dratch. It sucks, but a diva type has to be played by someone who looks the part like Jane. &&""Titusville? I assume you have Titus friendly activities - swimming with your shirt on, food, couches?""&&I agree. She's basically playing the same character, but she's perfect for it. It just works.&&>Titus

Edit: Typos&&As someone who has seen the show through several times, I find her character better every time. And I didn't really care for her the first time.

I also see Tracy Jordan as less of an idiot each time; he's eccentric but extremely intelligent. And Baldin claims that the cast of 30 Rock taught him how to be funny - it's true, and you really can see him develop as a comedian over the course of the show.&&Mine too, which is saying so much considering Alec Baldwin, Tracy Morgan and Tina Fey are fucking hilarious&&Do you want to watch Downtown Abbey tonight?&&The Rurr Jurr. &&depending on how some life rights work out, you‚Äôll be playing a Janis Joplin-type character called Janie Jimplin or Janet Jopler.&&Jormp-Jomp.

That John Hodgman dude is great.&&Oh her leaving totally was either a Tina/NBC thing. That's brought up too. &&Yeah, it's possible that Dratch's character could have been fantastic, but there's no way it could have been the same character that we ended up with.&&And that's the long and short of it. Dratch would have played a Jenna that was a lot like Lemon - two homey looking women from a small town with a comedy routine, that somehow made it to 30 Rock. I don't think a lack of eye candy is a problem even, it's just that making Jenna anything but Krakowski means two very redundant lead characters. &&What are you talking about?

Cut to present day. Vin Diesel is the eldest brother despite being the shortest of the physically impressive 3. Terry is the middle one and the Rock is the youngest. The movie opens with them helping out in their parents Chinese restaurant, Vin Diesel is manning the wok, Terry is chopping up vegetables and meat with a cleaver like a pro and the Rock is hosting and waiting on tables.

The restaurant has seen better days and the brothers are struggling to find out how to keep it afloat when a gang of Triads come in and try to extort their parents for ""protection"" money. The brothers have been raised humbly by their Chinese parents but when one of the Triad gangsters takes out a knife and walks towards their mother, Terry throws his cleaver in to the Triad's back, killing him. We learn this gangster was the Triad leader's younger brother, and he vows to exact revenge.

The 3 brothers who are not trained fighters must figure out how to combat the Triad while simultaneously saving the restaurant. During their blundering encounters where they fight the Triads, certain fight scenes and action moments inspire the brothers with new recipes, like when a Triad throws a grenade and a Steamed Pork Bun (Char Siu Bao) cart explodes. Browned pieces of the buns land in one of the Triad's bowl of tonkotsu ramen broth that he was eating before the fight. The little browned pork buns with the broth give Terry the idea to make a hearty tonkotsu soup with Char Siu Bao dumplings.

The brothers fight to defeat the Triads and along the way get inspired with enough recipe ideas to turn their parents restaurant in to one of the most popular Michelin Star Asian Fusion restaurants in China.&&I got you even better. Vin Diesel singing Rihanna:

https://youtu.be/gzxoGArufdc&&The fact that he's really one of the backup voices in the song really made it for me when this song came out.&&This is beautiful.&&this was actually really good lol&&My friend was all ""I like Duke Nukem but I'm worried about Michael Bay directing the movie, it'll be garbage"" and I was like ""Michael Bay is the only director capable of directing that movie properly"".&&>Like Best Director will NEVER go to Michael Bay because there's nothing elegant about a perfect well timed explosion coinciding with a car flying through fire.

You say that, but George Miller was nominated for Fury Road in 2016. &&Ahh yes I really enjoyed Michael Bays work on TMNT. 2 minutes into the movie and megan fox is on a trampoline. It's subtly like that the Oscars committee miss. And Will Arnett as loud annoying guy? Perfection. &&> there's nothing elegant about a perfect well timed explosion coinciding with a car flying through fire.

NOTHING is more elegant than that&&That is literally the only part from the military tribute I remember.&&r/OutOfTheLoop Why is Matt Damon the butt of the joke now?&&Was he even there?&&I'm pretty sure that guy is a war criminal now, but whatever.&&Glad I'm not the only one who thought it was a little out of nowhere, Wes Studi and all.  &&It felt like it was meant to pander to ""middle America.""&&I thought the whole point of that was so Hollywood could be like ""See??? We're not all liberal hippy SJW communists! We support the military as well!""&&I would have been fine with it and the other montages if they didn't cut the speeches short just to show montages.&&It's nothing special, it was just yet another Oscars montage of classic movie clips. This one was in the theme of war movies so they had all the classic, and one of the scenes had Matt Damon (I believe Saving Private Ryan).

After the montage, Kimmel comes on and says something like ""Sorry for showing Matt damon"", as a reference to the joke he has on his own show where he keeps fighting with Matt Damon.

The most low hanging fruit joke, basically.&&In the middle of the Oscars ceremony there was a random montage of how war has been depicted in film. It was very out of nowhere and in the current sociopolitical climate was borderline inappropriate. Okay maybe not inappropriate but a little cringey. &&Precisely my thought&&Just watch more lonely island. Have you ever seen hot rod? Probably one of the most under rated comedies in the last (I almost said ten) 11 years. 

Also their failed show awesometown is actually gold 

Edit: start here - nsfw - https://youtu.be/cYzdtL4X0U8&&We could crowd source it... i'd throw in 5 dollars&&Watching Aquaman bone a woman or the Oscars?

If boning a fish man  then Game of Thrones. The characters look similar so not hard to pretend Aquaman is boning Dani.&&Yeah, but we only like 4&&do it like they did in Ragnarok, and get the less successful and well know Hemsworth to play thor again&&They do these kind of things for other award shows all the time though, they‚Äôre just all filmed separately and composited together to make it look like they got them all in the same room at once. &&The actors might do it for shits and giggles&&Nah, they don't have to pay all those actors, or they could pay them a little. However, Andy Samberg has enough clout in Hollywood that I'm sure he could've asked and gotten the talent to do that thing. Some of those people can be replaced as well and re-written. The Rock, for example, wasn't present. Vin Diesel doesn't want to do it? Sub out his stuff for something related to The Rock.

It seems to me that he came up with this idea and it was a case of The Oscars feeling like, man, this would be hard, lets not.&&Well, it can't be that expensive. The entire project doesn't even feature a single Oscar nominee.&&The more time your movie is in the public conciousness, the more money it will make. Studios should have paid for this just to get their memovies in folks minds a bit more.&&yeah Id be surprised if the actors would request to be paid to do this.&&But then we got the ‚ÄúI Saw Your Boobs‚Äù song from MacFarlane shitting on many winners. &&People have to be paid if you want them to do work. They‚Äôre professional entertainers and the Oscars is still a commercial event. &&There in the union. You have to pay them at least scale. &&They did something like that for [I'm fucking Ben Affleck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwIyLHsk2h4).&&You may be right, but I think your parent comment is still true. It would be better if the Oscars were more geared towards celebrating movies instead of what it is.   

It's like the show creators forget why people care about the Oscars. They drag it on way too long and include stuff that's so out of place and boring rather than fun things that remind people why they love movies.   &&They could have done it with imitators, like The Lonely Island did here. Or just get people to say lines into a camera no matter where they are in the world and compile it together.

I'm more in favor of the explanation that The Oscars is a bit too up its own ass to go as far as this video did in mocking their feigned highbrow nonsense.&&Seth MacFarlane got William Shatner, Naomi Watts, Jennifer Lawrence, and Charlize Theron as well as a few dozen others to fill the ""crowd"" spots around them for the pre-recorded [""We Saw Your Boobs""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jwtenNl77w) song in 2013.

So long as all these actors were going to be at the Oscars a couple days early, I don't see why they couldn't have used the stage to stitch together a video the way MacFarlane did.  Perhaps they couldn't have gotten ALL the actors in video, but they could have probably gotten a few of them and stitched the rest together. &&What is this, 1945? They could shoot everyone wherever they are and composite as necessary.&&Never seen that, but it was phenomenal. He's amazing.  &&That opening was at least partially written by Dan Harmon, if I recall correctly.&&The bitching is still valid, and no longer tongue in cheek.&&Yeah. I was hoping Patrick Stewart would get a supporting nom at least. Such a good movie.

I always appreciate big actors playing stupid roles like that that you know they couldn't have been getting paid a lot for.&&That depends on which weekend it is.&&We'll never know now &&Despite this years award show being a drag they always have self-deprecating humor throughout the show...&&But they have Kimmel host it who's career began with tit jokes. &&People make fun of the Oscars at the Oscars all the time&&Except for that time they got super meta and RDJ won an Oscar for a playing an Australian actor playing a black guy disguised as a Vietnamese guy just to win an Oscar.&&Or just dress The Lonely Island up as each of them. That'd be funnier, too.&&Barnard has a 16% acceptance rate versus NYU's 33% acceptance, so I don't see how that makes any more sense? &&Barnard is even harder&&Barnard aka not Columbia...lol, seriously though, Barnard is still not a bad school, and Lady Bird was hella average as a student&&Vibranium&&- 12-night Tanzania vacation for two

&&Who the hell else is going to understand the plot? Who could pull off The Duke? Sure as hell not Mel Gibson.&&I think Michael Bay would really fuck it up tbh. He's got the spectacle down, but not the writing; as simple as it is. To me, Duke Nukem worked because it was a parody of current trends that didn't take itself seriously. Stories taking themselves way too seriously for the content they're portraying is one of the major problems with a lot of Bay's movies. 

I think he might produce something more akin to Duke Nukem Forever. Although if he made the movie in a way that pointed out how out of place Duke is, it might work. A joyless, crass, sociopath acting like a complete douchebag and constantly verbally masturbating himself while every character around him cringes. Maybe. I dunno.

Funnily enough, I think Sam Raimi would do an amazing job with it. I'd also just love to see Edgar Wright take a stab at it. A hyper stylized Duke Nukem with his trademark humor, frenetic action, and attention to in-jokes and details would work so well.&&Bay would fuck up Duke Nukem by making it three hours long with 15 subplots about other characters who aren‚Äôt Duke Nukem. &&No, because Michael Bay will make it PG-13.&&Because George Miller doesn't fucking suck.&&Because while Mad Max was completely batshit, it was lean, well orchestrated, and visually stunning batshit. Nothing that didn't belong in in that movie made it into the final cut. Bay's films are batshit, but they're bloated, messy, and muddy. 

The Rock is a goddamn masterpiece though.&&Because George Miller made a great fucking movie, not just blow shit up in the middle of a shitty script. &&A lot of Bay's earlier movies were masterpieces.  Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor and Armageddon were all excellent films that transcend time.  Pain and Gain was surprisingly really good despite such a dumb premise.

Miller gas always done film... Bay has not.  Bay started off working for MTV making music videos and sort of just worked his way into movies.  He's the sort of untrained story teller Hollywood hates.&&The best picture this year involves a mute fucking a fishman&&What happened? I didn‚Äôt make it that far&&Its a running gag on Jimmy Kimmel's show. &&It's been an ongoing thing for years now. In one skit, they had a thing about whether Jimmy's kid was really Matt's. They've poked fun at the Damon/Affleck bromance, etc. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYU7xSMPCHw&&I'm actually not sure. I didn't see a Damon sighting and none of his films were nominated for anything this year.&&He taught me the value of patience.&&""Thank you actors for your service in playing soldiers in war movies that were also not real and created in highly protected environments where nothing can go wrong...and that Chris Kyle movie too."" &&And meanwhile, ""middle America"" didn't even show up.&&Like the beginning of every football game&&I‚Äôm in the military and I thought it was cringe worthy and also a little bit guilty of what you said. It also came at the end of a whole lot of tribute stuff so it just seemed shoeboxed in there. Idk it‚Äôs the oscars, no one expects any military stuff in that, it‚Äôs unnecessary. &&Weird... anybody got a link?&&Also Popstar: Never stop never stopping

Absolutely fucking hilarious and yet it's a film that really flew under the radar and barely anyone saw it, well at least here in the UK.&&:(&&Just have Matt Damon play all the characters&&His name is Luke&&You and me baby we ain't nothing but haddock,  
So let's do it like they did in Thor: Ragnarok.&&Or even just farts and grins.&&This comment is little perspectiveless. This video would not have been cheap and scheduling would have been a nightmare that required it's own Production coordinator, producer, travel coordinator, and a fuckton of other people that all don't work for discounts. Then the actors schedules would have been problematic. A whole production crew would have to fly all over the place several times over. Post with some level of VFX... $$$ Every dollar spent making this would be a dollar the Oscar producers don't have to spend elsewhere. Perhaps if they knew of this like six months out, it would be a bit less challenging. But still not exactly money they'd be spending comfortably.&&Aren't there union rates for these sorts of things?  As I understand it, it's really hard to get those waves for anything commercial, and this would absolutely count as something commercial.  They might have been able to get away with the minimum rates, but that's still a fair chunk of money.&&> Nah, they don't have to pay all those actors, or they could pay them a little. However, Andy Samberg has enough clout in Hollywood that I'm sure he could've asked and gotten the talent to do that thing.

Not necessarily. At least, it depends on the time frame. If they had a year or two it wouldn't be a problem I'm sure. &&> Nah, they don't have to pay all those actors, or they could pay them a little. However, Andy Samberg has enough clout in Hollywood that I'm sure he could've asked and gotten the talent to do that thing.

I'll bet Pratt and Evans would be gutted to know they're missing out lol. &&Sometimes they invite Pratt and just call it a space party&&Nothing will judging by the silence when Kimmel shat on weinstein. &&STOP TAKING THE MONEY!&&Yeah, I know we are kind of circlejerking ourselves right now, but I 100% agree with you. I don't know. I really don't care what celebrities have to say about politics. I mean great, use your Public Image to stand up for what you believe in, I get it, but most celebrities I wouldn't trust to do my grocery shopping without doing some weird shit. One of the things I always think back to, when I hear a celebrity say something political, is once I read an article about Dave Grohl where he was saying some real shit about politics, and I was like hell yeah man, speak the truth. The next day I found out on Reddit that he is an AIDS denier. Kind of made me take any opinion a celebrity would have with a grain of salt.

I don't know. I'm not sure if mine is the dominant opinion or not, but I kind of feel like celebrities should just smile and waive for the camera, and do their job, which is to entertain the masses. I interact with a lot of people on a daily basis as well, and I don't use my job as a soapbox to like, peddle the merits of the  free market lol.&&Terry is my fave. &&NINE NINE!&&Terry loves responsible agricultural practices!&&Where is the rest of Vin Diesel singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow accompanied by uke, that is what the world needs right now. &&BraveDuke&&Apocalypduke&&I'm talking more tonal than realism. All his movies are filled with **intense** amounts of melodrama. He always tries to appeal to these weird moralistic guidelines about what's right and wrong, trust and honor, about sacrifice, and then lathers on a heavy smear of jingoism. 

Just sprinkling in some poop jokes, a few stereotypes, and putting a hot chick in the middle won't make a Duke movie. It needs to be a self-aware parody if it wants to capture that same love that people have for the OG game; and not just end up as the franchise in name only.

Duke wasn't just lovable because he was a muscly dude who shot aliens and paid strippers. He referenced all the things we knew about at the time - movies, games, music, porn, current events, etc. From Doom and Evil Dead, to Shawshank Redemption, to OJs police chase. 

Personally, I think just condensing the franchise down in to a gruff, crass, douchebag who loves the smell of his own farts is what sunk DNF. Despite the nature of the IP, it needs a touch more careful writing. IMO anyway.&&That's what we call range, baby!&&Don't forget Babe 2: Pig in the City!&&He also did Babe&&I liked Watchmen. So, I don't hate him so much as generally don't care for him. Michael Bay can eat shit though.&&People did not have that reaction.  They left singing about LEAVING ON A JET PLANE&&And no talk show would put an A-Lister like that at the end of the show to get bumped. Hence the start of the gag and now their eventual ""feud.""&&Great, now that song is stuck in my head.&&And the response 

https://youtu.be/TwIyLHsk2h4&&I have seen these many times and I still can't tell if he is really crushed or if Kimmel is just good at acting.&&I‚Äôm aware, I‚Äôm saying I didn‚Äôt see Damon in the flesh&&Tropic thunder was used in a different montage I think&&I'm a veteran and feel I can speak for many of us when I say that shit was stupid af.&&Or haddock super weird&&Yes obviously they can lend themselves to projects at their will, unless they are currently shooting something, which they often are. Taking time away from set for events like award ceremonies is often written into contracts -- doing fun stuff with your celebrity friends is not. 

Also, many of the characters portrayed in the song are owned by companies. You'd have to get DC and Disney to agree for their IPs to intermingle. Gal Gadot can't just go be Wonder Woman in some movie because she wants to. Its far, far more complicated than that. 

You would need to juggle the schedules of extremely busy people, whose time is about as expensive as you can imagine. You would need to negotiate permissions and allowances from different companies that are often direct competitors. Then there are production costs for the props, VFX, mixing, etc. &&You realize they still have SAG and DGA contracts to abide by, yes? And depending on the budget of the piece those minimum day rates add up fast. Even so the rest of coordination and production would be quite costly, unless all those people happen to be in close proximity over a handful of dates, and the producers were OK with a very low level of production value (which seems unlikely given the event and the reputation of Lonley Island's previous content).&&They do ""fun"" projects, but you're really naive if you don't think they are paid for those things.&&His collarbones in that movie deserved a nomination all their own. &&He was painfully annoying as always, but in 5th that *was* good, so I don't know how to feel.&&Coincidentally that movie is half of the reason he was nominated for a Razzie.&&Good?!

And it‚Äôs probably an embarrassingly great amount of fun. &&Many of them dropped out of a formal education in middle school or high school. Very few have a college degree and real-life experience as an adult. That doesn't make their personal positions *wrong*, in fact, many of those positions are the same ones us rank and file reach on our own, but it does mean that they are absolutely terrible at articulating their reasoning, judging merit or importance, or getting people onboard with their ideas.

Average person: ""We should do more as people to protect the environment, right? I think I'll take my kids to the park and we can pick up trash as a family. That seems good.""

Certain MEGA-Celebrities who are completely isolated from the issues affecting everyday people and who live on, essentially, another plane of existence: ""Protecting the environment is the most important goal in the entire planet. Every dollar you spend that doesn't go towards my personal environmental charity is 30 pieces of silver the Devil has paid you to annihilate Mother Earth. Flyover state rubes MUST be reached, so I'm going to team up with a few other millionaire producers and we're going to fly all over the world spending millions of dollars so I can make a movie about a flyover state rube who realizes how ignorant he is to the environmental damage he's causing - we'll call it ""Honey I Can't Stop Shrinking the Kids"". If any audience go-ers complain about how ""preachy"" or ""bad"" it is, I'll personally call them out on twitter. If any critic derides it, I'll throw a hissy fit on E! about how worthless their profession is. That seems good.""&&Lethal Nukem.&&And, of course, the whole feud itself is a joke because they are clearly very good friends. &&In the beginning it was funny because his show was small and they had no hope of ever getting Matt Damon and yet they ran out of time for him.&&Flesh Daaamon.&&Yeah i remember that vividly cos they used RDJ's ""dude"" line.&&I'm not sure they would need legal permission for use of characters/likeness as this piece was clearly a satirical thing. SNL doesn't need to license Star Wars when the make a Star Wars sketch.

Obviously the scheduling and general production needs of putting this together could easily be prohibitively expensive, especially on what would likely have been a condensed timeline. &&True&&I don't know how they didn't get the Oscar for Best Costume Design in 1998. 

Oh.. *Titanic* won that category. Of course. Who could forget [those suspenders](http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2017/12/05/titanic-clock.jpg)?

Matt might still be upset about Kimmel fucking Ben Affleck.&&The gag created the friendship that created the fake feud. Damon didn't know Kimmel at all before Kimmel started the gag.&&Yes!! I got into Kimmel probably right before he started getting the big guests, it's so weird seeing how it's changed. I was definitely confused over the Matt Damon Joe's when I first started.&&Thats a good point&&Parody Law&&A 20 year wound about best costume. 

That‚Äôs a wicked grudge.&&I always wonder why period pieces always win best costumes. Sure they have great costume but they are never original, they're just reproducing past clothes. Plenty of other films get better costumes. 

To be honest, I don't understand why awards have such a hard on for period pieces to begin with (bonus points for true story and biopics).&&Fucking Jean Paul Gaultier invents the fashion of the future instead of recreating fashion we have clear reference for because it ALREADY EXISTS and they get snubbed. Such bullshit.&&The one time that ""zzzz"" *doesn't* mean sleep.&&Duke Max: The Nuke Warrior&&Maybe if Matt hadn't fucked Sarah this wouldn't be an issue.&&Let's be honest. It was bullshit.&&You should hear how people feel about Shakespeare in Love.&&The overall discussion reminded me of it; the Oscars have famously shied away from subgenres like science fiction and horror for a long time. (Fantasy, too, up until LOTR.)  I mean, no Star Wars film has never been nominated for Best Picture, and it's been 40 years since they took home an Oscar. 

In the same vein, Fifth Element wasn't even *nominated* for costumes or visual effects. Yeesh. (It was nominated for sound editing though, so.. there's that. Also the visual effect nominations were the second Jurassic Park, Starship Troopers and Titanic, so.. i guess it was a tough field that year!)&&I think its more an issue of constraints. If you want to make a hot pink suit then you can, and it may look super cool, but at the same time there is no challenge to it. Its just a hot pink suit, and if it was hard to make that hot pink suit then maybe you would just go for bright purple instead. If you are making a futuristic setting or an outlandish one then you are free to do whatever you want, and that freedom makes it easy to be creative and to express whatever you want. If something is too difficult, there are no constraints so you can just do something different. 

If you make a period piece then you know what they wore, the audience has an idea of what they expect, critics have a desire for authenticity and its just much more challenging. Reproducing a style of clothing from 300 years ago is harder then it is to create something new for the modern day, which is likely why they tend to get more awards. It is the difficulty of the task, not the outcome that matters. Obviously the retro-futuristic costume is going to look better then a period piece, but the period piece overcame a larger costume challenge then the retro-futuristic costume.&&> To be honest, I don't understand why awards have such a hard on for period pieces to begin with (bonus points for true story and biopics).

The Oscars are all about making sure people take movies seriously so that hollywood has political clout.&&Because the voters are all like 80 years old.&&The museum at FIDM in LA does an annual exhibit with the film costumes that year, some of which are nominated for best costume 

Last year I looked at the Oscar nominated single texture solid color dresses from La La Land next to the incredibly detailed robes of Doctor Strange and I still don't understand how these decisions are made&&I think part ofthe appeal to hollywood isthat period pieces age well. Do a movie about the 1920s in 1990 and then again in 2018 and by and large they look the same minus better camera quality and stuff like that.&&Because nostalgia is a hell of a drug.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - Official Teaser Trailer,38923,84593n,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sEaYB4rLFQ,3355,1520956870.0,,"WE'RE GOING BACK TO HOGWARTS&&Depp looks far better as Grindelwald when his mustache is complemented by a beard. &&""It can't be me.  It has to be you, Newt, a man who cannot control his own pets for longer than an hour at a time.""  Dumbledore I love you and your reckless disregard for the safety of others.  10/10 will be there opening night slamming popcorn into my face&&A return to Hogwarts, new creatures looking awesome, and a dashing Jude Law playing Dumbledore. Lots of promise here!&&Few takeaways I got from this trailer:

- The tone for this one looks so much darker than the first one
- Holy shit it was so good seeing hogwarts again
- Loving the look of Jude Law as Dumbledore 

So in for this movie&&I got the biggest smile on my face when Hogwarts showed up&&Young Dumbledore is exactly what I wanted: a charming, cheeky little shit sending people recklessly into danger.  A+ Jude Law usage.&&Dont get hyped, dont get hyped... I AM HYPED&&Oh damn this actually looks kinda badass.&&This movie could have just been Dan Folger wondering around Hogwarts for 2 hours and it would be just as amazing. He stole the show in Fantastic Beasts. &&Cheeky deathly hallows symbol at the end & Elder wand in the logo! This looks great!&&Only thing that somewhat bothers me (beyond apparition in Hogwarts, but it's on the edge so you could excuse it that way) is how all wizards are impeccably dressed as muggles. A recurring joke in the books was how wizards couldn't dress themselves like muggles at all. Though the movies never really took this into account anyway.&&Before today, I never had the desire to bang Dumbledore. But here we are. &&Actually really liked how Johnny Depp looked in the brief scene in this trailer &&""Teaser trailers"" these days just look like regular trailers to me.&&Kingsley Shacklebolt?!

You may not like him minister but you can't deny, Dumbledore's got STYLE

Edit: Sorry I appear to be wrong. I just got my hopes up they were going for a young Shacklebolt who I have always liked! &&Sexy Dumbledore and a return to Hogwarts?! Count me in!&&Anyone else excited to see Jacob Kowalski back? He was my favorite character in the first. &&Is this the first film to feature a Wizarding World logo? Seen in the trailer @ [0:47](https://youtu.be/5sEaYB4rLFQ?t=47s)&&I got chills when they showed Hogwarts. I never expected to see it on film again, a surprise to be sure.&&Love how they turn up the fantasy aspect in these new movies. It's so creative!&&The Deluminator

Thestrals

All the references to the Deathly Hallows

I'm excited.&&Really excited about this movie. My fiance and I finally watched the first one on HBO about a month ago. I couldn't get her into the Harry Potter movies back when we first started dating 8 years ago, but now she wants to watch the whole series thanks to Fantastic Beasts. &&The music at the end seems oddly reminiscent of **Infinity Wars** darker mix of the Avengers theme song.....&&But no one is going to mention the fact that wizards are wearing muggle clothes, even while at Hogwarts?&&Grindelwald Looks soooo much better!!&&HOGWARTS!!!

I'm really liking Jude Law as Dumbledore from what I've seen so far. I wonder if we are gonna see Grindelwald getting the Elder Wand or Dumbledore getting the Cloak or something of the sort&&Interesting.

From the ""It has to be you"" line it makes me think (hope?) that Dumbledore is written to be a manipulator/user of people, much like he was in the original series.

Or encouraging people to do more than they think they're capable of, depending on how you see it.&&I am so exited for this. I hope Johnny Depp kills it as Grindelwald.&&Seeing Hogwarts again has literally given me chills. This trailer has gotten me so excited! I think Jude Law will be a great Dumbledore, really intrigued to see what he does with the character. Can‚Äôt wait for November!!&&Jude Law as Dumbledore is better than I thought he‚Äôd be, and I thought he‚Äôd be pretty good. &&Was that Newt performing magic with his brother at the end?&&Damn I like Johnny Depp a lot better in this Trailer already. He looked more unhinged and less wacky at the same time.&&Youngeldore&&I do wonder why they stuck with the Fantastic Beasts angle for this. I mean, obviously sticking with the brand name and that, but the intention apparently is to gradually phase out Newt to focus on Dumbledore - so I wonder why not just start a new series? Young Dumbledore is pretty marketable.

Or, you know, if they're going for Wizarding World as the brand - and they've made a logo now, so this is going to be a while - it'd make sense to have a sort of anthology angle. Newt first, then quidditch or whatever, with the Grindelwald thread in the background, leading up to Youngledore.&&With Hogwarts making an appearance, I wonder if we'll get a Tom Riddle cameo - the HP Wiki states that he started attending the school in 1938 and that Dumbledore and Grindelwald's famous duel took place in 1945.&&I always thought you couldn't apparate on the terrain of Hogwarts?&&Grindelwald looks better but I‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs only is look when he escapes and he will look like he did last time for the rest of the movie. &&I absolutely love that these films are expanding out and showing us aspects of the Wizarding World that we never saw in the HP books or movies. We saw the American wizarding community in Fantastic Beasts and now it looks like we're headed to France in Crimes of Grindelwald. Say what you want about this series being a cash grab; I'm going to enjoy every second of it!&&Man dumbledore must have started smoking crack after this becuase he aged like a mutherfucker &&Jude Law looks fantastic Dumbledore! Glad that we see him smiling and joking.&&That was a very well done trailer. Between introducing Dumbledore and showing Hogwarts I don't think I've been this hyped over a trailer during the last few months other than Infinity War.

I'm excited to see where this goes. I enjoyed the first Fantastic Beasts. I do think the first film had too many subplots. While the Potter books did have subplots I feel like the books did a better job of connecting than this film did. I still really enjoyed the overall story and I liked the world building. The cast and the characters were also great in the film and the film had solid action and visual moments. I'm glad they are bringing everyone back.&&Depp looks great as Grindelwald, but Dumbledore never struck me as the suave, waistcoat-wearing type of guy. Visually it looks stunning already, can't wait to see a magical cabinet of curiosities. &&Newt's role seems so contrived, and it's his own movie!&&Looks good but I think this series would benefit tremendously from getting different directors behind the camera. 

We haven‚Äôt had a non David Yates HP film since Goblet of Fire in 2005. 

&&Was Dumbledore in the DADA classroom? Nice detail. Also the Deluminator makes an appearance!

Also, when Newt and his brother do that firey spell, it almost sounds like a air raid siren in the background...I wonder how much WWII will play a role in this film. Clearly Grindlewald is analagous to Nazi Germany, but I wonder if much the Muggle side of the conflict will be incorporated. &&At first I was like wait how can they apparate into Hogwarts...and then motherfucking Dumbledore! And some thestrals too in a different scene&&There‚Äôll be witches and wizards and magical feasts, to goblins and ghosts and to magical beasts. It‚Äôs all that I love and all that I need back at Hogwarts, Hogwarts!&&Where everything is Magi-coooooooool&&Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home&&Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom @ :19&&For me, this is like  seeing the Millenium Falcon again was for some people. &&I loved how all the text slides throughout the trailer had either the stone, the wand, or the cloak symbol flashing in the background (and each being in the title card, as well). Really looks like they are going all in on the Hallows‚Äîalways up for some connective tissue to the Potter world. &&[deleted]&&WE‚ÄôRE GOING BACK TO SCHOOOOOOL&&WE GOTTA GET BACK TO SCHOOL
WE GOTTA GET BACK TO HOGWARTS
WHERE EVERYTHING IS MAGIC-cooooolll&&[Gotta get back to Hogwarts, gotta get back to schooooool.](https://youtu.be/wmwM_AKeMCk?t=1m30s) And it's gonna be totally awesome.&&#SO. MUCH. HYPE.&&Yeah blonde isn't his best look, he definitely needs the beard.&&I'm just glad he didn't look like Johnny Depp with white hair this time. &&I would say this is the general rule. Most men suit beards, not nearly that many suit moustaches.&&Yeah now he literally looks like Marilyn Manson's old guitarist...&&Yes definitely, much less 'Hipster that can't quite grow full facial hair' and more 'demented crazy Nazi mudblood murderer'.&&Newt, didja put yer name in tha Goblet a' Fiyah?&&Maybe that's the point, Dumbeldore knows that trying to out-calculate and out-smart Gridnelwald is next to impossible, so instead he sends the ""Wild Card"" who can surprise Grindelwald with something he would never expect.&&I'm interested to see what reasoning they put behind Dumbledore not being able to do anything. It seems like the ministry doesn't want him to interfere. 


After Rowling said Dumbledore was gay, most fans theorized that was why he waited so long to stop Grindelwald. It'll be interesting to see if they include his sexuality in the film (which I doubt) or how they'll dance around it. &&Dumbledore's whole schtick is throwing responsibility on people who can barely handle it. &&http://floccinaucinihilipilificationa.tumblr.com/post/123904895387

There's a better comic about the disregard for safety somewhere on that page, but I couldn't find it right now. You're better off reading each and every one of them anyway. :)&&Jude Law looks great. &&Him not trying to imitate the older Dumbledore is a big relief. Doing that almost always ends up in a disaster. &&The hippocampus looks amazing&&> Loving the look of Jude Law as Dumbledore

What I want to know though is when exactly in the timeline did he decide to go from being dressed by Tom Ford to going everywhere in a silk nightgown? &&Looks way darker which should make for plenty of quick moments of comedic relief from Eddie Redmayne.&&David Yates has always leaned towards a darker tone, hasn‚Äôt he?&&I was skeptical until his face is revealed for the first time.  He very much has the same twinkly in his eye you would expect from someone portraying Dumbledore.  &&Darker or lighter, I just wish this one actually has a strong tone unlike the first one which was kind of a tonal mess. The Harry Potter series has one of the strongest and most distinct tones of any movie series I have ever watched (Post Azkaban ofc), so the first Fantastic Beasts was rather disappointing to me. &&Didn't the first one have a lot of child abuse and murder?&&HOGWARTS HOGWARTS HOGGY WARTY HOGWARTS&&> Whether you come back by page or by the big screen, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.

‚Äï J.K. Rowling&&I read that as ‚Äù+ a Jude Law sausage‚Äù and was like WTF!? o_O&&And dat butt. Never expected to be sexually attracted to Dumbledore, yet here we are. 2018 is *wild*!&&When is Jude Law not awesome?&&This movie should be pretty brutal on him, right?  I feel like I remember his falling out with Grindelwald being a defining moment in adding somberness to his character.&&I saw that first shot of Hogwart and I was gone.&&Fookin' Hogwarts&&Jude Law is killing it with Dumbledore.&&It's still hard to believe he's the guy from Balls of Fury. &&> wondering around Hogwarts for 2 hours 

I would watch the crap out of a movie like that. How much damn fun would that be to get a virtual tour of Hogwarts with such a high budget. Shit. This is like when IGN made an April Fool's trailer for an Auror show. I'm all let down now. &&Its *Fogler*- 

I just copy/pasted *Dan Folger* to make sure I was thinking of the same person and it was someone else entirely :)

(Thankfully Almost-Sentient-Google told me what I was actually looking for instead right underneath)&&I'm so happy He's coming back.&&That moment at the end of the first one, before he stepped into the rain, had me unexpectedly in tears.&&If you just titled the movie, "" Wondering Around Hogwarts for 2 Hours"" the movie would for sure be a box office success. Harry Potter is in the same boat as Marvel and Star Wars, anything attached to it is money. I would say the Wizarding World is in a slightly better situation as it isn't oversaturated yet. &&I also love the ""dark"" take on Hedwigs Theme that accompanied it. It's balancing the nostalgia well. &&The I in ‚ÄúCrimes‚Äù is the elder wand, the o in ‚Äúof‚Äù is the resurrection stone, and the A in ‚ÄúGrindelwald‚Äù is the cloak.&&Eh, some Wizards like Barty Crouch were amazing at dressing as Muggles. Seems like the higher up in the Ministry or just the smarter the witch or wizard was, the better they were at Muggle Dressing.&&Especially jude law when he‚Äôs being confronted by the Ministry. Dumbledore‚Äôs character doesn‚Äôt really go with the ‚Äúhot stud teacher‚Äù outfit&&[I like a healthy breeze 'round my privates!](https://b1nd1.deviantart.com/art/Muggle-Pants-25254504)&&14-year-old Harry Potter obsessed me would not have expected that by the year 2018 we'd get a Wizard World movie with a bangable Dumbledore. That wasn't covered by the way I thought the future would be. &&Hope you're a dude&&He‚Äôs not how I pictured Grindelwald, but I like the look as well. He definitely looks like a baddy.

Edit: To clarify, I pictured something like Bale in American Psycho, or well, Hitler. A sort of clean cut, psychotic type&&I'm low-key kinda hoping for the menacing _Black Mass_ Johnny Depp as Grindelwald&&They're the only ones I watch now. The full trailers will usually spoil too much&&If that's really Shacklebolt(I'm sure it is), I am really curious about the average lifespan of wizards now.
 
Edit: Not Shacklebolt, but a new character; Yusuf Kama played by William Nadylam

&&the phrase 'sexy Dumbledore' doesn't really sit right LOL&&The Harry Potter Cinematic Universe.&&I've been waiting for that. We KNEW they had to connect the whole universe via branding, somehow so it was only a matter of time. My guess is they waited to ensure Fantastic Beasts was a success before pulling the trigger.&&but a welcome one&&Absolutely! My favorite part of the first one was that the world wasn't shoehorned to teach the audience what magic was. They just assume we already are familiar with the world and had at it! The world they created was fantastic.&&I do feel like the first film spent too much time in the muggle world, it didn't feel as magical as the harry potter films. From the looks of this trailer it looks like they are really going back into the wizarding world, which is very exciting!&&I'm pretty shit in movie themes in general but isn't that a darker remix of the main Harry Potter theme? The one from John Williams.&&Glad I'm not the only one who thought that.  I was looking to see if someone else commented on it before I wrote it.&&Comparison for the lazy:

[Avengers](https://youtu.be/8VGJGXMUhmc?t=85)

[Fantastic Beasts](https://youtu.be/5sEaYB4rLFQ?t=102)&&It's most definitely a remix of Harry Potter's theme.&&Blame Alfonso Cuaron for that, he got rid of wizarding clothing in PoA.&&Not sure about Grindelwald getting the Elder Wand. But Dumbledore borrowed the invisibility cloak from James Potter shortly before he and Lily were murdered in the early '80s. That's a good 50 years after the events of this film.&&FWIW, in the flashback in HP7, Grindelwald looks like he‚Äôs in his late teens/early 20s when he takes the wand from Gregorivich&&Yeah, you can even see the hints of his world-weary silliness creeping in through that scene in his office. Glad JK is writing this. There's no other way this project will fly.&&I really hope so too. I was disappointed with the reveal at the end of the first one, but mainly because Colin was so great and I wanted to see more of him. Johnny has done great work in the past, I think he‚Äôll be able to do a great job this time too!&&That's what it looked like to me as well. Considering his brother is the war hero who Newt is a bit estranged with I'm intrigued to see how that portion of the plot develops&&Finding this out was like when I realised Hitler fought and survived in World War One. It makes sense but you never put two and two together. &&It‚Äôs possible that Hogwarts didn‚Äôt have as many protective charms until a serious dark threat proved dangerous. We could see a change in Hogwarts in this movie as Grindelwald becomes more powerful&&I don't care if it's a cash grab if it's something I want to see.

People complain about Harry Potter movies, Star Wars movies, Lord of the Rings  movies, Marvel movies but I want them to keep 'em coming tbh, even if the movies aren't that great it's still a little more time spent in those awesome universes.

If you don't want to watch them because they'll ruin the nostalgia you have or whatever fine but I don't mind having 20 other Star Wars movies lmao&&Sorcerer's Stone takes place 60 years after this&&Maybe Hogwarts didn‚Äôt have all of those protection spells until Grindelwald came into power? Would be interesting a different Hogwarts with fewer precautions&&What thestrals? All I saw was a carriage being pulled by ropes in the air.

I suppose that as someone who grew up with the Harry Potter franchise, Hogwarts is my Millenium Falcon or my USS Enterprise.&&It hasn't even been ten years. &&Well, it is a story about Grindelwald. &&It's all that I love and it's all that I need&&He does suit that better, but from a previous shot in the trailer and from a promo photo he'll probably shave it down to the moustache and Peaky Blinder haircut once he escapes prison.&&Now let's just hope he doesn't act like that as well&&Which I guess is fitting since he basically is Marilyn Manson's new guitarist IRL&&Newt would obviously be a conscientious objector of The Triwizard Tournament duento the treatment of magical beasts as sport.&&>Newt, didja put yer name in tha Goblet a' Fiyah?

YEEHAW!! *disapparates away*&&WILD CARD BITCHES &&How is Grindelwald supposed to know what Newt's doing if Newt doesn't know what he's doing? &&It's because of his sister's death, the one briefly seen in the painting at Aberforth's in Deathly Hallows Part 2. When Albus, Aberforth and Grindelwald were younger they got into a duel and in the chaos his younger sister was killed. Dumbledore didn't face Grindelwald because he was afraid Grindelwald would reveal who killed her, and Albus was always afraid of learning it was him. But by 1945 he finally confronted his old friend.&&In the books he didn't want to face Grindelwald. It seems like he felt guilt for what Grindelwald had done and become, he felt powerless. There was a whole thing where him, Grindelwald and Aberforth got into a duel, his sister tried to stop them and was killed, nobody knows who did it but Dumbeldore obviously blamed himself, even if he didn't kill her, befriending someone like Grindelwald and letting such a duel happen he shouldn't have let it happen.

I think he was scared to fight Grindelwald, perhaps a little cowardly  about it, there was too much emotion there. In the books it says that people had asked him to get involved but he backed down until finally he knew that he had too, Grindelwald was too powerful, killing people, it wouldn't be right to sit there and let it happen, so he fought Grindelwald and won. Basically this is before he fights him and so I just think he perhaps selfishly doesn't want to get involved with Grindelwald. Dumbledore in his younger days was of course not the same man he was when he was older and realised his power and influence and wouldn't think twice about doing what had to be done&&We didn't really have to theorize why he waited to go after Grindelwald since he tells Harry it was due to fear of finding out who killed his sister. There is of course plenty of room for there to be more than one reason, and there's always the chance that he was lying if that is a theory that sounds right to you, but the reason given is internally consistent with Dumbledore's fear of accepting his family's deaths, so I believe it. It's why he picked up the Ressurection Stone that led to his death - he could not accept their deaths.&&Hottest Pope of all time.&&now it's gonna be harder to tackle the ""were dumbledore and grindelwald in love"" thing. no one would ever believe sexy jude law dumbeldore would go for weird platinum-blonde depp grindelwald &&In his brief dialogue in this, it does sound like he's added a twinge of Irish. Just a bit, the same as Michael Gambon did. I quite like it.&&Honestly, Jude will probably be the closest incarnation of Dumbledore we ever see. He's charming, charismatic, powerful, and he can totally pull off the air of whimsy that surrounds Dumbledore. 

Richard Harris was fabulous, but something just feels right about Jude.&&Hippogriff? Hippocampus is a part of the brain, but i'm sure it does look amazing &&You get older, you just want to be comfy.&&In the books in the 1930s he is wearing a fabulous purple suit to meet with the Muggle orphanage about the eleven-year-old Tom Riddle. More than a few folks in the HP fandom are wondering why the FB Dumbledore doesn't have that colorful fashion sense. It's such an interesting part of his character -why forego it?

(also, book Dumbledore in Harry's time wears sort of classic Wizardy type spangled purple robes and stuff. The movies understandably went in a slightly muted direction, which I support, but I don't necessarily consider the costume design canon.)&&those are standard old-person clothes &&And from Jacob.

There definitely has to be bad shit for Dumbledore at some point in the story.&&This should be after the falling out has happened. I think this is during the phase where he knows Grindelwald is evil but holds off on the inevitable confrontation.&&And Take Me Home Tonight. That movie really surprised me. &&The guy has talent. He was in a few Broadway shows before he broke into film.&&So that's where I recognize him from. No shit.&&I don't care what anyone says, I enjoyed that movie &&The best part of waking up, is Fogler in your cup!&&I was fucking sobbing like the little bitch I am.      

That guy made the movie the amazing thing it is. I find that although many may not share my opinion or realise, however you want to take it, he had a huge impact on how audience received the movie.       

His acting was delightful and genuine, I have enjoyed few actors as much as him. It made one see things with his eyes and he also played a very relatable character, as many many people would love to be in his place - a Muggle, exploring the wizarding world with its unbelievable wonders.      

The cast in general was great but this guy just fucking made it for me - excuse my language throughout the post/comment.&&It was like the Avengers Theme meets HP&&Okay but what's up with a well dressed dumbledore?

This seems unlikely, because the source of this information in the books is Hermione quoting ""Hogwarts: A History"", which seems to imply this is a long-standing protection.

In the sixth book, the closest Harry and Dumbledore can Apparate back to Hogwarts is Hogsmeade, and they have to borrow brooms from the owner of the pub so they can fly back as quick as possible (since they can see the Dark Mark over hogwarts from there)&&The enchantment is supposed to extend to the entire Hogwarts grounds, not just the castle itself.

Presumably the teachers can just pick any room that's available and they like in the gigantic sprawling castle. There's only what, 300 students in total?

*title screen*

**Gindelwald kills Newt**&&This is what my mind went to immediately. &&The 1945 part gave me the impression that this whole Grindelwald plot will get intertwined with World War II. I do wonder how much the plot will get tangled with real world affairs, I could have also sworn that Newt even mentions being in the Great War (I believe its the same scene that he talks about his old girlfriend). Correct me if I'm wrong though. &&damn looks like I'll be reading the whole series again&&On the topic of Dumbledore's sister, she was definitely an Obscurus, right? It's implied that Dumbledore and Grindlewald were on the same side. Maybe that alliance finally ended when Grindlewald decided to take advantage of the the sister's Obscurus powers (like he tries to use the Obscurus in Fantastic Beasts years later).

I'm not optimistic they'll do this, but I'm curious how bad they're willing to make young Dumbledore. His character would be vastly improved if we discovered him to be Deatheater-lite as a youth but then changed and grew to be the force of good we know him as. It would also explain his belief that anyone can turn their life around (e.g. Malfoy, Snape).&&My personal theory is central to why Dumbledore knew, or at least suspected, that it was powerful love magic which protected Harry:

Ariana sacrificed herself to save Albus from Grindelwald, and thus Grindelwald was unable to harm Albus. 

He never faced him because Grindelwald knew this. Basically, in their duel Grindelwald would have no chance of victory. He would, and could, destroy or harm anyone or anything in an attempt to get Albus to stop.&&My personal theory is central to why Dumbledore knew, or at least suspected, that it was powerful love magic which protected Harry:

He never faced him because Grindelwald knew this. Basically, in their duel Grindelwald would have no chance of victory. He would, and could, destroy or harm anyone or anything in an attempt to get Albus to stop.&&I think he was also in love with Grindelwald at some point too.&&The Youngledore.&&Considering they were even younger (late teens/early twenties I think?) when they were still ""friends"", I imagine Grindelwald looked a lot more like young Johnny Depp. Who, quite honestly, looked *quite handsome*.&&His kink is ghoulish skeleton-men.&&I agree.  The way he says ""follower"" definitely sounds like Gambon.&&Yeah, I agree. When he says the word ""orders"" he sounds just enough like Gambon that it made me 100% buy the continuity between the two actors. &&I still would have liked to see McKellen in the role, regardless of what Harris would have thought.&&I thought Michael Gambon was great as well. There was only really one line that bothered me (and I'm pretty sure we all know which one that is) and it was probably written that way in the movie's script.&&I am reminded of the quotation ""you just cant help trusting Dumbledore"". 

I completely trust Jude Law, and I trust Jude as Dumbledore&&Richard Harris was great for the movies he was in, but I would have had a hard time seeing him doing some of the stuff that Dumbledore had to do in later books (the duel.in the Ministry and stuff with the cave both come to mind)&&Jude Law is a phenomenal actor. I have complete faith in his ability to portray Dumbledore.&&While there's definitely a hippogriff, the aquatic creature that someone is riding at 01:13 in the video is [a hippocampus,] (http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Hippokampoi.html) an aquatic creature from Greek myth!&&Shit man 18 year old me compared to 24 year old me changed to comfy.&&All he wants for Christmas is a pair of socks&&""I like a healthy breeze 'round my privates, thanks."" &&he cant really walk around muggles dressed in his best and pressed silk wizards duelling gowns can he? &&When Dan Fogler came into the mix in Fantastic Beasts for the first time I laughed out loud in the theatre because.. I mean it‚Äôs him. The dude from Balls of Fury, and Fan Boys! I thought I‚Äôd hate his role. Just another comedic relief. And although he does have his comedic relief I thought he played it very well and I was very wrong. 

His role adds a nice everyday character who is just so stoked to see magic for the first time. Especially when him and Newt are going through the beasts for the first time. You as a viewer share in his wonderment. I‚Äôm very excited to see their antics again. &&That dude is the perfect comic relief.&&He did the last four of the original eight actually, and I feel like you can tell from all the little worldbuilding touches that he's very comfortable in the world now. The atmosphere and general aesthetic of the magic in the first Fantastic Beasts what what endeared it to me honestly.&&WHETHER WE BE OLD AND BALD&&I‚Äôm down for some Dumble-dong&&I had to stop the trailer and go back to check it out again lol&&Well, there will be 5 movies total...so there will be 3 more movies after this one to explain all of that. &&And my all-time guilty pleasure, Fanboys! &&I love that movie! I remember watching it on Netflix and being impressed by how good it was.&&He won a Tony for his role in The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. &&Yeah I think I've watched the Infinity War trailer a bit too much...

https://youtu.be/6ZfuNTqbHE8?t=2m2s&&Glad I wasn't the only one, really threw me for a bit.&&They def inspired themselves from the ending of the Infinity War trailer, with the slower theme, just kinda suggesting the theme without throwing it in your face.

When doing a legacy movie they shouldn't be afraid to use the iconic themes. Pacific Rim Uprising should re-used the original theme which is awesome, Spider-Man Homecoming should have used the cultural Spider-Man theme that they used during the Marvel Studios logo.

Same thing for the TMNT and Power Rangers movies.&&Uhhh.... Dumby is over a century old, old people have weird taste in clothes even before you think about how Dumbledore is basically the wizard equivalent of an old cat lady. Dude gave up on having a social life in lieu of his work decades before Harry met him. 

This is young, sexy and gay Dumbledore. Still-has-crushes Dumbledore. Hasn't-gone-to-war Dumbledore. Of course he's going to be dapper as fuck in his prime in the most dapper decade.&&He‚Äôs friends with a longbottom&&Maybe not *quite* as buff, but yeah&&I wish we just kept Colin Farrell as Grindelwald.&&I still stand by Graves being much more what I expected of Grindelwald and was very sad that it was just a disguise. &&Oh I could see Daniel Bruhl...&&Daniel Br√ºhl would have been so cool. Maybe a bit too young? But then Grindelwald was only like 43 in Fantastic Beasts so they could make it work&&Yes, Fasbender! As soon as you said it, it clicked. I thought he would be handsome and mischievous &&Yes but they still age in appearance. &&I think JK Rowling said in an interview that they could live up to 150.&&No. And my parents also never had sex.

:P&&Just imagine a triwizard tournament movie set in middle ages. Or a Marauders movie. Endless possibilities.&&> the right directors would absolutely print money for WB if they were given free reign of an HP universe anthology-type thing.

And considering how well WB's DC has done, HP probably their biggest property going forwards, no?&&General Dumbledore&&That's fair, it didn't quite work for me, it made some parts very dull. Like I loved when they entered Newt's suitcase, that was classic harry potter magic.&&That doesn't surprise me...

I get why people love PoA on it's own but fuck me you can't half tell that Cuaron did not care about the source material. Like for the book that focuses on Harry's Dad and his mates they are virtually incomparable in the movie.&&To be fair though, once Pettigrew gave up their location to Voldemort, there wouldn't have been much that the invisibility cloak would've changed. Kinda hard to hide two grown adults and a one year old under a cloak.&&Sounds about right. I'm pretty sure that Grindelwald will have the Elder Wand from the get go. If I remember correctly, Grindelwald stole it from Gregorovitch when he was relatively young. I may have the timeline wrong (it's been a while since I've read the books) but I'm pretty sure that Grindelwald has had the wand for quite a while at the time of this movie.&&in my canon, he's just out there locked up somewhere like Mad Eye Moody in Goblet of Fire. Because you know, polyjuice potion and whatnot.&&If you had told me 10 years ago that Colin Farrel would turn into Johnny Depp in a movie and I would be DISAPPOINTED about that, I would have called you crazy.&&I was always hoping that Percival Graves was a real character that was replaced by Grindelwald as an impersonator, and that perhaps he wasn't murdered and would show up at a later time.  I can't stand Colin Farrell's early work, but lately he's been killing it.  Deserved better than he got at the end of the first film if that's all there is.  &&There is a flashback to Riddle in school and he looks 80+&&Don't, no, don't you go into that dark forest. 

Okay, well don't go looking for that stone. 

Okay, but for real don't go wandering the halls at night. 

Shit.

Alright don't go looking for Sirius Black. 

Goddammit kids, don't... fuck it, 50 points to Gryffindor.&&it was the 90's

all schools were more lax in the 90's&&Oh I agree wholeheartedly. The school needs some serious help, but it wouldn‚Äôt be Hogwarts if there wasn‚Äôt a risk of death every year!&&TBF a lot of the stuff Harry n Friends did at Hogwarts was technically agaisnt the rules. IIRC they weren't supposed to be allowed inside the Dark Forest until like Year 5. Also most of the dangerous creatures they met were because Hagrid was an inept teacher.&&Also possible. The dementors got pretty close to Hogwarts in the 3rd book/movie&&Or they had a closer apparition point back in the day.&&Wait... You talking about  Phineas Nigellus Black?? Do we know if he was headmaster at that time? I thought Dippet was headmaster during the 20's/30's?&&[deleted]&&Yeah, the anti-apparition wards cover the entirety of the Hogwarts grounds. There's no way those guys could have apparated in that close, unless the wards are a newer feature of the castle than most assume.&&Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders!

And also the best house imho.&&Great finders!&&My favorite will always be this exchange:  

Mrs. Weasley: ‚ÄúOh I came with Lupin, Tonks, Sirius Black, and your brother Fred!‚Äù  

Ron: ‚ÄúCool, where are they?‚Äù  

Mrs. Weasley: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all dead.‚Äù  


Also the entire Voldemort/Bellatrix seduction scene. &&[You mean this?](https://i.imgur.com/I6i7OOl.jpg)&&The interiors of the castle (and the grounds) were vastly remade starting in film 3 though, weren't they?&&They only started burning through DADA teachers after Voldemort got turned down and cursed the position.&&The jinx on the DADA position was left there by Tom Riddle after Dumbles told him to piss off.&&I DID MY WAITING. 7 YEARS OF IT&&[deleted]&&12 YEARS OF IT! WITH NO RAZOR! &&Arthur is absolutely my favourite. &&Yeah, it'll take a bit getting used to, it's bit too ""!""
But he's got the look in [this](http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-1024x576.jpg) and [this](http://www.baltana.com/files/wallpapers-10/Fantastic-Beasts-The-Crimes-of-Grindelwald-Widescreen-Wallpapers-29473.jpg) photo. So I guess that will be his look for the time being. &&I don't think The Psycho fits Grindlewald as a character, though. He's supposed to have come to power on talk of ""The Greater Good"", and had a popular following of non-evil people (unlike Voldy). It all went bad *after* he'd gathered his followers.&&That's a far bigger range than most Hollywood A listers. &&[deleted]&&And then you have Ed Wood, who is all of those modes at once.&&Where's Rango, Donnie Brasco, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico fit in here?&&He has a gangster character too.&&This is a really interesting comment. There are a few outliers (*Chocolat, Public Enemies*) but you basically covered his comfort zones.

If he just skims the surface of Whitey Bulger in *Black Mass* it will be a more bone-chilling villain than Voldemort, for sure. But I've always thought of Grindelwald as charismatic and magnetic rather than sociopathic and selfish. So, I'd root for a Sparrow archetype. &&Where would you rank his work in Black Mass?

That film showcases how versatile his acting really is. He's totally unrecognizable as Johnny Depp, which is a hard mold to break.&&Oh my god. After seeing the movie I can totally see why Luna Lovegood would end up with one of his descendants/children. So happy for them. Lol&&This guy reads the books! Wish they put the Sphinx into the film &&https://i.imgur.com/XjMCWW5.jpg&&[Harry grabs the mic]

""LIQUID SWORDS""&&I do wonder, since Newt's meant to have written and published his book by now, is there anything ensuring he survives this film?

He managed to survive Grindelwald the 1st time, though Gellert was more focused on the Macusa at the time.&&Maybe Dumbledore should ask himself what he should do if he was crippled and in a wheelchair? It seems to work out a lot better for that other guy running a school full of kids with powers. Well, aside from all the times mutants have been run to extinction that is.&&It would be interesting. This is a complete side plot but it would be interesting to see how the magic ministries handled pre ww2 vs post. Pre ww2 they undoubtedly are still the strongest powers. Post ww2 muggle science has gotten a foothold with power (nuclear) that can now overcome them. Would give great reasoning behind the rise of dark art users who believe it‚Äôs now or never to preserve the wizard way of life. (Think reverse X-men plot)&&Rowling did say it's very intentional that it happened during WWII, with maybe Grindelwald and Hitler working together as its been theorised. Newt's older brother was in WWI, he said to Jacobs he was working with dragons, IIRC.&&Newt mentions he fought in World War One on the Eastern front as a means to work with dragons in Ukraine.&&Another fun fact: Remember that old berk, Elphias Doge, from Bill and Fleur's wedding in *Deathly Hallows*? The one who claimed to be Dumbledore's best friend? Well, I actually highly suspect that [he's none other than Phineas Black Jr., the son of former Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5r64nn/harry_potter_elphias_doge_is_none_other_than/), and that he met and befriended Dumbledore when they were both students.

Which would mean that he will likely not only show up at some point in this film, if not its sequels, but he could well be be a blood relative of Sirius Black. Especially since they're already featuring the Lestrange and Travers families, both of whom, like the Blacks, are also Pureblood...and Phineas Nigellus Black, in particular, was a well-known ""Pureblood supremacist"". 

(Dumbledore also has several, rather interesting, conversations with Phineas Nigellus Black's portrait in the *Harry Potter* books.)

As an edit, [J.K. Rowling directly addressed, and referenced, one of my *Fantastic Beasts* fan theories on Reddit last year, with her new, in-character forward to the textbook as Newt Scamander himself](https://imgur.com/a/atCrF). So I wouldn't put it beyond her to have also read the above theory about Elphias Doge...&&this was my first thought as to why they introduced the concept of the obscurus, seems to fit the storyline of Arianna being abused by muggles into hiding her magic&&Dumbledore was intrigued by the Hallows same as Grindelwald and even sort the same goal as Grindelwald, reign over Muggles in a new magical order and he even coined the ""For the Greater Good"" phrase of the movement. But he also wanted the Resurrection Stone to bring back his parents. It wasn't until Aberforth confronted him and Grindelwald that Albus stopped, after his sister was killed, who I think was confirmed to be an Obscurus by Rowling.&&Ariana is the whole reason why Grindelwald is fascinated with obscurials. &&this makes a surprising amount of sense. I never could wrap my head around how Dumbledore defeated a elder-wand-wielding Grindelwald, but his sister's love would do it, being canonly stronger than death &&MAGIC cannot be measure in *numbers* it can only be measured by *INTENSITY*!

I want FANATICS in Hogwarts, because fanaticism is love. I want GREAT LOVE STORIES.

&&Jude Dumbledore and Johnny Grindelwald would have the prettiest wizard offspring ever.  &&[yeah, young Johnny Depp was pretty great.](https://i.imgur.com/knVtcGW.jpg)&&Yeah he definitely had the hots for them in the cave scene in Half Blood Prince.&&Yeah it seems like he's trying to imitate gambon's round o sounds and the measured speaking pace that he gave dumbledor.  Nout a great...foullouwer..of ourders.  But its subtle and not forced. &&Yep! This one word made me go back and listen again because it sounded so much like Gambon.&&Its been a bit since i watched the ~~first 2~~ movies. whats the quote?

Edit: Im not the fan I thought I was&&I thought it was a kelpie&&My mistake if I didn't explain myself properly. I never meant to imply he would wear wizard clothes in the muggle world. He dresses in a muggle suit to visit Tom Riddle at the muggle orphanage in the late 1930s and to talk to Mrs. Cole. While his suit is technically a muggle fashion, it still highlights Dumbledore's flamboyant, colorful style. Harry even teases him for it in the Pensieve memories.

In this trailer, set only a few years earlier than that scene, the ministry corners Dumbledore at Hogwarts where he has little reason to dress like a muggle. Of course, maybe he does and I just don't know what that reason is yet, and maybe he also has a good reason for not wearing a bright purple suit, but still, so far he seems to dress like a standard guy in the regular 1930s. This seems sort of a shame, considering there are two ways to make his costumes more interesting from a design-aspect, and I can't really figure out why Colleen Atwood would not take advantage of these things.&&Yeah, that's the beauty of Harry in the HP series.  He is a natural-born wizard so he's got the wizarding part of it all, but he has lived among Muggles his entire life, so it's all brand-new to him.  Sure, he's not the best wizard or the brightest, but everything you see, you see it through his unlearned eyes, which makes everything so filled with wonder.

If they're doing any world-building, a non-experienced wizard or a Muggle is needed to explain what is going on in the series.&&Fogler is the perfect wide-eyed, every-man optimist that I think we'd all be if we were suddenly thrust into a world filled with magic and wonder. He's perfect for the part and I really appreciate his character.&&He was the best part/character of Fantastic Beasts and it wasn't even close. The best scene in the film by far was him going around the zoo-brief case the first time.&&I personally felt that Jacob really stole the show. By the end of the first one I was far more invested in his story with the bakery and him and queenie than literally anyone else in it. Im really glad they decided to bring him back.&&If you enjoy him in this trailer and the first movie, I know I did, you should watch Fanboys &&Not just comic relief; he's perfect at reminding us of how immensely powerful everything is. He has no chance at doing magic, he basically has to brute force his way through everything.&&Yeah the Golbet of Fire was first PG-13 rated HP movie and it was made a big deal in news. I remember reading that the rating board thought the voldemort scene was too dark for PG rating.&&I dunno, somehow it always feels dull. When magic besides the white fizzes happens like 'reparo's or food being cooked magically, it's amazing, but for the most part it just looks dull. Hell, the last movie's magical duels were all just flashes of white light. Dude couldn't add some color to the spells to make it look unique?&&OR YOUNG WITH SCABBY KNEES&&It's not a garage, it's a carriage house!&&No guilt required. That movies great.&&""Nobody calls Han Solo a bitch!""&&No reason to feel guilty about Fanboys, it's one of the all time most underrated comedies to come out of the 2000's.   
   
""KAAAAAAAAAA-\*inhales*-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN!!!!""&&That movie was so underrated.  I watched it when it first came out and thought it was hilarious, then watched it a year ago and recognized so many huge actors in it that i didn‚Äôt know when it first came out.  &&> This is young, sexy and gay Dumbledore. Still-has-crushes Dumbledore. Hasn't-gone-to-war Dumbledore.

I miss the old Dumbledore, straight from the soul Dumbledore&&Same here, when he died I was like ""Well damn."" I could conceivably imagine him manipulating people too, he was hot and charismatic while Johnny just looked like death warmed over.&&Same&&Black don't crack&&[deleted]&&Just give us the Quidditch final we should have been given with Goblet :D&&So many good ideas to draw from.

Histories of each school  
History of the Ministry  
""Prequels"" of the previous generation (Lily, James, Lupin, Sirius, etc) leading right up to the start of HP1  
Post-HP era  
Sports/event focused (Quidditch tournament, Triwizard, I'm sure there's more)
&&Where am I?&&In the books, Dumbledore seems to be able to see Harry and Ron when they are hiding under the cloak. I'd imagine Voldemort is equally powerful enough and would find them no problem too.&&Then they fight and Dumbledore get's it or something?&&Nah they've confirmed he's dead unfortunately. &&[deleted]&&Butterbeer‚Äôs a hell of a drug&&Hogwarts has one rule: don't be Slytherin.&&The dream of the 90s is alive in Hogwarts.&&the dementors were allowed to be close in that one though, they were supposed to protect the school from Sirius Black&&Same.

And then, getting movies based on Quidditch Through the Ages and Hogwarts, A History would be awesome, too. 

&&Or they're meant to affect most people but not, for instance, senior members of the ministry at the time of this film but since Dumbledore has a distrust of the organization (as seen in later books) he may have revoked their ability to apparate in and out of the school when he becomes headmaster.&&The wards are in Hogwarts: a History, though. Hermione repeatedly quotes the book on the fact that you can't apparate on Hogwarts grounds.&&His awkward smile and sitting down sells the line so much. I love it.&&I love the Voldemort-Quirrell scene where they get ready for bed. Voldemort doesn't want to lie face down on the bed and Quirrell's messy room annoys him.
   
  
It was so funny to me because you have to think,Quirrell did actually have to go to sleep or go to the toilet with Voldemort on the back of his head being able to watch / speak to him. Must have been pretty awkward! :)&&Absolute mad lad.&&Haha yeah.&&So was the exterior of Professor Flitwick.&&IN AZKABAN&&Gary Oldman is a treasure&&DEMENTORS! IN AN OPEN FIELD HARRY!&&I love seeing Sweeny Todd references, cheers for making my day&&He should be like a sauve cult leader. A charming person on the outside, very charismatic with a veiled psycho personality underneath. Not psycho like the Joker though, more of a long-haul crazy. &&Which is why it's odd that this series takes place in the significantly less interesting time period of his life&&And isn't including all he can do too. He is a good actor when he tries. &&Like, entirely. The movie is a fish out of water parable. &&If Rolf is anything like Newt then they are a perfect match. &&Oh shit I saw a shitty watercolor 3 minutes after it was posted&&Perfect. &&[That is too good](https://i.imgur.com/ZuwfFGD.gif) &&I thought you retired&&Well, we know he has children at some point, as Luna Lovegood marries one of his descendents, and it doesn't seem like he has any currently.&&Damn that's a good point, I never thought about how wizards had the power advantage and it changing overtime&&That sounds right. Newt worked with ‚Äúdragon corps‚Äù while his brother was considered a war hero at the MCUSA trial after the senators death. &&[deleted]&&Totally left field in this but I wonder if Rowling would venture to Harry searching for a way to rescue Sirius Black from the void he was sent to.  I think it was assumed it was a portal to oblivion, but basically it was a place no one returned from.  I could see Harry becoming obsessed with this as his children are getting older.  If not with the hopes of finding Sirius alive but finding out the secrets of the void.&&*Obscurial&&I have some bad news for you&&Michael replaced Richard in the 3rd movie onward due to his death. In the Goblet of Fire, [this dramatic change](https://i.imgur.com/MiectdP.gif) occurs and it became a meme in the HP community.&&I mean, Harrys pretty fucking decent wizard.&&I loved watching him in the first movie. He's just so absolutely *okay* with everything going on, like he's having the time of his life. ""A hot chick is serving me floating pastries, this is so cool!""&&holy crap thats where i know him from!  &&I could see why they thought that. A weird looking man cut the teenagers arm to steal his blood, along with a bone of some dead guy, after carrying an abortion in to a graveyard and dropping it in a big pot. &&Well he did directed The Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore vs Voldemort was pretty cool to watch. Don't know why we never got more of this kinda of fights even though I get Dumbledore vs Voldemort should be on a whole another level. &&OUR HEADS COULD DO WITH FILLING&&""The hutch touch""

*air hump*&&After they're done expanding out Fantastic Beasts, Quidditch Through the Ages is the obvious next choice. Maybe like a feel-good sports movie about the Chudley Cannons breaking their hundred-year drought?&&Let's just hope The Cursed Child gets ignored. &&I never thought he could actually see them through the cloak so much as just recognized the signs of it being used. He did have the cloak in his possession for about a decade and probably studied and used it a fair amount over that time.&&Yep! My guess is that this series of movies will end with Dumbledore and Grindelwald's famous duel in 1945. This is when Dumbledore defeats Grindelwald and takes the Elder Wand for himself. This is also what ends the first modern Wizarding War which somewhat mirrored WWII with Grindelwald essentially being Wizard Hitler.&&Yeah but what do they know.

^^^Please ^^^let ^^^me ^^^have ^^^this.&&Dumby is more of the oak matured mead kinda guy&&a harry potter sequel really need to have the hero be in slytherin tbh.&&> everyone making fun of Slytherin

It always rains.&&They still weren‚Äôt allowed on school grounds though, they had to protect from the outside, hence why dumbledore is so pissed when harry gets attacked by one during the quidditch match. &&I would watch the hell out of a Quidditch film where a coach whips an underdog team of misfits into a championship-winning team, complete with inspiring locker room talks and all.&&His awkward smile with those ridiculously white teeth! Honestly, 7/8 years later I still remember thinking, my word they are white teeth! 

Also, did you know that here at Hogwarts we have a hidden swimming pool?&&Whose treasure?

HP1 with creepy Voldemort behind the teacher's head.
HP2 with creepy young Voldemort and the creepy Chamber of Secrets.
HP3 with creepy werewolf and Sirius and Pettigrew
HP4 with the creepy long awaited reveal of Voldemort and the death of Diggory.

After those HP I was no longer afraid of the endings, maybe because I was older but tbh I'm still creeped out by the first 4 HP's endings.

The Harry Potter saga was surprisingly scary for kids movies.&&Dumbledore v Grindelwald should be at that level, but nothing else.&&That fight was incredible. His visuals have gone downhill since. I've enjoyed his movies but they aren't super pretty to look at.&&WITH SOME INTERESTING STUFF&&Dude, you just called yourself white chocolate.&&Cursed Child? Never heard of it........&&I can see that, it's kind of ambiguous actually. If I remember correctly, he literally looks at Harry while talking to someone else but doesn't acknowledge it, so Harry isn't quite sure if he can see him or not.&&I wonder if we will see the wizard side of ww2 in these films, I wonder what a real full scale wizard war looks like in this world.

He's a much better actor right now.&&While I do agree that Colin Farrell was awesome in the first movie and would have done a great job as Grindewald, I like the new look that Johnny Depp has in this trailer and I'm still hopeful that he can pull off his own great version.

Steven Spielberg confirms Peter Jackson will direct The Adventures of Tintin sequel and will begin work on the script very soon,37455,86lksz,http://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/Steven-Spielberg-Peter-Jackson-va-bientot-travailler-sur-la-suite-des-Aventures,1086,1521819534.0,,"*""Peter Jackson has to do the second part. Normally, if all goes well, he will soon start working on the script. As it takes two years of animation work on the film, for you, I would not expect to see it for about three years. But Peter will stick to it. Tintin is not dead! ""*



The Adventures of Tintin 2 will incorporate two of Herg√©'s books: The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun.&&Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 7 years since the original! 

I always thought it would be cool if Spielberg did the first, Jackson did the second and Edgar Wright did the third (as he co-wrote the first one)... &&I‚Äôve waited for this for too long. The first one was such a great adaptation. &&I really adored the first one. Usually this sort of animation is uncanny, but Tintin did it right, and it allowed for action setpieces and a level of expression that can‚Äôt be done in live-action. &&The first movie was great imo. Hopefully they do an even better job this time. As someone who really loved the books this was a fantastic adaptation. Fingers crossed that it doesn't get delayed again&&I remember this was one of the first animated films that simply blew me away. The animators are absolutely incredible. Can't wait for the sequel!&&The first Tintin movie is a solid, animated movie for kids. It isn't 100% faithful to the books but it still has that Herge feel of wonder/adventure to them.

If/When this sequel ever comes out I look forward to seeing it.&&You know, I just realized that if you cross Haddock and Calculus, you'd basically get Peter Jackson.&&Now that we have Tintin, can we get Asterix & Obelisk as well?&&Kids are missing out not picking up the books to read.&&Thank God, I've been waiting for this four years. I'm very happy to see some sort of update.&&That'll be great. I'm surprised peter jackson hasn't done a fully animated film yet, it seems up his alley. And the seven crystal balls and prisoners of the sun storyline is really great. I wonder how the final script will introduce calculus, since the treasure-hunting part of the Unicorn story where Calculus first appears wasn't in the first movie. We will need to be rooting for calculus's return, so they need to give him some kind of intro. 

And i wonder what a third movie would be? On paper Tintin in Tibet makes the most sense, since it's such an incredible story, but it wouldn't fit the frenetic action pace that first tintin movie went for. Maybe the calculus affair? &&I wonder how he's going to work Legolas into this one. &&Until it's delayed...again.&&Any word on whether they're getting Steven Moffat back for this one? The original reason he declined to co-write the sequel was because he was busy with Doctor Who and Sherlock.&&Why so long? I understand the movie didn't do so well in America, but I believe it did well in Europe. I loved that movie.&&I'm so glad to hear that this movie is getting a sequel! My dad introduced me to the comics he grew up on, and I used to read his old comics growing up myself. I bought him a collection of the comics for his birthday a couple years back. He was so happy to hear a new movie coming out for it, and we both loved it from what I remember.

It's a shame he won't be around to see the sequel, but I'm sure as hell gonna watch it for the both of us.&&YES! I got such a classic Indiana Jones vibe from this movie that I was really looking forward to this franchise taking off. And with the boundless limits of animation they can do some crazy stuff without sacraficing the immersion. Bring it on. I'll wait. &&To this day, I still think the first Tintin might be the best-looking animated movie I‚Äôve ever seen.&&YES.  So happy there's a sequel.  I loved Tintin.  &&Closest thing we've got to an Uncharted movie&&Prisoners of the Sun and the Seven Crystal Balls, huh? 

The third one better be Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon or GTFO.&&***Billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles in ten thousand thundering typhoons!***&&I keep thinking of Percy Jackson....wish Spielberg would direct that&&I absolutely love TinTin and grew up on the comics. I was a little underwhelmed by the first movie, but as a huge Peter Jackson fan, I'm excited to see where he takes the project!&&While we are on the subject of French graphic novels.. did anyone see the Asteric and the Mansions of the Gods film that was on Netflix?

They did an amazing job, stayed true to the book and it was hilarious&&I never really had much experience with Tin Tin as a kid, but that movie was phenomenal, both the writing and the visuals. &&About time, it's been way too long.&&I saw the title and screamed ""Hallelujah!"" as if it were the second coming of Christ. Which it goddamn well is!&&As someone who grew up reading/watching Tintin - Holy shit, bout time! Thought the idea of sequels was pretty much dead at this point.&&Billions of bilious blue blistering barnacles in a thundering typhoon!  This news makes me happy. &&Man, my dad used to read those comics to me&&My thirst for adventure is every bit as unquenchable as it was when I walked out of the theater seven years ago.  I can't wait for this movie.&&Best news all day&&I looooooove the first Tintin movie. I was convinced this franchise was dead after they stayed mum for so long. I'm so happy now.&&Hell yeah! I watched the first one not too long ago and remembered a sequel had been announced but nothing came of it.&&What the hell.. I was certain this movie sequel was already made, with Jackson as the director&&not to sound entitled, but.... *begin* working on a script???&&YEEEEEEESSSSSSS! I have been waiting for so long. What's a few more years? I'm just glad the project isn't dead. Though, I wish they would base it off of the comics set in space. Those were awesome.&&Great! I loved the first one.&&I adore Tintin and absolutely loved the first movie. I'm really looking forward to the sequel! &&HOORAY!!! As a die-hard fan - I am so very glad to see this come to fruition. :) &&The fuck's been goin' on the last seven years if they haven't even started the script?!&&Fuck yeah! The first one was a real surprise. Haddock was perfectly portrayed, his alcoholism was like the second lead character of the movie, just as it should be&&Finally my username is relevant.&&I just hope John Williams gets to write the music for it, as he did with the first one. Such a fantastic soundtrack!&&Fucking loved tintin as a kid, didn‚Äôt get to pick up the books. Now I‚Äôm full of regrets. Loved the first movie, hope this one can come sooner. And they should be ready to make a 3rd one. &&TinTin was my favourite thing as a kid and I wish they had stuck to the same cartoon format rather than trying to do this mash up of animation/real life. Booooourns.&&I'll believe it when I see a trailer.&&That was a really good movie!&&Was hoping we'd get a mix of red rackham's treasure (which introduces calculus and ties off the last film), and the calculus affair (for the fictional politics and Calculus-centered drama). But this definitely has me hyped!&&I don't think this will ever actually make it to the pipeline tbh&&YEEEES!!&&Tin Tin was a big part of my childhood Both in comics ans the movies and I loved the new Tin Tin movie, even though they combined two movies in to one.  &&Finally! Fuck Yeah!!&&I'm excited! First Tintin was so good though. I hope Peter brings have A game, because his A game is fly. His Hobbit game was whack as shit tho.&&As one of the dozens of people who loved the first one I'm very excited for more adventures!&&Yes!!!! I loved the first one, they got everything right: the look, the tone, the humor. As someone who grew up with the comics, it‚Äôs was great to see a faithful adaptation. So glad they‚Äôre making another one!&&I actually enjoyed the movie, I'm glad they are continuing it.&&YES! This is what I want to hear. The adaptation was actually very good in my opinion. I'm a life-long Tintin fan.&&Ooh! I'm excited. The first one was awesome! Even more so not having read any of the comics&&I‚Äôm so excited for this movie! I remember when I first saw it and my dad and I were blown away by the animation of the water. &&Tintin and the Unnecessary Plot Modification&&I really enjoyed the first movie and was just talking to my dad the other day about how I wished they would make another one. I‚Äôm so glad to hear this! &&Yes!! Very underrated movie this.&&Ahh, Tintin, i still have the books somewhere in the cellar.&&Finally my wait for the sequel if going to over. I liked the the first part so much.&&Finally.&&/u/thejeanlantern Rejoice. This is your day.&&The first one feels like such an underrated masterpiece of a movie. I hope this one lives up to the first.&&It‚Äôs only been seven years&&OHHH I‚Äôm so excited. I watched the first one just the other day. What a great movie.&&Yesss!!! I love tintin and the first one was great :) &&Good. They left us on a cliffhanger &&Isn't this pretty much exactly what they've been saying for six years now? That the movie is just about to get made and will probably come out in two or three years?&&Well its about time!! We've had 2 paddingtons to 1 tintin in less time.&&Tintin was my first crush.  &&Why was I under the impression that they had shot both films at the same time?&&Never thought I'd see the day&&I thought it said Percy Jackson lol&&dope, loved the first movie&&A very good underrated movie. &&I've been waiting years for the sequel! &&I read that as The Avengers of Tintin at first. Now there‚Äôs a crossover I‚Äôd pay money to see. &&Thank You!&&The first one is such an underappriciated film&&I actually enjoyed the first film, so this is great news! &&This was always the plan. Spielberg would direct the first with Jackson producing. Then, after the Hobbit they would switch roles. It just took Jackson longer to get to this point. He directed one or two films after the Hobbit trilogy and didn‚Äôt immediately return to the Tin Tin franchise. &&I used to read the comics as a kid they were dope&&10 years apart?! Billions of blue blistering barnacles &&Fuck yes! I had nightmares about The Seven Crystal Balls when I was a kid, it was actually rather creepy.&&So stoked! I would love to see a Netflix series rather then a movie. But I‚Äôll take it!!!!&&Dope. Tintin is the one of the most slept on animated film in years. &&OH HOLY SHIT... I FUCKING LOVE THIS MOVIE! 

Seriously... this is probably the best news I've heard all month. &&About time!&&Took them long enough&&They're taking Tintin to Isengard.&&YES! ive been waiting years for this, im so happy that its finally coming to fruition. &&HELL YES THAT MOVIE WAS AWESOME&&I loved this movie! &&I loved this movie! &&Wish someone would do an Asterix movie comparable to Tintin-  so great seeing one of my childhood favorites turned into an entertaining movie with superb animation.&&Two books in one movie?

I guess that's better than one book in three movies.&&The only way I would be more okay with this decision, is if Spielberg chose Guillermo del Toro to direct.&&It's about time&&YES!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! IM SO EXCITED HOLY CRAP&&Script isn't even done yet? And here I'm thinking the script is probably on its first or second draft. It's a longer wait than I expected. They might as well do the third film simultaneously&&I love the first movie.  This is great.&&If they never get around to making The Calculus Affair, I'll be very disappointed.&&Yes, please! God knows we need to restore our faith in Peter Jackson after that triple Hobbit mess. And the first Tintin is an overlooked masterpiece, brilliantly made and just so so so much fun.&&goodness I thought that the hope of a sequel was long gone &&confirmed: movie duration will be 3:48&&YES!&&YEASSSSS&&Blistering barnacles!&&Great news. Love that movie. &&Oh, they‚Äôre finally doing this? 

I‚Äôm in!&&It's high time Tintin have a sequel.&&It's high time Tintin have a sequel.&&Yey! I loved the first one :)&&My first Twitter post ever was to Steven Spielberg to make a sequel to adventure of tintin&&Was the first Tintin movie any good?

I liked a few of the comics back when I was a kid. &&The Seven Crystal Balls and The Prisoners of The Sun are two of the best ones. Can't wait!&&Read most of the Tintin books as a child and totally loved it. The majority of the Tintin comic albums came out first in China back in 1980s and were republished in color when the cartoon series was aired on CCTV (China Central Television) around 2005. It was refreshing and fascinating for me to follow the adventures and see the world set in turbulent times like 30s to 40s from the viewpoint of a liberal westerner who does not stereotype things. Besides, I feel particularlly proud to see Chang, a Chinese character, to be featured heavily in the right perspective instead of being portrayed as a ignorant, cunning, yellow peril with eyes slanted.&&We need something along the lines of Destination Moon or Explorers on the Moon&&Awesome... Wait...

1. It's really been 7 years since the first movie?? AAHHHHH
2. I swear I just caught wind of the sequel already underway a few weeks ago (though under the title of the ""Red Rackham"" books), but I now find out it was just stuck in production hell? wtf
3. [Anyone remember that movie tie-in game?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZHE_wiWCwM) It was... okay, but still kind of enjoyable and it even went into further detail of the treasure than the movie did. Wonder if this movie'll have a game based on it (though maybe with a different style game).&&I really liked the first one. It felt very true to the comic and the casting was great. Andy Serkis absolutely kills it as Capt. Haddock. The motion capturing techniques make the faces move very realistically, without sacrificing much of Herge's distinct visual style. Really gotta see this. What I liked about the film was how it took elements from different Tintin comic books and seamlessly stitched them together into a single story.&&So, can we have it actually respect the tone of the books this time?&&Three years??? Blistering barnacles! &&Before anyone raises any potential concerns about incorporating two books, Prisoners of the Sun is the direct sequel to The Seven Crystal Balls.&&> for you

What does he mean by 'for you'? Seems kind of out of place in the context of the quote. Reminds me of Bane, crashing this plane.&&Awesome!  Virtually no one in the US seems aware of Tintin - even after the last movie - and I didn't think they'd make another after the 2011 one's modest results.

Hell, I was only vaguely aware of the movie until after I ""discovered"" Tintin in like 2013.  Now I'm a fan.

Must be a personal passion project for Spielberg.

Edit:  Removed a redundant word word&&Oh yes they're doing my favourite story as the second film!&& >As it takes two years of animation work on the film, for you.

Bane: animation usually takes 2 years of work for film...

CIA guy:  you‚Äôre a big animator

Bane: ...For you&&*""And by 'the film', I mean parts 2, 3 and 4. Total running time approximately 15 hours, 17 with DVD extras.""*&&> Tintin is not dead!

So can we take that to mean this film will have a Dead Alive vibe to it?&&> normally, if all goes well, he will soon start working on the script.

Wait, they don't have a script cooked already? It's been 7 years for fuck sake, that's enough time to not only write the script but to also plan and write a whole Tintin Cinematic Universe! 
&&Like the animated movie.&&I believe the plan is for them to co-direct the 3rd one together.&&>7 years since the original

It has been? I need to go lie down and think about my life &&oh no wonder thomson and thompson were voiced by pegg and frost.&&Is there any reason to want this over the cartoons?  I remember watching the movie and thought that they copied the first story from the comicbook/cartoons exactly but somehow they made it seem so bland.  I loved both the comics and the cartoon and yet somehow the movie was a big ""meh"" for me.&&I really enjoyed the original even though I have no familiarity with the IP it‚Äôs based on.

Script isn't even started yet.&&The first one is a better Indiana Jones movie than the 4th Indiana Jones movie.&&Same here, I LOVED the first one, I was so bummed out it wasn't a huge megahit like it deserved to be.  I guess there **was** some Uncanny Valley issues with it, they should have maybe gone more Pixar than Polar Express.&&Some of the greatest animation I've seen in the last decade. Eerily realistic &&It really was. I was also completely blown away by the animation. Such a great movie. &&The first one was a good movie, but a terrible adaptation. It wasn't at all faithful to the spirit of the comic. For example, IIRC they changed Captain Haddock's character and made him really unsympathetic.&&[deleted]&&That one-take downhill chase scene is unlike anything I've ever seen before.&&The animation is a bit weird (my opinion may not be yours) but the red rachkam story arc was my favorite&&As a HUGE fan of the comics, Captain Haddock was really not true to the source material. In the comics he was smart, assertive, angry, and drunk. At the same time, lovable. In the movie, he was bumbling and strange. Didn‚Äôt care for it. &&that whole movie felt like an adventure, and I am glad to hear of a second!&&I'm a huge tin tin fan and while I enjoyed the animation and different landscapes, I disliked the ""Steven spielberg"" touch: when the action sequence consists of the main character ziplining through a crowded city on a clothesline using a motorcycle, I'm just thinking ""dial it down man, you're giving me an action induced headache"" &&Andy Serkis was amazing in the first one. &&Seriously. There were moments looking st buildings where I could not believe it was animated. So realistic. I feel this movie doesn‚Äôt get near the praise it deserves for its animation.&&I think the strength of the movie was that they deliberately modified the story. It would've been pretty boring if they had not changed it. Mixing Crab and Unicorn was really smart.&&That's because there are already animated shows that look like they just animated the books.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGHtOHkncN4&&Honestly it cuts a lot of bumpf from Red Rackhams Treasure. They needed to have the Crab with the Golden Claws bit to introduce Haddock.

The only bit I didn't really like was making Saccharine the main villain. &&... I can't think of a rebuttal&&[You haven't seen this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSOIp4aAWPc).

Admittedly, neither have I.  Just knew it was out there.&&*Obelix!&&The Gerard Depardieu Asterix movies weren‚Äôt good enough?&&The existing Asterix and Obelix films are great, I don't see why you would want anything more. On a side note, there are very similar Tintin films which are also excellent.&&[Tintin in the Congo is a timeless classic](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CtAhgtM4WkY/TbeB4thWRDI/AAAAAAAAFok/4FQi89p7ga4/s400/tintin-au-congo-decision-le-5-mai-2010-01.jpg)&&Definitely. The books after a certain point, no earlier than 'Cigars of the Pharaoh' have aged very well. Or if you want to conservative then from 'Black Island' onwards. Everything from 'The Secret of the Unicorn' onwards is phenomenal.&&What's a good place to read them online? I'm getting bored at work&&**Update**: Still 3-4 years away.&&I want the third movie to be Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon. Would make for some sick visuals!

On a second thought let it be either The Black Island or Land of the Black Gold. We need to see Tintin's arch nemesis Dr. M√ºller!&&I'm very interested to see who they get to play Professor Calculus, he's one of my favourite Tintin characters.&&I do like those books a lot, but I still am a bit surprised they chose those two. The first film showed that action is what they're going for, and *Crystal Balls* is more like a detective story with horror elements, while *Prisoners of the Sun* would be more like a road movie.  
I think f.e. *Pharaoh's Cigars* and *Blue Lotus* would be more fitting, but of course Haddock is not a part of those, which would make it a bit weird.&&I really hope they dial back on the action and set pieces, not that the first one was bad but it wasn't what I thought Tintin to be. &&He'll have room because the sequel will be a trilogy.&&They're taking Tintin to Isengard!&&Viggo already told him he won't play Aragorn. &&I mean, he hasn't even started working on the script yet and it's been 4 years.

My grandchildren might not even get to see it.&&Him and Edgar Wright* both better return, it was a super enjoyable screenplay.

*EDIT: And Joe Cornish, too!&&He does have Dracula to develop. &&I think Jackson unexpectedly taking on The Hobbit threw things out of wack.  Then he moved on to other projects while Tintin sat quietly on the shelf. 

It happens all the time, especially foe filmmakers of Speilberg and Jacksons caliber.  They constantly have projects being thrown at them. &&Tintin was the real Indiana Jones 4.&&I shit you not, after watching the trailer I thought this was a motion picture, and I said to myself ""Fuck, they casted Tintin perfectly"".

They‚Äôve already waited a long time to make a sequel as it is!&&The first movie was based on another two book story of Herge's, The Secret of the Unicorn + Red Rackham's Treasure. If they continue making movies out of the two-parters, they'll likely make Destination Moon + Explorers On The Moon.&&Herg√© did not invent duologies but it is really cool that he used them at a time where things weren't all about sequels.

I grew up with Tintin (French Canadian here), I'm so happy of these news.&&Yes, it's one long adventure.

In the ~~post~~ parent comment, POTS was put before SCB -- it made me confused for a moment.

EDIT: A correction.&&Yeah, it's weird that they were listed out of order. In any event, these two are my absolute favorite Tintin books.

It was rumored years ago that they would be next and I am glad it's proceeding forward. &&At least this time he's not making one book into three movies.&&The article is in French, maybe Google Translate effed up.

Or maybe it was a subtle nod as to how Captain Haddock crashed the plane in the first one XD&&Read it like this:

> As it takes two years of animation work on the film, you should not expect to see it for about three years.

&&I think he's saying he's a big guy compared to you &&My wife and I go as Tintin and Captain Haddock to Comicon.  About 10 people each day call us out and are very excited to see Tintin.  

There are dozens of us.&&Saw it at the theatres.  It was Spielberg and Jackson.   It has Speilberg all over it.   Our family loved it.  It's one of our favorites - &&Spielberg wanted to do Tintin before he got involved in Indiana Jones, another 30s era globe trotting adventurer. &&Yeah most millennials don't get the classics. I grew up reading Tintin books in grade school during the 80s.&&> Must be a personal passion project for Spielberg.


***Super*** passion project. Herg√© said that he wanted Spielberg to direct a Tintin movie, and Spielberg has been obsessed with Tintin since the Indiana Jones days. I'm so excited he's finally getting to make another one.&&I was kind of hoping for Objective : Moon, but that's the sci-fi enthusiast speaking. So many great stories!&&Prisoners of the Sun was my favourite too! Second is The Broken Ear. &&Watch the unofficial Jonny Quest documentary on YouTube . They churned out the original 26 hour episodes in an ungodly short time ....they said that it would be impossible to replicate today. 
It‚Äôs a cool doc about the behind the scenes how the show and of Hanna Barberra/ animation industry. &&Wow, I haven't seen a wild Banepost in years...&&Could be worse. It could be the Blake and Mortimer movie Hugh Laurie signed up for in 2001.&&[deleted]&&Spielberg, Jackson, *and* Wright?

That's a lot of cooks.&&Personally I would've loved for Spielberg to have just done all of them, but it'd certainly be cool to see how Jackson's is different.&&It only gets faster and faster, friend.

Our perceptual mid-life is around 25 years old, meaning the amount of time before 25 feels about the same length as the time after 25 until death.&&And Stephen Moffat (Coupling, Doctor Who) was the other writer &&The whole thing lacked energy that is present in most animated adventure movies. You can replicate the visual style all you want, but that won‚Äôt mean a thing if the characters don‚Äôt seem excited to be in the story.&&I noticed this the last time I watched it, and it really made me think for the first time about cinematography in animation.&&It's what I wanted from *Crystal Skull* for what a modern Action-Adventure, globe-trotting film directed by Spielberg to be and it ticks those boxes, if that makes sense &&It's a fun Indiana Jones style adventure B movie with really pretty animation and a fun story. I really enjoyed it both times I saw it. Worth a rental I'd say.&&About 3 years according to the article.&&Herg√©,(dude who wrote the comics) wanted Spielberg to direct Tintin because he thought Indiana Jones was the closest thing to it&&It might be heresy... but I liked Tintin more than any Indy movie except Raiders.&&I thought it was perfect since it fit Herge's hyper detailed art style so well. &&It did well in Europe &&I really liked the animation. It was brilliant. &&I know it's not ""real"" but I just goddam love that one super long ""tracking shot"". I don't care how easy or hard it was to do, it is wonderful to watch.
&&That sand dune to sea transition remains one of my all time favourite pieces of animation. &&I'm going to suggest that Uncharted was following the cliches created by TinTin.&&Fun fact: Spielberg discovered Tintin after a French critic drew the parallels between Raiders of the Lost Ark and the famous young belgian journalist-adventurer:

http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/steven-spielberg-on-the-indiana-jones-tintin-connection/ &&I saw this Shakespeare play recently, really reminded me of that Baz Luhrmann film from 96&&Spielberg and Wright really know there camera work.&& I really liked the animation. It is unique though&&The animation in 3D was truly amazing, I loved it. But yeah, it's special. It's a sort of weird ultra-realistic/cartoony CGI.&&Honestly, mixing it in with Crab with the Golden Claws worked really well. I love Red Rackhams Treasure but the whole story is a wild goose chase. &&I thought they did a phenomenal job at bringing the Tintin characters to life, except for Tintin. He came across as, well, uncanny. He was ok overall, but something was just a little off about him.&&You're not alone, I felt like this too. It's called the ""uncanny valley"" which you can read about [here](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/27/tintin-uncanny-valley-computer-graphics).&&I agree. They went to far with Haddock in the movie. In the next, I'll bet he can drink rocket fuel and fart his way to the moon.  

To much loony toons for my taste. &&Fellow huge tintin books fan. Totally agree. Also, I thought the first film had too much action with little substance. PJ will just expand upon that trend. &&I thought that entire sequence was amazing.

So much visual invention. It's everything I had hoped Spielberg would do in animation.&&I'm assuming you grew up on the comics? That's a usual complaint for people who did. I didn't and I loved the movie but can understand it being too actiony compared to the comics&&I loved it for the choreography in itself, it has Edgar Wright's cinematographical sense of movements written all over it. &&I thought it perfectly encapsulated the whole story never stops aspects of the books and in an awesome action sequence. &&Well it wasnt really a conventional animated movie in any way. They used performance capture technology to achieve realistic motion and emotion on characters with cartoony proportions and eyes, yet their skin and clothing materials were designed to look realistic. It gave it an uncanny valley feel in the best possible way. &&Yeah, agreed. Seemed to break ground and whenever I mention it to anyone they look at me like I'm crazy. Granted they probably think I mean the original cartoon or something.&&They did animated films faithfully adapting all of the books, and they were great.&&I'm not complaining mind you! Spielberg and team did an amazing job with the adaptation.&&Tintin In Tibet! My favorite. &&> Honestly it cuts a lot of bumpf from Red Rackhams Treasure.

There is no bumpf in Red Rackham's Treasure. It's one of the better and funnier Tintin books (with the addition of Calculus who I believe wasn't in the movie).&&It's actually really good. The best Asterix movie adaptation, I think.&&The best Asterix movie, in my opinion. The visual gags are hilarious.&&You've reminded me of this great story, which is actually what turned me from a casual affection for the series, to an avid fan of Tintin and Herge. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chongren):

> Herg√©'s early albums of The Adventures of Tintin were highly dependent on stereotypes for comedic effect. These included evil Russian Bolsheviks, lazy and dumb black Africans, and an America of gangsters, cowboys, and Indians.


> At the close of the newspaper run of Cigars of the Pharaoh, Herg√© had mentioned that Tintin's next adventure (The Blue Lotus) would bring him to China. Father Gosset, the chaplain to the Chinese students at the University of Leuven, wrote to Herg√© urging him to be sensitive about what he wrote about China. Herg√© agreed, and in the spring of 1934 Gosset introduced him to Zhang Chongren. 


> The two young artists quickly became close friends, and Zhang introduced Herg√© to Chinese history, culture, and the techniques of Chinese art. As a result of this experience Herg√© would strive, in The Blue Lotus and subsequent Tintin adventures, to be meticulously accurate in depicting the places Tintin visited.
&&yeah that one hasn't aged too well&&Tintin in Congo is one of the worst actually. Cigars of the Pharaoh is the one where the Tintin series really starts to get good.&&I think Black Lotus is the first great book&&At least it's coming.&&I love the [covers of those two](http://gamedesignreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tintin.jpg), really captured my attention as a kid!&&No, not between meals.&&The great thing about mocap is they can get pretty much any great actor.

Hmm

TIL&&aka French&&Acting the *goat*? ACTING THE *GOAT*?!?
&&To be precise: Spielberg and Jackson, well they‚Äôre once again acting the goat!&&I wonder if that village powered by guineapigs will have a role in the movie.&&My 3 year old loves the first one. I thought it was brilliant too, hugely under appreciated&&I've got teen-agers who loved the first one, but they'll be moved out by the time this arrives.&&>Mille millions de ~~tabernacles~~!

FTFY&&not a perfect r/beetlejuicing, but I'll take it&&The first movie actually had a lot of Crab With the Golden Claw mixed in too.&&> If they continue making movies out of the two-parters, they'll likely make Destination Moon + Explorers On The Moon.

Oh man that'd be incredible. My favorite Tintin books.&&It's not a two parter, but I think that a Flight 714 movie would be awesome to watch.&&Didn't Land of Black Gold lead into Destination Moon + Explorers On The Moon?&&I think it'd have to be handled with a fairly sensitive touch (Yellow Peril caricatures in the original work + lingering Sino-Japanese tensions) but Cigars of the Pharaoh / Blue Lotus would be a fun duo, too. Occupied Shanghai of 1931 is IMO one of the coolest settings for a story Herge ever did.&&The first mixed in aspects from the Crab with the Golden Claws to introduce the Captain. &&I did too friend! (English Canadian here)&&I'm Canadian too! I read Tintin and Asterix religiously as a kid. I've read the books dozens of times. They still hold up today.&&That was due to studio pressure....and also Evangeline Lilly character getting the short end of the stick.&&He is a big guy.&&Am French speaker, the original article says ""if I were you"".&&> The article is in French, maybe Google Translate effed up.    
   
For you.&&You need two friends to dress up as  Thomson and Thompson and follow you around&&It's a REALLY good fucking movie and doesn't get enough love.  I'm sure a similar sentiment is all up and down these comments but I just have to say my peace here somewhere.  &&I don't believe he was aware of Tintin at that point, but it was while he was promoting Raiders in Europe someone pointed out how much his film resembled the comics and then he fell in love with them.&&I was one of the lucky ones. One of my dad's customers gave me 2-3 Tintin hardback books when I was younger, then I ended up reading the rest from a local library which had the full works; I then got the animated works for Christmas one year.&&I really don't think this is limited to Millennials.  Among Americans in general it's not well known, among my ""Gen Y"" it's pretty unknown too.

Yet everyone's at least aware of Dick Tracy, which is even older (but longer-running I suppose).  Tintin just isn't in US consciousness.

Most people in my generation are incredibly familiar with a slew of 1930s-1950s cartoons from way before our ""time"", but almost completely unaware of Li'l Abner, which was huge at one point.  Culture is weird, yo.&&Depends where you are. All French-speaking countries hold the traditional French/Belgian comic books in extremely high regard and most kids have read at least *some* Tintin, Ast√©rix, Spirou or others. I'm pretty sure they're more popular than American (superhero) comics around here.&&The tintin books are the most stolen school library books, in many libraries.&&Was it called Objective: Moon in your area? It‚Äôs Destination: Moon where I‚Äôm from!&&It takes a lot to make a stew&&Spielberg and Jackson, not Wright.

But I also read that Spielberg intended to direct the third one alone. Who knows?&&[One might say too many... ](https://youtu.be/QrGrOK8oZG8)&&At first I read that as ""a lot of cocks"" and I was like, well, you're not wrong.&&On the Making Of for *Tintin*, Spielberg says that Jackson basically co-directed the first one with him anyway, which I thought was cool of him to say, plus I think that Spielberg/Jackson would have little ego with one another... a third director in Wright does sound like an interesting scenario though. &&Amazing cooks&&STOP&&And that's the most depressing thing I've read all week. Or probably even this year &&As someone who is just a few months shy of 28, this made me open up a bottle of booze and evaluate some things.&&Delet this pls&&Oof&&Only if you don't keep doing new stuff . If every day is the sameish then yeah it'll fly by. &&Source?&&Like a roll of toilet paper.

Fuck you &&That does. I will try it tonight. Thank you. &&Not a B movie at all&&Sound like a party. I will watch it later tonight. &&Hey just like at the end of District 9! ""I will return in 3 years..."" *waits a decade*&&Camerawork minus the camera can allow for some cool shit&&Me too, I personally loved it, the attention to textures was not anything I'd seen before. I'm pretty excited about this news.&&It looked like cartoonified Uncharted&&[deleted]&&My thoughts exactly. All these people saying how great of an adaptation the movie was clearly don't know what they are talking about.&&I see that too. He definitely sets up extremely elaborate set pieces which normally conclude quite epicly. However to me, that isn't really what Tin Tin is about, and while there are moments where the action sequences do really shine, I feel like there is also times where it becomes a bit too ezcessive. &&It was an extremely americanized watered down version of the original work. In fact, virtually none of the movie respected the original work. This movie is honestly a pile of shit aside from the animation &&As we all know Tintin is all about big bazookas going KABOOM. I can't wait for Ast√©rix throwing amphora-grenades.&&Waaaay too ""actiony"" compared to the comics. Huge tintinophile here (yes that's a word), but honestly I enjoyed the movie for what it is : something of it's own.&&Very astute observation, yes I did. While most of his action sequences were thoroughly enjoyable, some of the more excessive ones felt somewhat out of place. &&This is the only animated movie I've seen where there were moments I forgot it was animated.&&Werent those only around half an hour tho? It would be strange to extend one comic to an entire 2 hour movie.&&Don't get me wrong, it was the first book I've got and I love it, but in terms of a modern movie it's a wild goose chase. The whole search for the Unicorn is a dead end. &&Nothing beats out the classic animated ones imo but that‚Äòs probably nostalgia and as far as a comics accurate revamp goes this movie was excellent! The live action films aren‚Äòt terrible if you take them with a grain of salt. They are definitely different than the comics.&&> The best Asterix movie

It definitely isn't. Asterix and Cleopatra and The Twelve Tasks of Asterix are the best.&&Rip Chang :(&&I've been a Tintin fan all my life, and I never knew that Chang was based on an actual person!

I always found *Tintin in America* interesting because, although Herg√© drew pretty heavily on racist stereotypes in his depiction of Native Americans, he also portrayed the mistreatment of them at the hands of white Americans (when they were forced off their land after oil was discovered). It was done partly for comedic effect, but in just a few panels he summarized hundreds of years of racists attitudes.&&This really showed in one of the later books especially, *Tintin in Tibet*&&Yeah. None of the depictions of race have aged very well - but they're still classics.&&It's that way for the first couple of books unfortunately (coincidentally have been marathoning them recently). Around Black Island is where it improves imo. Though I love the Cigars/Lotus adventures&&> Blue Lotus&&Fun fact: Explorers On The Moon was around ten years before the Apollo moon mission but Herg√© accurately predicted the landscape of the moon and the feasibility of the mission to a tee! It was thought the only thing he got wrong was ice on the moon. But that too was proven correct as ice was discovered by NASA in 2010.&&I have these two hanging up on my wall as decoration, as a Belgian I adore Tintin, and especially these two books.&&Gary Oldman&&My favorite part of the entire series. Shame they're not doing the moon arc.&&Help! Help! He's cured!&&Precisely.&&What's that you say? Their grunts have been stacking the moat? &&I could 100% see it&&lol what? I know the Tintin series better than the Bible and I don't remember a village powered by guinea pigs!&&So does mine! I was very surprised at the quality of the animation too&&Mille millions de mille milliards de mille sabords !&&Yeah, Captain Haddock wasn't from Quebec.&&I'd say it was more Crab With the Golden Claw than Red Rackham's Treasure from what I remember of the books I read nearly 30 years ago.  IIRC the film ended at about the point RR'sT starts doesn't it?&&Yeah the whole Haddock meeting is there. It also left out Professor Calculus first meeting which was in the Rackham Treasure story actually. &&Yes, but only to introduce the captain.&&I  also love Tintin In Tibet!&&Flight 714 was my favourite of the comics and theirs definitely enough material there to stretch it to feature length. &&I have the poster of flight 714 hanging in my hallway. I‚Äôm 54.&&They have to do that one last, though, because it's almost the main arc end of Rastapopoulos! (Unless you care about Alph-art)&&Such a trippy story! Then 2001: The Space Odyssey can pack it up and go home.&&There were connections, like the weird health condition (relapse of the Formula 14 drug) of Tomson and Thompson got in Black Gold shows up in Destination Moon.&&Me too! I  read them in Nepal!! 

What about Asterix and Obelix ; did you guys  read those comics? &&[deleted]&&What's the next step of your master plan?&&Well, i mean ... he's one of the biggest guys in Hollywood, he certainly had a master plan - and he crashed a plane in *War of the Worlds* and *Temple of Doom*. Checks out ; he can officially get away with this.&&My nephews are identical twins, maybe when they get older we'll bring them into the act&&So that's what they're called ! :D

In French they're Dupont and Dupond.&&For me, it's the closest thing we have to an Uncharted movie :)&&I mean, I liked it. Right up until it stopped in the middle of the plot without diving into Rackham.&&I loved that Tintin got a worthy movie by the likes of Spielberg, and there were some really amazing renderings & references to the books (desert plane, the way they had the animated character's portrait be a classic Herg√© drawing of Tintin, etc). But as a purist, the crane battle, downhill chase & mixing of storylines were bummers.

So much cool stuff happens in the books - no need to Hollywood it up with newly added action sequences.&&Ah, I had it backwards then. &&""Objectif Lune"" in french : ) And ""On a march√© sur la Lune"" (we walked on the moon) for the second part.&&Put a couple of directors in a pot, baby you've got a stew going.&&Especially when it's me and you&&For sure, the original intent is for Spielberg and Jackson but anything can happen and I would love to see what Wright could do and how his vision could translate to an animated format, plus he's already part of the franchise so it would make sense. &&That is largely based off the fact that we define ourselves upon our upbringing and have more important events early in life so that it seems like it lasted awhile as you have more memories of them. So as you get older keep active and doing new things and you might never notice how time seems to be going faster. 

A steady 9-5 job where your work defines you is how you seemingly lose decades of your life. Always strive to change things up.&&He‚Äôs completely full of shit lol &&The first one was so good. As an American, I knew very little about Tintin. It was totally not what I was expecting. I went out and immediately bought some of the original comics. Those are also really good. The movie is pretty true to them.&&Hope you enjoy it! &&The water was beautiful.&&For me it was the lighting. The attention to detail of sources and how they interacted with the locations really added to ever scene.&&No problem!&&I fully understand that and respect the fans that felt they maybe updated it a bit too much to the modern action adventure style, but for me the film hit just the right spot. 

It wasn't strictly speaking like reading the comics as a kid, but I *felt* like a kid nonetheless. And I think that was the intention, to deliver the feel of globetrotting thriller action comedy that those books also gave people back in the day.

Also to me Spielberg's true gift is his visual sense (there's a reason his calling card was Duel), so to see him let loose like that gave me that extra fun on top of all the Tintin fun.&&OMG I want a Steven Spielberg's Asterix movie so bad now!&&I'm just getting back into Tintin after having read it as a kid and I'm starting with ""In the Land of the Soviets."" Hoooooooly crap Tintin starts off rough. Looking forward to the rest.&&I think the camerawork deserves praise as well. Just take the single shot chase scene with the tank for instance. It's a virtuoso piece of filmmaking.&&I honestly didn't even think about that. Though some of them do go together, so you could have two fill up an hour at least. I think though really they do better as a TV series than a full-length film.&&Those are great as well. Even the live action Cleopatra is quite good, despite the rest of the live action movies being terrible.&&CHANG! &&Keep in mind Tintin is a Belgian comic from the first half of the 20th century, when Belgium was committing heinous acts of barbarism in their African colonies. It probably helped for people to see Africans as silly, primitive cartoon characters.&&In 1969 Herg√© did 4 pages about the Apollo 12 mission: https://flic.kr/p/mk2mCa

This one is nice as well: http://lecomptoirdelabd.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2012/08/tintin-armstrong.jpg&&That's a great idea. The guy is already a chameleon but with a layer of CG clothes and skin he'd would disappear completely.&&https://i.imgur.com/3zTpVxy.jpg?1

#Make Way For The Goat!!!&&The whole sequence after the eagle takes the scroll is dizzying, it looks incredible in 3D&&I  have all the comics. I first read them about 30+ years ago. I bought the comics 10 years ago to introduce my kids to them. 

My problem is I can't remember the movie!! &&That‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs about 50/50 crab with the golden claws and secret of the unicorn. Red Rackham‚Äôs treasure is only the voyage for the sunken treasure, and it also introduces Professor Calculus. 

Speaking of Calculus, I hope they eventually make a third movie and that it‚Äôs the Calculus Affair! It‚Äôs always been one of my favorites and would make a great movie.&&That was a pretty big part of Crab...opium smuggling isn't super target audience friendly. &&THE BEST and I would argue THE BEST of the Tintin books, I would fight anyone who disagreed

I made fake Criterion covers for all the Best Picture nominees this year,35425,81egdp,https://imgur.com/a/QPUdg,1052,1519999896.0,,"Your post made me sad, because I was once again reminded that The Florida Project was not nominated for Best Picture. &&These are excellent. Not a bad one in the set but I particularly like Dunkirk, The Shape of Water and Three Billboards. Criterion should honestly hire you for artwork design.

EDIT: Holy fuck I just noticed Get Out was spelled out in the antlers. A+.&&The Dunkirk one is really good!&&Excellent except for maybe Lady Bird which suffers from readability issues. &&I think these are all really great ideas, but the readability wasn't particularly good. In some I had to look around a while before seeing what it was (Get Out) and in some I just couldn't read what it said (Ladybird, The Florida Project). 

After looking through some of the official Criterion posters, I think you have an excellent proof of concept here - my favorites were Three Billboards, The Post, and Get Out. In fact, the only real criticism I have is the clarity of the titles. If you reign the word design in just a touch, I think you will have a stronger product.

Great work!&&I‚Äôd be much more entertained by Crit-style covers for movies that definitely *don‚Äôt* deserve it.

Like, did they announce the Razzies yet?  I‚Äôd be very amused by fancy covers for those turds.&&These are awesome. The covers are the best part of the Criterion editions.&&These are terrific . Though , correct me if I am wrong, but Criterion releases are still commercial products, which means that they probably don‚Äôt want the film titles to be that hard to see (such as with the very clever ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù cover and ‚ÄúThe Darkest Hour.‚Äù)
But purely by an artistic standpoint , these are fantastic. &&The Lady Bird one is incredibly hard to make out.&&Wow.  I was really expecting every cover to just be, like, one object from each movie and then name in some fancy font.  When I saw Phantom Thread didn't have a [mushroom](#spoiler)  on it I was like ""Huh, this person might know what they're doing"".  These are CRAZY good.  Thanks for sharing.&&Sorry, hate being a contrarian, so I'll say while a lot of the artwork is nice, there are a few issues with the text. In most cases, there's either too much of it or it's hard to read.

I looked at a few covers for criterion DVDs, and in almost all of them, I knew what the title was in a second (with the exception being for *The Game*). For a lot of these, I would have puzzled over them way too long trying to figure them out (Lady Bird gave me the most difficulty, and if I hadn't seen *Get Out* in theaters, that would also have given me grief).

The artwork is generally nice, but I have to break the jerk that says these are Criterion tier mainly because I think you're trying to sell product, you never want it to be unclear what you're selling. (Also, for the Post, I haven't seen the film, but do those articles have something to do with the movie? Because if not, they're hugely distracting and if so then you're potentially spoiling something.)&&Nice.

Now do them for all the Razzie nominees.&&Shape of the Water and Get Out are a bit too illegible to my eye.  Darkest Hour needs a bit more contrast (although I get maybe it's supposed to be ""dark""?).  The concepts are all really excellent though.&&What IS criterion collection anyway?&&I love The Shape of Water one. Great stuff!&&A lot of these are hard to read and don't fit the styles of the film.&&These are amazing. Love Phantom Thread and Get Out covers the best &&It's a shame Blade Runner isn't nominated for Best Picture. &&Where'd you get the Three Billboards image? It did you make it yourself? I want it as a poster.

Also I'll echo the sentiment expressed elsewhere that while pretty a few of these are really word heavy (Dunkirk) or have incomprehensible typography (Lady Bird). All very pretty tho.&&Artistic, but I can't read half of these.&&I like a lot of them. But seriously... fix your kerning on ""D...A.RKEST HOUR""&&Not gonna lie OP but I really hated all of these, besides maybe Three Billboards.&&The Florida Project wasn't nominated though.&&Wow. I come home from work to all this!?!

Thanks for all the feedback. This is incredible. To answer questions: 

No, I don't do this professionally, per se. Though I've done some random design work in the past, designing these criterion covers has been more of a hobby. I find that's a great exercise to get me to think about films in a different way than I normally do. I notice so much more when I'm thinking about designing something relating to the film.

I went to school with quite a few graphic designers, and I've got mad respect for what they do. It's a craft you have to hone your eye for, which I have not quite done yet, as the posts pointing out issues with kerning and whatnot attest to. Thank you to those who pointed those things out.

As far as legibility, I knew going into this that some of these covers were going to be problematic in that way. That makes them terrible as actual covers and marketing material, but as a fan of many of these movies, I did them not as an exercise in making marketing material, but as fan-art. [Some of my favorite criterion covers](http://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/260_box_348x490_original.jpg?w=348) are ones that take an idea and just gun for it. 

Also, I'm looking into where I can put them up for sale, and I'm working on tweaking these so they work as posters without the C-and-bar. Watch this space. I'll work on that this weekend.&&I don‚Äôt love these.  Hard to read, unclear, and a bit cutesy for my taste.&&I still need to see Dunkirk We Surround You and The Post The Washington Post The Washington Post.&&These are amazing, took a minute to find Get Out in the antlers, I saw Jordan Peele and was like, it's gotta be somewhere! I particularly love that one! Also loved that movie on a side note....stellar work. &&these are real great, but some are way too hard to read.  

for instance: i wouldn't know what the shape of water, get out, or the florida project said if i didn't already know the names of the movies.

overall, amazing work though&&I love these but I have to say I feel a visceral hate for the Dunkirk one, despite its stylishness. It looks great and communicates a certain aspect of hopelessness but it doesn't feel like it fit the tone or the point of the film at all. Framing the film around a war map makes it feel impersonal and inhuman like something out of Darkest Hour, where men in uniform scurry around giving orders that they know will result in deaths but which they are far removed from. It feels like it presents Dunkirk as a strategic issue rather than a human one - this very idea feels critiqued when the protagonist soldier guy arrives in Britain but feels no real reassurance from Churchill's speech about the 'miracle at Dunkirk', because the film is ultimately about the human experience of those thousands of people waiting on the beach. 

It looks great though and I like the rest. &&Do you do these officially for Criterion because god damn.&&Pretty bad some of em&&Fantastic work!!&&These are beautiful. Well done! &&I need to see a lot of these. Thought get out was absolutely fantastic. Rod was the best &&FUCK these are good! Nice work OP.&&Fuckin love these.

Fantastic, Get Out is the best IMO. 

Darkest Hour was fun cuz I was almost not a fan because of the dark text, which led my eye to he Churchill. I love when artists have the capability to make your eye travel through a piece to finalize the story in the image. Great work! &&Lady Bird and Get Out are a little hard to read, but other than that I love the design work.&&It took me a second to read GET OUT in the bloody antlers of that stag. Fucking brilliantly clever and creepy as all hell (slow clap üëè)&&May I make a suggestion.  Shorten ""Fan Art"" to ""Fart"".  We all lead busy lives and as a result need to be efficient as possible with our time.&&A lot of these a great. Get out has major readability issues. The idea is cool, but it doesn't matter how cool the design is if you can't figure out what the main copy is supposed to say. 
The last one in the set has a value issue in the type. That pink is the same intensity as the sky, its so close that it's very hard to read in conjunction with the font type. &&If I was forced to be nitpicky, the title font on Phantom Thread bugs me just a bit, and the title font on The Darkest Hour is hard to see. But damn you nailed the pictures.

My favorite is the Shape of Water one, just beautiful. Also the titles in the antlers on Get Out is bloody brilliant, it took me a couple of minutes to figure it out, then I couldn't believe I missed it!&&I literally stared at the ""get out"" one for a whole minute before I realized how amazing it really is...and how dense I can be lol.&&Just from a marketing POV, Timothe√© Chalamet is a good looking kid, that Call Me by Your Name cover could have benefited if he were on it.&&The Darkest Hour one, I kind of need. &&How did you make the antlers look like that?!

 Mad skills, very cool.&&Your ‚Äúthe post‚Äù and ‚Äúthe darkest hour‚Äù are fucking brilliant and should have been the actual run posters.&&Yaaaaaaaas. Dude, I love the get out cover. Really all of them came out well. A+++&&https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/epicrapbattlesofhistory/images/2/22/Bender_Neat.gif/revision/latest?cb=20150719011029&&These are awesome. The one for ‚ÄòThe Post‚Äô is particularly aesthetically pleasing.&&Every comment here by some self-proclaimed expert that was like ""Your fan art is *not* as good as the most famous boutique movie design house in the world, sorry, just had to tell you that, "" made me want to take a long bath and never get on the internet again.

Seriously.  The internet's sense of consumer entitlement (everything must be perfect *for me* or you're going to hear why!) has now spread to *fan art??!?!*

OP, these are clever and fun.  I assume that's why you made them.&&These are way too subtle to be effective. There's a reason why big, red text is so prominent in movies, cheap as it may be.&&Meh... Not bad but not all that great either.&&Amazing work on ''get out''
Best of luck in your future endeavors &&I just noticed the Get Out in the antlers. Also great work with The Shape of Water (literally feels like you're looking at the water's shape).

These are incredible, do you have any other cover art you've done for other movies?&&Get Out one is awesome!&&I just realized I only watched comic book movies this year. I didn't even recognize any of these titles.&&Nice, but some are definitely better than others. One thing I'd (deservedly) criticise is that a lot of them are hard to read and some are nigh unreadable; a poster should always, always, *always* be 100% clear to the viewer on what it is advertising, the design should be built around that and never the other way around. For example, I would never have known what the 'Get Out' one was advertising if it wasn't in the footnote.&&That Get Out one is masterful. &&Hey u/herky140, you‚Äôd better watermark these before some shitty website steals them.

It also had a bunch of small nods to Central Florida (including the company I work for oddly enough). Even if I didn‚Äôt know the setting very well it‚Äôs still funny, sad, and bittersweet movie. 

Basically watch this damn movie if you haven‚Äôt .&&I liked this one, but it bothered me with how nice the grass looks. Like, ""there's no way in hell a flop motel in Kissimmee has grass this nice, this is Disney quality grass from up the road.""

And then I got it. ""The grass is greener on the other side,"" and in the eyes of a child, everything looks perfect.&&I'm thinking that A24 must've put all their effort into promoting Lady Bird, which is why none of their other movies (Good Time, The Florida Project, The Killing of a Sacred Deer...) got any noms.&&That movie made my chest sore from the intensity of my sobbing &&I'm really happy they made these just because this is the first time I'm hearing about the Florida Project and it looks fantastic. &&Biggest snub yet&&No doubt!!!  Of all the movies I‚Äôve seen the past year, that movie continues to stick with me. &&My favourite film of last year&&It is THE best picture of the year in my book. Total bullshit it wasn‚Äôt even nominated&&The Florida Project was the single best movie I saw last year.&&Fact that Darkest Hour was nominated over I Tonya, Baby Driver, and Logan was sad... :(&&And the darkest hour was.


Gary Oldman was excellent, but that film was not very good&&I've never heard of that. Need to go check that out!&&I WISH! Florida Project was SOOO GOOD!&&I loved the movie, but the ending was so bad in my opinion.  It took away from the rest of the movie&&Damn I was wondering why it didn't have a title.&&I would buy that Get Out on in a heartbeat. I hate the stupid Rotten Tomatoes logo on the standard blu. &&It wasn't until I saw the Jordan Peele name on the cover that I realized what movie it was.  Then I saw the antlers.  Very clever. &&> EDIT: Holy fuck I just noticed Get Out was spelled out in the antlers. A+.

My first thought was: ""No way was *The Killing of a Sacred Deer* nominated for an Oscar!""  &&Haha holy shit, I was also looking to see if anyone commented about the get out poster, cus I was like "" ok it's cool enough I guess but shouldn't it have the name on it?"" &&The Ladybird one was too subtle. Took me a minute to actually see ‚ÄúLadybird‚Äù on the cover, I thought the movie was ‚Äúdo your best on the test‚Äù. &&the Dunkirk one looks like a book cover&&Get out is so good and clever! holy crap! Well done.&&Maybe artwork but definitely not for the typography for that one&&I thought that was Killing of a Sacred Deer lol... didn't notice the writing.&&https://giphy.com/gifs/reaction-supernatural-wtf-d0MYTsbRnGKoU&&Dunkirk is so good. &&Most of these are great, but a title being illegible is bad design.&&I'm so glad I read your comment. Just saw the antlers. Amazing work.&&> Holy fuck I just noticed Get Out was spelled out in the antlers. A+.

Honestly, a bunch of these are fairly illegible if you don't already know what they're supposed to say.&&The Shape of Water and Get Out were particularly good. The rest were very good too, well done OP!&&Your comment had me go back to see. Impressive. &&It's the best one, but [taken straight from the movie](https://medias.spotern.com/spots/w640/76702.jpg).&&The Dunkirk one is literally one of the propaganda flyers the Nazis dropped to break British morale &&I'd love to get it in wallpaper size. Such a cool design.&&Most of them do. I appreciate clever design, but OP has forgotten that design should serve a function. A customer trying to find one of these movies in a store is going to be really annoyed when they can't tell what the cover says. &&Most of them suffer from that. They are neat, but I can't see any of them being used as official covers.&&I couldn't read Get Out.&&I was having some trouble reading what they were. It‚Äôs like a glance I couldn‚Äôt feel or tell what if was about. &&They are all ***fantastic***. Except Lady Bird. &&Agreed. It makes me so sad when movies I love (like Dunkirk) are given generic movie-poster covers because companies like WB or Disney or Fox aren't willing to invest in a cool artist to make a new cover worth saving&&[deleted]&&[I think you might want to spoiler that mushroom bit. Had I known of the significance of that before I saw the movie, I would have been focusing on it a lot more.](#spoiler)

As it stands, I went into the movie with very little in the way of narrative expectations and while I could immediately tell [mushrooms were going to be important](#spoiler), I didn't fixate on that.

**EDITED FOR MAXIMUM ANTI-SPOILER**&&Yeah, the graphic design on a lot of these leaves much to be desired. They‚Äôre beautiful but not fully functional. Typography is awful on a lot of them. I could even read the words ‚ÄúThe Darkest Hour‚Äù. &&[deleted]&&...I'm sorry, are you really worried about The Post spoilers?&&*mother!* lowkey does deserve to be in Criterion &&I agree that Get Out is hard to read, but I think it works in this case because the poster's composition isn't over-complicated. Once I realized the text was hidden in the antlers a very creepy vibe overlays the lifeless head that's staring back at you.  That one was my personal favorite for this reason.
&&They restore and remaster important classic and contemporary films, which come with extra features and audio commentary.&&Heaven.&&http://www.criterion.com&&and they have a streaming service - [Filmstruck](http://www.filmstruck.com)&&They restore movies and release them on special dvd and blu Ray in the highest possible quality. They‚Äôre also packed with special features (they actually invented special features)
Also a lot of the titles are from other countries that don‚Äôt have dvd release so they‚Äôre given a chance to be seen in America.&&[And more importantly, how much does criterion weigh... in space?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN25ghkfgQA)

&&I don't see how it's not... It was so good. Maybe I just expected it to be so bad that it seems better than it is. &&I'm bummed Wind River wasn't nominated.&&*PLORIBA  
PROJELT*&&You are not alone. I understand that it took a lot of work but god damn, I think that most are horrendous. some don't fit the theme or tone of the movie and most are hard to read.&&I felt Call Me By Your Name deserved more&&Outside of a couple I didn't like them either. I did like the Phantom Thread one. Darkest Hour one to me looked like he took a picture of himself near a window holding a cigar... Looked pretty cheap.&&Agreed. I would have a hard time picking the one I dislike the most.&&I'm asking you directly, since nobody bothered answering my question in the thread and this has been driving me crazy.

Is that Anne Hathaway on the Phantom Thread cover? Looks like her to me. If yes, what motivated your choice, since she has nothing to do with the movie?

Great job by the way, I think most of those would make great Criterion covers.&&If I'm not mistaken OP didn't even design that one, it's just a screen grab of that poster which is used in the movie.&&I think that a view from one of the boats looking towards the men, with lots of other boats heading in to each side would look neat, it would combine the human aspects of the troop's fears and the hope coming from the boats.&&Honestly, ""impersonal and inhuman"" is exactly how I would describe *Dunkirk*. I really don't think it succeeds in humanising the conflict at all; none of the characters are very well-developed or interesting and it made it very difficult for me to feel emotionally engaged with the film.&&Criterion has way higher standards than this.

Don't get me wrong, what he did is great, but Criterion's selection process results in something more than great.

The Phantom Thread one is up to par imo.&&They suck.&&As others have said these aren't bad -- but at best they might pass for a graphic design homework assignment. They didn't even design the one for Dunkirk, there's just a screen grab from a poster that is in the movie. &&It's a huge collection of films that are more or less selected for their artistic or cultural significance. They can get pricey, but if you really want to study a particular film, the Criterion Collection is the way to go. Their commentaries and other extras can't be beat. Also, if you keep an eye out, these things go on sale for 50% off every few months, so that's the best time to buy. 

https://www.criterion.com/&&I know right! I couldn‚Äôt even read it at first &&[deleted]&&Dafoe was great, but I think Rockwell ~~and Day Lewis~~ gave a better performance.&&Will I like it even though I despised everything about tangerine?&&I agree with you. I love Rockwell, who in my opinion probably has the Oscar locked up, but Dafoe was exceptional. &&Apparently, that scene just kinda happened. 

The cranes kept coming to the hotel, and Sean Baker was inspired to shoot the scene where Bobby shoos they away. 

In an interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Dafoe said that the cranes are a protected species, but the real hotel manager was feeding them Cheetos.&&Sandhill cranes. Not geese. They‚Äôre everywhere in South Florida. &&Do it my dude, it‚Äôs a wonderful film&&Just buy it. You'll want to watch it again.&&YES!


Just know that this film is not a huge dramatic story.  It is quiet and thoughtful and real.   It is deceivingly simple and almost meditative.  What I loved is it's a different type of story telling that most movies do not employ.  Scenes that seemed simple and meandering I began to notice depth and themes as I thought of it days after.  
&&The Oscars can be very by the numbers sometimes - Spielberg, Streep, and Hanks in a movie about the press taking on the government? That‚Äôs a slam dunk. As for Darkest Hours, you have a beloved actor who has never won disappearing into the role of a politician who has been lionized for his role in World War 2. That‚Äôs also a slam dunk.

Movie about a six year old who over one summer loses her innocence amongst a ratty motel in the shadow of America‚Äôs greatest theme park? Yeah, that‚Äôs a more difficult pill to swallow for the Academy I think.&&The Post is a fantastic film. Just because it had a bunch of people that are well known shouldn‚Äôt hurt it. &&Meryl Streep must feed...&&Like someone pointed out, ""The Florida project portrays the wrong kind of poverty"". Along with Blade Runner 2049, it's 2017's most memorable movie for me. It was a pretty strong snub imo. I would have nominated it for best director, movie, main and supporting actress. Moonee was terrific and her mother was in a league of her own, miles ahead anything I saw that got nominated. Her performance was s√≥ strong that I truly hated her guts.&&But...it‚Äôs a real hotel. All of the locations were real. 
&&Florida Project for Best Picture, Sean Baker for Best Director, and Don Hertzfeldt‚Äôs World Of Tomorrow Episode Two: The Burden of Other People‚Äôs Thoughts were the biggest missed opportunities of the Oscars this year. &&It was my favorite film of 2017&&I politely, yet **firmly** disagree. 

The ending is my single favorite movie moment from 2017.

It‚Äôs perfect. &&100% agree. It's one of those parts that works for some people, and doesn't for others. It didn't work for you and me, and that's okay.

The rest of the movie was incredible though.&&I thought it was Killing of a Sacred Deer, then realized it wasn‚Äôt nominated, and then found the Get Out in the antlers.&&I was wondering why the antlers were so oddly shaped.&&Excellent idea, but I missed it too and I thought I was smart. I think it's too smart for a moviegoing audience.&&It's fresh! Don't you forget it!&&I just saw a youtube ad advertising RT score for Annihilation. Not sure how long that's been going on in ads. I suppose if that will convince people to see underappreciated movies, fine. 

But keep it off the posters, please.&&If that Get Out cover was available as a poster-sized print for a reasonable price I would frame it and hang it on my wall.&&The fact that *The Killing of a Sacred Deer* is missing from the Oscars makes me so sad. What a phenomenal film.&&It should‚Äôve been, it was so good D:&&I think the angle was too much on that one. &&Yeah, Ladybird was way too hard to read. Beautiful stuff though.&&I thought it said ""HYBRID""&&being from Sacramento CA where it is filmed i immediately recognized the look of that stupid post card font. its everywhere in old sac/ downtown sacramento.

also - thank you for not putting that stupid bridge in the picture.&&[It's taken straight from the movie](https://medias.spotern.com/spots/w640/76702.jpg)&&Many Criterion covers do.&&ya that one would never fly in the design world&&Ive been waiting to watch it again.  def one of my favorites from the year.  I also loved Mother!  Blade Runner Call Me by Your Name, and 3 billboards.  I would say it was a damn good year for movies&&Some choices in these designs aren't perfect (typography, space usage, allignment, etc) but there's huge potential here and with minor tweaking these could pass for legitimate cover art designs for Criterion releases.&&Which was taken from the actual flyers that were dropped on the area.&&I think that actually makes it better&&Do we know if this tactic was actually used in the movies/were there real pamplets like these airdropped at the English?&&I don't think this has ever been the goal for Criterion cover art.  They've always been more about creating kindred art based on the movie rather than making it an advertisement for the movie that is easily readable or recognizable on a store shelf.  That's what regular DVD editions are for.

&&I was surprised I had to scroll so far down to find some actual constructive criticism. 

I count 5 that really could be improved for legibility.

* The Post (hard to find the title, needs a tighter focal plain and the title on all of the papers should match).

* The Shape of Water, needs more contrast on the text. Too much of a fight to read the title.

* Lady Bird, really should be camel case and needs a space between the Y and the B ""Lady Bird"" not ""LADYBIRD""

* Get Out, clever, but so hard to read. As with many, didn't even immediately see that the title was there.

* Florida Project, my eyes are bleeding. Like Lady Bird, all caps with that font means that I spend too much time trying to decipher the title. 

High marks for creativity and implementation (only minor complaints for the actual work).
&&Get Out was the worst offender I though. I spent a good bit of time wondering where the title was. 

It was clever artistically, but terrible as a title.&&Some are also just not meaningful covers. A cover should evoke feelings that are consistent with the main themes of the work. For me, ""The Post"" is the only one that does this.&&If you‚Äôre ordering a Criterion, you already know the name of the movie. These are special editions for cinemaphiles.&&In some cases, hard to read design is used on purpose to attract interest and [improve recall](https://hbr.org/2012/03/hard-to-read-fonts-promote-better-recall). I'm thinking of posters for [metal](http://i.imgur.com/Whr9Shz.png) and [psychedelic shows](https://99designs-blog.imgix.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/MacLean-Bonnie_Affiche-concert-TheYardbirds_1967_galJanos.jpg).&&I would agree if OP was designing something to fit on the Wal-Mart shelf with the intent to grab the customers attention then he/she failed. However, OP designed these covers for a very specific target audience.OP wanted to catch the eyes of the criterion collection consumers and I think the designs are successful in that regard.&&Honestly I stopped because it gave me a little headache. I love OPs ideas but it seems sooo cluttered! Get out was cool but the text between the antlers is, again, distracting :/ keep at it OP! Practice makes perfect &&Covers*&&Same with the standard Blade Runner 2049 cover. &&I don't think it's that they aren't willing to invest but rather they know it only appeals to a niche market. Your average movie-goer prefers the  generic movie cover. Especially with a film like Dunkirk where a large portion of the audience is people who love war films, who aren't necessarily worried about this kind of classic aesthetic. 

If it would make them more money, they would make these kinds of artistic covers all the time.&&Posters are a marketing tool first, and a piece of art second. A lot of posters are generic, but that‚Äôs because they need to pique the interest of the general public - not this sub. If they thought a poster by a cool new artist would help market the movie better, then they would be spending the extra money to get it done.&&Your comment was more of a spoiler than the original.&&Saying ""phantom thread has mushrooms"" is about as spoilery as ""Daniel Day-Lewis tells Paul Dano he drinks his milkshake."" It's technically referring to a huge plot point in the movie, but that information by itself doesn't reveal anything. When you finally get to the mushroom/milkshake, it's not like its importance is hidden from you. They tell you immediately why its significant.

tl;dr not a spoiler.&&I get you.  I guess it's because I was spoiled that they were important in the movie before I saw it, that influenced the way I think about it now.

I guess I should still spoiler it, because however our comments are worded or whichever ones technically ""more of a spoiler"", as long as no one looks at the spoiler, they won't be spoiled.&&You're the one spoiling it.&&I've learned that Reddit doesn't have a particularly good eye for graphic design. There's high praise for being 'clever' around here but not much in the way of functional design.&&Same with Florida Project. &&>  I could even read the words ‚ÄúThe Darkest Hour‚Äù.

Hopefully no ""the"" as that's not the title. 

And that's the worst one. My fav image from the film is him and the plane in the fog. It was sadly only used in a few bus stop ads before the Oscar one took over. &&So, I don't give a shit about spoilers and also have no idea what the film is about. Presumably something to do with the Washington Post based on context, so let me go back to saying all the damned text is distracting.&&and dank covers&&Their remasters of 7 Samurai are amazing.&&Like The Rock.&&[In Heaven...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awVNCIjQq1A&t=1m25s)&&FilmStruck isn't a Criterion streaming service, it's a streaming service that currently has the exclusive streaming rights to The Criterion Collection.

It's not Anne Hathaway, though I can see how it sort of looks like it.

It's a 1953 photo of a Balenciaga dress. I found that in preparing for his role, Daniel Day Lewis learned so sew, and didn't consider himself ready until he could recreate a Balenciaga dress, sewn by hand.&&He edited the lettering on it it read ‚ÄúDunkirk‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYou‚Äù but it is. Although I think that‚Äôs the beauty of it &&Having well-developed or interesting characters does not make a movie human. Tree of Life barely has any developed characters but is the most human film I have seen all century.

The movie humanises the conflict by putting us in the head of an anonymous soldier. You don't need a soldier to be well developed to care for him. Most of the survivors from WW2 (soldiers, prisoners, etc) are cared about only because of their survival. None of them are ""well developed characters"" are they? It's only an act of empathy. &&Phantom Thread's text is off. 

DDL, VK & PTA's credits are too small and in the wrong font. It would work better without them IMO.&&yeah, good effort, but there are only two or so in this album that I could mistake for a real criterion cover.  Shape of Water is imo the strongest and closest to an authentic-looking cover.  &&Criterion would never use that font for the performers names but the rest of it looks good (Phantom Thread)&&They are also more functional. Over here, you won't understand what the Get Out cover is about until you look at it for some time. &&Day Lewis is not supporting&&I love Sam Rockwell but I really hated 3 Billboards and I wasn't a fan of his drunk acting in it. &&Rockwell completely deserves it&&I think so. There is a lot of humanity and interesting characters. I'm from Florida so it felt extra familiar to me. &&Sandhill Cranes might be a protected species but those fuckers are everywhere in Florida. And they‚Äôre not afraid of humans (probably because people feed them Cheetos). They‚Äôll walk right up to you and it can be a bit intimidating because they‚Äôre incredibly large. I remember I once got in my car and one walked up to the passenger door and started pecking at it and I thought it wanted to come for a ride with me! Later I found out they peck at their reflections. &&Is this gonna be the new ‚ÄúDiCaprio cut his hand and kept going‚Äù?&&even better&&My b&&is it sad? Will i cry? &&You make the Academy sound like boors.  These are the same folks who selected Moonlight and The Artist; I think The Florida Project isn't more difficult to swallow.

And honestly, Darkest Hour and The Post are a lot more artistic than people give them credit for.  The cinematography in Darkest Hour is particularly notable and bold.&&Its the most ""its pretty good"" film of the year 

incredibly safe, tried to do what spotlight did and just did everything worse &&It was a good story, and an important one. However, It it was phoned in by both Streep and Spielberg. Hanks in my opinion did a decent job mind you.&&>The Post is a fantastic film. 

It's a fantastically-made film. It's well-acted. But it is very by-the-numbers and unchallenging.&&I was talking about the poster.&&I have not seen world of tomorrow &&I also loved the ending and thought it was perfect for the film&&Wish Bladerunner had made the nomination list just so I could see his poster for it.&&Behold the Coagula. &&Same here. The actual poster for Killing of a Sacred Deer is gorgeous too.&&Reminded me of ‚ÄúThe Night Of‚Äù&&Are criterion collection covers ""for"" the average moviegoing audience? &&Not sure what this have to do with being smart. I just assumed he chose to not have the title for some reason, so I didn't investigate it any further.&&Fuck I‚Äôm dumb
&&I don't think making something less than obvious and hard to read is smart. It's poor design. 

Great stuff here in general, but that piece of the Get Out poster is bad imo. &&I‚Äôve only stared noticing it after Batman v Superman was released. So presumably when audiences started paying more attention to quality (since BVS collapsed at the box office after the terrible WOM). &&OP, please provide prints. We will give you money.&&Which was taken straight from real life (but in French)&&I meant the cover specifically, but yeah Dunkirk was amazing. One of the greatest IMAX films I've ever watched in theaters.  

Blade Runner was so good. I wish it got a little more love. &&The real flyers were actually very different.&&[It was indeed.](http://dunkirk1940.org/index.php?&p=1_245)  &&I disagree. Their covers are certainly [more artistic](http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/312084/10803708/1297991021937/criterioncovers.jpg?token=862g9sc66H9X5d2iXMKPfqA2Rrc%3D), but they don't abandon the basic principles of effective design. The most important info - the title - is legible, not hidden. &&Yeah but the titles are always clear and legible no matter how stylized.&&While it may not be the intention of the style, any art that includes information but does not clearly represent it just diminishes its own artistic impact. Unless the intention is illegibility \(like a ""muddy waters"" feel or ""overwhelming expectations"" with a cover full of words you're not necessarily meant to read\) then it can't be claimed that the ambiguous representation is just part of it. The art is by no means bad, I just want to point out that it can't hide behind ""style"" as an excuse.&&with the post one, if the rest of the papers were really blurred out i think it mightve drawn your eye to it quicker&&Yeah the font on the Florida Project was basically unreadable too.&&I don't even think it was clever. To me, it smells of someone *trying* to be clever. And poorly executing the idea. (Poorly executing that one piece, obviously OP is very talented.)&&I agree. It's god awful design in my opinion. &&Too hard for a movie cover, too readable for black metal band logo.&&As much as I loved ‚ÄúThe Post‚Äù, I‚Äôm mixed on the cover. Maybe if the edited masthead was centered instead of at the top it would be better, but I‚Äôm not a graphic designer.&&[deleted]&&That ""metal"" poster is covered in spiders!&&Apparently the director originally wanted to keep Harrison Ford‚Äôs being in the movie a secret, setting up his first scene to be a bit of a surprise moment for viewers but marketing wouldn‚Äôt have it. They put him front and center on posters and even the Blu-ray cover even though most of the movie doesn‚Äôt really have him in it. Would have been much cooler as a secret. 

Also, blorange. 

Edit: here‚Äôs a link that confirms that the director said he wanted to keep it a secret. Warning there are some story spoilers at the link. 

https://screenrant.com/blade-runner-2049-harrison-ford-secret/&&Exactly, and I think a poster can help convey what kind of movie it is. Assuming I don‚Äôt know anything else about a movie, if it has a [generic blue and orange poster](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/blueorange500_229.jpg), I generally assume it‚Äôs your typical blockbuster fare, whereas if it has a more artistic cover I expect it to be a more thoughtful movie&&For true.

Beautiful film.&&I did, so maybe? I don't cry easily tbh, and I was a wreck when it was over&&Maybe, not many movies left me with tears welling up except for this movie and Coco last year. The ending hits hard.&&The two movies you‚Äôve brought up here (Moonlight, The Artist) were rather anomalous choices for the Academy, in my opinion. Million Dollar Baby, Argo, Crash, A Beautiful Mind...these are more indicative of the Academy‚Äôs choices. Those are all fine films, by the way, But they are very by the numbers sorts of choices.

I thought both The Darkest Hour and The Post were very good, by the way. I just didn‚Äôt think they were as good as The Florida Project, and I was offering a rationale as to why the Academy may have chosen them instead.&&I'm curious why you used The Artist as an example when it jerked the Academy off harder than any movie has in a long while. A movie entirely about the history of Hollywood and cinema? Easy in. The Shape of Water definitely got points for this too even though it played a much smaller part in the movie.

To be clear I loved The Artist, just saying it was OBVIOUSLY going to be loved by Academy members.&&Most of the Academy is old white people. You didn't see the leaked info that a bunch of members weren't even considering Get Out for awards because it's a ""comedy""? 

I have zero faith in them not to pick the boring by-the-numbers choices. I'm sure Darkest Hour and The Post are pleasant, well made movies that I'll forget about the instant after I see them, but there's no way they should be taking spots from films with an actual cinematic impact like TFP, BR2049, or Good Time&&Disagree in that I don't think it wanted to be the same as Spotlight. Spotlight had more of a focus on the actual investigation and them discovering just how bad things were. 

I agree that The Post is good but great. It is very much Oscar bait and took far less risks than Spotlight. &&Fair point. &&u/herky140

^^^^/s&&It's a neatly stylistic cover for people who are already familiar with the movie. *Dunkirk* is a brutally violent story of heroism against impossible odds, though. You don't get the grittiness and despair that are key themes in that story from this cover.&&Oh my god if it would've have been a surprise it would've been great. I don't think the absence of Harrison Ford would've deterred anyone from seeing it.&&I had the same complaint about Kingsman 2: the previews would have you believe it's a Channing Tatum film, but he's only in about ten minutes' worth. &&I don't think that's legitimate. Maybe Villeneuve would have theoretically preferred Ford to be a secret, but he lost that option pretty early. I'm attaching an article (Nov. 2014) from almost two years before production started which quotes Ridley Scott (executive producer) saying Ford will be in the movie, and will show up in the third act.

So this was confirmed before Villeneuve was even attached (Feb. 2015) and didn't come from marketing.

https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/25/7286991/blade-runner-2-wont-be-directed-by-ridley-scott&&I really agree with him. I avoid trailers, spoilers, *everything* before seeing a movie. But I knew Ford was in it. I literally was expecting him in every scene until he finally came up.

Still top 5 movie for me last year, but it definitely was a nagging thought as I watched it. And I'm not a Blade Runner fanboy or anything. I was just expecting to see him more based on the poster. &&It gives you an indication of what the entire public sphere is like. The general community have a similar leaning to creative works as reddit. &&Criterion regularly does flash sales too. I always pick something up on the sales&&It's a small distinction, certainly, but to say ""Criterion *has* a streaming service"" or even calling it a partnership implies that they have at least partial ownership over FilmStruck, which they don't. FilmStruck just has the current licensing deal for the streaming rights to The Criterion Collection, [like Hulu before it](http://screencrush.com/criterion-collection-leaving-hulu/). You don't even get access to The Criterion Collection in[ the base FilmStruck package](https://www.filmstruck.com/us/sign-up).&&There can be a lead male and lead female. So in this case, Day-Lewis is leading male actor&&McDonaugh's work is typically ridiculous and over the top. It's a clear mark of the auteur. There's nothing wrong with not appreciating his style, but personally I consider him a brilliant filmmaker.&&I went to one of those oscar showcases last weekend and realized why people love this movie so much. It's loud and shouts it message at you for awhile, then changes it's pace for a slow, contemplative scene that tricks people into thinking that message was a subtle realization. These scenes exist essentially to make sure the point they were they were hammering into you was absorbed. This makes the catharsis feel earned without actually taking you on the journey to get there.      
I can't really fault people for enjoying this movie though. General crowds like to think they 'get' films but some movies are crafted to elicit this specific response. There's a term for this in wrestling and this film is a textbook ['work'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms). With that said, Three billboards is still better than the average film and has some great virtuosic performances. I also went into the second viewing picturing a western and had a great time. Carter Burwell's score makes is perfect for that kind of viewing.            
Edit: Hostiles is a film that came out this year that tackles the same themes but has more cohesive storytelling. I'd recommend it if you enjoyed Three Billboards at all or westerns in general.&&Having grown up in a small town in Missouri, I can tell you that the police station closed at about 8pm.&&You clearly haven't experienced some rural towns and cities in the US. Many can't afford to have a station open 24 hours and simply have someone on call.&&Small towns often have a really big problem with finding and retaining police officers. My local PD had an on call officer, but the police station definitely closed at night.&&You're kinda missing the point of the movie. 

This is a crazy small town. It's about the intersection of big world and small town politics. Take for example the relationship between Willoughby and Mildred. In ""big world"" politics they were staunch rivals, who were openly at war with each other. In ""small world"" politics, they were surprisingly close friends, although still rivals - but they each understood and respected the game the other has to play. 

Small towns aren't the same as a big city. You can get away with more shit. That's the point they're trying to make. 

Further, Dixon not being charged comes as a result of the arc between him and Red Wellby. Wellby forgives him - which translates to the swing within Dixon. &&Grew up in a small town in Iowa that had no police station because they couldn't afford to pay for officers after the recession in 2008. There's still no police station.&&You‚Äôd be surprised what a corrupt police force can get away with in a small town. I remember reading a ‚Äúcreepy small town stories‚Äù thread on AskReddit and some of the stories involving the police made my jaw drop.&&Cops literally get away with murder in metropolitan cities, his portrayal isn‚Äôt far off. Growing up in a cluster of small farming towns one is the ‚Äúcounty seat‚Äù where you would find the larger jail and more police and the smaller cities would have tiny police offices that would indeed close early.&&I've been told to think of the movie as more of a stage performance because that's Martin McDonagh's thing but I still think it didn't do anything all that well. All of the humor in the movie thudded for me. The scene when her ex-husband stops by and his girlfriend walks in is like high school play level funny. &&I used to be able to say this, now I cry like a baby at just about anything. Kids do this to ya.&&That's fair, and I agree, but I don't think that explains why The Florida Project was snubbed.  You could list a number of auteurs who are even less ""by the numbers"" than Sean Baker that the Academy hasn't ignored (Linklater, Malick, Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, etc.).

Which is just to say I really don't have an explanation for why The Florida Project was snubbed.&&Crash is a terrible heavy handed movie though. It's pure oscar bait and nothing else.&&It wouldve been better if it went on the spotlight route instead of Meryl Streep's character's hammy plotline of ""hey im this rich sucessful white lady but feel bad for me because men dont listen to me"" that was so ham fisted and obvious it may aswell have been in all caps running along the bottom of the screen like on the news&&Yes, art can be subtle. Subtelty can be great. But this does the opposite of stand out. How many comments here are about how they didn't even notice it? If it's so subtle lots of people are missing it it's too subtle. 

I just think it was a poor design choice, and a poorly executed one as well. &&The great thing about the original flyer is that it doesn‚Äôt show Dover, making it feel like there is no escape for the troops.&&Very interesting the note to the French begins with ""comrades"" while to the British its just ""British soldiers""&&It says ""Les Alles"" for the Allies, and ""Les Allemands"" for the Germans. Does that make the word ""German"" in french literally an alliance of ""mands""? whats a Mand?&&It's one of those things were if you do your job right, no one notices. So ppl question why's the job so important&&[deleted]&&Lol you got me on that one. Very interested in what the art direction was for that cover. Not their best work for sure!&&Totally. I would have but I bet people would have been freaking out that he wasn‚Äôt included in the movie. I bet that would have been a fairly major talking point for people who didn‚Äôt trust the new director or vision or whatever. It might have been a hard secret to keep but would have been cool for them to try at least. &&Then I'll say ""there a streaming service where you can watch a lot of Criterion films"" &&But has a film ever had two same sex leads get nominated?&&In Bruges is one of my favourite movies ever. I thought it blended comedy with drama so perfectly. It was over the top in all the right places. 

For me, Three Billboards was tonally all over the place. Plot points that didn't make sense, the drama felt like it was competing with the humour that fell flat most of the time. Was extremely disappointed. 

Wanted to love it, and I think McDonough is very talented (anyone who made In Bruges is), but I can't see the hype for it either.  &&You just reminded me that Crash won best picture. It still shivers me timbers.&&Way to belittle people who just liked the movie. You can say you disliked it but to say the people who did like it were tricked by ""fake catharsis"" or whatever is actually pretty rude.&&Or as the case has been in a few small towns I've lived in; no police at all just the county sheriff to cover you, the other tiny places and all the folks in the. county &&Not just US. Many Australian towns will have one or two cops, if they're busy or sleeping the cop shop is closed.&&I've seen all best picture and Three Billboards was my favorite of all of them. Guess I'm a dumbshit. &&No black people like three billboards. The guy who is supposed to be the hero is racist, never atones for that, and we are just supposed to say, ‚Äúok he‚Äôs racist, but he did this other thing so...yay‚Äù&&Absolutely agree. I don't get the praise in any form for this movie outside of Francis Mcdormand's performance- she was a blast to watch.&&That‚Äôs fair too. I will say that those auteurs have a far bigger profile than Baker, and that it wasn‚Äôt until later in their careers that they were really recognized (Badlands, Days of Heaven, Rushmore, the first two Before movies, Dazed and Confused - no Oscar noms for any of them). PTA had some screenwriting noms for Boogie Nights and Magnolia, but it wasn‚Äôt until There Will Be Blood that he started to really get the recognition he deserves.

I have no doubt that based on what I‚Äôve seen from Baker, he will break through as well.&&Allemands is because Germany in French is Allemagne.
The French word for the Allies is Alli√©s.

The two are not directly related in meaning in today's French, but if you look into the etymology of the word you can find some similarities.

Allemagne could mean either ""all men"" or ""foreign men"" in proto-Germanic (which derives from the same family as many languages, including French.) &&but french doesn't mash words like german though lol&&Shit I just lost The Game&&It's also probably the least readable of the Criterion releases. I actually saw a list of ""The 50 Best Criterion Collection Covers,"" and The Game was #50. I'm guessing they only had 50 releases at the time.&&More often than you'd think. To name some examples: Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in Thelma & Louise, and F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce in Amadeus (Abraham actually won).

Here's a [Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_movies_with_more_than_one_Academy_Award_nomination_in_the_same_category) for movies without multiple nominations in a category.&&....yes&&For me Crash is a legit bad movie. It feels like a dumb teenager talking about racism.

And it fucking won against Brokeback Mountain.&&I‚Äôm with you bro. He‚Äôs just part of internet horde who believe somehow they are more insightful and knowledgeable. &&Three Billboards was the clear standout. &&I've seen most and agree completely. Lady Bird had high notes, and I don't see what anyone sees I'm Phantom Thread, I'm proud of myself for not just walking out.&&I‚Äôve seen them all and as well and I‚Äôm still pissed Blade Runner 2049 wasn‚Äôt at least in contention there.&&There are no heroes in Three Billboards and all main characters are deeply flawed. I don‚Äôt think the director wants the audience to cheer for any character.&&He does nothing to celebrate, because he's fundamentally a shitty person. They quite literally address this in the film, because it's made clear that a bad person that does a good thing does not make them a good person. 

Conversely the mother is a good person who is about to do a bad thing, which is why she wants the bad person to help. 

But really, the whole fucking film is about how things aren't as easy or as clear cut as you imagine they are. This is the central plot of the movie: Solving her daughters murder.

In case you didn't notice, the murder doesn't get solved. Probably never will be. But she's doing something that will make her fell better about it and be able to sleep at night. Or. Will she? 
&&It boggles my mind that people come out of that movie thinking Dixon is ""supposed to be the hero"". The whole point of his arc is that he's an irredeemable asshole, what makes you think we're supposed to root for him?&&Thanks for clearing that up. &&Not counting laser disc releases, The Game was actually their 627th release. &&I was iffy about the tone until the end which I thought was perfect and brought everything together. Nice to know not everyone on reddit disagrees with me. &&I saw all of them, for me the only one that felt like an oscar movie was Dunkirk. Hell I'd even put Molly's Game over the other noms, but that didn't make the cut.&&standout in what way? like the best? cause I would agree then, three billboards was clearly the best of the best picture nominees to me personally. &&I was definitely joking. The list I was referencing was released in late 2017, so there's certainly more than 50 releases.&&I'm convinced it's going to take home best picture. 

We're getting one of those whacky Oscars with no sweep. Well, Rockwell is getting Supporting Actor. And McDormand might get Actress. Buuuut otherwise. &&odd, I saw Dunkirk back when it released and frankly I wasn't impressed much. It feels like maybe 7th or 8th of the 9 nominees in my mind.

I‚Äôm an actor (and producer) from the United Kingdom.

My question is this; do you remember a day on set that was particularly trying? What happened (if you can say) and how did you rise above whatever difficulties you experienced that day?  &&You are a rising star in the industry.

A fellow actor here from Mexico. My name is Abraham Vega and I'm 24 years old.

I'M YOUR VOICE IN LATIN AMERICAN SPANISH!

I was wondering if you have any idea of our work as voice over talents and also wanted to tell you how much of an honor has been making your voice and translating the passion you put in your characters with my voice.

You can find me on Twitter as @TheAbeVega

How uncomfortable was the stormtrooper armor? I heard that you couldn't sit down in the old armor due to the butt plate, was wondering how it was for you and the other artists in these films with the First Order designs.

Do you still stand by the above 2 statements? The first one is just blatantly false, so I would hope you don't stand by it and the second one seems like a useless statement. Why would an all white or all black cast be a negative for a movie? Do you not understand that there are stories/countries/etc that make having a racially diverse movie stupid?

Two questions:

1) How was stunt training for PFU different from the training you underwent for the SW movies?

2) What are your thoughts on Oscar Isaac's one-man push for a Finn and Poe relationship and on him hilariously ""fully endorsing"" it a couple of weeks back on a sign?

You are a breath of fresh air in the new Star Wars movies, and I truly enjoy your personality and enthusiasm! 

How you feel about becoming a part of the Star Wars universe? What is your opinion of the Comic Con scene? Will you be a Ford who seems genuinely annoyed by the questions he gets about Solo, or would you embrace the attention similar to Hamil?&&Hey John.

My question is, based on trailers and previews for Uprising, some fans are feeling that without Del Toro the film won't be the same as the original.  is there any way you can reassure for us that this new direction will bring surprises and also be a true sequel to Pacific Rim?

Secondly, what is it like being a cultural icon? Star Wars is, on its own, already a huge landmark in history and pop culture, so what does it feel like to be a face of the new era of Star Wars?

Please and thank you :)&&My boyfriend takes roleplay way too seriously. I love him more than anything and we have been together for 4 years. We work a busy schedule so we probably have sex once a week. He has never said no to any of my fetish requests and its great. He has one request for me though and that is roleplaying. He loves it and after all hes done for me, it seems like an easy thing to do considering he's never asked me for anything else.

He just takes it so seriously that it makes me confused. It's not the typical naughty school girl thing. He buys me outfits and they've always been from his favourite shows/games/films. We have so many costumes that I'll never have to buy another costume for Halloween again.

For example, he got me a full Hogwarts outfit to wear and he had one too. I thought I would make it a bit slutty so I didn't wear anything except stockings under the robe. He told me to get the shirt on and take the stockings off because ""what student at such a prestigious school of wizardry dresses like that"".

The next thing is how long and realistic it gets. Using the Harry Potter example, he was a student and he literally spent half an hour talking about the 'OWL exams' and how he was striving for outstanding. It had no relevance to the sex whatsoever. I tried to speed it along but he told me that a Witch wouldn't act like this during her OWLs. It took around an hour of roleplaying until we got to anything sexual.

He even does voices. I came home to find a Bo Peep outfit once and I had to endure sex with him hearing catchphrases from Woodie. I never thought I would be getting fucked by Woody shouting ""Yee-haw! Giddy-up partner!""

He wanted to do Spiderman once so I was meant to be some girl and he wanted to climb through the bedroom window in the middle of the night at a random time. I really don't want to wait all night for some masked man to climb through my window. He said he wasn't going to do Spiderman if he can't climb through the window so we settled on just vanilla sex. It wasn't the same at all though and it feels like he needs the roleplaying. I've told him that I can't be bothered doing it to this extent every time but after 20 minutes of roleplay, it wasn't enough for him and we had below average sex. We've tried without costumes but its still not the same. He just watches ordinary porn too, no costumes. I'm just so puzzled by it all. I had a previous partner who liked roleplay but it was your typical sexy teacher, not me getting fucked by Chewbacca. How can we fix this?&&Why did you ruin Pacific Rim 2.

I still to this day ask anyone who visits if they've seen *Attack The Block* and if they haven't, I pull out the Blu-ray.

Thanks and look forward to seeing your work in PR2 and the next Star Wars!&&Hi John! So I guess my comment didn't go through (New Mexico internet is the crappiest internet on the planet) Anyways, I'm a fan and I was just wondering what was it like working small films all the way to landing a role in Star Wars? Also, I'm a fan of Pacific Rim (I get made fun of for it cause apparently its cheese but I love it) I was wondering is the Jager pilot suit more comfortable than the Stormtrooper suit? &&What movies/actors/directors inspired you to become an actor?&&What has it been to star in one of the largest movie franchises of all time? How has that affected your time with Pacific Rim? &&What's your Nandos order?&&Hey John, hope your are having a grest time doing your press tour,  l have 2 Qs

Q.Which hero do you play the most in battlefront 2?

Q.Other than Gipsy Avenger and Danger, what is your favorite Jaeger from either movie?

&&Hey John! I was wondering what you did to get into the film industry. Are there any steps someone like me could take to try and get ahead of the game, or is it pure luck?&&Hi John, what are some projects are you currently doing outside of these blockbuster films?&&Do you think that Battlefield: Earth should have been a Tyler Perry movie?&&What country will you attend for Pacific Rim?&&Hi John,  do you like roles that let you speak normally or ones that lets you use an accent?&&What was your favorite part of working on Star Wars?&&Yes. In talks now, haha.&&No actually, I definitely wanted to have the same gravity and same command that Stacker had but Jake starts off quite different to his character so we had to make our own unique character. 
&&Collaborate! It's the actor's job to fill out a role that is obviously written on the script. It just needs life and energy breathed into it and you need to be collaborative with your actor in order to find new ideas and new ways to do things that you find you just create genius. 
&&Oh, definitely the jaeger pilot suit. The most comfortable one.
&&No, I was in tears more than anything.
&&No sir!
&&No sugar.
&&My mom loved me in a TV show called *My Murder* that I did back in London, and Dad is most looking forward to *Pacific Rim* actually because it just has much more action.
&&Training is the emphasis. Be ready for the opportunity that is auditions. But enjoy the process.&&No, but it's the same process on set actually in telling all these stories. One isn't easier, it's just different in the sense that there's...the characters are different, the seriousness and energy on set is different, but I do think it's all the same experience.
&&The best car I've ever driven was my first ever car.

&&So this is one of those fancy canned questions?&&You genius.&&I didn't know that your hours, they expand, you're doing a lot of work after hours to make sure that by the next morning creatively the scene is in a good condition or creatively at  the same time the actors understand and there may be a different point of view or different emphasis that otherwise would have been normal and so obviously constantly improving the script and that's something I'm not used to obviously as an actor i'm used to kind of a set way and that's something for sure. 
&&For me it was the opportunity to be involved in creative process early on in a project which otherwise you don't get to be involved in as an actor and also as a scifi fan to kind of get impacts most of the ideas that most of the time I would keep to myself, to be given the chance to display them was something that was very very fun.  And it leads your career forward in a very good way.  
&&I've always wanted to be an actor ever since that was a decision process in my head and I wanted to act since the age of 9. &&I was living on my estate when I was filming *Attack The Block* and they always brought like fancy cars to come and pick us up and for me that just brought too much attention, to all were trying to do so I would always cycle to sit past the big ol‚Äô Mercedes Benz's trying to not raise attention to nearby civilians. &&Nice to finally see a question about this awesome movie after scrolling through so many about Pacific Rim and Star Wars.

Let Guillermo Del Toro finally make At the Mountains of Madness¬Ä¬ô,33449,82ruyz,https://theoutline.com/post/3598/guillermo-del-toro-at-the-mountains-of-madness-revival,1897,1520457015.0,,"*Del Toro wrote, ""The studio is very nervous about the cost and it not having a love story or a happy ending, but it's impossible to do either in the Lovecraft universe."" In July 2010 it was announced that the film would be made in 3D and that James Cameron would become producer, and Tom Cruise was attached to star. This ""was a startling prospect considering Lovecraft's tale had long been considered unfilmable."" Del Toro confirmed that the film would begin production as early as May 2011 and start filming in June. However, in March 2011, it was announced that ""Universal Studios refused to greenlight the project due to del Toro's insistence that it be released with an R rating rather than a PG-13.""*

An R-rated Lovecraft story directed by Guillermo del Toro sounds like it would be a hit.&&Let him make whatever the fuck he wants.&&That would be great but I don't think Doug Jones would be up for playing every single creature in that film.&&YES! YES! YES! 
i still desperately want a MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS film from Del Toro!! &&My team and I made a 9 minute animated version of The Mountains of Madness for our college thesis after we heard that Del Toro wasn't going to be able to make his. If you're still craving some Lovecraft check it out! Hopefully one day Toro will get his greenlight and we can see a proper treatment.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wLC_vByu0k&&Hey, Universal. Know how your ""Dark Universe"" series is kinda sucking? Well there's this guy named Guillermo...&&Having seen the script online, I don't blame studios for passing on it. Very run-of-the-mill sci fi horror stuff, didn't capture Lovecraft well at all. 

If he's going to do it, it needs a good rewrite. 

&&What I would really like would be a ""Fatasia"" like movie based on
""The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"", which personally was my favourite Lovecraft story by far.

And once you read it you realise how influential it must have been to the ""Souls"" series of games.

Both Mountains and Madness and Kadath are hard to sell as conventional movies though, because both (as opposed to other Lovecraft stories) just fundamentally don't build around any usable amount of dialogue, and it wouldn't serve the material imho to rewrite it in a sense that they did.

I'm not sure either audiences or financiers are nescesairily up for having a predominantly visual journey, without people chattering about about what is happening.&&I'd say he should pitch it to Netflix but I don't know if they're willing to shell out the kind of money that Guillermo would require?&&The script that was put out online a while back (and is linked here somewhere) was just terrible.  It read like ‚ÄúThe Thing‚Äù, with the shoggoth turning from a huge monster subway train of eyes, tentacles, and goo, into a bunch of ‚ÄúThe Things‚Äù, mimicking different people in the expedition but it‚Äôs also a slug because salt kills it, making it no threat to the rest of the world unless it gets on a boat to cross the ocean. It‚Äôs all told through flashback by a crazy survivor instead of a wise man trying to make a case to not explore the Antarctic. When they leave Antarctica at the end Cthulhu shows up and there is time distortion and they imply that the shoggoth made it back on a boat and is like, a thinking, intelligent, consciously evil creature. Also there‚Äôs a part where they walk into an elder things lab with like extremely explicit wall carvings of them making all life on earth, in like a evolutionary chart type way,but it sounds much more cartoony than what‚Äôs in the book where it reads like they are really trying to piece it together from tons of carvings.

Basically it‚Äôs like someone who doesn‚Äôt like mountains of madness read it, and thought ‚Äúthis needs more star power, lets put Cthulhu in it.‚Äù And just keep poorly adding to it until it was that mess.

The kicker is in the beginning there‚Äôs this sad love story where the main character leaves his pregnant girlfriend to go on the expedition.  But only because his superior lies to him about something, then I think she or the kid or both die in childbirth.

It‚Äôs suuuuper mediocre with none of the suspense or horror of the book. They legit show an elder thing dead in like the first 10-20 pages as a way to motivate the main character to go to Antarctica.

If it‚Äôs anything like that it‚Äôll suck. The horror of the book is mans insignificance on earth and the implications of discovering an elder alien race. The draft online wasn‚Äôt scary, or entertaining.&&The issue with making *any* Lovecraft movie is that Lovecraft really only works in text.

Most people associate the author's work with Cthulhu. The thing is, that story was about the most un-Lovecraftian one that he wrote, rather like how ""Stairway to Heaven"" sounds pretty dissimilar to the rest of Led Zeppelin's works. Most of what Lovecraft wrote was psychological horror, offered in a way that was meant to make readers feel just as insane as the characters. The descriptions and events aren't things that can be seen, because they can't even be imagined... and the ability to prompt people toward *trying* to imagine them was what made Lovecraft as skilled as he was. *At the Mountains of Madness* relies on descriptions and literary devices that can't be duplicated on screen, meaning that just about any adaptation would be the director's interpretation.

Now, granted, we can make the argument that *any* cinematic endeavor is the director's own interpretation, and I'm sure Guillermo Del Toro would offer a fantastic one. As talented as he is, though, something tells me that he knows a thing or two about the comparative strengths and weaknesses between the written word and what can be watched.

**TL;DR: Let Guillermo Del Toro offer whatever he personally thinks he's capable of offering.**&&Why is it that everytime lovecraft comes up, people feel the need to remind everybody that he was a racist. Even in the very first sentence. I don't see people doing that with Hemingway. 

I consider myself pretty far left but I don't think it is necessary to remind people that one author from pretty racist times was pretty racist. Especially when nothing comes out of it. Like in this article: ""he was a racist now completely different topic."" 
What's the point of this?&&HBO, Netflix, somebody...create a serial story, maybe similar to American Horror Story, and center it around the Cthulhu Mythos.  Make AtMofM an 8 part season.  Maybe use Call of Cthulhu as another, or the Dream Quest story.  Maybe use one season as a collection of shorter pieces, even some that fall outside the Mythos specifically.  TV-style content is where it's at right now.  Supernatural-based shows are popular, too.  This is a no-brainer, imo. &&[removed]&&I really want him to finally be able to make that 'Pinnochio' that he's been talking about. The idea that he has sounds amazing,&&I've been begging for this for a while. The nameless horror, the eldritch mystery, the unspeakable suspense of being terrified by the trickery of cinematography alone, has only been done well by the likes of great directors like Kubrick, and Hitchcock. Del Toro is one of them, and if he can properly create fanciful monsters that light up the screen, and creatures of lore that can entrance audiences, then why not let him take a crack at what could be the gold standard for modern horror in the vein of an author most are even afraid to consider interpreting to film.

Isn't it time someone tried?&&There are many reasons I wish I had Bill Gates type money but one of them would be when obvious good ideas like this come along and corporate suits are too pussy to follow thru.

I'd just walk up to Guillermo, hand him a check for $300 million and say ""This is for Mountains of Madness. I want to sit next to you at the premiere, 5% of the returns forever, and don't you dare spare a thought for the rating while deciding what should go on the screen. That is the last creative input you'll get from me.""&&Fuck Yeah! This is what I immediately though of after he won. &&Wasnt budget the big issue? As great a job as he did with Shape of Water its not like it made a ton of money.&&One of my favorite books of all time.  I would absolutely love if this happened.  Especially since it's a project of passion for him.&&Can someone give me a tl,dr quick synopsis about what this book is about?

if not I'll google it I guess

EDIT: thanks to all of you who gave me a quick intro to the story. I will definitely be checking out the audiobook on YouTube. &&I want a bioshock movie where there's a mute Japanese character that is played by Hideo kojima in it.

I also want Hideo to retire from gaming in 2 decades to start working on movies &&Sounds like there are a few outspoken people who do not care or like the popularity of Lovecraft. You sound so dam edgy with your bad self. I mean almost every major horror writer pays homage to Lovecraft and his work is littered through out pop culture. From Video Games to Comics. Lovecraft is massive. Cthulu is referenced as much as any other bad ass scifi/fantasy/horror monster. Quit playing yourself.&&> H.P. Lovecraft was a bitter racist and reactionary

What does that have to do with the rest of the article?&&I would love him to do The Shadow over Innsmouth and Call of Cthulhu. It fits his pastiche.&&Do we really have to preface articles about deceased artists with whether or not they were racist? Let their work be their work and save it for relevant discussion.&&This was one of the first audiobooks I had.  It was amazing.  I read the story a few times, but listening to a voice actor read it was truly a memorable time.  I hope this gets made into a movie.  &&The only Lovecraftian movie that would work for me is a movie that you don't know will be Lovecraftian in nature. Advertise it as a rom-com, and have a Lovecraftian twist. Like that music video with the kids sneaking into the pool.&&Oh god. Can you imagine? The world is not ready. Some of the scariest nightmare fuel ever concocted by mans fevered mind, brought to life by one of the best directors of our generation.

Del Toro loves this story and its material. It would be his passion project. You'd have people walking out of the theater because they couldn't handle it. People would be traumatized for years. It would probably be the scariest movie ever made. 

*Sounds wonderful...*&&One of the most Lovecraftian films I have seen besides The Thing (which is my favorite horror movie of all time) would have to be The Void. B movie horror that came out a few years ago that just screams Lovecraft. It by no means stands as strong as any of Lovecraft'actual work, which I mostly agree with people saying is near impossible to accurately translate to film, but it has that same cosmic dread, insanity, monster in the dark (though it shows the monsters a little heavy handed as The Thing did). Albeit, it has its own vibe, you can definitely see and feel the Lovecraftian I fluency in it.

Oh, and you cannot forget Event Horizon. Another movie that I felt was very Lovecraftian, even moreso than The Thing and The Void now that I think of it. By far, those are my three favorite horror films just because of the Lovecraftian vibe they have. &&While we're at it let Jodorowsky finally fo Dune please and thank you.&&He's starting to look like Milton from Office Space.&&Give me my Haunted Mansion movie so that the Eddie Murphy version can be erased from existence! &&PLEASE, He is like the only person living who could capture the horror and sheer alien-ness that is Lovecraft.

Other than John Carpenter but he does have a tendency to do a few silly touches to things, but that was the 80s.&&Fuck yes PLEASE! I‚Äôm sad Prometheus blocked it from happening but maybe their is a chance. &&We already have The Thing.

A truefull retelling of the story would be boring and long. The adaptation they need to do to make it interesting make it so that it is no longer ""at the mountains of madness""

If people want a Lovecraft movie, there are stories that are easier to adapt like Dunwitch Horror or The Horror at Red Hook, maybe even The Colour Out of Space or Rats in the walls. &&This is exactly what I thought when I heard he won.  It's so crazy we've never seen mainstream adaptations of this seminal work. &&YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES

Holy shit nobody can understand how freaking much I've been dying to hear this. Ever since it  first got cancelled i have not stopped thinking about it. 

This just made my freaking week&&The leaked script of it wasn't all that good, if he reworked that to make it more in line with the story I'd be all in. I honestly think there are other Lovecraft stories that would lend better to his monster designs overall. At the Mountains of Madness is all about discovery, and while there are some monsters, they are never really at the forefront (exception at the end, but I think it's one of Lovecraft's least inspired monsters)&&Fuck that! Let him make Silent Hills. &&Let him make Monster pleeease&&Let Guillermo Del Toro make aLL yOuR bAsE aRe bELoNg tO uS&&It's a good story, but I don't understand why everyone is clamoring for that one specifically. Shadow over Innsmouth would make a much better movie.

 At the mountains of madness (if I remember correctly) is mainly a narrator recounting a conversation where someone else talks about their adventures.&&As a huge fan of Lovecraft and del Toro, this idea is awesome but what the hell is with the opening line of the article? It‚Äôs not exactly relevant and seems to be a habit that is forming within the media...&&The perfect director for this. Whether or not people will ""get"" it is another thing.&&I don't see how you couldn't do a love story in a Lovecraftian film.

Shadow Over Innsmouth is all about the love between man and fish-man, for instance.&&Amazing movie? Most likely. A hit? Financially speaking, unlikely.&&Wasn't the last attempt at something Lovecraftian At the Mouth of Madness with Sam Neill? Not sure how well that did at the box office. I agree with some of the above comments that Lovecraft seems hard to convey on film. Elements and inspiration from his stuff works great, directly sourced though I dunno. &&>Tom Cruise was attached to star.

Might get downvoted to oblivion (no pun intended), but Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise in a movie to me, never the character, so I feel casting him would be off putting. However I'm not familiar with this story at all and maybe he fits into this role really well.

This is all irrelevant however if nobody will ever greenlight Del Toro to make this, but I digress.&&[deleted]&&A love story is perfectly doable....until they start to slowly embrace the sweet kiss of Insanity.&&If Crimson Peak is any indication, the production value, set design, costumes, etc will be incredible, and there will be ample atmosphere to go around, but all the parts may not come together as neatly as we may hope.

I really enjoyed SoW, but the film did have some pacing issues, and I was too dumb to understand the theory about [her being a fish-lady per her scars](#spoiler) on my first watch, so idk. Definitely won't have as much audience interest due to the IP, but will definitely get a boost from it being a GDT production&&Honestly, it's quite possible to have a love story in the Lovecraft universe. It would just have to be a minor aspect of the story and end in some horrifying way.&&I was going to say it‚Äôs literally impossible to convey an Eldritch beast that causes madness just by looking at it with a movie. The very nature of it makes it lose all effect after the first time you view it. The monster money shot cannot happen in Lovercraft. It‚Äôs like jaws, not seeing it makes it keep its effect, but the second you see it the effect is lost.&&> it not having a love story or a happy ending

Those are what ruins most movies, unnecessary, lazy, love story melodrama, and happy endings don't bring that heavy catharsis. Knowing that the characters have plot armor puts nails in the coffin.&&I'm really glad he didn't compromise the story and just didn't do it instead.&&But in 3D (gimmick) with James Cameron (gimmick) and Tom Cruise (no range)?&&YESSSSS JUST thinking about it makes me horny!!!&&‚ÄúNo!‚Äù - Konami (probably)&&He wanted to make it but the studio wouldn't put up the money&&He throws so many ideas at us that any of them will probably end up being a treat.

##iwanttobelieve&&Agreed. The worst part was that he makes a large chunk of it into The Thing Lite, with the shoggoths impersonating crew members and being revealed by a test. Also that he puts Cthulhu in the ending and wastes him completely. &&I read the script recently too, and it's very much what you described. At times it felt like a ripoff of ""The Thing"". &&Yeah I love Del Toro but the writing in his movies are by far the biggest weakness &&Not to mention that the story feels already done with Prometheus. &&Not to mention his highest grossing movie was Pacific Rim which made $411 million worldwide.

Stuart Gordon's movie Dagon is pretty good despite all it's limitations at the time it was made. &&> Lovecraft really only works in text

I don't know.  *Bloodborne* managed to nail Lovecraftian horror.&&I have to disagree.

The HPLHS did an excellent job with The Call of Cthulhu, and their radio shows are brilliant. They're especially entertaining live, but I love listening to them.

As far as TCoC being the least lovecraftian, again- gotta disagree. It's all about the maddening effects of witnessing something truly terrible! If anything, I'd say Horror at Red Hook is the least ""lovecraftian""- it's objectively awful even if you disregard the obvious racism.

When it comes to translating that dreadful madness onto screen, we can already see movies that have done this. The Shining imo did a great job of this- granted, our protagonist was already a little off when he started, he definitely falls into madness aided by some supernatural forces.

Look at The Thing, or In the Mouth of Madness. Absentia. There are plenty of movies out there that capture the lovecraft feel of horror.

I mean, hell if we want to talk about movies that don't show the monster: Blair Witch? That movie scared the piss out of people and never once showed the monster. It created madness and tension using light and sound. There are *film* devices to accommodate the lack of literal written literary devices.

My favorite example would be Oculus. It creates so much tension and we never *really* see the monster. In fact, we're left unsure if there *was* a monster. I wouldn't say Oculus is specifically Lovecraftian, but that feeling of dread is, to me, what makes Lovecraft so horrifying.&&I don‚Äôt know...a lot of people felt The Lord of the Rings was equally unadaptable to film but with the right director, production team and cast I think a lot of things are possible.

Granted, Tolkien‚Äôs work was far different than Lovecraft‚Äôs. Especially since the latter relied on creating indescribable horrors in the imagination that would become describable if put to the screen.

But Del Toro is a known fan of Lovecraft‚Äôs work and understands the core of how to tell a Lovecraftian story, even on film.&&[This is how I imagine a Lovecraftian creation would look like on-screen.](https://i.redd.it/dwqcikr4kgh01.gif)&&I always thought a good way to convey how indescribable a horror a certain character was witnessing was to just get a close up of the actor‚Äôs horrified expression.

For example, when Dyer and Danforth are running from the shoggoth at the end of Mountains, Danforth can look back and we get a shot of just his face, and maybe a small sliver of something in the reflection of his eyes, and all the sound will be cut off and it‚Äôll be in slow motion. Of course, you‚Äôd need a really good actor for it, and honestly Lovecraft deserves good actors for his films.&&Have you got any examples of these 'indescribable passages' ? I took a look at some of the artwork based of his writing and it seems pretty accurate compared to the descriptions.&&I don't have anything to add, but I 100% agree with you and that's basically what I have always told people. Most of the people I know in real life that even know of Cthluhu or Lovecraft think the term ""Lovecraftian"" means evil ancient aliens that live in the ocean with a bunch of tentacles. I think most of the people disagreeing with you secretly feel the same way and are just trying to justify it by reaching too far. The Shining was the closest a popular movie has been to being Lovecraftian imo as well. People say Bloodborne is Lovecraftian, but to be completely honest, it's just Dark Souls with weird tentacle-y monsters towards the end.

Keep on fighting the good fight.&&Nail on the head. I mean hell, take The Thing on the Doorstep. I don't know how to do spoiler warnings on here so I'll just say that in the final act, when we learn what the thing is (and what state it's in), and connect it back to what we heard on the phone before it dropped on the doorstep, holy crap, amazing writing. Sure any B-level movie studio could film it, hell I could probably whip up a student film version over a weekend, but the way Lovecraft led you right to the edge of your seat and then dropped the horror on you....damn. Truly amazing writing. 

Dangit, now I'm going to be up late reading from my Lovecraft anthology &&What? I'm sorry dude, but it sounds like you didn't read this particular story. Lovecraft went into extreme detail in this story... The creatures, their architecture, the geography... Whole pages he dedicated to describing the smallest things. There's only a couple of things he didn't describe completely. I mean, sitting here thinking about it I can still visualize the places and things in the story.&&Or Santeria and the rest of sublime's music.&&Thank you. Not everything can be made into a movie. And that's ok.&&Del Taco would easily do the cosmic horror of Lovecraft. Hellboy was heavily inspired by Lovecraft and I felt that Del Toro brought the cosmic horror aspect forward very strongy. &&As much as I appreciate this submission, I'm not sure the Led Zeppelin comparison really fits. You can find segments of ‚ÄòStairway‚Äô all over LZ IV, parts of III, and quite a few segments of Houses of the Holy.

In fact, one could argue that the sound they possessed during ‚ÄòStairway‚Äô was nothing more than a natural progression turned masterpiece. That entire album is full of original, timeless, and anthemic movements that carry the album at a flowing pace from start to stop, which was different from the other LZ albums in the sense that their choice of when and where to record pushed the direction and quality of the album production itself. Headly Grange was the most natural location for all band members to creatively work in a stress free environment, and the proof is in the musical pudding.

However, those are only the quality tracks. There are definitely a few winners that sound like carbon copy fillers that made it onto physical graffiti that just don't sound right, and those were supposed to be B-sides from LZ IV. If those had been accepted, I think we might be looking at different reviews of their musical direction, although still ultimately positive.

But yeah, didn't mean to become a wall of text here. I've just spent too much time listening to that group, the album, and the song itself to accept that it's that much different thematically or compositionally from the rest of their discography.&&I think another big hurdle with Lovecraft is that a lot of his writing is about people trying to comprehend or make sense of something they can't usually in the form of internal strife and their thoughts. This just doesn't translate that well to the screen without going the ""anime"" route of having people just saying what they're thinking. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of very skilled performances by actors with internal strife, but usually they manifest in some physical way. Lovecraft doesn't have his characters do much physically other than research and try to track things down which isn't the most engaging thing to watch. It's one of the reasons Lovecraft transferred so well to tabletop games like Arkham Horror but I just don't see it going on screen very easily. &&His racism is totally ordinary for that time. What I find funny is how he goes to great lengths to describe humanity as worthless, insignificant specks no more advanced than bacteria...but man those coloured fellas sure are inferior.  &&Maybe you should start asking Guillermo to try to approach Netflix.&&Thanks for the link.

If anyone wants to delve into some Lovecraft for free that hasn't checked out anything deeper, you can listen to my absolute favorite readings of his stories here:

I'd start with Haunter of the Dark as that's one of my favorite stories, especially with how well it's told. They really set the atmosphere fantastically well. &&Both of these stories seem like they would translate into film really well, and I would love to watch a full-on SoI film&&And I doubt you could find many famous people born in the 1800s that weren‚Äôt at least a bit racist. &&Honestly one of the worst intros to any article I've read. I don't see how it is even remotely relevant to the article at all. Could you imagine them starting an article about a new Disney movie like that?&&I don't think that's the *only* Lovecraft movie that would work, but I love that idea.  I've always been a little disappointed when the first season of TRUE DETECTIVE didn't end up being backdoor Lovecraft adaptation.&&Denis Villenuve (Sicario, Prisoners, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is making Dune. I think he's in post production for Sicario's sequel then he's gonna head it up. Dream come true for me. &&That movie was overrated. Jodorowsky was a fucking mentally ill lunatic and no sane producer in the past, present or future would ever let him make his movie on his own term. If Jodrowsky had been able to make his movie, it would've cost 200 million (without inflation), made a 50 million dollar loss, partly because he would've purposely said something controversial about sex with children in public so people boycotted the movie. Not too mention it would have been less an artistic masterpiece and more an ambiguous masturbatory act that would fail to grasp its original potential.

**TLDR: Jodoroswky is a mentally ill overrated hack who would have ruined his own version of Dune.**&&He did, he just renamed it Crimson peak haha. &&He just won multiple oscars for a love story about a fishman and a mute woman. He can make anything work at this point.&&I think the only way to do it would be to somehow dig unnervingly deep into the relationship. Have some unknown force that needs them to be together then slowly make them seem less like two people falling in love and more like two symbiotic parasites or something. &&Unironically, Dunwich Horror would probably be more appropriate there.

In a terrible and horrifying sense.

Actually what the fuck am I saying, the actual time that Lovecraft wrote a romance was 'The Thing on the Doorstep' (fun fact, he wrote it during/after his divorce). Now there's a fun story for the whole family.&&You have to add a strong female. Haven't you seen The Hobbit?&&See: [Dagon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0264508/) (btw: Erza Godden looks just like Buddy Holly) really amazing adaption of the story, any re-telling should pay special note to the modern setup and the hotel chase (also done very well in the game *Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth*) Also See: [The Last Lovecraft](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1522262/) A very funny movie with some great lines. Also see a very neat film shot as a silent film [The Call of Cthulhu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478988/) Another ""unfilmable"" film. 

I would really hate if holly wood ruined any Lovecraft story with a love story, or a happy ending or a PG-13 rating. 

edit: Not that they're particularly gory, or have nudity.

Like *this* project is what could revive big screen horror if they trotted out the 'directed by 3 time oscar winner del Toro' all over the place.&&Back in 2011 I would agree, but with the recent success of R-rated movies like Deadpool, Logan and IT maybe the winds have shifted.&&IT was rated R. And it was a financial success.&&Precisely. As much as I want to see GDT make a Lovecraft movie.. most of the market that hits the theater probably couldn't name a single Lovecraft story.  People on /r/movies and /r/games are incredibly naive when it comes to what would be a ""hit"".&&I understand Universal's stance that they want the movie to be PG-13 in order to attract a larger audience and make money since all movies are an investment, but for the love of god something needs to be said about making a movie that is worth watching. I hate it when production companies make movies that only appeal to lowest common denominator (e.g happy endings/love interests). 

I've always thought that a franchise such as Star Wars would be a good example of the potential that an R rating would do. To see an uncensored version would be incredible. Episode 3 was quite dark compared to the rest of the series and despite the acting by Hayden Christensen, it still remains one of my favorites. On top of that, none of the movies do any justice in showing people the real power of a Jedi. It's cool that they can throw around large structures like Yoda did with Count Dooku/Emperor Palpatine, but that just seems like childs play when in reality they are capable of bringing down a fucking star destroyer from the sky with their telekinesis. With Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, my dream of this happening is dead and instead I am forced to watch Rey (no experience with the force or wielding a lightsaber) take on Kylo Ren (taught the ways of the force by Luke Skywalker [who was taught by Obi-Wan and Yoda] and win.

If you mean *directly written by lovecraft*, then that's the last major one AFAIK.

If you're using ""Lovecraftian"" in the sense that the word is often used; i.e. ""having qualities similar to a Lovecraft story"", then Annihilation and (arguably) A Wrinkle in Time are both playing now.&&I just rewatched that recently actually.

I like him a lot as an actor. He may've been playing only as Tom Cruise these last few years, but I like that role anyways. Nobody does TC as well as TC, and the MI movies are a testiment to that. But for Lovecraft, the most important elements are dread and immersion, and while I see him capable of that, he'd have to really challenge himself for it.&&I'm going to go against the tide here and say a few of my favorite movies had Tom Cruise. He was in Legend by Ridley Scott, Vanilla Sky, Eyes Wide Shut... With the correct direction, he can be more than the action hero thing he is often placed as.

Although it wasn't Lovecraftian Horror, it was definitely Nordic something.&&when you gather enough insight that horrors that have been there all along suddenly become perceptible to you is one of the best executions of the Lovecraftian idea&&neo goth Victorian isn't really Lovecraft.  Bloodeborne just happens to have cosmic dread stuff in it. &&So did Eternal Darkness. &&I appreciate you making this argument as I agree wholeheartedly. You don‚Äôt need to see the monster just because it‚Äôs a movie, and basically all the other Lovecraftian boxes can be checked through skillful artistic direction and cinematography. I think you make an especially powerful point with the music; movies like The Witch (as if that hasn‚Äôt been brought up enough in horror discussions) prove the power of effective music to conjure thick and oppressive dread. 

Also all your movie examples are great; Oculus is underrated and Flanagan is one of the best modern horror directors as far as I‚Äôm concerned.&&*The Shining* is a decent example of how filmmaking can begin to emulate what Lovecraft did, I'll grant you. As this thread makes pretty clear, though, I think there's a dearth of understanding about what made him such an effective writer. The creatures and events weren't the point of his stories; the manner in which he described them was.

The best metaphor I can come up with is to compare hearing a scary story told in a low, sinister voice with listening to a telling of that same story (with the same details) being offered by Barney the Dinosaur. Lovecraft offered his work with a voice that coaxed readers into feeling the same madness experienced by his characters. It's *probably* possible to elicit a similar reaction with a film, but I haven't yet seen one that accomplished what the author in question could do with the written word.&&Another commenter brought up *The Shining* as an example of something fairly Lovecraftian being adapted to film, and while I don't think it quite hit the mark, I can admit that it was pretty close. In that case, though, Kubrick had to take some pretty subtle-yet-profound steps to make the storytelling work in the way that it did, like when he mixed up the shots of Danny riding through the halls in order to make viewers feel lost and disoriented.

If Guillermo Del Toro can accomplish the same thing while evoking a sense of cosmic, inescapable horror, then I'll be very impressed. Granted, that horror on its own isn't enough to make something truly Lovecraftian, but I'll concede that it's probably possible to affect a cinematographic ""voice"" that matches Lovecraft's.&&Please don't kill me for mentioning this ..  

The Blair Witch Project was obviously Lovecraftian. Explorers/investigators go wandering off chasing a myth of some sort.  The myth chases back.  You never once see a monster of any kind.  All you see is how crazy they are becoming from their environment and their increasing fear.&&This makes me violently uncomfortable. && Only poetry or madness could describe the noises heard&&I'd encourage you to read it again. You're absolutely right when you say that there's a lot of description, but I think you might be surprised by exactly what is being described. Starting from the entry into the ruins, things stop making sense. They're *presented* as making sense, certainly, but the characters' sanity starts to slip right away, and the way that the story was written was intended to foster a similar sentiment in readers.

Lovecraft pioneered the idea that the unknown is scarier than what can be seen, and his entire writing style was based around trying to blur the line between the two. If anyone can show that on the screen, I'm sure it's Guillermo Del Toro... but again, by the same virtue, I would expect him to know what could be accomplished in either medium.&&He‚Äôs too busy playing make believe with Kojima and Norman Redus. &&Man, if I had that kind of pull, I‚Äôd be all over it.  &&He ready has a working relationship with them. I can see it. &&That's my problem with making a Lovecraft film.  Lovecraft, from what I remember, relies so little on actual character interaction or dialogue.  Instead he builds a ""feel"" for the reader.&&I mean it's a tough thing to adapt but I agree.  The ominous feel is more or less replaced by pulpy cheese.  Dialogue fits more with the lighter nature of Reanimator honestly. &&[deleted]&&Better than Blade Runner made.&&Which makes it one of his few movies to have succeeded. 

And totally does not justify the 200 million budget that was being tossed around.&&Almost sounds like the plot to Alien V Predator. &&There's a difference between ""kinda racist but that was the era"" and Lovecraft, who got called out by his contemporaries for his racist views.

In the era of Jim Crow and ""Birth of a Nation,"" HP Lovecraft was notably racist... and it bled over into a lot of his stories. 

I mean, I really enjoy Lovecraft and the worlds he build, but he literally calls Africans and Spaniards ""savage apes"" in his tales.&&Denis Villeneuve isn‚Äôt doing much on Sicario 2. He was working on the early stages of writing, but he is not directing and probably won‚Äôt have much to do with post production. 

His next movie looks like it will either be Dune, or a movie about Cleopatra. &&I'm so fucking pumped for Villenuve's Dune. Jodorowsky would make a helluva visual trip, but I think Villenuve is the best director to do the story visual and narrative justice. &&Like the birthing of some horrible being into our dimension can only happen at the point of conception between two particular people who really don't like each other very much and deranged cosmic forces ally to cause it to happen. You could make it the first dark romantic comedy science fiction horror, and GDT is absolutely the guy to make that.&&Imagine having your relationship with someone else plotted out by an extra dimensional entity for their own purposes, like some kind of stupidly subtle, pan-dimensional Cupid.&&Oooo I like it!&&Yog-Sothoth and Me: A love story between an inbred albino girl and her spaghetti-hubby from another dimension.&&Well I mean based on OP's requirements that it have a ""happy ending"" Dunwich is probably the best for Lovecraft stories.  In the end the academics triumph and Yog-Sothoth is banished.

&&Kind of gory in spots, no?
&&Which is tragic. 2049 was the best movie released last year IMO. It may honestly have become my favorite movie of all time. And it fucking tanked. 

I feel it‚Äôs my obligation to go spend money on Annihilation even though it‚Äôs not quite my kind of movie, but I like that some of these riskier concepts are getting made and I want to help fund that. &&I've said this elsewhere, but the issue with Mountains is that it's only R rated because a single scene, but that scene is so important to the story that it has to be kept as is. All three of those movies are great, but they also all lean heavily into violence. What producer is going to fund a movie that can't be marketed to teens and kids, but also can't be marketed as a violent action or slasher flick?&&All of those are based on widely known properties, two of which involve very famous movies already and all 3 have strong built-in audiences.  None of them were given the budget Del Toro is asking for (Deadpool was made for about 1/3rd what Del Toro wants for Mountains)

I LOVE Del Toro.  Love him.  Even his ""bad"" movies like Crimson Peak.  But none of his movies have really made big money.  Pacific Rim is as close as it gets and that's only because it was saved by foreign box office (100M domestic, 309M overseas)

I mean consider the following, these are the FULL run, not opening weekend, hauls for his movies

Hellboy: 60M domestic, 40M foreign  
Hellboy 2:  76M domestic, 84M foreign  
Crimson Peak: 31M domestic, 43.5M foreign  
Shape of water:  58M domestic, 69M Foreign  

Now keep in mind that movies usually need to make at least 2x the budget to recover advertising costs and the like and you have to ask yourself, ""Why would an R rated Mountains of Madness perform like Pacific Rim and not like Crimson Peak?""  

I love me some Del Toro, but I don't see it.  He's got to find a way to make the movie for 75M or not at all.&&There is a movie right out right now, based on an original sci-fi/horror novel, about a group of scientists exploring a mysterious area. It was written and directed by a well-liked, well-reviewed, well-established director. It is an amazing film with thought provoking concepts. It is a hard-R with scary monsters and body horror. It is financially flopping and was basically abandoned by the studios even before release, with foreign distribution sold straight to Netflix. 

Things have not really changed that much. (The movie is called Annihilation in case anyone was wondering). &&It is worth noting that those all had.smaller budgets than Del Toro is asking for.  I would also say that they're more mainstream thematically - I haven't seen Logan (but it's based on an extremely popular character), but Deadpool and It still have a blockbuster feel to them tonally - Deadpool.is a superhero comedy and It almost feels like an 80s Spielberf-style adventure with horror imagery - than I would expect At the Mountains of Madness to be.&&IT also had more mainstream appeal. &&The really funny thing is that IT is riddled with lovecraftian themes.  This perverse timeless, ageless creature that feasts on flesh and views all humankind as insignificant cattle.  The fact that it choses to be a clown sometimes has really nothing to do with the pure horror of it.&&IT only cost $35 million to make. Way less risk. &&Lovecraft isn't hard to ""get."". His works can be verbous and not necessarily translate perfectly toward the current nomenclatures but his work is very easy to get.  Fear of the unknown.  Imagaining monsters and evil completely unknown to our sense of reality.  It's literally the boogieman.  Something no one could ever know or document.  &&[deleted]&&That movie rode a *massive* wave of nostalgia and the common fear of clowns. All you people thinking that Lovecraft is as well known as King by Joe Nobody (the person that needs to be interested for these big films to succeed) are absolutely delusional. I really hope some studio executive is dumb enough to take GDT‚Äôs Oscar win as a sign they can sell a 150 million dollar, R-rated Lovecraft movie, as I think it could be a great film, but it *will* be a flop. How many huge financial successes has Del Toro had? Pretty much all of his blockbusters have either underperformed (Hellboy) or barely broke even (Pacific Rim, which would have been a huge bust if not for China). Everybody acting like studios will be willing to suck Del Toro‚Äôs dick now that he has an Oscar are insane; The Shape of Water has made money, but only 57 million domestic. That‚Äôs a far cry from, say, James Cameron fucking sweeping the Oscars with Titanic and going on to have it become the highest grossing movie ever at the time. Money talks, and that‚Äôs the only area GDT doesn‚Äôt have much to say as far as being a filmmaker. If anything, I hope this Oscar allows him to get supported for one of his modestly budgeted films that could be an awards contender, like Frankenstein. &&I think that a movie about a clown terrorising kids is an easier sell than anything Lovecraftian&&If there was ever a project for Netflix to throw gobs of money at, this is it. &&Most movies I love aren't hits, if he can get it made by convincing the studio it will be, then hell yeah, go for it GDT. &&We're talking about the likelihood that a studio would fund the project, not whether or not we want it to be made. Movies are a business and studios aren't going to fund something that they're not going to make money on. $150 million is an insane amount of money to spend on anything, let alone something so niche, by a director who is hit-or-miss, financially speaking.

A lot of people are saying that the studios should trust Del Toro because of his history as an incredible filmmaker and they should trust the source material as something that people are familiar with. However, even assuming that most people are familiar with Lovecraft (and most people certainly are not), this isn't always a surefire thing. Look at 2017's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. A King Arthur movie directed by Guy Ritchie. What could go wrong? People are familiar with Arthurian legend and Guy Ritchie has made some amazing films (Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Sherlock Holmes, etc.). The film cost about $175 million (a tad bit more than Del Toro's proposed AtMoM), but only made back an unimpressive $39 million domestically. It was a total financial failure. Even though Ritchie is a talented director with a good amount of critical and financial success under his belt, the movie failed. 

I think a lot of people are overestimating the popularity of both Del Toro and Lovecraft. I'm a gigantic fan of both of them, but they're wayyy more niche than the typical redditor might realize. I mentioned the King Arthur situation because Guy Ritchie is similar. He's a super talented director with a following, but unknown to the general public (he's not Spielberg or Nolan, so they don't know him). *Plus* he had the added benefit of people actually *knowing* what King Arthur is, unlike Del Toro's Lovecraft film.&&In the Mouth of Madness wasn't written by Lovecraft, just heavily inspired by it.&&Is John Dies at the End Lovecraftian? I always thought it was, but not sure if it's based on actual source material.&&I know Annihilation is based on totally different book, but the film is basically an adaptation of The Color Out of Space.

Are you an animator?&&Faculty need to fuck off then&&Aw&&4 Oscars.&&I mean, I'm not sure it would have after Universal made them insert a Russel Crowe cameo to tie it in with the bigger ""Dark Universe""&&It's been adapted to film 3 times and also heavily influenced the book/movie ""Annihilation.""&&How was Annihilation Lovecraftian? Because it's humans approaching the unknown and other?&&I wouldn't say Hellblade was more of a movie than a game.  It was more about atmosphere and story than gameplay, but I don't think it would have been as effective without the player having control even when all you're doing is running around experiencing things.

Also, the whole idea of the puzzles representing psychotic delisions was complete genius and I don't think it could have worked in a movie).

That said, it still does work as an example of how it is possible to capture insanity in a visual medium.  It's quite possible that no Lovecraft movie can ever perfectly capture the experience of reading a Lovecrsft book, but that doesn't mean it can't convey the story, including the sense of unknown, incomprehensibility, and insanity.  And I also think if there's anyone who can pull it off, it's Del Toro.&&That's just the first half.  Once you reach Byrgenwerth, it goes 100% Lovecraft.  The final part of the Old Hunters DLC is the like the most Lovecraftian level in a video game ever.&&You could say the entire insight mechanic was lovecraftian&&>I think there's a dearth of understanding about what made him such an effective writer

There may be a disagreement, but I don't think there's necessarily any lack of understanding here. Then again, getting lovecraft fans to agree on things is often rare, esp if the drama surrounding the last NecronomiCon is anything to go by! 

I guess we just disagree strongly about the written word being superior to all other means of inspiring fear. For me, it's possible to create the same sense of fear and tension using light, framing, and sound. Lack of light, how a shot is framed, and the sound (not just the music, but the sound or lack thereof) can create a scene of tension and suspense without any words. Take a look at [Curve](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2017/06/19/curve/). This horror short has no dialog. There is no monster. It's all sound and visuals. The bleak sky, the bright red against the dark concrete, and the blackness of the gaping void all create horror and tension without a word or a monster. You're drawn in to the feeling of desperation and despair that the woman is feeling. It's an excellent example of exactly what it seems you think is missing from horror.

Also just a plug for shortoftheweek.com in general- there is some **solid** horror in there. &&For my money the original ""alien"" is the closest we'll get to a good ""at the mountains of madness"" movie. The story hits alot of the same beats as the book did.&&The story can't be presented in film as a 1 to 1 translation, the bulk of the narration from inside the city is essentially the characters interpreting the bas-reliefs.

I'd suggest merely looking at the script that's online. It's an adaptation in the sense that it's a roughly similar story but things are necessarily changed for the format.&&I've read most of Lovecraft over and over. They're combing ruins. They're excited and in awe, but nobody loses their shit until the final quarter of the story. I get that you don't think the same as I do, but obviously Guillermo Del Toro thinks it's doable. He's been after it for years.&&I'll tell him Sunday.&&As a counterpoint - Del Toro is fantastic at building an atmosphere as well&&IIRC I read that they kept making Transformer movies because while they performed poorly domestically, they made tons of money internationally.&&It was the highest grossing out of all the Best Picture nominees this year bar Dunkirk iirc&&i honestly thought Blade Runner was better.  kind of bullshit that it wasn't even nominated.  it was my personal best picture &&Which is a massive shame seeing how Blade Runner was actually really good.&&It‚Äôs certainly the inspiration for Alien and also The Thing&&A rather surprising amount of horror is directly inspired by Lovecraft's work. 

AvP definitely does take some rather precise points from Mountains though and doesn't get much credit for its setting. Though most people probably don't remember it or haven't seen it or hated it too much to think about it. &&Yup, Lovecraft is one of those authors who when you read, you realize how many things were influenced by him.

Like when I was a little kid and read the Hobbit.  I was all ""wizards, dwarves, dragons, elves, trolls.  Come on, that's so cliche!!!"" Not realizing that it *started* the cliche.&&Holy crap. That could be an *amazing* movie. &&Isn't that [Ghostbusters](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yJsAIqH2Qs8/maxresdefault.jpg)?&&When do the guys with three corner hats and sword-whips show up? &&Probably missed my edit but the romcom we need is The Thing on the Doorstep.&&Elder gods are from Nyarlathotep, men are from Mars &&So was that a direct reference to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaruko:_Crawling_with_Love), or did the same bizarre idea strike at least two people independently?

I think the latter would be more unnerving, considering this is Lovecraft we're talking about.

Edit: [Here's](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11785/Haiyore_Nyaruko-san) a synopsis which should better convey the cosmic horror of someone doing this to Lovecraft. Emphasis apparently on the *love* part.&&I always was under the impression she got it on with her father.&&I was thinking more along the lines of the romance angle but yeah you're right, Dunwich is definitely uncharacteristic in the triumph of the protagonists.&&I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by Annihilation as it's wonderful&&But what could you realistically expect from 2049? Blade Runner was a slow, box office bomb that gathered a cult following.And I think cult movie drawing power always gets overrated.&&Im glad Im not the only one that thinks BR2049 is one of the best movies of all time. &&After you watch 2049, it's clear that the trailers and teasers were complete dogshit.&&giving that high of a budget at the current state of cinema is a pretty risky move if it isn't a superhero movie&&> And it fucking tanked. 

It was a little disappointing at the box office, it was far from tanking.&&What‚Äôs the scene? I‚Äôm ok with spoilers &&People would go see an R-rated scifi/horror/thriller. 2007's The Mist made money, but that may have been because it had a paltry $18m budget and Stephen King's name associated with it. &&Didn't he direct Pan's Labyrinth as well? &&I don't care what anyone says, Crimson Peak is a superb film. It's an exacting rendition of Gothic Romance, it's beautifully shot, the acting is spot on.
I love that movie.
I understand Gothic Romance isn't for everyone, but there's nothing wrong with that film whatsoever.&&What did you like about Crimson Peak?&&Having seen it, it is really sad tbh. This is a creative and stunning film that should do way better. Plus people complain about saturation of superhero films and reboots etc. &&I'm not sure we can call Alex Garland 'well-established' as a director yet (as a writer, certainly).  His only prior directing credit was *Ex Machina*.  

I definitely hope he *becomes* a well-established director, though.  *Ex Machina* is probably my favorite film of the decade thus far, and I've been eagerly awaiting *Annihilation* since the first trailer dropped.&&Like a billion times more. People really overestimate Guillermo's appeal. &&And King is hugely more popular that Lovecraft.&&Ageless creature from the stars that spends most of its time sleeping and inspires madness in people. 

Yup, nothing Lovecraftian to see here, the main stream could never abide cosmic horror!&&Yeah, Deadpool and It proved that an R rated movie can do well, but they were also outliers and only had a fraction of the budget.  They also both had much more mainstream themes and tones.

At the Mountains of Madness would be a guaranteed cult hit, but studios don't give someone $150 million to make a cult hit.&&Only one GDT movie has made $100 million dollars domestic, and that film cost $190. 

I love GDT but there's no fucking way I would give him this sort of money. I'd give him a crack at another ambitious medium-budget film or a movie in the $70-100 million range with high commercial appeal, but not $150 for a movie with limited commercial appeal. 

The question was never whether or not GDT could make a good Mountains of Madness, the question was whether or not it would have made enough money. So far the worldwide BO for Shape of Water hasn't even hit the budget of Mountains!&&Funny since Pennywise is actually an ancient eldritch being. Not a clown&&I just watched Altered Carbon and saw a trailer for their Lost in Space. They certainly have the effects and the capital required to make it&&Oh shit. In that case - Re-Animator? I think? And that was pretty loose in its adaptation.&&JOHN DIES AT THE END is based on a novel by David Wong of the same name. It is very much cosmic horror with a lot of Lovecraft influences. &&[deleted]&&Fat bald Tom Cruise is best Tom Cruise&&I think it's definitely left open as a distinct possibility.&&is it not actually directly explained in the last moments of the movie? it's left ambiguous as to whether she was a fish person or she just died, there is no theory of her being a fish person it's literally the climax of the movie saying whether she is or isn't is up to how you interpret it.&&glad you contributed to the conversation.&&Reticent Ridge&&Whispering Knolls.&&That sounds like a pornstar name.&&MOS Mountain&&Or ""mons pubis"" &&Or a silent hill loot box survival crafting game..&&> Castlevania

This hurts, mate&&I thought the Castlevania anime was pretty good. It‚Äôs just a shame that‚Äôs the only thing Konami will probably ever do with the series. &&And Contra.  And Suikoden.&&""I see you like playing a lot of Konami games, don't you?"" &&I know. P.t. Was lighting in a bottle but I‚Äôm willing to bet it‚Äôd be the best horror game in damn near a decade &&> If Silent Hills miraculously happened after all of this it would never live up to the expectations that people set

I would say the same for Metal Gear. There's just too many expectations imo.&&Hey, gambling is illegal in Japan. You win worthless metal tokens that a guy next door *JUST SO HAPPENS* to be very interested in buying.&&> Doesn't Konami make many times more from their gambling games than their video games?

They do. I think that's why they've stopped giving a shit about making games other than PES.&&Not many more times. Their earnings are actually in the negative now.&&**WOOWOOWOOOP**&&W R O N G L E V E R ! &&**E R O T I C V I O L E N C E**&&he has OSCAR fuck you money now.. he will get to make whatever he wants. &&...Kickstarter?&&He could probably keep it for the rest of his career and basically be technically right.&&Yup that does it.

It makes his works so easy to come back and read again and again.  Plus I fall asleep to the Kindles text to audio every night so Lovecraft always inspires crazy dreams when its playing through your head while sleeping.&&Add in the well written horror on behalf of the horrific.&&It‚Äôs made even creepier by finding out that shoggoths mimic the voices and accents of their oppressors, and ‚Äútekeli-li!‚Äù is very likely to be the last, desperate cry for help by a murdered Elder Thing that the shoggoth is now mockingly shrieking.&&Tru dat&&Interesting. Thanks for sharing. I‚Äôll have to check it out.&&It is literally just The Color From Outer Space, one of Lovecraft's short stories.&&The kind of spiritual, other dimensional, magical feel of the whole thing. Lots of Lovecraft horror imagery sprinkled about like the dude cut open in the swimming pool and the secret lighthouse room at the end. The Alien series had similar design choices. &&How would you describe ""Lovecraftian"" to someone who had never heard the term, though?

I ask because (as I explained in another comment) the otherworldly creatures and mend-rending phenomena aren't supposed to be the focus of Lovecraft's writing. The way that those things are described ‚Äì the word choice, the meter, what's revealed, what's twisted, when each of those things are offered, and so on ‚Äì is what makes Lovecraft stand out from other horror writers. His work is more about the method (and the madness) than the details themselves.

Again, I haven't played the game in question, but based on what I've seen from it so far, it really seems like it was based on the culturally distorted perspective of Lovecraft's work, not a familiarity with the stories themselves.&&*Grant us eyes.*&&What happened at NecronomiCon?&&Blockbusters will become that little bit stranger, step by step, year by year, as they move away from what we're used to and target the Chinese market. The Transformer movies are a great example, the great wall flick with Damon even more so. &&And the highest-grossing BP winner since 12 Years a Slave.&&Get Out.

And it‚Äôs actually a bad sign when Best Picture hasn‚Äôt broken 100 million since Argo.&&Highly agreed. Blade Runner 2049 is already considered a sci-fi classic among many and one of the best sequels, period. I didn't find any major flaw with the film. It was beautiful, bleak, evocative, mesmerizing to look at, and at its core was a very human story. Honestly, BR2049 was one of the only movies I've ever been 'upset' about for losing money or not having as big an audience as possible. &&i agree, but this movie needs to also be At the Mountains of Madness and not be six hours long.&&Starring Matthew McConaghey and Kate Hudson though.&&They're all flesh-hungry beasts now...&&I have a general feeling like it‚Äôll be a superbly executed version of what it‚Äôs going for, I just don‚Äôt think the concept is something that typically does a lot for me. 

But I‚Äôm more than willing to take a chance and go in with an open mind. Plus, I‚Äôm a big big fan of Portman.&&Here you go:

[There's a scene where the main characters arrive at the camp of their expedition's advance party. The whole place has been torn to shreds, and most importantly, one man and one dog have been professionally dissected. It's important that this is shown because at first they take it as evidence that the one man missing from the corpses they find had gone man and killed the rest - the dissection must have been done by a man - and later on, is revealed to have actually been done by the Elder Things who built the ruined city most of the story takes place in. This is also important because it shows the Elder Things as scientists and researchers like the explorers themselves.](#spoiler)&&He's probably talking about the part where the protagonist [finds mutilated and dissected bodies in the camp they previously lost contact with](/sp).&&Not who you're responding to, but I'd assume they're referring to the expedition coming upon alien specimens frozen in the antarctic ice. The aliens unthaw and come back to life. They have never seen a human, but are scientificly minded. A good way to learn about how an unknown animal works is to dissect it. &&I mean. I‚Äôm *so fucking happy* Bladerunner 2049 got made, but... slower burns are harder sells amongst the mass audience. &&Annihilation is all of these things and it's failing hard as we speak, it's a fantastic film too go see it if you haven't&&I think Pan's Labyrinth was not made by an American company (it got Oscar for best foreign movie), so maybe the stats for it are incompatible?&&Yup. And blade 2 and mimic and devil's backbone, but I wanted to stick with his biggest moneymakers&&Not OP but I thought that the movie itself was beautifully done. I thought the performances were good and it was an interesting concept that just didn't work on a narrative level. *Crimson Peak* wasn't a great film by any stretch but it was a well made one that landed short of it's intended goal, I think. &&I wouldn't worry. It'll get there. It's got cult status written all over it and being on Netflix will defenitely help. &&I don't necessarily think people would be drawn in on either Lovecraft or Del Toro alone, but the dude just took an Oscar home for an original screenplay horror-romance about marginalised people fucking fish. It's not like he hasn't demonstrated that he can pull off movies without an obvious hook.&&lovecraft is also pretty far away from the mainstream.

i mean, how many average joes do you think has read anything by him, and would really ""get it"".

if the movie comes out, i foresee a 50/50 chance of it becoming a cult classic (ayyy), and doing just marginally okay at the box office.&&I really don't understand why. Pacific Rim didn't actually do that well! And this was in the middle of Transformers #19: The Fall of Dark Uncertainty Revenge making a billion dollars worldwide!&&Or Lovecraft, for that matter.&&And ability to deliver.

Some of his work I love, some is garbage. He's by no means consistent except when it comes to visuals.&&Dude just made a movie about a woman who fucks a fish man, he won best picture, movie is making money. What are you even talking about.&&And they still didn't have the balls to do the real Dark Tower&&Except the movie was basically ""monster clown tries to eat kids"" and didn't hint to anything of that shit at all in a noticeable way. Much easier to market and was riding on the fact that it was a King book and was made before.

Y'all are really hopeful and reaching.&&[deleted]&&> but studios don't give someone $150 million to make a cult hit.

blade runner 2049&&Does the general audience know this? No. In fact, they don't care about that. They care about 'ooohhh scary CLOWN from the miniseries in the NINETIES.'&&Time spent on screen as a clown: a shitload

Time spent on screen as an ancient Eldritch being: basically zero&&You can go more recent and loyal than that, the HPLHS has made a couple great adaptations for Call of Cthulhu and Whisperer in Darkness.&&Noiseless Knoll&&Dont you put that evil on me, Ricky Bobby!&&See that would have been only 90% off the mark instead of 98% off the mark.&&At least we have Bloodstained to look forward to in the near future.&&At least the show is pretty good&&Everyone I talked to that watched it liked the Castlevania anime. Most of them don't even like anime. Hoping those new episodes come out soon. &&Konami didn't really do much other than help with the backstory, it's not even Japanese made, it's I believe American, it was just created in the ""anime"" style and even got a Japanese dub.
&&What a lucky break for the industry.&&This is how it works in the first Pokemon game.    

You get worthless prizes at the casino (run by gangsters Team Rocket) and have to leave the building and go to the one next door to exchange them.&&It's a complicated situation. The basics are this: Konami is not and never was *just* a video game company, but the shift into Pachinko (and more specifically ""Pachi-slot"", which is mostly just a slot machine that's legal in Japan) was a recent development and kind of puzzling. Konami's video game business was never really the biggest chunk of the company, but it was still solid business, mostly.

The assumption is this had to do with the floated idea of legalizing gambling fullstop ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, which doesn't seem to be going anywhere at the moment and also, their machines aren't being picked up by the major chains for the most part. So there's been some backpedaling about their whole ""torch the company and run"" approach to exiting the console market, especially since Bomberman did well as a Switch launch title.


They also apparently smack-talked former employees when they applied for new jobs elsewhere and sold save slots in Metal Gear Survive, so, you know, real quality people.&&Actually not really anymore, some new legislation tanked their earnings, that's why they're crawling back to games now.&&For Konami? Can you show me? Maybe that might get them to make games again.&&I'm Jim Fucking Stirling Son!&&It would require way more money than kickstarter would be able to provide, and he would probably want the large scale distribution that only major studio would be able to provide.&&$150 million is a lot of money to make off kickstarter...&&There are some parallels but the film is VERY different from the book.&&It's the ""The Colour From Outer Space"" combined with Ursula Le Guins ""Vaster Than Empires and More Slow""

Definitely more similar to the latter in terms of the characters, ending, and overall message. They're two of my favourite short stories and probably why I loved the movie so much.&&Lovecraftian, to me, would be experiences in sanity and stories about mortality and exploring the concept of inevitable death. For the most part. Basically Grimm Fairy Tales that have been blown into cosmic proportions. 

A large part of his work does revolve around ""The Great Old Ones"" and how they like to screw with humans ex. Nyarlathotep or how they are here and a danger only due to their existence. Cthulhu, Dagon and Shub Niggurath are probably less popular because of his flamboyant writing style and more popular because of the sheer scope as well as how there is an overarching thread throughout his stories. Although I actually really like googling words while reading it so thats definitely a small part for me

As far as Bloodborne goes, I feel that the lore and stuff that goes on in it is very reminiscent of his works as far as I have read of each. The big issue is he uses lines like ""just reading the description of the horror would drive a man mad"" which clearly doesnt make for great visuals, as was stated above. So its impossible to recreate what Lovecraft envisioned but i dont think The Celestial Emissary or Amygdala were too far off from what he was imagining.

Edited to avoid the elder wrath.&&You have to admit that it is difficult to accurately judge the ‚Äúgame in question,‚Äù when you have not actually played it, as you said. &&Well you haven't played the game in question. And most footage of the game avoids the spoiler that it starts as a Victorian werewolf game and slowly descends into otherworldly madness.

Usually when I have an opinion about a piece of media that I feel really strongly about, and then I get to the end and type ""oh also I have never seen or interacted with this and I don't know about it"" I become self aware and stop.&&It's 100% pure Lovecraft.  Even the DLC storyline culminates at a fishing hamlet....&&The game is heavily inspired by Lovecraft's work and doesn't just go with the -insert cthulhu here- thing either. 

The entire premise is that the game occurs in a ""nightmare,"" that is, the nightmare of the otherworldly beings that were discovered beforehand called the great ones. They are so powerful that reality is shifted and dimensions are created through those dreams, inaccessible to the player at the start of the game because they are simply too ignorant to understand. &&A major theme of Bloodborne is the classic Lovecraftian theme of knowledge being a curse that breeds insanity and obsession rather than a blessing that grants understanding. It relays that theme through both gameplay and story. 

Story-wise, Bloodborne features several factions who seek knowledge through different means. Some take a scholarly approach by focusing on ‚Äòseeing the world as it is‚Äô to the point of obsessing over literal eyes and exploring the catacombs beneath the city where the game begins. Others take a metaphysical approach that centers on ‚Äòeyes on the inside,‚Äô trying to ascend beyond humanity through different rituals and the like. 

Both routes lead the groups and society writ large to psychological and social ruin, and the game takes great pains to show that the two approaches are not counterposed, but are in fact driven by the same doomed desire to make the unknowable known. 

Gameplay-wise, the player gains a currency called ‚ÄòInsight‚Äô for encountering or defeating the horrors borne of the groups‚Äô meddling. As the player gains more insight, new and horrible sights that were invisible become visible, and some enemies gain new attacks. The game becomes harder and more horrifying with high Insight. 

Furthermore, the game takes you to different ‚ÄòDreams‚Äô that are often only vaguely Euclidean, with some being warped and impossible versions of ‚Äúreal‚Äù areas. Again, the fuzzy barrier between consciousness and other psychological states is a very Lovecraftian motif. 

Does the game succeed in terms of making some horrors literally unknowable or beyond comprehension? No, of course not because games are partially a visual medium. But it does do a great job of getting the mood and themes right, and its regarded as a near-immaculate instant classic because of how well it executes those aspects. 

All of which is to say that in Del Toro‚Äôs capable hands, Lovecraft has a lot of potential. &&Seven?&&Yeah they‚Äôre already looking at 6 hours trying to translate page to screen.&&**Failure to fhtagn**&&According to a script review I read, Del Toro's version also adds some more gory action scenes (with the Elder Things and Shoggoth) that weren't in the original. He also changes the time frame to WWII for some reason.

As much as I adore Del Toro I don't love the sound of that script.&&Yeah you can't get rid of that. Completely defines the stakes. &&Just FYI, maybe it's just me, but the spoiler tag didn't work.&&...but if you make them dissected ‚Äúzombies‚Äù we could put it on cable TV!&&Nah they just thaw&&It'll be released on netflix soon instead of theatres where i live.


I'm actually slightly pissed off at not getting to see in on the big screen....&&Because it's had next to no marketing. Paramount practically abandoned it. 

However, I got the feeling while watching it that it was absolutely something people in five to ten years will commonly talk about as something you *have* to see the way they talk about Scott Pilgrim or Donnie Darko with dozens of collectibles, re-releases and special screenings. &&True, but Crimson Peak proves that he can also lose a lot of money on a movie with a decent genre hook. &&Oh shit, we done The Shadow Over Innsmouth already? &&Easy. 

Make a Call of Cthulhu movie first. People don't know ""Lovecraft"" or ""Mountains of Madness"", but they love that Cthulhu tie-in shit.&&A lot of people loved True Detective season 1 and that was totally the vibe they went with.  &&It's one of my top 10 favorite short stories ever and I work as a dishwasher. I'd say I'm a below average Joe.&&>I really don't understand why. Pacific Rim didn't actually do that well! And this was in the middle of Transformers #19: The Fall of Dark Uncertainty Revenge making a billion dollars worldwide!

Budget 190 m

Box office: 411 m

How is this not doing well? They doubled their money&&It did though? One of the major turning points of the movie is the kids realising that it's been haunting the town for decades and the rest doesn't show uptil they're adults in the book. I'm not sure what you're expecting.&&Yeah, assuming the $150 million I've heard is correct, people are either underestimating the budget he's asking for or overestimating the budget of Deadpool, It, and Logan.  Logan is the only on of those three even close, and it's still considerably less (wikipedia says $97-127 million), and it's an entry in an extremely popular franchise starring the franchise's most popular character.

The issue isn't that studios don't think anyone wants to watch the movie, it's they're not confident enough people want to watch it to make it worth the enormous budget.&&Mute moor&&My thesaurus broke.&&I'm unfamiliar with that&&Oh be careful before you get a dozen dweebs telling you how it's *not* an anime. &&*Kojima laughing in the distance while partying with Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen*&&Interesting, i've heard konami was still Fullbore , whereas smaller companies like snk cooled off on pachinko &&> Nub Shiggurath

Don't mean to be pedantic, but I think it's Shub-Niggurath&&Honestly, those seem like fairly small changes to sell a Hollywood adaptation. I'm far past expecting true-to-source films now that I've become comfortable with the idea that a story's entire structure often doesn't work across different mediums with far different production scales and the connected profit expectations vs. those massive expenditures. The vast majority of adaptations make alterations in that vein.

Far better to see films and shows as inspired works, as the cinema will inevitably be lacking in some way due to the constraints of a 2-hour experience designed for multi-million dollar profit appeal.&&As long as the gory action scenes are about the humans being completely overwhelmed by madness and despair by the eldritch stuff it could pass, nicely even. The time frame is pretty much a technological level fir this story at the most so as long as it does stay pre-1950s its still fine.

Del Toro rarely makes big bad choices on critical element imo and deserves some faith. The guy knows what he is doing and is a true artist.&&But there are gory action scenes with the Elder and the Shoggoth, most researchers don't come back alive because of it. As long as the humans don't overpower either I'm fine with it. For example, I'm not against someone emptying a clip at an Elder while running for their life only to find out bullets don't even tickle them, or exploding some cave or something with the creatures inside, this would serve to prove to the big screen the Lovecraftian point that humans are pathetic and can't really even stand at ankle level of those creatures.

About making it during WW2, ehh, what difference does it really make, it could be made in present day and the story would remain the same, the researchers are isolated from the big cities, so it doesn't make much difference when it's set.&&This could end up being made if JJ Abrams decides that the monsters came from a dimensional rift in space.&&You can find the script online. It's not very good. There's one character that feels like an actual person and something we've never seen before, a badass Canadian guy. The rest? It's like Prometheus meets The Thing as an early 20th century period piece. The script was generic as hell. I couldn't see a Tom Cruise character anywhere in it. Either he's the male lead, or the professor and I can't see him as either. I also don't see why it needed to cost 150 million. If he can do Hellboy for 60-80 million surely he could do the same for this. &&Oh thank goodness, I was worried they were gonna say there were boobs. Since when is a little violence grounds for an R rating?&&Thanks for the correction. Been a while since I read it, thought I remembered the elder things being dead when they thawed. Lovecraft was never really one to draw a line between dead and comatose I guess.&&I feel bad for you, this movie was definitely meant to be seen big and loud, elsewhere on here it seems like Paramount is even skimping on a 4K HDR home release...&&You really overestimate the amount of people who even know what Cthulhu is. &&do it.&&There's a perfect introductory Lovecraft story that would make a tense, awesome movie. But every time anyone has tried it's been garbage. 

The Shadow over Innsmouth. Creepy cultists, ""somethings not quite right in this town"" vibe, thrilling escape action... fish people (fish people are so hot right now).

&&When it comes to the people that love Cthulhu tie-in shit we'd probably get some lame, cutesy animated Cthulhu movie to sell more of those little green plushies&&Pacific Rim is one of those movies you can watch in another language with no subtitles and still enjoy

I mean cmon

Gundam vs Godzillas?&&You're not counting marketing costs, which could easily add another $90 million to the ticket and suddenly that $220 million in profit turns into $130. This may seem ridiculous, but the Hollywood reporter notes that in 2007 studios were spending $36 million on average marketing medium movies, comparable to The Fault in Our Stars or Tammy. $100 million worldwide for advertising a tent pole isn't a wild bet. 

Also, studios don't get the same cut from overseas tickets. $100 million of your BO came from China, where studios only get 25% of the ticket price, which shaves off another $75 million and suddenly it just made $55 million. If we assume the other $210 million in foreign ticket sales earned a generous 50% average cut then another $105 has to be shaved off and suddenly we've fallen from earning $220 million to losing $50. And this is still generous because it assumes that the studio got to keep 100% of the US BO when in reality theaters would take a 40% cut of the films lifetime BO. If you look at more realistic ticket earnings the film might have lost $100 million dollars!

Of course, this situation is complicated by the fact that Pacific Rim isn't an average movie. It's a multi-media franchise with plenty of opportunities for merchandising and cross-promotion. So the film itself can lose money in terms of ticket sales and still make money when you consider all the potential income streams. A film like Mountains Of Madness would not enjoy these advantages.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pacificrim.htm&&Marketing isn‚Äôt usually included in that budget figure &&Box Office Wise, generally you have to double your money just to break even (marketing costs and taxes/movie theatre take of ticket sales)

Blockbuster movies usually have to more than double their money to break even, and make much more than double to be considered 'worth it.'

Example: The Mummy Made 410m on a 125m movie, but Universal is basically cancelling the Monsters universe it was making because that wasn't enough money.

411m on a 190m budget is just barely not a flop, but it is the definition of 'massive disappointment' to studios. I would say 'doing well' for Pacific Rim would have been a minimum of 515m. The fact that it's getting a sequel is a miracle, thanks completely to china. &&> They doubled their money

Not even close.  There are many other costs associated with a movie beyond the budget for the film itself.  Advertising for a summer tentpole like Pacific Rim is a big one.  A good rule of thumb is that the movie usually needs to make 2x its budget to break even.

If they doubled their money, a sequel wouldn't have taken nearly as long as it did.  They weren't sure whether they wanted to go to that well again until after the DVD sales and rental numbers started coming in.&&The marketing budget isn‚Äôt published but tends to be about the same as the general one. So the real amount the studio spent is ~$380 million. &&Taciturn Tor&&Had no idea, ""Thesaurus,"" was a synonym for silent.&&Me words no work&&Castlevania successor launched by long-time series steward Koji Igarashi, aka IGA.

There‚Äôs a reason the credit usually states ‚ÄúBased on...‚Äù.&&I'd be cool with that. Just let Del Toro do his thing.&&Lovecraft doesn't do boobs. Or sex. That's one thing nearly every film adaptation has gotten wrong.&&Seriously, have you ever watched Bones or Criminal Minds or The Alienist or CSI. Gore, gore and more gore.&&Kids see worse shit on the news &&And here you guys are just throwing his name around all willy nilly :/ braver than me&&very true.  its amazing how ""overplayed"" cthulhu is while still being very niche and unknown by a wider audience.  It is seemingly everywhere, but only within a tiny subculture.&&I mean there was a whole South Park episode with him, he's in the opening credits of Rick and Morty, Fallout 3 and 4 both directly reference The Dunwhich Horror, GRRM has publicly cited Lovecraft as a major inspiration and has loaded Game of Thrones with major and minor Lovecraft elements and references (the Drowned God, anyone?) I think you underestimate how ubiquitous Lovecraft is in pop culture. Besides that, del Toro's aesthetic has always been a little bit Lovecraftian- little wonder that in both Hellboy and Shape there is a Deep One (fish man).

Edit: oh yea, and True Detective season 1 that everybody loved so much? Absolutely ***loaded*** with Lovecraftian themes and elements, *especially* the Yellow King and Carcossa. I mean the whole thing about an esoteric sex cult with horrifying rites that take place far from civilization in the heart of a savage wilderness (the sex tape that Rusty shows Woody Harrleson) is taken directly from The Call of Cthulhu and the ""tale of inspector LeGrasse"" part of the story where a Louisiana detective tracks his case into the depths of the bayou. Season 2, that people didn't like so much? No Lovecraftian elements. 


Second edit: oh yea again, how about ever played this insignificant total flop of an unheard of indie game called Skyrim? Basically all the daedra in the game are Lovecraftian, especially Mehrunes ***Dagon***.  But yea I mean Skyrim was a mainstream failure, completely without commercial success or profitability. Completely. 


Third edit: another oh yea, Event Horizon was a Lovecraftian story, and so is the Cloverfield franchise. It's like those old ""how many Indians can you find"" pictures, the longer you look the more Lovecraft you find all the fuck over the place in main stream entertainment. 


Fourth edit: oh yea one more time, the Alien franchise that nobody ever heard of and didn't spawn a franchise of blockbusters, comic books, toys, video games, and memorabilia spanning three decades

Fifth edit: oh yea revival tour, there's also the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, made famous primarily by the Evil Dead franchise (which is distinctly Lovecraftian) but was created for the Cthulhu mythos by Lovecraft. (Not written by Lovecraft tho- it was written by the Mad Arab Abdul Alhazred)

So please do forgive me if I think it's bullshit that Lovecraft is A) unknown, or B) commercially unviable. &&I had to explain to someone struggling to pronounce ""Cthulhu"" the other day that it isn't supposed to be pronounceable.  
  
Also, that Lovecraft isn't a sci-fi writer (even if there are sci-fi elements).&&You mean that octopus monster that BP released after drilling on the moon?

You can bandy about Cthulhu's name all you want. He don't care none.&&That's all true, but they're talking about *public awareness* about the widespread influence of Lovecraft. Yeah, mainstream culture may enjoy True Detective because of its Lovecraft elements, but that doesn't mean they are *aware* of where those elements come from. 

It's not as if True Detective starts with an opening title card that says, ""This episode is inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft""&&and? just because shows reference it doesn‚Äôt make it popular. 

i can promise you 90% of the true detective audience didn‚Äôt pick up on, research, or even realize the lovecraft connections. shit, people by and large were wowed by Rust‚Äôs philosophy, when it‚Äôs pretty boilerplate existentialism/nihilism.

speaking generally, no one knows who lovecraft is and, really, no one gives a shit. &&How many of the people who played Skyrim or watched game of thrones do you think know about or care about it‚Äôs lovecraftian influence ?

Stop a random person on the street. Ask them to name one story of Lovecraft‚Äôs. 2/10 may be able to namedrop Call of Cthulhu. And those two will struggle to name five more.

Denis Villeneuve Is Planning At Least Two ‚ÄòDune‚Äô Films,32737,8385pv,http://www.indiewire.com/2018/03/denis-villeneuve-planning-two-dune-films-1201937538/,2280,1520614514.0,,"He needs to shoot them back-to-back like what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings. That way, the second movie will still come out if the first one flops.&&I really want to see if they can even adapt the whole Bene Gesserit analysis thing that goes on in the books. Like when a character points out several things like body language, the sound of voice, the use of specific words, etc. And also when a mentat processes information and what the prescient visions look like. I mean it‚Äôs very possible to do it but I just can‚Äôt think of a way to do it that isn‚Äôt awkward or cheesy. 



And can I just get a confirmation as to what the shields are suppose to look like? It‚Äôs just a slight blur or haze right? And 100% not what Lynch showed in his film.&&After seeing Blade Runner 2049, I'm hopeful that if anyone can adapt Dune, it's Denis Villaneuve.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Now that's a director whose pacing is more than adequate for the material.

His recent films (Arrival and Blade Runner 2049) were very rich in athmosphere, taking their time to establish the setting. I think this is a very important aspect when trying to adapt dune.&&I have heard it's totally easy to make a film adaption of dune.

This may take a few years....&&I was hoping Dune would be a TV show like Game of Thrones so that it can delve deeper into interesting aspects like CHOAM, Spacing Guild, the Imperium, etc....&&Helen Mirren should be cast immediately as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam&&So here's the thing with Dune movies. I loved the book (the first one, the others didn't grab me the same way), it was bold, imaginative, and disturbing, and no movie so far has been able to match the source materials. But I love all the Dune movies too. Even the ones I don't like. They represent a challenge that I think all film makers should embrace. Each team had to look at this towering achievement of literature, replete with all it's mystery and subtlety and then ignore everyone and everything that is telling them, ""This film is unmakeable."" They attack the project with the same naivete and enthusiasm as the climbers that first tried to climb Everest. And, ultimately, they all fail in one way or another. But the movies should stand as a testament to the ambition and fearlessness of these artists. I would watch the student project of an 8th grader with a handycam if they did a Dune.

Edit:Typing am hard. &&Just get someone who knows how to cast for it. Please don‚Äôt put Jared Leto in either of them&&Well, let's see if the first one actually makes money.&&This is going to be expensive.  Getting genetically enhanced earthworms, and feeding them til they reach 300m is going to be time consuming and extremely resource intensive.  I do however trust Villeneuve to get this important detail, as the casting of Shai-Hulud will be integral to this film's success both internationally and domestically.&&They'd better have cat milking, or I'm just not interested.&&Omg&&I'm not sure who is financing Villenueve, but I sincerely hope that the money keeps flowing *despite the fact that these films will almost certainly lose money*.&&I'm excited for a new Dune movie or 2, but the David Lynch version will always hold a special place in my heart. Such an original sci-fi blockbuster. So weird!&&I have a feeling that audiences won't respond well to space muslims. I can't wait for all the whitewashing nonsense.&&To me everytime I hear about a Dune film in production it always felt like the scifi version of that restaurant location in your home town that always seemed to be turning over every few years. You want to see it succeed but you know it won't. &&I'm looking forward to this. We need a more mature, well written sci-fi space Opera to fill that void. Star Wars now a days is catered towards a new generation that prefers ideology and simplicity instead of a smart story. Fingers crossed.&&He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing.
-Mua'Dib&&The final boss of film making is _God Emperor of Dune_&&Oh, I just started reading Dune. Great!&&What a shitty title. He said he is going to make the first book into two parts. He hasn't said anything about making the other books or making more than 2.&&Anything this guy makes has my full support. 
VILLENEUVE SENPAIIIII&&TBH, Id be totally down for a the books *after* dune to be adapted into a series not unlike what HBO has done with Game of Thrones.

Its just too hard to get excited over another take on the first book.&&Yes please yes. I hope a videogame releases along with them too. &&My two favorite movies while growing up: Blade Runner and Dune.

My two favorite movies as an adult are going to be: Blade Runner 2049 and Dune.&&Too bad Trump is busy. I would have liked to see him cast as the Baron. &&I re-watched the 1984 Dune  the other night. Aesthetically I love that film and I'd be excited to see Villeneuve's take on it.  

But wow, I'd forgotten how strange some of the directorial choices were in that film. So much internal monologue, even in parts where it could be done in dialog.  But what makes it more jarring is that only the ""good guys"" speak in internal monologue, and not just the film's protagonists. Even fairly tertiary characters do it.  All the film's principal villains talk to one another if a plot point needs explanation.  And if I hadn't read the novel years ago, I'm not entirely sure I'd have understood what was going on, even *with* the characters talking to themselves all the time.  Why do the Fremen yell when shooting their guns? Not sure it gets explained. What is the Water of Life? Not sure it gets explained. These things just do things so the plot moves forward.   It's also funny to watch a bunch of fairly good actors give completely bonkers or flat performances. This is a film with over half a dozen Academy Award nominees (including winners) in it, and they're literally standing stone-faced a lot of the time while their dialog is voice-over dubbed as internal monologue.  All the while being directed by an Academy Award nominee (three times).  It's *almost* Star-Wars-Prequels levels of wasted talent, saved only by the fact that at least I'd be willing to watch Dune again just for being bizarrely captivating.&&as good as a film they will be ..i still think it's a mistake not making a HBO series with more potential to expand upon the universe.&&Lynch planned to direct two films, as well...&&I'm still quite furious at everyone who didn't see Blade Runner 2049. &&Can we get Kyle Maclachlan in this somehow? Not for fan service, but just because it's always nice to see him in anything. &&Can he tap into Jodorowsky's Dune design?&&When one was too many&&Good. Cramming it into one film is a mistake. &&I have the weirdest boner right now. As a dune fan I've been waiting for this to happen since forever. The lynch knock off holds a special place in my heart, and the scifi series that used desert scenes painted on tarps gets a participation trophy, but this will be the first real Dune movie. &&and just like LOTR, it saves them a TON of money to do them at the same time. It probably saved the studio 150-200 million doing those movies all at once.&&I mean honestly, I think he needs to shoot them back-to-back like what Robert Zemeckis did with Back to the Future Parts II and III.&&And not have weird narration like the 80's versions. They had interesting and great parts to them, the scenery and how they did it for the resources available was awesome. 

Just don't have every character's ""inside my head"" voice jabbering on annoyingly like book on tape.&&There is a time skip in the middle of the book, so filming back to back won't be as necessary in the same sense as Lord of the Rings was.

This is not to say I don't see your point about the first movie potentially flopping, but here's to hoping it doesn't, we need more Dune!&&In the book you can't even see them for the most part. Just a slight hum of noise if you are close enough to the generator. You have to be really perceptive to notice the subtle distortion shimmer.&&Well Lynch did try to show the mental processes of all the various orders. I dug it because it stayed in line with the book but I guess we'll see with Villeneuve. I've enjoyed all of his movies thus far so I feel we're in good hands. &&I'm imagining a variation of how they did it in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, maybe?&&[There is only one way](https://i.imgur.com/gGqjFpw.jpg)&&I thing it can be done. You make a shot on the eyes of the character, eyes locking, examining, shows what is being examined, what do they see and get what it means.&&The shields in Lynch's Dune worked because they are unmistakable. A subtle haze or blur is not very visual, especially considering the lack of focus of your average non-Dune reading moviegoer. Look at the hunter-seeker. In the book, it is much smaller than the one in the film. It needed to be bigger in the film or else it would be more difficult to see. Tons of these little changes will need to be made to make Dune a visual film, keeping as close to the book as possible. If you want an exact duplicate of your own imagination, you will be disappointed, I think. &&The Bene Gesserit breeding program was always fascinating to me.  Thankfully it shouldn't be as difficult to explain as the history/functionality of the items you mentioned.  

Curious to see the worm too, if only because I thought Lynch revealed it beautifully.  &&bite ur tongue lynch's shields were dope af&&So, having just gotten Dune, I've noticed there's A LOT of books. I saw another three or four by Frank Herbert, and quite a lot more from other authors. 

Which books are essential? (absolutely loving Dune so far)&&Altered Carbon did this well in like the first two episodes, then stopped holding the viewers hand (which was great).&&Sherlock Holmes did it pretty well&&I lives Lynch's shields.  Honestly one of the coolest parts of the movie.  Especially near the end&&I really won't mind if the skip that in the movie and just mention that it's something that happens, as long as they cover other things, like the fact that Paul knows hat he's pretty much taking advantage of the fremen's belief in the coming mahdi, that he knows he's not their messiah, and that he realizes he isn't even the kwisatz haderach but ""something else"". One of the best things about Dune, for me, is that it deconstructs, or outright destroys the savior or chosen one narrative, but that seems to get ignored a lot.&&The best thing to do is don't.

Don't point out anything a character is doing. Just have good actors and good direction. 

Whispering inner thoughts of dune 84 was terrible TERRIBLE film making, and Lynch should be ashamed.
&&""Early Dune reviews: Extensive establishing shots of the desert, while slow, were beautiful. Gut-shattering synths seemed rather out-of-place.""&&Its Villeneuve FYI.

It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs trying to right all the wrongs Hollywood has bestowed on dark sci-fi fans from the 80s. Godspeed you Denis Villeneuve, Godspeed. &&I'm very hopeful too. I'm just worried its going to bomb. Even a director as brilliant and visionary as Villeneuve can only shrug off a certain number of expensive bombs before he becomes known as a box office underperformer. &&$200 million art film. &&I'm sure this has been said, but you should check out Sicario. He directed that, too and it's one of my all time favorite movies&&Serious question. So I'm a massive fan of the original Blade Runner movie. So much in fact I pretty much always have the soundtrack playing on my computer. I can almost quote the entire movie. 

Having said that, I still have not seen the new movie. Without spoiling it too much, is there any reason /r/movies seems to love it while the rest of the populace craps on it?&&Took the comment right out of my mouth.  I'd sit 3 hours to watch that movie.&&Two films would be better. There‚Äôs a lot that happens in the first book, and I can think of one or two smart places to split it. There‚Äôs also a lot of world building that could be done in the film(s) that could easily justify two 200-minute films. &&There's a time jump that would make for a natural break between films too.&&Two films would be great. There is a clear dividing line in the middle of the book. &&Would probably make more sense to get the budget of Game of Thrones as a series tbh. Theres a lot of material here and the story spans generations&&honestly the fan edit of the Lynch Dune movie is really good IMO&&Super unpopular opinion, but I'm about 60% of the way through the first book and I'm honestly kind of bored. Less enthused about a possible Dune movie now. &&He's been on fire with his last four films, Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival and BR2049. Absolutely my favorite working director. Still haven't seen Incendies yet though...&&Most def.  
He's my favorite director working at the moment.&&He the chosen one! The one who can finally bring Dune to the screen!&&Indeed it will. If I remember correctly, he said in another interview that it might easily take five to seven years until they can even start shooting.&&Sci-fi did a miniseries that did a really great job. The music especially. The special effects didn't age well but it's ok. They did the first three books in two, three-part shows. 2h each I think.

It's what got me into the books.&&I once envisioned it as an anime series or some other type of animation. 

Using Leto II as the narrator who can use bloodlines to relate past events (to include the prequel Trilogy) and the prescience to cover the books that came later. 

I can understand that some people aren‚Äôt in to animated series, just fun to think about how certain elements could be presented.  &&> Helen

What about the actress who played Shakana in Marco Polo?  Definitely wont me over as far as a dark priestess kind of archetype https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marco-polo/images/d/db/Shabkana.png/revision/latest?cb=20160928042028
&&Diana Rigg gets my vote, and she might draw in some of the GOT crowd.&&can we get benicio del toro as duke leto? please?&&I bet you'd love to watch [Jodorowsky's Dune](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/) if you haven't seen it already. &&It's worth sticking with the Dune book series until Heretics/Chapterhouse, those two are on par with the original for me&&Villeneuve is going to get it right. I believe.&&> Leto must be it it.

&&Honestly wouldn't mind Leto in the Dune universe. I don't care for him much or his antics but I think he has his place. When he has the room to be eccentric, but with someone to reign him in, he does pretty well. I liked him quite a bit in BR2049&&Hopefully, he gets to shoot them back to back like LoTR so the 2nd is realesed even if the first bombs.&&Yeah this is what really makes me nervous. The novel is huge and complex and two movies would really give it more room to breathe. But after Blade Runner 2049's lack of box office success (and to a lesser extent, Annihilation), I'm terrified of the first movie flopping and the second getting canned. &&As much as I want to see Dune, I have a feeling it will bomb.... Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong&&Sad but true. If Blade Runner couldn‚Äôt get people to come out to the theaters I don‚Äôt have much faith in a high budget Dune movie :(&&I have nipples, Greg. Can you milk me?&&That's not in the book but a fucking fantastic addition from Lynch. &&Oh my god emperor.&&The ~~spice~~ money must flow.&&It would be hard to finance if the money people only view it as business venture. But sponsors with another mindset do exist. John Lennon financed Holy Mountain because he wanted to see what would Jodorowsky do next. George Harrison financed Life of Brian because he wanted to see what would Python do next. Maybe Paul or Ringo could take this one for the team.&&It is weird.  The special effects and set designs go from pretty good to really bad, as does the dialogue.  But there's something about it that makes it entertaining...probably the camp factor.  One thing that I remember that is laughable is the Duke and family carry around a pet pug...I guess to show royalty?  Seeing Sting, though, is just so strange and fun.&&I really don't get the hate from this movie. The casting is fucking phenomenal. In Lynch's Dune, The Baron alone is maybe one of the best characters in all of movie history. I love the look he gave the Dune universe. &&Have you seen the[ extended TV cut](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dune-Extended-Three-Hour-DVD/dp/B000BJETCU) of the film? It adds a load of backstory but does cut some small scenes like the Barn spitting in Jessica's eye.

[An article comparing both versions.](https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=1380)&&I envy you.&&[deleted]&&The title doesn't imply he was making any of the other books into movies.&&I assumed from the title it meant splitting the first book into two, but I can see how that wouldn't be clear.&&
>What a shitty title. He said he is going to make the first book into two parts. He hasn't said anything about making the other books or making more than 2.

What a shitty job reading the article:

> ‚Äú‚ÄôDune‚Äô will probably take two years to make,‚Äù Villeneuve said. ‚ÄúThe goal is to make **two films, maybe more.**‚Äù

&&If he gets real high.&&Sure, if you somehow get Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger and Pink Floyd back on the project.&&Yeah but it's a *huge* financial risk if the movies are no good, or if they are good but audiences just don't care. &&Not only in production but not having to negotiate with actors or having people drop off between movies. Not having to have all the actors renegotiate their salaries or become ""audience favorites"" who add bullets to their contracts.

Significantly simplified just from a talent perspective.&&He needs to shoot it back to front like Christopher Nolan did with Memento&&Back to the Future 2 and 3 were shot even faster than back to back. They were shooting 2 and started pre-production on 3. Captain disillusion did videos on it, really interesting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtPA6nIBs5g&&Or like the Russo brothers did with Infinity War and Avengers 4&&Back to back like Danny and Mel in lethal weapon&&Not that I disagree with you, but I'm going to point out that is the style in which Herbert wrote the book. Lots of inner dialogue in them. It didn't adapt well though to your point. &&I can see why Lynch had to do the voice-over though. Easiest way to bring audience up to speed on more detailed history/concepts in the limited timeframe.   

I'm excited and trust this director, even though an HBO type series might be a better fit narratively.  &&There‚Äôs a ton of inner dialogue in the books as well as secret communications between two characters, hand signals and secret languages, that necessitate ‚Äúin my head‚Äù dialogue. 

It would be weird to not let people in on the thought processes behind some of the actions. It‚Äôs basically how the books are structured. &&you've never read the book have you? That's one of the unique aspects of the book, the internal monologue of each character in the story. The problem withLynch's Dune...well there were a lot of problems...but many are because of the forced editing to cut it from like 6hrs to 2hrs. That's why there is all of that naration in the beginning and middle that just give you these huge information dumps. But the inner monologues are part of what make Dune Dune.&&The scifi miniseries did a pretty rad job finding the middle ground.&&Without the narration it can be tough because Dune is full of a bunch of weird shit. It's difficult to get across the fact that this is a spacefaring feudalistic low-tech high-tech society where people need to get high to pilot spacecraft and shit&&>Where are my feelings?!&&I don‚Äôt think the timing of the story of LotR had much to do with the decision to film them all at the same time. They were able to do it *because* there wasn‚Äôt a difference in character‚Äôs ages, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was more that they *knew* they were going to want to film all three movies more or less as written, so might as well do them all at once.&&Couldn't you smell them too, like ozone or something?&&*Flips through book...*

You're right, I don't seen nothin'.&&The voiceover was a compromise between the studio and Lynch. The movie was much longer and as far as I remember reading it went deeper into the BG analysis but they had to edit it for length.&&The mini series goes into it a bit as well. You can debate whether they did so successfully but having more time meant more of a chance to do this. &&While that would work, I don't think that's Denis Villeneuve's style.  From what I've seen, he likes slow paced shots and very careful edits, not the quick cuts that Guy Ritchie likes.&&Exact same thought I had. Either Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes or similar to the BBC Sherlock series with words on screen showing what they're thinking. &&This, or BBC's Sherlock would work as well (maybe even more since, as u/Zarkovagis9 pointed out, Villeneuve prefers slow paced shots)&&See: Sherlock&&What if what they are noticing is the fact that someone is pronouncing a word slightly differently than they usually do? Because that happens kind of a bunch. &&I completely understand that, like every other adaption, it obviously has to be adapted. But, if the visual effects are anything like BR 2049 then I‚Äôm sure they can create something in between that is visually obvious but subtle enough to make it blend in. Kind of a contradiction there but you know what I mean (hopefully).&&I thought the shields in the Lynch film were terrible. They looked awful, even for the time.&&Fucking Synths. &&Honestly? Could probably fit. Just throw some bedouin woodwinds in there and you're golden.&&yeah 2049 was a cold, joyless, nihilistic death meditation&&I was severely disappointed in the soundtrack for 2049, especially after the amazing work Vangelis put into the first one. &&GY!BE would make a pretty decent soundtrack, I should imagine.&&Agreed; we need to be remaking more bad movies instead of ruining good ones.

Edit: I hope it doesn't bomb also, actually&&did 2049 bomb?&&Arrival did well though, it did $200m worldwide against a production budget of $47m. Sicario was also a financial success. I think BR2049 was really Villeneuve's first true box office bomb.

I'm more concerned about Alex Garland; Ex Machina turned a profit but Annihilation and Dredd (which we now know he unofficially directed) were both huge stinkers in the box office, despite being brilliant movies.

It's a huge shame that today's mainstream audiences aren't intelligent enough or have long enough of an attention span to be able to enjoy the brilliant sci-fi films we've gotten in the past few years.

&&I disagree. I'd go see Dune, but didn't really care for Blade Runner. I think there are way more Dune fans than Blade Runner fans. Dune2 was an innovator in gaming in the early 90s.

Thanks for sharing!&&Or like James Cameron is doing with Avatars 2-5&&Really?&&Could easily be done well, though.  Just look at Game of Thrones, the books are entirely written from inside various characters' heads yet we get no narration at all in the show and it did an amazing job adapting the books (in the first 4 seasons).&&If something does not lend it self to adaptation, change it while trying to keep the essence. Philip K. Dick's style would be a nightmare to adapt without basically re-writing the whole thing, but movies loosely based on his books are fantastic.

I agree that Dune is nearly impossible to adapt without the narrator because it's heavily focused on mental processes very hard to visualize, the script is going to need a lot of thought to express the core concepts in a visual way. Let's hope this is a ""creativity born from limitation"" case.&&Hmmm, *slight* over acting could fix this.&&Most books have inner dialogue.  It doesn't translate well into movies very often because A, it's used too much, and B, it's used too much.

The story is told from Deckard's point of view, and it's his story of self-doubt and self-acceptance.

IIRC they sold the international rights minus China to Netflix for the production cost. So the domestic and Chinese box office don't have to kill for it to make a profit.&&To be fair, Annihilation is a really weird movie. I liked it, but I can‚Äôt blame mainstream audiences at all for not seeing it.&&oh definitely&&Everybody else already said yes, so I'll just throw this out there:

The first few chapters can be hard to get into. You're basically thrown into the deep end of the universe, and all the strange language, settings, and lore that comes with it. But **don't give up.** It will all come together, and it's worth the wait.&&Absolutely. I‚Äôve read the entire series multiple times. The first three are the best, admittedly. And four through six don‚Äôt make a lot of sense initially. But if you go back and re-read the entire series, it‚Äôs actually very brilliant and obviously planned from the beginning. What sucks is that Herbert died before Dune 7 could be published, so his son and another writer ‚Äòfinished‚Äô the series based on notes and outlines. And, those last two books are very meh. Like polished fan fiction. But that said, they‚Äôre still worth reading. I really do love the entire series though. &&If anything, more relevant than ever.

Themes include environmentalism, resource wars and religion.&&The first Dune book is a stone cold classic. They get more convoluted and weird as the story goes along in subsequent books, but they are definitely worth a read. I read it again (Dune) last summer and was blown away how great it is as it had been several years since I had read it.&&so you are getting a ton of ""definitely"" response... and, well, they aren't even remotely wrong.  The book if phenomenal.

BUT, it is a heavy, heavy read.  You probably aren't going to sit down a read it in a sitting.  And you'll almost surely use the appendix to understand the words and terms used throughout the book (well I did anyways).  There is quite a bit of terminology one needs to sort out at times. So just take that as a heads up.

But otherwise, there is a reason its such a well known classic.&&Good God, yes.

I took a class on Religion and Ethics in college and Dune was our only textbook. It holds up.&&All the books are good but the first book is in my mind the greatest adventure story ever written. It does not fail to entertain or inspire wonder. It does hold up and I think it will continue to hold up for a long time. &&The first one is absolutely fantastic and holds 100% and is really relevant in today's world. Highly highly recommended. the sequels, while also good, are less essential reading. Herbert's son also wrote a few sequels- those you could avoid, but they're not the worst way to pass your time.&&There's a reason it's considered the greatest story of science fiction of all time for a reason. Definitely worth a read even if you just read the first book. The first book stands alone well if you don't want to bother with the others.&&I have never been so awestruck by adventure and such a fantastic depiction of a world that seems *so incredibly real.*

I'm 21 and put off reading this for about 6 years too many. Read it. Somewhere between 50-100 pages in, it suddenly becomes page 300 and you'll realize how easily you got lost in the book.&&Some friends and I finished them together in January, they totally hold up. They aren't Star Wars type scifi or The Expanse or anything, there's clear analogues and comparables to issues we still have today, which is a hallmark of scifi that I enjoy. The books also do a great job of bucking tropes that you expect as you finish chapters without being bait and switches like GRRM sometimes pulls in Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire.&&I'm half way through the first one now and it is dooooope.&&Yes. &&They are some of the best and most influential science fiction books of all time. Everyone should read them.&&Just started re-reading the series about two weeks ago. Will always be one of the greats. &&Dune is the best selling sci-fi book of all time for a reason. &&My dad tried to get me to read them for years and I always refused. Then, last year, I decided to finally read the first one, just to get him off my case. Oh hey, this is actually really fucking amazing. So I read the next book, and the next book, and before I knew it I read ever book the Frank Hubert wrote about Dune. I was craving more, but I didn't want to read the works that his son carried on, because I heard they weren't great. But Franks books? Fantastic. &&Probably the best written sci-fi of all time.&&Yes!!!&&Dune is one of those books that's worth reading even if you're not into the genre.&&I just read it for the first time about 6 months ago. I'm a Senior in high school and it was required by my sci-fi class to read it, at first I was worried and thought it would be like all the other books I've had to read. But by the end I was running to old book stores trying to find the sequels. Easily my favorite book of all time&&I'm only 200 pages into the first book and i can't believe how good the book is. Very sad i didn't read this when i was younger. Definately pick it up!

Edit: maybe don't read all the replies, there are a couple of unmarked spoilers inthere :/&&The books are great.

The only criticism that I have is that the book is pretty heavy. It can be difficult to read unless you are already immersed in the universe from the get-go. The characters are all introduced using titles and job descriptions, but there isn't a character or narrator who tells you things like ""The Bene Gesserit are a group of woman who have gained supernatural powers through training. They are attempting to guide the galaxy to a better world, but often resort to subterfuge to accomplish their goals."" This makes it super easy to get lost in the character interactions. 

I read the first 40 pages and got confused so I put the book down. I went back to it a few months later, and things were much better because I had a basic understanding of the universe. &&I haven't read the entire series, should probably do that some day, but even just the first book is worth it by itself. It truly is fantastic especially if you enjoy sci fi or world building.&&My all time favorite. I drove around with a copy of Dune today just because in case I got stranded somewhere I wanted it with me&&Scrolling down to see if anyone tells you not to read Dune. Expectations: low. &&Best science fiction ever written in my opinion, at least the first four books.&&They do, though it does get increasingly... weird... towards the end.

The books are so dense in terms of political psychology that even rereading several times you'll still notice new aspects and connections.&&It‚Äôs my favorite series of all time. The beginning of the first is tough to get through. They kind of drop you into a world that‚Äôs already been built, so for the first few chapters you have no idea what‚Äôs going on. But after that, it all ‚Äúclicks‚Äù and it‚Äôs amazing
&&I had read (and loved) plenty of sci-fi before I finally got around to Dune in my late twenties. It‚Äôs the greatest of them all. &&It's my all time favorite sci fi story and  a beautiful read. :) &&If nothing else read the first novel, Dune. It‚Äôs entirely worthwhile even as a standalone story.&&Ubdoutebly, easily my favorite sci-fi series. &&Yes.

my favorite books are the last two, heretics and chapterhouse.  well beaides the first insuppose&&Fuck yes.  Dune is a classic - not just scifi classic, just a classic.&&If you haven't already known by now, YES go pick up Dune.  You won't put it down until the very end, you'll be sucked in and won't want to do anything until the conclusion.  Make sure you leave it for the weekend.&&Not only do they hold up, you could say they got even better with age and you can easily see parallels between the future world of Dune, and our own if you overlook the more mystical stuff.&&Oh yeah, haha...that's nearly three and a half hours.

> Should I watch this mini series first or read the book?

Read the book, there is a slow burn (in the first half I think), the pay off is fucking amazing
&&I would recommend the series to most people instead.  The book is good, but part one was better than two and three, which seemed a bit aimless and the end was clearly not fully fleshed out.  
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NZiTVPXmNM&list=PLRXGGVBzHLUdsgN_vFaZmfjc6bXxPqajV) is a great playlist of a guy explaining the concepts in the Dune saga.  The ideas behind the story are more interesting than the story itself.&&Omg. Best phonetic read ever. 

Kwizatch haderach. Lol. 

Read the damn book. The mini series is great. But like 2% as great as the book. &&I see that role more for esteemed character actress Margo Martindale&&Only if we get Jeff Goldblum as Liet-Kynes&&Are we really going to do this again?&&> Dune the novel is basically unfilmable

maybe... but that was also the argument about LotR.  

And what we got are arguably three of the all time best films.&&I believed that 20 years ago, but I think things have changed. A Song of Ice and Fire was supposed to be unfilmable, but it works. I think Dune in 2 films would be doable - there will be necessary departures, but the overture of internal dialogue is something HBO's Game of Thrones overcame (those books are all descriptors and internal dialogues).

If they can turn Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones into epics (on either screen) I think they can make this work.&&You think? I disagree. It‚Äôs pretty action packed. I think the parts they may have to water down is all the pedo stuff and polyamory. &&>Dune the novel is basically unfilmable.

They said the same about the LOTR movies before peter Jackson did it. &&The 2000 SyFy series was pretty decent.&&Of all the books in the Dune world, Dune is the most filmable of them all. If Dune doesn't make it, we can be assured we'll never see a God Emperor, Heretics, or Chapterhouse in our lifetimes.

And honestly I think those 3 are the best books of the whole franchise. &&It's not *that* complex. It's totally filmable.&&>I am so, so afraid

We must not fear.&&> The original didn't do well, and despite it being a pretty remarkable movie, especially for the time, it is a very slow burn. My family, who generally likes science fiction stuff, was all asleep halfway through it.

First time I saw the original I fell asleep too, though I was like 14. I still don't find it all that engaging, aside from the world building and the amazing shots of their miniature model of LA. But BR2049 is nothing like that. It's long and complicated, but it's extremely engaging. Sure it's not a Marvel movie but I don't think it's necessarily an art house abstraction either.&&Oh muad'Dib&&I thought all the casting was fucking spot on. &&[deleted]&&The first part would end with him going into the desert, perhaps with his spice-trip sequence. &&Aka the BR2049 syndrome. &&Ummm, not likely.

Or Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2

Or Fifty Shades of Shit 2 and 3&&I still can't believe there's gonna be 5 of those movies&&I think those are being shot as 2+3 and then 4+5. C-c-c-combobreaker. &&I think a key difference between GoT and Dune is the inner dialogue plays a huge role in defining the power of certain characters. It shows the inner process of near omniscient beings and their attention to detail. Characters noticing and using weaknesses present in the smallest of physical responses is a big theme of the series. Not to disagree with you but I believe the inner dialogue in Dune is more important to defining characters and their potential than it is in ASOIAF/GoT&&I can't say that I'm familiar with the books. Only the series. That seems to be the consensus, and it goes with my opinion that the series format would be better suited for a book like Dune. The Lynch version just didn't have room for all of it. &&I think the technique that Sherlock uses to [film thought](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bfFgnJoLiQE)  would have worked well for Dune, had it been around back then. &&Starting William Shatner, Christopher Walken, and Nicolas Cage&&yeah but dune is SUPER dependent on it to drive the story forward. it has more internal dialogue than any other book i've ever read, it was strange to read at first. there will be several pages where nothing is really ""happening"" but the story is still progressing&&Reading your comment made me want the D.&&Dune without Kyle MacLachlan is wrong&&For the Villenueve films, Sting and Kyle Maclachlan should be given supporting roles. Also, I really just want to see Leto become an immortal god-emperor worm. Of Dune is gonna be 2 movies, does that mean God Emperor will be movies 7 & 8?&&I thought the series casting was rather crappy except for maybe 2 or 3 characters, all fremen. If poorly cast, I can't watch it.  Believe me, I tried.  I read Dune as a tween, and reread it throughout my adolescence.  It was crucial in forming my views and attitudes about politics and economics.  Very fundamental piece of literature for this gal.

https://youtu.be/nruKlir1h14?t=6&&You're not thinking with portals, though.  Think about Vangelis' Blade Runner soundtrack and how the sound and music bleed back and forth in a dreamlike way.

It's like the first or second chapter. &&I think if someones struggling I'd recommend pushing through until Paul and Leto are given the helicopter tour of the area outside of the city. The terror and wonder that you experience when you for the first time realize and get a first person experience of what Arakas really is is one of the greatest moments in literature. I think most people's curiosity will be too peaked to put the book down after that.&&Is it a lengthy read? &&Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson's Dune books are all kind of meh&&Dude, the first three books are nothing without GEoD. Like it was all for naught. &&I also **firmly** believe, without revealing anything, that because they found his dad's notes after having written quite a lot of surrounding fiction in the Dune universe already (not good stuff either) - they intentionally changed major plot points in book 7 (which also became books 7 and 8).  They changed these points to match their earlier work and story decisions.  
I truly believe they will never release the notes raw, because fans would shit bricks if they knew what was done.  But as 40+ year fan of Frank Herbert and having read the series many, *many*, **many** times - I'm very certain it was supposed to end differently.  There are a LOT of clues too.&&Not just religion, but religious extremism.&&Herbert's skill at intricate world-building.  Wildly impressive.  &&I just finished relistening to books 1 and 2 and it honestly feels almost like reading/listening to Shakespeare. It's heavy and requires a lot more thought per passage than typical fiction.&&Damn, that's impressive for a novel.

I've read all of them, so I know how good they are, but still.&&I'm an avid sci fi reader,  and reading Dune was an... interesting experience to say the least.  First, they do zero hand holding in that book. They drop you in and go ""good luck"". Normally I like that, but in this case i only sometimes knew what the hell was going on.  Also,  the book felt like.... a bunch of robots acting out a biblical story.  I could tell the subject matter was grand and had such a sense of scale,  but i didn't care about any of the characters.  They didn't seem to care if they lived or died. They didn't have the self doubt that makes for characters easy to empathize with.  A year after finishing it i feel the same way i did when i read the last page. ""Huh. Those were some things that happened i guess""
&&""Arguably"" to be safe, but yes.&&> The books also do a great job of bucking tropes

Do they ever. I loved reading that book and just being awestruck at the storytelling, doesn't take shortcuts, hits these crazy impossible themes and works through them so well.

That was the issue I had with his son's books, as much as I think we all owe him for finishing the series, it just wasn't the same. Frank Herbert is a fucking master.&&Fuck it, do it like an HBO show, he drinks the water and collapses.  Then wait a real 2 years before you pay off the cliff hanger.&&Enemy was great. After that and Prisoners I hope to see more Villeneuve and Gyllenhaal. &&Also H.R. Giger and Moebius. Before Star Wars. The Movie World would be different today. :(&&I keep meaning to watch the movie about the (attempted) making of this movie -- [Jodorowsky's Dune](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/)&&What would the 2025 collaboration look like if you had your choice?&&I'm sick that Jodorowsky's Dune never happened!  When he says in the doc that he wants to 'change the mind of every child in the world' (or something to that effect...) and the fact that most of the crew he assembled went on to make Alien you wonder what it could have been.  In terms of the internal monologues in the book, I'm sure his treatment of it would have been like nothing else and not simply relying on voiceover. &&I recently watched this before watching Blade Runner 2049. The idea is that this movie really did exist in many filmmakers' minds because of the book they shopped around and that you can see that in many different sci-fi films, Blade Runner was one of those films they mentioned in the documentary. Blade Runner 2049 is also for sure inspired by Jodorowsky's Dune. 

I think Villeneuve is perfect for Dune and might actually get us pretty close to that original vision as well. &&Which is nonsense really. Contrast it to Game of Thrones (all first person narration in the books) or Lor of the Rings (All the battles take place of page, and are only ever recounted after the fact in conversation)

I'm getting so sick of the word ""unfilmable"" with regards to Dune. The 1984 film had flaws but it got the immersion right.

There is really no such thing as ""unfilmable"" anymore. &&[deleted]&&It's been a few years since I've read the original Dune. What pedo stuff? Besides the perversions of the Baron, which, I mean, he is a villain.&&[deleted]&&> may have to water down is all the pedo stuff 

Made my day.&&The book handles point of view changes and interior monologues sooo well. Some of the best scenes are just people sitting at a dinner table talking and stuff like that. But the stuff they aren't saying is what makes those scenes.

I love love love Dune, but I hope they don't try to adapt the film too faithfully. Novels and films are different media. 

Some writers, like Cormac McCarthy, write perfectly for film. A lot of his novels can be translated perfectly. Dune *really* takes advantage of its form.&&It fell to the usual predictable SciFi channel pitfalls for miniseries, most notably re-using scenes of combat.

I prefer some parts the way they were done in the movie, and some the way they were done in the series, but overall I enjoyed both.

Children of Dune was pretty dang good too I thought, though some of the CGI was distracting.&&Fear is the mind killer&&I must not fear. 

Fear is the mind-killer. 

Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

BR2049 was a thought piece on technology and the nature of being.

Exactly. If there's any motif or personality it's buried under the layers and layers of synths and effects. It's the (relative) simplicity of Vangelis' soundtrack that allows the themes to come through so clearly. IMO, of course.&&It's probably the first film to come out in recent memory that looks so beautiful that I *needed* to get a hard copy for.&&[deleted]&&It's an amazing film... But unfortunately Blade Runner (1982) didn't do too hot either... But it holds up very very well. &&I did the same.

Always dangerous, I usually end up reading the entire series (not the new ones)&&To me that was kind of the point. Everyone is bred to basically be the most capable of their existence, and all aspects of humanity have been hollowed out.

What do I know though?
&&> Moebius.

Villeneuve is a huge fan of Moebius. I am so hopeful for this movie. &&It was O'Bannon Giger and Moebius meeting on that film that gave us Alien.&&It's a great watch, I don't even know anything about Dune and loved the Documentary.&&Good question - who are the Salvador Dalis, Orson Welles, Mick Jaggers, Pink Floyds of today??&&Alright that was a genuinely hilarious response. Thanks for the laugh mate. &&To be fair, LotR is also a much longer book (/trilogy of books) than Dune.&&One of the objections of David Lynch if I remember correctly was that he did not want to make _kung fu in space_, so he turned the weirding way into devices. 

But that might be due to the lack of special effects at the time. Reading about it now, it could turn out badass:

http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Weirding_Way

>During close-quarters combat, an individual adept at the Weirding Way was able to maneuver around and strike an opponent at unimaginable speeds. To the opponent (and any bystanders) the movement seemed almost like close-quarter teleportation.

>The key axiom of the Weirding Way was, in the words of Farad'n Corrino, ""my mind affects my reality."" By imagining oneself suddenly at a nearby location an adept could bypass the laws of physics and make themselves arrive there almost instantaneously.

that said, it's a difficult thing to get right. Matrix-like effects? Teleportation? Frank Herbert walked the line between natural and supernatural.&&Things have changed a lot in filmmaking since the early 90's when Dune was last attempted on film, and directors have a lot more inspiration in these genres to draw from. I think someone like Villeneuve, who has tackled some relatively unusual film/scifi topics already (Arrival being about language, time, and how we interpret things being a good example) is a good person to trust with this franchise.&&I think that's what the person was talking about.&&I don't remember any polyamory either, but I only ever read the first book.&&I expect they will gloss over most of the backstories and individual relationships.  Because really there's no way to convey the amount of information given in the books, lots of things will be implied or hinted at.  Casual fans will never notice, and the people who have read the book will get to enjoy it on a richer level knowing those bits of information.  There's still plenty of action and a coherent story arc to make a big budget hollywood movie around.  I have high hopes for Villeneuve after seeing his last few films.&&It's never going to reach the explicit philosophy of the books. It's a completely different medium, and things like internal monologues have never worked well. 

On the other hand, villeneuve is excellent at immersion, and having the viewer figure out philosophical stuff on their own. It's going to be different to the books, but he's already talked about how he's been a fan of the series since his teenage years, and I have faith he'll do the book justice, just like Blade Runner.&&But that makes the villain even more evil, they should keep that in&&[deleted]&&Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. &&Oh mighty Shai-hulud, keeper of balance

I've honestly never heard of that, and I read a lot.&&> Dune though is one of the most well known sci fi book series

Among hard sci-fi fans. The same group that knows *Bladerunner* just fine. 

The general public doesn't know shit about Dune. The reading public only cursorily so. It's one of my favorite series (well, the first four books), but its mainstream appeal is almost zero. 

If they want a big budget Dune that won't bomb, they're gonna have to dumb it down (TBF, dumbed down Dune would still be more stimulating than most) and cast Robert Pattison or someone as Paul (he actually interviewed for this role years ago in one of the many failed adaptation attempts). Weird, big budget Dune will not work...again. I would of course still watch the shit out of it.

&&Assholes and elbows!&& ^^^Pssst! [^^^Go ^^^here, ^^^man.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_produced_back-to-back)&&Because if it takes ten years to make every movie...&&For technology to catch up.&&Also tons of really stupid changes that made no sense.

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the queen living a stone‚Äôs throw from Earth‚Äôs most top secret military base. &&That movie was weird because unlike most poor movie adaptations of novels, it actually kept the major plot points intact. The production values were high, the dialog was fine, and I liked the casting too.  
  
But it just didn't work. I think your explanation is a big part of it. I think another part of it is that the conflict in the book felt epic with masterful solutions whereas the movie made the conflict look like it was resolved in a couple of weeks, and quite easily too. &&/r/dunetinder &&Shields + Lasers = Nukes.

Don't run around with lasers kids, you might fall down and accidentally incinerate us.&&You didn't use nuclear weapons because that was a social taboo enforced by a sort of tacit agreement to nuke anyone who used them on people into oblivion that all the houses were a party to.

Probably because the constant references to it in the main books, as well as just the topic being something that so interested me.&&I actually really enjoyed the Butlerian Jihad, but I think that I just really, really wanted to know the history leading up to Dune.

Yeah, simple, no problem.&&Lynch's Dune didn't lack visual chops.  It lacked energy and enough time to tell the story.&&A princess of Mars is easily one of the most well know sci fi novels out there.

It felt like the perfect fan-service ending, especially with the Paul and Chani gholas coming fully back and being together. There were just too many damn gholas of main characters at that point, haha. &&Dune is self contained, the LotR trilogy wasn't.&&In the context of Dune though, you need to push it further. Life on Arrakis is already tortuous, you need a villain that pushes it further, otherwise they are just milktoast. The villain needs to be so bad that you risk leaving the cities and hiding in caves, which basically drives the whole narrative.&&This might be fairly pedantic, but Herbert was clear that Chani was not a ""wife"". She was a concubine just like Jessica. Irulan may have held the title of wife, but Paul never shared a bed with her despite her best efforts. Titles aside, Paul spent his entire life loyal to one woman. I don't imagine that anyone will have difficulty with that.

And the reference to Alia's interest in incest, the book is quite clear that it's a very undesirable outcome. By the time Alia is considering it, she's already crossed over into abomination and is decidedly evil.

And the Baron, well he represents all that is evil and sinful. He's SUPPOSED to do those kinds of things.

&&God damn right. And you're doing yourself a disservice if you only stick to one kind of movie. Of course, that also tends to lead to looking at films with a more critical eye. At least that's been my experience. &&Did you know that ""love"" is the only thing that can transcend the laws of decent movies?&&That‚Äôs pretty cute. Good for you two!&&My wife saw BR2049 first and then BR. The only reason it happened like that is because it was about to leave theaters and we hadn't had a chance to show her the original. I told her she didn't have to go with me but she decided it would be fun to go with me and be able to see my reaction.

She said that my childlike wonder was adorable.&&I don‚Äôt think you can expect general audiences to sit through Blade Runner and understand how much of an impact it had on modern cinema. I loved the hell out of it, and appreciate it, but most people wouldn‚Äôt (especially those around my age - 29 - and younger). It could be called slow, dull, dated, etc. by today‚Äôs standards.

I think it was wise by Villeneuve not to have the original BR be mandatory viewing before going into BR2049. Let it be it‚Äôs own fully realized story, not just a sequel.

Damn it was so good though. I‚Äôm miffed that it wasn‚Äôt more of a commercial success.&&BR2049 and Interstellar - two movies that left some of the longest emotional impact post-watch for me&&They only did that because Mars Needs Moms bombed so hard they didn‚Äôt want any association with it in the title. Bad decision by Disney. They royally fucked up the marketing for that excellent film. &&Oh no... Is it bad that I liked that movie?

I mean, it's not Citizen Kane, but it was entertaining.&&Look Into my eye&&Somebody said ""aliens"", she thought they said ""illegal aliens"" and signed up.&&Yeah, well it's not for you! &&Like Clockwork Boogaloo and Electric Boogaloo. &&the problem is that due to carpet nuking planets during the Machine Crusade humanity has a HUGE problem with using nukes on any humans. This is addressed in the first book when Paul uses a nuke without killing anyone and only gets away with it because he has their whole civilization by the short and curlies.

There is a pact between all forces to nuke a planet to dust if the inhabitants use a nuke on another human. As in, ""oh the fuckboys on planet Fuckboy launched a nuke at planet Chad? Time for the whole galaxy to launch every nuke they have at planet Fuckboy.""&&Too many casualties.   It would prove to be the essential genocide of the native population, and would be a sign of ruthless recklessness seen by the The Emperor, CHOAM , and the Great Houses of the Landsraad, as well as other powerful players outside of the three point civilization as a threat to the stability of the Galaxy by means of an abrupt change in Spice production. Which is the absolute worst thing to happen because everyone that matters in the universe is addicted to it.  

So youd be taken out.

Thats not to mention the radioactive tainting of the most valuable substance ever known to sentient beings.   So maybe this is a thing on other planets,  but would be economic and political suicide to the highest extreme on Arrakis.&&Also agree with that. Happens to be my second favorite sci fi series. &&I still want to see the Mule on film.&&It was nice seeing the big-picture stuff, but I'd much rather they'd just published Herbert's notes and what he'd written so far, ala Christopher Tolkein's editing of his father's unpublished works.

*Phauh,* surely you jest! 

I'm merely here to cite uproarious correlations to the *Marvel Macrocosm of Motion Pictures.* 

You see, in the 1930s German forces began occupying nations across eastern Europe, starting with Poland. Adolf Hitler's army fanned out and eventually gained an ally in the distant country of Japan. Upon Japan's attack of a US fleet, the United States created a Super Soldier with a magical discus.  

However the colonies were not entirely enlightened, as segregation was still in full form. Predating Dr Martin Luther King jr's March on Washington by about thirty years, African American soldiers were still not yet allowed to serve alongside white soldiers during the second Great War. However a highly effective battalion of African American soldiers were equipped with tanks and sent into battle. They were called **761st Tank Battalion.**  

**And to your amusement**:

Despite the nation of Wakanda's king baring the title of 761st Tank Battalion, he did not participate with General George S Patton and the 761st Tank Battalion, as a World War was the precise jeopardy they desired to evade. Perhaps Obergruppenf√ºhrer Red Skull might not have come so close to slaying US Captain Discus if accompanied by the 761st Tank Battalion and his magical flying cars. &&Can Michael Jordan direct space jam 2?&&ITT: People who've never heard of the 761st Tank Battalion and don't care to find out.

Nope you're not allowed to war together cause you look different. Cause apparently it's bad to die next to a black man, whom is also probably dead cause you're in the middle of the largest global conflict in history. I forget how fucking deep some of that shit ran&&Holy shit, that Wikipedia page reads like a movie already. Black guys had to train for 2 years before going over! 2 years! And then there‚Äôs this nice little monologue before the lads go over 


>Men, you're the first Negro tankers to ever fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my Army. I don't care what color you are as long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsofbitches. Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all your race is looking forward to your success. Don't let them down and damn you, don't let me down! They say it is patriotic to die for your country. Well, let‚Äôs see how many patriots we can make out of those German sonsofbitches.

And then some of the battles and medals they describe are just crazy. &&Ooooh... that makes actually more sense. &&Fuck I was hoping it was about the Wakandan Black Panther during WWII with a special appearance by Captain America. &&Bad asses.  I'm really looking forward to this one- I hope they don't shit it up.&&Thanks for the article link. This sounds fucking AWESOME. &&Then he will portray Cam Newton in a feature film about the Carolina Panthers. &&Yeahhhh so not being a comic book fan, I was confused when everyone was excited about a Black Panther movie made by Marvel because I had only heard about the political party. &&Does Tom Hanks come in and ruin it?&&Bagheera spinoff film!&&As long as it has a cameo of Tom Hanks ruining their Black Panther Party, I'll go see it.&&> Then an animal doc about panthers for Disney. 

Honestly if DisneyNature ever released a documentary on panthers and anyone OTHER than Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan or Letitia Wright does the narration, it'll be the upset of the century.
&&Well, when you find your niche...

Make a patriotic war movie about the much less known tank division so that current and future generations will associate ""Black Panther"" with Marvel superheroes and WW2, instead of the much more controversial and influential radical political party&&""political party""

dont give them credit as being a legitimate political party. how about ""extremist organization"" or ""crime ring"" are much more fitting, considering the vast number of crimes their founder and top leaders committed. murder, money laundering, extortion to name a few.

I‚Äôd like to add Jackie Robinson was in the Black Panthers battalion but was transferred after refusing to move to the back of a bus. Hopefully that is in the movie.

Really good premise for a movie and I like that it shows the inequality and racism that existed in America rather than just a ‚ÄúRah rah‚Äù story about how great America is.

I have a positive view of America and am not a leftist; but the narrative that America was in multicultural harmony fighting against racist Nazis is BS.

*Flags of our Fathers* had a similar theme.&&Whoever killed hitler is the greatest hero of our age ... oh wait ... shit ...&&He never saw combat action, so I doubt he'll play much of a part in the film.&&That is pretty normal for most huff post articles.&&I'd like to see one done in a Dunkirk style on the Nazi vs Soviet eastern front.

It might just be a skin color but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the skin color doesn‚Äôt make a difference on everybody‚Äôs lives. Every black person in America has something in common, as does every white person, Asian person, etc. Whenever people ‚Äúidentify‚Äù as being black, they aren‚Äôt identifying just because of their skin color, but the culture that formed around these groups.

Now everyone is still an individual but it‚Äôs okay for people to relate to others that are similar to them. &&holy shit what an amazingly out-of -touch question...

They find something that speaks to them, and hopefully they do an assload of research and find experts and military historians, and then they make a movie worth watching that resonates with the truth and is a sight to see.

Book by John C. McManus

Context: Background, prior to invasion of Omaha Beach on 6 June 1944, the 1st Infantry Division trains in Britain.

""Competition for the affection of British women, and the inherent racist mores of mid-twentieth-century America, led to serious tension between a few of the white Big Red One soldiers and nearby black support troops. The animosity was serious enough that it led to occasional violence, such as a shooting incident involving Captain Uffner's M Company, 26th Infantry Regiment.

""Two of five black soldiers [were] killed, three others wounded. Civilian witnesses saw white soldiers fleeing.""

The Criminal Investigation Division restricted both groups to camp while it probed for more information on the murders. But the perpetrators were never found. Finally, after enough tension (and possible injustice) of this sort, the senior officers wisely decided to move the entire battalion to Swanage, away from the black units.""&&Chadwick Boseman to cameo as Jackie Robinson for the Jackie Robinson cinematic universe&&stalingrad's hopelessness portrayed the same way as the first couple minutes of dunkirk would be some powerful shit

Black panthers and white supremacists are the same. In the 60's when they had whites only bars and this courageous group of blacks that decided to fight back for equal human rights vs white supremacists who already make up 70% of the country and they feel like they are turning into a minority ... Let then have their rights!!! Totally equal groups!&&>the black panthers were a black identitarian solidarity movement, and if you accept the existence of such a movement in principle, there is no justification that invalidates an Asian identity, a Latino identity, or even a white identity.

I disagree. The Black Panthers advocated for a black identity as in ""We're not what they tell us we are, this is who we are."". It was for the purpose of standing together to oppose the oppression and giving black people the same social powers/freedoms that whites carried. By forming a black national identity, they sought to shout loud enough to be heard.

White people aren't being oppressed so there's nobody to protect themselves from. They don't need to pool their resources together because they own the majority share.

Also, until 1952, women were allowed to play Major League Baseball as well and non-Major women's teams played in exhibitions against men's teams all the time. The ban was only lifted in the 1990's (although no women have yet to be signed since).

Malcolm X and MLK, Jr. are often compared and contrasted with each other, as MLK, Jr. represented a peaceful approach to civil rights, while Malcolm X represents a more militant approach to achieving equality. Interestingly, as MLK, Jr. aged, he became more radical, but that's a topic for another time.&&Easy way to explain it was that MLK and Malcom X were both black civil right leaders in the 1950‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs but MLK preached non-violence and Malcom X led a more ... aggressive ... approach.

I haven't seen Exposed, but I did hear about the studio interference and how the end product was a complete mess. It's great that people have the opportunity now to watch the original director's intent. &&Mark Kermode did a wonderful blog on this very topic

https://youtu.be/J6bzF76z6QQ&&I watched Daughter of God a few months before Exposed came out, and the differences are incredible. The studio took a great story with complexity and made it into a run-of-the-mill cop drama. The writer and director recently just made the movie public on [social media](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg5_ENGnNes/?taken-by=geemaliklinton) today, so I wanted to share it with you guys.

EDIT: Gee is doing an AMA in r/KeanuBeingAwesome on Sunday, April 15th at 4pm. For all those who had questions, stop by!&&Honest question: does he have the rights to release this version online, or is this the sort of thing that will be taken down shortly?&&It really sucks when a movie is ruined by studio interference. &&So this is the version the director is absolutely Happy with, or just the best he could do?&&Thats Joi from Blade Runner 2049... I'm in.&&How common is this?

I remember this happend to another keanu reeves movie aswell the 2013 '47 ronin'. Where they ended up writing the director of and did reshoots to make keanu reeves a way bigger part of the movie.&&With all the social movements going on these days, I hope this snowballs into a movement of filmmakers coming forward with amazing versions of garbage movies.

Like, can you imagine if M. Knight Shamylan came out and was like ""here's my actual version of The Last Airbender, y'all""

And it's a fucking masterpiece?

What a twist.&&Been anxiously waiting a release for this ever since Mark Kermode highlighted the film and how terribly the original vision was butchered. The differences sound astronomical and I guess its just another example of how dangerous the editing room can be.

Can't wait to watch this though.&&I watched Exposed and it was god awful. Not joking when I say when I say worst movie ever seen but if it is suppose be different I understand now. I will give Daughter of God a shot. Thanks for this.&&In a few words without spoilers could you tell us what the movie is about? &&I was under the impression that the studio couldn't remove his name, or did he ask for it to be removed? &&I actually saw Exposed and you're right, it was a mess. I had just seen Knock Knock and searched Ana de Armas on IMDB because she was just about the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I'm so glad she got the role in Blade Runner, also glad she was great in it. We'll see her in lots more because of it.

So after I watched Exposed, I did a little research because I couldn't understand why Keanu Reeves would do a movie that was such a mess. I found out, just like OP said, that this is *not* the movie the director intended to make and, like always, the studio basically butchered it. Psyched to watch this to see what it should have been (and also more Ana).


edit: spelling&&I did some work on this movie right at the end of its recut, and was working on another project with some of the head post people during the final pass on this movie. It was an absolute shit show to watch this all unfold. I saw this cut right before they butchered it. &&On Rotten Tomatoes, the ruined version got 9%. It‚Äôs unfair that they did this to him.&&Huh. A similar thing happened to my brother. He directed a movie called **Tantrum**, but Lionsgate (I believe) renamed it and released it as [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1116047/?ref_=nv_sr_1](Rise of the Dead). Which is kind of annoying, since there aren't any zombies in it.&&If the reception is positive, will G release this on bluray or will the srudio come into help?&&Count me as one of the few who actually saw Exposed in the theater back in early 2016, and it was a goddamn narrative mess.

Director shouldn't quit his (very well paying) day job. Lions Gate should've just walked.

All that being said, Keanu Reeves performed his most wonderful scene ever in this film. If I'm sad about anything it's that nobody will ever see that.

I still feel violated though... not giving spoilers but some scenes were hard to watch. Do i feel like i wasted my time watching it? No. Do i wish the plot had been a little different? Certainly.&&Just finished it, I liked it.  Also noticed some Clint Mansell in the soundtrack towards the end from The Fountain.  The movie could have used some better cutting between scenes, but I'm guessing that was the result of not being able to do a final draft because of the studio so it wasn't as polished.  

I never saw the ""original"", but I though this is a solid film and don't understand why Lionsgate (weren't they the ones who butchered 27 Ronin as well?) has to ruin movies.  They have to know what kind of film they are supposed to be making.

Butchering the original vision doesn't usually make a movie better, it just ruins it.  Even if they don't like it, their butchering does nothing to serve anyone, not even themselves.&&Yo man, just watched the movie, shit was dope, really enjoyed it, got a mad Stone (with Edward Norton) vibe.

Loved everything else about the movie though; The eerie atmosphere was tangible and the performances were great all around.

It's a shame that this movie was whitewashed in this confusing, nonsensical way.

I am thinking this movie is a bit like the original Blade Runner where the studio puts out a movie that is different than the director's original vision, director then puts out an alternative ""director's cut"" and then later makes a ""final cut"" of the movie. I feel that this movie will definitely benefit from a proper cut with proper scene transitions and editing and sound mixing and even a proper film score that ties the whole thing together.

I'm glad that this is one of the rare exceptions and that your friend's original vision is able to be seen.&&Quick spoiler free intro or synopsis:

Late one night after partying, Isabel, our main character, leaves to take the subway home, alone. Earlier someone we can't see was photographing her group secretly. While waiting for a train she has a vision of a strange man floating in the air. We learn that a man has died on that same platform on the same same night as she was there and that Keanu is on the case. 

Now the mystery begins to slowly, tho confusingly unravel in that unreliable perspective style.

6/10 if you ignore the editing, the audio, lack of color enhancement  and some missing pick up footage. The story ends up being slightly above average, but spends too much time on the boring detective work and never really comes together the way you'd hope from an interwoven narrative.

Still very cool to see a movie in this kind of raw state, you notice what an impact missing some production elements has on the overall quality of a movie.&&people are so overacted nowadays. did you even watch both versions?! i just watched the the daughter of god version. and yes the Exposed tell the story a little bit different... but only a little bit. and its the same story. same experience when you watching, same feelings... nothing changed. but in comments people describe it like almost another movie.

try to watch blade runner main version and director's one. thats where the real difference.

im almost sure this whole story just to try and save a bad movie. if you dont believe me than watch both versions and answer on a small question: would you change your score on IMDB?&&This version isn't good. &&Lionsgate likes to fuck great things up. 

They bought Starz and canceled Ash Vs. Evil Dead.

There are a lot of baaaad films that people write off because it's obvious that the original cut couldn't have been a masterpiece, given what we can see with the re-cut, but... I dunno, maybe those films could have been better than most people give them credit for.

The acting in it is pretty good, I suppose it was the highlight of the film. There was a lot of dedicated acting, but the plotline was scatterbrained, redundant, and unclear (not in a good way.) There is a very trite rape scene that goes on for way too long. The art direction was shit. 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back.&&yeah I would have gone back and counted, but I don't want to sit through that scene again. It was so long I was out of the movie wondering how she made that vein pop-out in her forehead. She sold it, props to her but my god that was painful.

What scene for Keanu? I watched this version and I was underwhelmed by his screen-time, but he didn't have much to work with.  I thought his only well-written scene was him talking to his son, and lying about what his birthday was like. It had all the pain of what those lies reflected, and he sells the father who loves his son and understands he's disappointing him.

Honestly, his experiences were bordering on being as surreal as hers with the crazy widow, I was starting to think we were going to have a reveal that he was dead or something.

This thing is a mess.&&I just watched it and I thought it was a clever and unpredictable story with characters that were complex and relatable. I would recommend. &&Good.

That's fucked, one of my top favorite shows god dammit &&*Exposed* is terrible in my opinion. I say watch this.&&I liked 47 Ronin but I would love to see what it was supposed to be originally.&&Hell, even The Matrix. The original plot was that humans were all connected together to form an enormous CPU that drove the machines. It's smart, coherent, adds an intelligent level of irony and complexity to the plot, but was ultimately changed to ""humans are like.... Batteries or something."" Because the studio execs thought the public wasn't smart enough to handle the original version.

I'm still pissed just thinking about it.&&Is that what happened to 47 Ronin??? I was so hyped for it when I first heard about it but then it turned out... well yeah
&&Keanu always chooses interesting films, where at the production phase there's a high chance a film could derail. 

Luckily for him, John Wick paid off. I also liked Knock, Knock.

If he chose safe films like Dwayne Johnson it would be a whole lot different.&&Please tell me Keanu himself didn't push for this and instead stood off to the side, meekly and chill-ly going ""guys this wasn't the original vision""&&It's my understanding Keanu had no control over 47 Ronin. Lots of issues plagued it though. A first time director for a big budget blockbuster. A mediocre script. Over budget and behind schedule. Studio stepped in after principal shooting, did reshoots and additional scenes, and completely controlled editing. The test version was likely not a finished product but the studio wanting feedback. 


Just look at Man of Tai Chi. Keanu had tons of control over that film, even directed it, he wasn't the main character, it's awesome, and it came out the same year. &&The most famous example of this being Kingdom of Heaven and the directors cut.  The theatrical version is universally panned, but the directors cut is universally acclaimed, it is an astonishing difference. &&And maybe the opposite happens too. Movies that would've been crap but after the big executive's intervention became better.&&Speaking of movies I'd like to see the alternate version of, there's something in my mind I call the ""Will Smith effect"" on movies. I'm sure there must be other people where this happens, but two movies stick out in my mind that were heavily altered (ruined) while Will Smith was involved.  
  
The first is *I am Legend*, where the infected people turn out to have regained their minds long ago and formed societies, and the lead character is revealed to be the monster that hunts them.  
Will Smith can't be the bad guy though, and sure, maybe it was because test audiences didn't like the downer ending, but that ending is what makes the whole trip worthwhile and sets it apart from every other zombie survivor tale.  
    
Second, there's *Hancock*. In the original ending, Hancock is basically an unstoppable monster who kidnaps a woman, kills a bunch of police trying to rescue her, and then tries to kill himself. 
Granted, that ending probably never would have made it to production, and the movie was stuck in development hell for a long time. Still, it would have been an interesting subversion of a super hero movie to see someone like superman without the moral compass. That whole movie went to crap after the first half.  
   
Also, more recently is Netflix's *Bright*. I don't know if it actually had anything to do specifically with Will Smith being involved whatsoever, but it doesn't actually matter. [The idea that Will Smith's character was the destined to be the hero was trite. It would have been better, even if almost equally predictable, for the orc guy was the bright. Or even both of them being brights would have been better.](#spoiler)   
At least that would have left a more interesting story open. &&> Thanks for posting that, it was a really interesting watch. And it makes me wonder how often that kind of executive interference ruins other interesting films.

So often. Or directors had to (or wanted to in some cases) go in another direction and production runs long. Some studios are cool and some are awful. Some executive producers usually push shit wayyyy to far and then get key staff replaced only to have something that was in development for years with all huge fans and experts to be created as an amalgam of shit no one enjoys making or watching. Ultimately, whatever makes the most money though!!!! (says a former filmmaker-dreamer)&&Just watch fanedits which are often far superior when done by professionals.  I like many couldnt stand the hobbit trash but loved lotr trilogy.  So I watched a 2.30 fan edit of all 3 and was blown away. Now I love it.  Check out https://www.fanedit.org.&&I hold out hope that one day we might get the original body horror version of Fantastic 4.  There is so much potential in that. &&I remember hearing that was a HUGE part in why Suicide Squad was...off. There was supposed to be a major plot planned that Harley Quinn was pregnant with the Joker's baby and it was about him accepting that. Which was why the scene with him surrounded by guns and knives also (bizarrely) had baby outfits in the mix. I guess when they went back to reshoot after Deadpool's humor success, they totally changed the plotline and rearranged scenes. This is all hear-say but I can imagine it happens in movies often, especially as they have to react to test audiences and what's happening in the real-world. 

An interesting quick read is this [list of movies affected by 9/11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_entertainment_affected_by_the_September_11_attacks) &&Don't know about Fan4stic, but ""Suicide Squad""? 

Considering the producers took the work of a talented director and cast and had it entirely recut by the guys who made the music video for one of the trailers, I'd say it turned out exactly like you would expect.

&&A lot of sequels that try to go against the grain fall victim to this because of the studio's expectations for a series.  Off the top of my head, I can think of Blair Witch 2 , The Crow 2, (the practical effects from) the new The Thing, the new Fantastic Four (as mentioned below), but there's so, so many more that fall into this trap.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHmq6C0_sI) is a recent video of the production issues behind a 1970's blacksploitation movie that really tried to be an arthouse film (race played a role here, but it's still relevant).

GBF (that youtube channel) actually goes into a lot of different movies that have this issue, but I don't think there'd be any way to search for those individually.&&While not exactly a bomb, I'd love to watch the original, R rated cut of *Galaxy Quest* with sex scenes, f bombs, and marijuana.&&>	Makes me curious to see those re-cut box office bombs to see if they might have been passable. 

It‚Äôs not just bombs. I suggest you watch the last jedi, then watch the deleted scenes. It‚Äôs more than obvious that the studio got involved and fucked some things up. 

Also those fuckers never should have touched the dark tower...&&Suicide squad and Fan4stic are really flawed at the core&&Army of darkness is better as a directors cut. Funnier.&&I'm among the crowd that would like to see the version of Suicide Squad before all the re-shoots. I have a feeling it was probably an entirely different movie&&Same here.  
For some reason Keanu kept getting fucked like this.  I'd love to see the original 47 Ronin.&&Tinkity tonk&&See you on the cruise!&&Same üòÅ&&For sure this. Dude should get some traction outta this at least. System is a soul sucker, shouldn't stop dude from the next one. &&/r/KeanuBeingAwesome/ could also help out promoting the film&&And Wikipedia.&&I think the director asked for his name to be taken off the project. The studio can't void his contract based on that AFAIK&&He would have gotten paid. The Director‚Äôs Guild doesn‚Äôt fuck around with that sort of stuff.&&It‚Äôs Hollywood. Of course they screwed him over financially. &&Yeah that's right, https://youtu.be/J6bzF76z6QQ&&Tweeted him the link!&&You could give five editors/other directors the same exact footage and it's entirely possible you get the final results back as 5 different genre films. 

I forget who, but some director close to Spike Jonze won a bet by recutting ""Her"" and turning it into a completely different movie and Jonze loved it. &&[deleted]&&You only need to watch a reality TV show to see the power of editing. Now apply that to hours of footage and it's easy to see how much it matters.

However, you can usually tell when a film has been butchered like this. So yes, you can cut a film into something entirely different than intended, but it won't be a coherent or good something.&&Exposed (2016) is the Lionsgate theatrical and DVD release that was changed beyond what script and directing intended. Daughter of God is the director's edit of the film as he wrote and directed it.&&They are both edited.&&Just to be clear (if not entirely accurate): yes&&Hey now, my beagle ate poop. That dog was a saint. &&I‚Äôm interested to see Annihilation because it seems like one of the rare times this was prevented (and apparently that‚Äôs a financial disaster).

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that people are stupid. I think it‚Äôs more a mental kind of laziness. Very smart people can have this attitude towards a lot of things such as movies. People approach film as a consumable that should require zero mental energy, which I guess is valid for entertainment but is a problem where art intersects with that.

No offence to Americans, but having the bulk of film money come from the US worsens the problem. There seems to be a practice of always remaking stuff from UK, Europe, Australia, NZ, etc.  The way the US version ends up being different is this blunt, exaggerated, often cliche version of the original. It enables this approach to film as something within the safe narrow confines of what people already know.

For example, there‚Äôs a good Australian film called Animal Kingdom based on a real life crime family in Melbourne with some great performances too. It was transformed into an American TV series of the same name, reset as a crime family in California, with the same plot points but this very classic melodramatic American style that overexplains what was nicely understated in the film and that loses what was unique or interesting about the original. 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of potentially good movies marred or even ruined by overexplaining. I found it confusing that people found Inception confusing. Primer is confusing. Confusing can be fun. 

I don‚Äôt know how to solve this problem when films need to be commercially viable and creators need to pay bills. &&Prometheus wasn't confusing, it was just bad. 

I'm not confused why scientists would walk around a hostile and unknown alien world without helmets, or at least filtered breathing equipment, and trying to befriend and pet uncatalogued alien species. I understand it. It's because they, and the movie they are in, are both stupid. 

I could go on, but tearing into this movie feels like bullying a class full of special ed kids. &&i dont even consider myself a movie watcher. Honestly 99.99% of them aren't worth my two hours. But the good movies ive seen stick with me
&&It's on the vimeo page :) &&Is this one of the things we should watch asap because it will probably be taken down? That is the impression I am getting, this looks like it could be real quality and I don't want to miss out on it. &&What a G&&Sounds like a cool dude. Gonna watch this now, I‚Äôm hyped!&&My guess is that it has been over 2 years since the release and given the poor performance of the theatrical version, the studio probably doesn‚Äôt care as much about the director‚Äôs cut version being out with the expectation that it won‚Äôt get much attention.

I watched it and haven‚Äôt watched the theatrical version. I thought the director‚Äôs cut version was fine. It would not have warranted the low ratings by both critics and non-critics alike. No way.

I saw the the trailer to the theatrical version after watching the director‚Äôs cut in full and the trailer was laughably off the mark. It looked like one of those trailer edits that make horror movies into rom-com and visa versa.

As Mark Kermode pointed out, the director‚Äôs cut version leaves you thinking about the movie m. Regardless of whether there was was more meaning or symbolism, leaving an impression and making me want to think about it is not a bad thing when it comes to storytelling.&&They say American History X was this way, (studio fixed movie) though we'll never know.&&people see studios as just one entity, they forget theres tons of people making decisions all the time the assholes that screwed this guy are most likely not the same ones responsible for saving some movies from the hands of unexperienced directors.

they either forget, or, choose to continue believing their bias of this common thought that hollywood is utter evil and against artistic freedom, in some cases that thought ends up being true but not always.&&Star Wars was apparently one of those, except it wasn't the studio. It was his wife.&&Lawrence of Arabia is an example of a film saved by the studio. It was a completely different movie until the studio interfered and made it the classic it is today.  &&The editing feels really amateurish in places, lots of awkward fade ins and fade outs in the same scene, even during the same moment of action sometimes. I wonder why that is?&&I wanted so bad for her to be happy!  I don't remember the last time I was so invested in a fictional character's well being.&&So it sounds like they wanted to re-edit it so they could say ""staring Keanu Reeves"".&&She's also in this other movie Exposed (2016) with him too.&&( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&&Alan Smithee was always the traditional name used. &&You mean you don't like ANGIE the AVIATOR?&&I kind of want to find out if it is more horrible than Exposed but I also think I would die if it is.&&The woman is Peruvian, no?&&Ahh ok, he did ask for it to be removed (I knew that was possible).

The woman was raped or otherwise violated by her father as a child. She was again raped at the beginning of the film in the subway. It is not clear whether she started repressing memories that invoke hallucinations from this point on or if she has always done this. From her cold, distanced behaviour towards her family and that she could never accept the love of her mother, let alone her father, showed that it was likely there was a traumatic past. It seems like her mother knew about the abuse and keeps trying to 'make up for it' with superficial niceities, she herself is clearly filled with repressed guilt. That cowboy hat played a role in the trauma as well, which can be seen to her reaction to it and her 'hallucinations' with the father of the young girl in the hat.

She subconsciously made up the memory of the guy floating on air as she could mentally not cope with the reality of her rape. The subsequent, alien-like manifestations represent the guidance of her subconsciousness. Their role is a bit blurry, maybe I'd need to watch it again, but maybe it's intended like that. The 'angels' protect her from her memories. Repression in traumatised victims is usually actually a rather healthy response to trauma; Or let's say, not thinking about it and just moving on. Many people seem to think that facing the trauma or reaching some sort of closure would be healthy, but that's far from the reality. So the aliens/angels/the subconsciousness actually protect her.
The young girl isn't real. She was probably never there, or maybe left the kindergarten sometime and the protagonist started imagining her. She is trying to protect her (past) self, be the person she wished she had when she was a child. It's a way of realising and reflecting on herself without having to face the reality that it was her who was the victim. Ultimately, her subconsciousness reaches a boiling point and she kills her father; a sort of subconscious revenge.&&And now I‚Äôm off to check all my devices to see if I can watch Vimeo stuff on my tv!&&Shit yeah. I think mine has one too actually.&&It's not been cancelled. No idea where they got that information from. &&I'm guessing the original version isn't available?   I remember when I first watched it it was pretty obvious where Keanu was added back in... there would be a shot of a group of people then it would show Keanu by himself reacting, then back to the group of people again.  &&I think 47 Ronin would have done much better if it didn't have that name. 47 Ronin is a well known part of Japanese history that actually happened, and making it into a high fantasy story really kinda kills it.

I believe if it was called uh...  Fuck, I don't know, ""Ronin's Edge,"" or some shit like that, it would have done much better. The name killed that movie, because I thought it was pretty cool.&&That's easy there are plenty of movies you can watch for that. My favorite is the 1962 version with Toshiro Mifune in it. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OXY-GfAtJ8o&&Source?&&Borg?&&Was Knock Knock good? I, admittedly, haven't watched because of unfavorable reviews.&&The first thing that came to mind for me was Terry Gilliam's Brazil (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_(1985_film)#Battle_for_final_cut) where they changed the ending from sad to happy, rescored it with rock music instead of the existing orchestral score and chop it down from 142 minutes to close to 90 if I'm remembering right.  Gilliam had to fight them for three years to get something resembling his version released.  That version has been rated as the 17th best British film ever made.  
  
There was also the similar fight with the studios over the release of Blade Runner.&&I never saw the theatrical cut. I honestly didn't know it was that different - I just assumed it was like most director's cuts, with a couple extra scenes tossed in and whatever.

Now I'm curious about the differences!

I love that movie, by the way.&&Another good example, imo, is Michael Mann's *Miami Vice*. The theatrical version was a disappointment, and I think the reviewers panned it as well.  The extended cut on DVD almost feels like a new movie. The characters are much more developed and just a better film. *That's* the version that should have been in theaters.&&I would argue James Earl Jones not wanting his name on the original Star Wars is equally amazing.&&Blade Runner is another great example, though I wasn't alive when it was in theaters. The theatrical cut was apparently an abomination, it had some really horrible, phoned in narration by Harrison Ford in the beginning, and the ending was changed in editing to be a happy one.

Of course now it's one of the most famous cult classic Sci-fi movies since everyone has only seen the directors cut.&&> The most famous example of this being Kingdom of Heaven and the directors cut.

I beg to differ. *Brazil* had it's ""love conquers all"" bullshit 20 years before *Kingdom of Heaven*. &&I'm not sure how often it happens that *executive* interference saves movies (simply because it's extremely difficult to believe that someone who wasn't heavily involved in the film could truly improve it, with some probably extreme exceptions).

*However*. I do know that Star Wars: A New Hope was saved from Lucas' horrifically awful edit by his wife and a few other people on the creative team. There's a reaaaally interesting [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFMyMxMYDNk) about how the second edit basically saved the film. Give it a watch, it's really amazing just HOW different it could have been.&&This might not be a popular opinion, but Apocalypse Now.&&You can feel the steering wheel being tugged out of the directors hands just after halfway through the film I think. 

Up until that point I was wondering why it had bad press, and was surprisingly entertained. Then all if the threads of the plot just fizzle and the orcs entire character arc is jettisoned to make way for Generic Hollywood Star Film Ending. 

Was quite pissed off, and did wonder then if it was the studio or will smiths ego that was the cause. &&I watched a fanedit of the Star Wars prequels. And while there was still *some* stuff that remained a problem, that was largely because they couldn't actually reshoot certain scenes to not suck, or to make other pacing problems make more sense. It's still a *vast* improvement over the original three, and it's about the length of a single film.

The pacing is pretty messed up though :P&&I'm sorry, what? There was a different version of Fantastic Four? &&Maybe this version will hold you over
https://youtu.be/28EyQ4a3OEA&&> I remember hearing that was a HUGE part in why Suicide Squad was...off. There was supposed to be a major plot planned that Harley Quinn was pregnant with the Joker's baby and it was about him accepting that. Which was why the scene with him surrounded by guns and knives also (bizarrely) had baby outfits in the mix. I guess when they went back to reshoot after Deadpool's humor success, they totally changed the plotline and rearranged scenes. This is all hear-say but I can imagine it happens in movies often, especially as they have to react to test audiences and what's happening in the real-world.

I mean I'd like to see the original cuts of those movies, because they both were edited TERRIBLY and I always sorta felt like they would have sucked anyway, but I also feel I might have underestimated the power a bad edit has to ruin a film.&&Same with the Scooby Doo movie, originally it was gonna be a much more adult, meta movie&&Oh reeeeeally?

He definitely didn't spare the audience any discomfort or fatigue. There is a time and a place where dragging your audience over broken glass is important to what you're trying to dig into, when you really need to make them feel it in a way that is excruciating. 

Spielberg does this masterfully, the scene with the knife at the end of Saving Private Ryan is burned into my memory like a hot iron of anxiety and discomfort. It's crucial to his objective telling you: ""war, at it's core, is the most brutal, fucking horrible, cacophony of humans doing terrifying shit to one another.""  It's been too long since I've seen Schindler's List, but I know it has similarly imporant moments.

This movie did not do this, it just made us watch a woman cry for like 2 minutes in a simulation of a terrifying act... there's no message here.

I'd still like to know what scene you mean for Keanu.&&Oh shit that makes a lot more sense! Thank you!

Two things still bothering me, then. 

[Why was the ending cut in such a way that it showed the angel sitting down where Keanu was? What was that supposed to imply? And what did the color of the angel‚Äôs dress represent? White was ignorant of the trauma, red was something(?) and black was revenge?](#spoiler)&&Thanks you saved my day. I should have Google searched,I may be too trusting in Reddit users &&That‚Äôs about right.  When they were cutting the picture, Keanu Reeves and Carl Rinsch we‚Äôre taking great pains to make sure it was an ensemble piece showcasing the Asian actors more than Keanu.  The problems were compounded when the studio not only didn‚Äôt like that direction, but that Rinsch was being entirely too precious with his editing process and was literally locked out of the edit room when WB had enough.

Sucks because that was going to be an awesome movie in it‚Äôs intended form.  Sucks more because Rinsch is actually one of the nicest directors I‚Äôve met.

Source: I used to work at a production company where Rinsch was contracted while the whole 47 Ronin business was going down.  Overheard a few things and talked to him directly.

EDIT: Corrected spelling of Carl Rinsch‚Äôs name.

EDIT: Corrected studio from WB to Universal (thanks u/Vectorman1989).&&From what I've read on the film, the original cut of the film was shown to screening audiences with favorable reviews and then they cut it to what it is now.

Hopefully one day we can see the original cut.&&>then it would show Keanu by himself reacting

I'm picturing Bill-and-Ted-era Keanu recoiling and saying ""Whoooa!""&&It's been talked about a ton in interviews and such. It honestly wouldn't change the movie much at all, just the scene where Morpheus explains the Matrix to Neo. Might have had a bit more of an effect on the sequels, though, I'm not sure.&&I heard it from the same guy who told me Steve Buscemi was a Firestarter at a 711&&Personally I found it almost unwatchable&&IT WAS FREE FUCKING PIZZA&&[The King and the Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_and_the_Mockingbird) may be even worse. It was an animated film made in France in the early 1950s, but the director lost funding before it was finished. It was released anyway, in 1952, against the director's wishes. 

It's a terrible movie, and [a really bad English dub of it](https://archive.org/details/The_Curious_Adventures_of_Mr._Wonderbird) was released under the name ""The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird"".

It flopped at the box office, and the director was eventually able to buy back the rights. He spent a decade trying to secure funding to finish the film the way he had wanted, and finally secured that funding in 1977.

So about 45 minutes of the ~60 minute original were salvaged, and another 40 minutes were animated, and the new cut was released in 1980. That cut is widely acclaimed as one of France's earliest animated classics. &&> Brazil

We're all in it together.&&You know the entire subplot about Eva Green‚Äôs son and how he has leprosy and she poisons him out of love and kindness? That kid literally doesn‚Äôt exist in the theatrical cut. Edited out entirely. As a result, some of the decisions the characters make are a little jarring and confusing.&&I saw the theatrical cut originally and enjoyed it a good deal, watched it a good number of times.  A few years afterwards I saw the director's cut and it's just so much better.  Just as one example, in the theatrical cut Sibylla's son (a large reason for why she went crazy for a while, and doesn't do anything to dissuade Guy from marching the army off to die) doesn't even exist.&&The theatrical cut was edited to be an action story about an adventurer who gets caught up in the politics of the crusade while finding redemption for his wife. Nothing was really explained as to why events happened to Balien. For instance, the attack by the lord's men on the road to Italy just made no sense in the theatrical. 

In the directors cut, the story is about a man who is struggling with faith getting caught up in the politics of the holiest place known to Muslims and Christians; trying to be faithful to his beliefs in a world where you're likely to die for being so righteous. &&Entire storylines were axed (I don't think you even know the Eva Green character has a son in the theatrical release). Bloom's character is more fleshed out in the beginning to make his actions more understandable. Guy De Lusignan's final scene is just him on the donkey (they cut the final duel).

Those are three major things off the top of my head. There's a total of like 45 minutes added.&&In the beginning of the theatrical cut, he inexplicably kills a snarly priest who is inexplicably insulting his dead wife.

The directors cut adds back the 5 minutes or so that explained what that was all about.

Plenty more like that peppered throughout the film.&&> I never saw the theatrical cut. I honestly didn't know it was that different - I just assumed it was like most director's cuts, with a couple extra scenes tossed in and whatever.
> 
> 

It's just a complete movie.

For example, it's never explained how the main character goes from blacksmith to running a medieval castle and building stuff for it well. He learned battle tactics fricking fast too! 

In the director's cut there it's brought up he was a (military?) engineer or some sort and left to be a blacksmith at some point.&&I love the director‚Äôs cut but the theatrical cold open to the night club op is so much better to me. Still, I‚Äôll take the DC.&&You just made my weekend....I always felt that film was missing something.&&I heard he felt didn't feel that he deserved credit for the role since he recorded the voice over in a couple days without going through the hell of filming that A New Hope was for the physical actor in the actual costume.&&True, but not many people still talk about Brazil's shitty versions. The definitive version has been THE version since home video (similar to Blade Runner). Kingdom of Heaven isn't that old of a movie, comparatively, so lots and lots of people active on the internet have probably heard the movie sucks, (based on the theatrical version) but aren't aware of HOW much different the cuts are.

Not arguing with you or anything, but there's a reason Kingdom of Heaven gets brought up and not Brazil. It's because Brazil's original cut is actually more obscure now.&&I love that movie.&&Star Wars in general was saved by people other than Lucas.

Not ribbing the guy, he has his talents. Writing and directing isn't one of them.&&There's probably a lot more examples of executive interference saving a movie than there are of them harming them but we're rarely going to hear ""Yeah the script was crap and the direction wasn't really there but a few big wigs executives saved the whole thing with audience test and requested reshoots.""&&It probably hard to definitively prove that a version of the movie that was never released was saved, but there are for sure a few instances where some exec or producer improved a movie.  
  
 The whole android subplot in *Alien* was forced in by people other than the original writers.   
The ""firing guns wildly into the jungle"" scene from *Predator* started as a protest because the producers wanted more guns in the movie.    
The first studio to pick up *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy originally picked it up as two movies, then demanded that it be cut down to fit one movie because it was too expensive. The second studio to pick it up demanded three movies and gave Jackson more breathing room.  
The lightinging bolt part of *Back to the Future* came about because the original ending was going to be too expensive. 

For *Jaws*, Spielberg liked the test audiences reaction to the shark, and he wanted more aucience reaction so he added in another scene where a guy's head pops up.   
That's not executive meddling, but shows test audiences can have a useful place.  
   
I can't recall at the moment, but I know there are a few other movies that were reported to be pretty awful before the studios demanded reshoots and recuts. Those stories just tend not to be as memorable as a flop that could/should have been great.  &&The IMAX version of Attack of the Clones is a large improvement. &&Josh Trank was basically making a different movie than the studio wanted.  You can sorta see the tone shift half way through then studio freaked out and effectively sidelined him so they could have genetic superhero movie #165.  I don't think there is a cut of his intended version though.  Not a complete one anyway.&&The director of the recent reboot wanted it to have kind of a body horror tone, with the heroes learning to cope with their new mutations&&Same story - the studio brought the director on based on his pitch of a body-horror Fantastic 4. Then when they had enough footage to re-edit into something less awesome and more boring they fired him from the project and cut all his good stuff.&&That's a different kind of horror &&Yeah, I remember a big criticism for the reshoots was based on the misunderstanding of why Deadpool was successful and it being misinterpreted as the R-rated humor. It was more the sum of everything that made it great (incredible dialogue, RR's delivery, over-the-top gore, and sticking to the original nature of the character) as opposed to something a studio can easily duplicate...in a reshoot.  &&*cough Dark Knight cough*

I hear ya though. The studios really have to dump money in the comic franchises though because it's big-screen, 3D action movies that bring people to theaters. It causes them to copy one another when there is a success. And there really isn't a benefit to watching Three Billboards in a theater vs. a decent home setup anymore so it's all they've got.&&> asshole marketing committee: bye. we're off to the money store with our shitty movie. it may not be a great movie, but it'll sell more tickets than your 'vision'.

Kaye disowned the final cut of the film, as he did not approve of its quality.[2] He unsuccessfully attempted to have his name removed from the credits.[3][4] The final cut was critically lauded and Norton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.

> The battle over artistic control of the film, which has become part of Hollywood folklore, all but destroyed Kaye's career. He delivered his original cut on time and within budget ‚Äì but when the producer, New Line Cinema, insisted on changes, the arguments began.

> The debate quickly escalated. Kaye spent $100,000 of his own money to take out 35 full-page ads in the Hollywood trade press denouncing Norton and the producer, using quotations from a variety of people from John Lennon to Abraham Lincoln. He attended a meeting at New Line to which (to ease negotiations) he brought a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Tibetan monk. When the company offered him an additional eight weeks to re-cut the film, he said he'd discovered a new vision and needed a year to remake it, and flew to the Caribbean to have the script rewritten by the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott. Finally, when the Directors Guild refused to let him remove his name from the New Line version of the film, he demanded it to be credited to 'Humpty Dumpty' instead, and filed a $200 million lawsuit when the company refused.[5]

[Hmm, interesting. I've seen a few of his movies, and he does kind of like that floaty style it seems. But look at a part like (BIG SPOILER) the stabbing at 2:04:10 (in the Vimeo timeline). Something feels so off. It takes a relatively simple action and makes it confusing, letting all the tension out of a climatic moment.](#spoiler) 
&&In the last minutes of the film (02:07:58), when Elisa is ""faded"" out from the restaurant, editing was really off leaving a huge weird blur in her stead.&&That I'm willing to give a pass on, because proper post sound is expensive, and he did this outside of the studio on his own dime. But there's no extra cost to use a regular cut rather than a fade.&&No sarcasm.

Rape scenes better serve a very good purpose and propel a movie/show forward. This one doesn't. It's sensational and misogynistic. To add insult to injury, the director handled the shooting of it very poorly. He traumatized the actor. AND the audience, by proxy. 

The problem with this movie is that it suffered at the hands of a giant, narcissistic ego. Not conjecture. First-hand knowledge. 

I hope he grows some balls and apologizes to everybody he tortured through the making of it. 

I don't accept the OP's mild suggestion that the director was a victim to studio short-sightedness. That is something that definitely happens out here, but  it in this case. He is the reason this film sucks. And sucks bad. I applaud Reeves and Lions Gate for always supporting unknown talent and fronting masses of money and credibility to do so.

May we all be so lucky and may we all have access to humility when the opportunity arises.




&&>That‚Äôs about right. When they were cutting the picture, Keanu Reeves and Karl Rinsch we‚Äôre taking great pains to make sure it was an ensemble piece showcasing the Asian actors more than Keanu. The problems were compounded when the studio not only didn‚Äôt like that direction, 

In hindsight, this is pretty stupid considering the mega profits asian markets generate.

I hope those studio execs were fired.&&Reading about it now. Universal stepped in, took the film away from Rinsch and spent a whole load more money on adding more Keanu scenes only for it to bomb at the box office.

The should probably have left it with Rinsch &&I didn't think the film was all that bad, I would definitely watch the original cut &&Actually it explains a lot about the ""super powers"" aspect.

Why would a computer purposely create a simulation where rogue human avatars can move faster than bullets and fly?

On the other hand, if the system depends on human brains as a processing substrate, then there's some logic to human willpower being able to influence the simulation, like being able to control a single node in a cloud computer.&&It would make the entire movie make far more sense, and would cover a lot of the essential plot-holes that exist if you know even a little bit about physics or computers. It's the one glaring point in what's otherwise a great movie.  
It also opens up an entirely new philosophical layer about merging man and machine, about human intelligence vs AI. ""The machines"" wouldn't be just AI, they'd be run on the unconscious mind of humanity.  
    
If the Matrix isn't just a VR system that people are dropped into, but it's actually a feedback loop where the people are in a shared dream merged with machines, and the machines are using human brainpower, then that explains why the machines don't have total control over people in the Matrix, why some people seem to have the ability to act outside the Matrix's programming, and why someone like Agent Smith exists.  
   
The first Matrix movie would have been that much better, and if they ran with the idea in the sequels, maybe they wouldn't have been such a convoluted mess. There's a lot of prime story material that was left on the table just so Morpheus could hold up a brand name battery. &&[deleted]&&there were no sequels.

&&You are definitely on point. In 20 years, the same discussion will probably come up about a move made in 2030 or some shit. Brazil probably was't even the first time this happened to a mainstream motion picture. This has got me thinking whether there are more definitive cuts of old Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin flicks.

I would personally consider Brazil a more quintessential example only because of how much of an unmitigated disaster the ""love conquers all"" studio cut is. People throw around ""unwatchable"" a lot for modern movies, but it is legit unwatchable.

EDIT: Yep, just looked it up, same shit happened to Hitchcock and Orson Welles&&This may be a good time to check out American Graffiti.  

70's George Lucas was a fantastic director.  Nearly every first cut of a movie, even the greatest movies of all time, is bad.  Nearly every movie is ""saved"" in the second cut, or the tenth cut, that's a step in the filmmaking process, not an exception that indicates a bad director.  &&No kidding.

I'd have loved a full-on version of it.&&He did, but a Russian mob guy killed it.&&As far as I can tell he didn't get any say in which version was released. It seems as though all changes were made during the editing phase by Lionsgate, and Keanu wouldn't have had any say at this point. Though he was a producer on the film so he might have had more say than if he was only acting in it.

In my opinion he most likely would have preferred the original version as this is the one he signed on to take part in. And although he seems to have a bigger part in the released version, he isn't the type to care about having the main role as he's played many supporting roles throughout his career.

I was definitely talking about his entirely filmography as a writer-director. I don't think American Graffiti is all that, but there is a certain ""trick"" it uses common amongst emerging filmmakers that gives it a free pass. It's why George looks like he's lost it since his early years, but Spielberg can keep going; George never had a handle on being a director. He's always been an ideas man, which is why he was a better producer.

Also, I'm well aware how the filmmaking process works. I work in the NZ film industry. I can watch a film in a cinema and generally tell what happened while the movie was being made. That being said, I watch the original Star Wars and literally have no idea how the fuck it worked.

That's actually very accurate. &&I thought that maybe it was a stylistic choice in other parts, maybe not a *good* one. But doing a fade out mid-[stabbing](#spoiler) is truly off putting.

It wasn't a slight dip as much as what the Wachowskis were doing was already tenuous in terms of originality and was drawn out far too much into something unnecessary and lacking in any real meaning.

Films ""in competition"" means films eligible for the end of festival awards. Many films screen out of competition at Cannes so unless Netflix decides to not submit to Cannes then their films can still screen there, they just won't be eligible for Palme d'Or, Grand Prix, or other awards.&&Fun fact, if netflix wanted to distribute their movies through french cinemas they wouldn't be able to add them on their streaming platform for 3 years.&&netflix is a distributor. does it even bother showing at festivals?&&>Cannes sees themselves as premier gatekeepers of culture

And that's why ...

>the average Netflix viewer isn't going to give a shit

Cannes can do whatever the hell they want, the only thing it will do is make them even less relevant to the average movie watcher. &&This is just stupid. Films should be judged on merits, not how they are distributed. There might be a strong correlation between quality and means of distribution, but foreclosing the possibility of a film being great and deserving of an award on rigid and attenuated criteria is a great way to make yourself irrelevant. Rules like this will end up harming Cannes more than anyone.  &&I doubt Netflix care about festival hype.&&People are acting like Cannes will die without Netflix. They won't.&&Reading some angry comments here I'm reminded that there is a fine line between anti-elitism and anti-intellectualism. Cannes says its movies must be released first in cinemas because that's the rule, that's how it's been for decades. It's an award for cinema, which in France is still seen as a very special and prestigious medium. That's it. Netflix is a massive company that wants to get as much advertising and exposure as it can so of course they'll try to compete for every award possible. That doesn't mean they are entitled to. 

Call it misguided french snobbery if you want but the french believe that when it comes to culture, the market doesn't decide everything. &&I don‚Äôt think Netflix has actually produced any films of worth (bought and ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù is a slightly different story) but this is still a dumb rule. Might as well have a block for HBO films too, one of which happens to be a Palme d‚ÄôOr winner. &&I don't get it. They're banning Netflix films because of the medium they're delivered on? Did I miss the rationale in the article 'cause what was explained didn't make sense to me.&&I just returned from France on film-related business. Went to Le Grand Rex. They take this stuff seriously there.&&They don't allow direct-to-dvd films there, why should netflix get treated as more important because they release them online?&&Let's pretend a Netflix film won Palm D'or... Think of the backlash. Cannes wouldn't be promoting a film, they would be promoting a business. It becomes free advertisement for Netflix. I actually don't understand why we would be okay with this. I think Cannes made the right call.

If Netflix played their films in theatres or allow their films to be watched in any other way, it's a different story. But the truth is, if a Netflix film won a prestigious award at any major festival, it's never promotion for the film itself, it just means more subscribers for Netflix.

Here we are complaining about Facebook and privacy issues, but you're saying we should give Netflix more power so they can slowly become a film monopoly? I like Netflix and all, but including them in festivals is promoting a tech company, not cinema.&&Such a shame because Bright 2 was going to clean up for sure.&&I found it is kinda weird that they banned it because Netflix release them not through movie theater and yet many oscar voters watched the nominated movies at home with screener version.&&I don‚Äôt think they should be banned but I do think Netflix needs to improve the quality of their original movies before they can be taken seriously. I also honestly feel that sitting at a TV or laptop to watch a movie on Netflix will never be as good as going to the cinema &&Netflix should give her own awards, with blackjack and hookers.&&""A lot of studios today would rather just make branded, tentpole, guaranteed box office hits from their inventory of branded successful movies than take chances on smaller films. Those smaller films that studios used make routinely are now going to Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix. Television is really thriving with quality and art. But it poses a clear and present danger to film goers.
But in fact, once you commit to a television format, you‚Äôre a TV movie. You certainly, if it‚Äôs a good show, deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar. I don‚Äôt believe the films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination""
-Steven Spielberg

So the studios are taking less risks on ""art"" films, yet he thinks Netflix, Amazon, etc shouldn't get an academy award for making a film (that you just said wouldn't be made by the big studios)



&&Okja, Meyerowitz, and Beasts of No Nation were all incredible films worthy of awards. I think this whole shutting out of Netflix is a kind of snobbery of the cinema world that will ultimately play against them in the long run. It's essentially saying, we don't care how good a movie is, if you don't show it in cinemas, you're not entitled to an award consideration.

The Academy Awards in particular are supposed to be a celebration of the art of film, but if you shut out Netflix and other streaming services purely because they don't release in cinemas, you're shutting out an ever increasing market, ultimately penalising the artists who Labour on these works to simply keep hold of an awards tradition that started way before there were even televisions in every home.

The cinema experience will always be important, but something that refuses to change with the times is always destined to be cast into the ash heap of history.&&>Steven Spielberg doesn't think Netflix movies should be allowed to compete for Academy Awards.

Right.

>""A lot of studios today would rather just make branded, tentpole, guaranteed box office hits from their inventory of branded successful movies than take chances on smaller films.""

Your latest film is an adaption of probably the most popular science-fiction novel of the last decade, and the screenplay was written by the guy who writes movies for Marvel. 

This is Cannes taking a stance that will reduce them. And Spielberg should know better. The medium of delivery is unimportant.&&Good&&Like mentioned before Cannes is a film market selling distribution rights and where people go to get funding. Who cares if Netflix can‚Äôt show their films that already have funding and distribution via Netflix. They just want to do it for publicity for their films. The should instead be trying to pick up movies at Cannes that may not have big backers already. &&I guess it depends on how much you support exhibition and the theatrical window.  I personally think movies should be released in movie theaters. Netflix does not agree in an exclusivity window for theaters, so I don‚Äôt support their distribution model for new releases.  

The French exhibition community thinks that they should get first whack at movies that premier at the Cannes Film Festival.  This makes sense to me.  

If Netflix wants this to change, they should support a theatrical window. &&Some of the film industry are raging hard against that huge shift that is certainly coming in the way people want and do consume film and tv. Cannes is just making itself more and more irrelevant.

The idea that it's t.v. doesn't really make sense because nothing on Netflix is broadcast. A tv is just how some people view it but it's not 'television' in the sense they are using it.

A film is a film regardless of how it's distributed, these are just the decisions of industry elitists that don't like where the industry is going.&&Obvious, bullshit platform discrimination. Let art be art in sake and sense of appreciation. A contest loses all its validity if it isn't all-form considering.&&First they ban you

It's the core of what they do -- it's why you can't even get on their red carpet without a bow tie. Netflix is democratic but is movies on mobile, in your one, AWAY from the theater.

It's a shitty, pompous and pretentious town and event. &&What elitist garbage, calling them ""TV movies"" as if they are somehow lesser because of it. &&Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories were two of the most hyped movies there last year. This will only further make this festival one of the ""elite"" gatekeeping that people hate about the film world.

Also should ban Amazon movies then, because Wonderstruck was at Cannes and I swear that didn't get a theatrical release.&&People seem to be super upset by this, and yet, i haven‚Äôt seen a single noteworthy netflix original that has potential to win an oscar. I might be forgetting some obvious ones but literally nothing comes to mind&&I haven't seen any great Netflix movies yet, but they are surely capable of making worthwhile entertainment, so it seems a bit pretentious to completely rule them out.

The blockbuster movie in a theater is still viable. It still happens, and it will keep happening for a while. And that's cool. But the landscape has changed. The big studios and networks no longer have control of the market. And in turn, awards shows and events are becoming increasingly irrelevant to people.

The Academy Awards are tanking worse every year, nobody except the entertainment press and studio marketing has ever cared about the Golden Globes. Cannes is just a way of saying: We serve crackers instead of toast.

Shows and competitions are less and less important now that content and its delivery systems are so diverse.

Half the point of Cannes is the film market, and a big reason a lot of filmmakers want their work there (beyond just the prestige itself) is to get their films seen by distributors for international markets. If a Netflix film is there, it's just not participating in that aspect of Cannes at all - it's not going to be screening almost anywhere in theaters, and its international VOD rights are probably already tied up. There's just no point in having them around except to advertise that they exist and let them get watched by the Cannes crop of critics.

People think this is a snobbery thing first and foremost, and while that may be part of it, there are other considerations, as well.&&[deleted]&&I think part of the point of the film festival is to recognize movies that *might not* get recognized.

Netflix could easily make the Emmy's the most coveted award for a movie maker.  &&It may or may not, but the if Cannes wants to be about ‚Äúmovies released in theaters‚Äù that‚Äôs not that weird. 

The converse of this would be the Grammys say  not making awards eligible to performers who don‚Äôt make album and only play live. Of course, that is what they do and no one thinks it‚Äôs weird. &&They require every film to be released in French in a French theater. Just because an internet screening company is releasing really long internet movies doesn't mean they should be accepted in a festival for theatrical films.&&>Films should be judged on merits, not how they are distributed

They are judged on merits by critics.&&[deleted]&&I completely agree &&Literally in the article ""The Netflix people loved the red carpet and would like to be present with other films.""&&And neither does 99% of their viewerbase&&Kinda disagree. Amazon winning Best Drama for Handmaids Tale was a huge feather in their cap. General acclaim and award recognition is something Netflix really are interested in, especially when dumping huge money into films The Irishman from Scorsese.

Edit: Huluuuu&&then why did they bring their movies to this and others festivals?&&Why are they so desperate for an oscar then?&&It‚Äôs basically a market for them. They‚Äôre probably gonna still buy a ton of movies from Cannes anyway &&I believe cinema in France is called ""le septi√®me art"" or the 7th art form. I believe they stopped at 9, where 8 was television (took a loooong time to be considered an art) and 9 was comics (the French have a strong love of comic books as a form of political commentary and treat them much more like art than the US does in my experience).

Needless to say, there is a lot of prentiousness in the art community, but that is due to them trying to maintain it as a bastion of French culture, like the language and social advocacy &&Elephant got a theatrical release though. That's what Cannes cares about. &&> Might as well have a block for HBO films too, one of which happens to be a Palme d‚ÄôOr winner. 

Which one would that be?
&&I'm yet to see a Netflix movie that's better than a 7. Beasts of No Nation has been their best film to date.&&Icarus is phenomenal &&Um, Okja?&&> I don‚Äôt think Netflix has actually produced any films of worth


They're also just getting started. &&As I saw it (plus reading comments), a three point explanation:

1) They're banning Netflix from being eligible for awards, not from screening their movies at the festival. The ability to receive awards makes a difference to the why of it.

2) Part of the point of the Cannes awards is for filmmakers that *could* find the money/budget to make their film, but *were not* able to align themselves with a company capable of international distribution, to do so. Basically a ""let the finished product you didn't look at before speak for itself"" retribution moment to hit theaters worldwide.

3) Netflix is already its own version of international distribution (even if movies don't always air in all available markets). So to give the award to a Netflix movie is basically giving it to a movie that already achieved the awards goal.

**TL;DR** - It's not about the medium vs. the range. Anything Netflix submits is already in potential global distribution. The point of receiving a Cannes award is to find/get global distribution. So Netflix should be there to buy movies, not submit movies for awards and acclaim it doesn't need.

Might not be 100% correct, or maybe there's some subjective assessment included, but at least their decision makes more sense in this aspect. 

As per the beginning of the article, I have to disagree with Spielberg and his Oscar assessment. If a low budget underdog can compete for best picture/writer/etc. against big budget showings, it should be solely about the art, who cares what screen you see it on...&&I'm not in the film industry so I dont know what I'm talking about, but my intuition tells me this decision might be a little short sighted. Direct to DVD movies are a little different from the work being done at Netflix, the budget itself should be considered. But I also think the future will show Netflix and other home viewing options directly producing theatre quality films, in fact, similar to Amazon, the direction of removing producers (ie publishers) might bring more media to the market. It may even be a future where theatre movies are instantly available for home streaming. So excluding Netflix now will only result in a retraction some time in future or a different type of award celebration that eclipses Cannes. &&[deleted]&&You make a very convincing argument in your first paragraph. I'm glad I read your comment. I thought my opinion on this was pretty much set in stone, but you changed it. &&Why does it matter who made the film if it was deserving of the award?

If Cannes is truly about the media, that wouldn't matter. But ultimately, it's not about film, it's about protecting the theaters--which Netflix makes obsolete.

Netflix isn't even close to a monopoly and is actually facing an extreme amount of market friction due to the film industry owning critics, the awards, and theaters. They refuse to innovate in distribution strategy and are trying to squeeze Netflix out as a result. &&Are movie studios that different?&&I'm sure they'll have no problem promoting a french film monopoly. it's all about the money and a guild protecting its own. &&How does this make any sense? Every film is funded, directed, acted in, (etc) by some people, and every award for a film is an advert for its entire crew.

Why is advertising Netflix by giving them an award any worse than advertising the Weinstein company by giving those films awards? Or giving a director advertising by giving their film an award?&&[deleted]&& I'm not sure I follow.  Netflix shouldn't be allowed to compete because even if (hypothetically) their film was good enough to win the fact that it's only available on their platform turns the festival into a business promotion rather then a film promotion? 

I also disagree with the last half of your second paragraph.  If a film wins an award it is a promotion of the film itself.  While the film is only available through one service does mean that Netflix would see a direct increase in subscriptions because of increased interests in it's films this is not the same as cannes putting out a statement saying that Netflix is awesome.&&But that's on the viewers not the distributors. &&Oscar is a different award, Cannes give out Palme d'Ors.

Cannes being a cinema festival is kinda the whole point of it.&&Most do watch them in theaters, studios just send out screeners anyway just in case.&&If the streaming services all get shut out of these big ceremonies, there's no doubt they will establish their own at some point.&&> A lot of studios today would rather just make branded, tentpole, guaranteed box office hits from their inventory of branded successful movies than take chances on smaller films

This is a hell of a sentence to say in the middle of an interview promoting Ready Player One.
&&Spielberg movies have been shit for a long time. I have a strong feeling that RPO is going to be shit too.&&There's stuff at Cannes worse than most Netflix originals every year.&&Wonderstruck did have a theatrical release&&I think the reason Amazon doesn't get attacked as often as Netflix by these institutions is that Amazon still does a classic theatrical release, whereas Netflix does not. 
&&> Also should ban Amazon movies then, because Wonderstruck was at Cannes and I swear that didn't get a theatrical release.

So far, EVERY Amazon film has had a theatrical release. That's part of their model and it's a good one. 

***Manchester By The Sea***, a film made for just $9M, made $47M from domestic alone before it headed to Amazon Prime (it was also released on home video, where it undoubtably did well after getting two Oscars). 

Meanwhile, reddit's sacred cow Netflix won't let you have the option of renting ***Mudbound*** and instead forces you to subscribe to their service to see it (if you aren't in the industry - they rained discs attempting to get awards this year). &&Yeah, same with Spielberg talking about how Netflix movies shouldn't receive an Oscar. They need to get with the times, or else they'll be left in the dust.&&Absolutely. And unfortunately Netflix won't be taken seriously until it has its own Citizen Kane.&&That doesn't mean they're not movies, or not worthy of awards. A good movie is a good movie, whoever the producer is.&&Aren't movies in cinemas also promoting a platform? A platform where you have to sink way more money into to get less?&&Nah, I just find it lacks the sheer enjoyment factor of going to a movie theater. MoviePass has been the best service I‚Äôve ever subscribed to.

 I barely even load up Netflix anymore when I‚Äôm at home.&&I absolutely agree with that assessment. Netflix is designed to be watched at home on small screens. TV is the best comparison for what Netflix does/is&&It‚Äôs a film festival to help movies find distributors. It‚Äôs not a trade show for distributors to promote their products. &&Yeah.  Cannes is trying to pull a power move, but is really hammering the nails in its own coffin.&&they are very protective of artists, film makers especially included (See:polanski). The goal is to stop film from turning into TV and keep cinema a large part of the cultural landscape. Not the priorities I would have, but not inherently stupid.&&As is tradition for the French. 
&&Not necessarily stupid, French culture is very different. &&The French imitate no one, and no one imitates the French. &&yknow the OPera browser has a half assed vpn that for some reason fools Netflix?&&Is that because Netflix concedes to their demands and distributes them through French cinema, or because Netflix just gives France crap options as retaliation?&&Moved to France in December, had to get the Fire stick going through a VPN but massively improved Netflix content. Does really suck.&&Chappie no crimes!&&Go sleepy weepy!&&Do you want piracy? Because that's how you get piracy.&&France takes culture seriously, so has some regulation which doesn't exist in other places. Cinema production is subsidised with a tax on cinema tickets. Radio and TV needs to play a percentage of French content. Other cultural products are also subsidised.

The [""Media Chronology Law""](http://www.ifta-online.org/media-chronology-france-2017) is the specific regulation that sets out the time frames for Cinema to video, TV, VoD, SVoD etc. Most recently agreed in 2010  or so, [but a review is promised](http://deadline.com/2017/05/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidential-election-reactions-trump-hollywood-1202086351/). The idea is that by exercising these controls, they can better ensure that the various format releases also contribute back to the subsidy and encourage production.

It has this strange characteristic at the moment that a pay VoD service, you only have to wait 4 months after theatrical release, but for Streaming VoD, it's 3 years. It's probably just a reflection on the power of SVoD in the market at the time of the latest agreement. Things have moved on, so it's likely there will be a change.

It's significant that France does have a bigger local film production, and a greater market share of local content than other European nations, where US content tends to dominate. So if their aim is to have a local industry that produces locally relevant content telling French stories, then they do seem to be having some success there.&&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_exception&&$$,$$,$$$&&Contrary to what other commenters are implying, this is not a move by capitalists to make more monnies. The state is literally interfering in the free market, so I don't know how they got that idea in the first place. Anyway, it's about protecting the national movie and tv industry. Money is involved, but it's about keeping some money in the hands of french media so french people can produce french things for french audiences. 

It's a protectionist move. And when looking at how influencial american media conglomerates are, and how shit their lowest-common-denominator output is, that's maybe not such a bad idea.

Edit: typos&&
Cannes is a festival for cinema movies, organized by that industry.

As it always has been.

&&Saw The Shape of Water last week and it was a blast. It's the kind of movie that benefits from a big screen i guess&&Beasts of No Nation is a solid movie&&I believe they actually picked up independent films that screened at Sundance too. &&yeh i know. but when you produce content and you send it to festivals it is usually to find a distributor. they are their own distributor. &&i still don't know which n is silent&&Some of their plaques still say Canes.&&The average movie goer doesn't know much about movies. Good thing there are people who aren't average movie goers. &&[deleted]&&I posted it a bit below, but usually [Google Translate](https://translate.google.fr/#fr/en/Cannes) is pretty good at giving out the correct pronounciation (Speaker icon). I checked this one and it's correct.&&""can"" . nailed it&&Many films have distribution lined up pre-screening at Cannes, and they are still considered for awards. &&> I doubt average movie goer cares about Cannes

Yep. And Cannes doesn't care about the average movie goer. If they did Zack Snyder would be sat at home right now admiring his three Palme d'Ors &&Well presumably the terrible Netflix films aren‚Äôt the ones we‚Äôre  talking about here. It‚Äôs the good ones.&&France in particular is very protective of cinema. And cinemas. 

The thinking is that if the movie industry becomes truly globalised it will just be dominated by the lowest common denominator. Which means mainstream films, made in America, in English. &&Why is this such a hard concept?&&It's not a good or bad thing. It's just a thing. I don't think anyone's arguing you should cater to everyone all the time. Nothing works like that. What people seem to be arguing is not to just dismiss the majority of people because they aren't as 'refined' as you. 

Films are films. Some are high brow, some are low brow. Some are in-between. I don't think any should be dismissed outright just because they don't match someone's specific tastes.&&They're getting banned because they don't participate in the business aspect of an event that most people think is just about art.&&Now that's the kind of insight I was missing here. Now it makes perfect sense. Thank you!&&But if that were the only case, shouldn't tons of other movies that already have distribution worked out not be allowed to show there? It seems more like an excuse that makes sense than a consistent idea that the festival is striving for.&&I think you explained it way better than Spielberg did.&&Then why not just ban all films that already have distribution?&&>I mean to a certain degree there's a pretty coherent economic rationale for not allowing Netflix films independent of any idea of the quality of the films.

And so clearly the logical choice is to then allow the films to take up slots, but just disqualify them from awards. /s

Seriously, the Cannes folk are cutting their own legs off. You're correct that they'd actually come off as *less* dickish if they banned Netflix stuff outright and publicly admitted that they're doing so to maximize the number of distributor-hunters they can toss up on the screens.

Then of course people would start grumbling about how many fix-is-in well-connected projects are allowed in...and not without reason.&&There's no point to having good films in a film competition if they already have financial backing? It should be about the best film. If your film is good enough it will be played and shown to distributors.&&Wait a moment is it fair to say that a Netflix film should be snubbed because they don't participate much in theater releases on one hand when the theater business actively snubs them from doing much on that end too?

Does it not just become the latest brick in the wall to keep out netflix that the film industry has been trying to build up?&&It's effectively just insulating themselves from the competition. Theaters are already suffering due to streaming. The last thing they need is for a Netflix original to win at Cannes. &&But loads of the films screening in competition already have their rights all locked up in all regions. No buying going on. So by that rationale in isolation Netflix should still be allowed in comp. &&Seriously, I came in with one opinion about this snub, and now you've made me rethink my position entirely. Great comment. I never thought about it from this perspective, just the art of it. &&> I had a film get in a long time ago, the point of going there is to meet distributors and make connections.
  
Would you agree that having Netflix there would result in Netflix snapping up a ton of finished films and directors?  Seems to be the problem, to me.&&Not if they're ineligible to even be considered based on how they're distributed. &&Wow nice job getting that username. What a beauty.&&I don't see the distinction. Any great film should be considered, regardless of who produced it. &&I can see the value of having anything in festivals.  By their nature they are there to bring attention to movies that would get passed over.  Netflix getting free advertising would never be seen as a bad thing... though it would be a cherry on top missing rather than a harmful blow.&&That was a quote from the guy who runs Cannes. It's not proof that Netflix cares about prestige.&&I mean look at all the netflix users that are mad about this&&I think the lack of concern is mostly due to the obscurity of the festival. 

Cannes isn‚Äôt like this big televised event that everyone can participate in to some degree, like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. To most people *‚Äùit‚Äôs a film festival that happens in some far-off place that movie experts go to and presumably plays movies that are like indie or something.‚Äù* Most Netflix users/people don‚Äôt even know it exists. Netflix wouldn‚Äôt get a ton of attention for winning anything there and most users wouldn‚Äôt find out anyway. 

It helps the artists and producers get noticed by other artists and producers, but that‚Äôs about it. But Netflix can still screen there, so the big fish could still possibly peep them little fish. But the only thing the general public ever sees is that little backwards Caesar tiara stamp that states an obscure accolade, and most don‚Äôt care. 

&&wrong&&Handmaid's Tale was Hulu.

Amazon won best comedy a few years ago for Mozart in the Jungle.

Just a small correction. I don't disagree with the point you're making.&&Cause that one isn't a film festival, it's a flat out awards show. Most of these others, sundance, cannes, etc. have a massive amount of screenings, which purpose is to get the filmmakers movies out there. With Oscar's, there are no screenings, just the awards and if you win one, it's a great marketing tool. Icarus won the best documentary and immediately afterwards it was on the front page with  the title of ""The Academy Award Winning Documentary"" and you can bet your ass that it increased it's viewership. I'd assume the same happened with Mudbound, but I wasn't on netflix when the nominations, but I bet if people saw ""Nominated for four academy awards"", it would gain people's interest, that hadn't bothered before.&&This is not exclusive to France, and 8th is photography btw. Television series are elongated films seen in a small screen, not quite another medium.

Edit: Also they invented cinema, so it should not be surprising it's important to them.
&&There's been a share of Netflix films that have played in theaters, too. *Elephant* barely got a theatrical run to begin with. And for that matter, some of the HBO films they've had in competition never even screened outside of Cannes. That's not including plenty of other TV movies that have been played in competition. 

They don't really care about the ""theatrical release"" so much as they care what Netflix's impact on moviegoing itself is. I'm sympathetic to that idea, but that doesn't make their rule a good one. The attempts to make distinctions between ""TV movies"" and ""real movies"" is a very dumb one. &&Elephant&&Loved okja, but yea id give it 8, 8.5 at best. And I think netflix just distributed it (?)&&Did you watch Mudbound and The Meyerowitz Stories? Those are both at least an 8 out of 10.&&The Ritual was great. Other than that I agree.&&Not yet but they're starting. Just like how they did with tv series. The Irishman will probably be the start. &&Disagree on Mudbound. If the Weinstein Company released it 3years ago it would have been an Oscar favorite,. &&Meyerowitz Stories is a masterpiece, and one of their acquisitions that played at Cannes.&&Doesn't really matter. Don't confuse the artistry as being of Netflix, all they have to do is hire the right people and they can win awards months later if they wanted to. And they probably will sooner than later. &&What, you don't think *Bright* was worthy of a Palm d'Or? Or being spammed in the fucking Netflix window every five seconds? &&> I have to disagree with Spielberg and his Oscar assessment. If a low budget underdog can compete for best picture/writer/etc. against big budget showings, it should be solely about the art, who cares what screen you see it on...

Not to mention, Oscar voters are watching these films on private screens anyway, often in their own homes.&&Spielberg is saying tv is a different medium and there needs to be a distinction. Not less than theatrical movies, just different. If any streaming movie is eligible for an Oscar then any movie should be able get an Emmy just because it played on HBO.&&TL; DR TL; DR: Netflix should be at Cannes to buy not pitch.&&Sorry but your first point about dvds is wrong. Netflix buys a lot of movies that studios have decided not to release (cloverfield paradox, ritual, etc) which is the equivalent quality of DVD films. They do release the odd quality original production, but there's a huge volume of garbage that they put out, too. I think Cannes recognizes that side of it for what it is, and is reacting accordingly.&&> Direct to DVD movies are a little different from the work being done at Netflix

Right. Direct-to-DVD films are expected to have at least a modicum of quality. &&HBO releases the movies and documentaries it shows at Cannes in theaters. The head of the Cannes festival said of Netflix: 
>‚ÄúLast year, when we selected these two films [Bong Joon-ho's Okja and Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories], I thought I could convince Netflix to release them in cinemas. I was presumptuous, they refused.‚Äù  
 
&&It's not the same thing. How many people even know which movies have been done by Miramax, Sony pictures classics, Janus films, etc. No one. Whereas people do know what Netflix has done because they stamp their little ""originals"" sign on the poster.&&Not the same.  People go to Cannes to buy and sell films.  Mirimax could sell distribution rights to other attendees, and increased theatrical showings support their businesses by generating profit for everyone in the chain.   Netflix isn't selling.  Netflix films doing well doesn't support theaters and distributors if they don't show their movies in theaters which despite being asked by Cannes they refused to do.  &&It looks like shit. The trailer looks awful.&&Maybe they should ban Vincent Gallo while they're at it&&Yeah, the reason why there isn‚Äôt such a big deal over Amazon‚Äôs film studio is because they are playing by Hollywood‚Äôs rules in terms of how they release their films - whereas Netflix is directly challenging what has been considered the standard in the industry for decades. &&I mean, a months subscription to Netflix is cheaper than 1 movie ticket in most areas and certainly cheaper than 1 movie 'experience'.&&Netflix cost like 8 dollars.&&How are they hammering the nails in their own coffin? Cannes will do just fine without showing Netflix films. There are plenty of other films released every year, there's no shortage. 

I'm not saying it's a good decision but it's really not gonna hurt them.&&Cannes is about artistic movies, not mass appeal ones.

They couldnt care less if they show stuff that isnt well know, chances are they enjoy being snobby and it makes the festival more relevant to its audience.

Which isnt the blockbuster crowd that gets hyped about MCU and whatnot.&&Not something that need sto be legislated. We shouldn't be legislating art.&&[deleted]&&Maybe if seeing films at the theatres wasn't bordering on luxury in some countries when it's 25 plus a ticket and adding in drinks etc. &&I find it inherently stupid whenever anyone government or otherwise tries to keep culture frozen in one perpetual state. There's a lot of things about the French to like. This is not one of them. &&Opera won't have 1080p content though..&&Just downloaded Opera and enabled the VPN, but I still get the same library. Any particular trick? &&Wow man, thank you. Searching for a free VPN ""just for Netflix"" since they changed their mind about proxies and VPN.&&It's because there's a mandatory 36 months waiting period between the cinematic release and the streaming release. France has plenty of these regulations on media, and my instinct is to hate them, but in fairness they do have the best market in the world for independent cultural products, and they maintain healthy cultural industries, including a film industry, on a scale that their similarly-sized neighbors haven't managed in 50 years.

The Italian film industry basically went to shit in the 70s, Spain has a few good directors, but they mostly work abroad, Germany does a good film a decade, and it has done so since the 50s. There are like 10 good French films each year.&&I thought netflix banned VPNs. Are they suddenly working again?&&Loved this reply!&&> Radio and TV needs to play a percentage of French content

Similar to laws in Quebec as well. 



&&Canada has simmilar laws and regulations, but because of the close proximity to hollywood and the relatively massive size of the media industry here, so much of the ""Canadian Content"" produced here has very little (if anything) to do with the Canadian identity- which is what the laws that exist are trying to preserve. So even though it is a noble goal, radio stations can get away with playing top 40 because at least 25% of those songs are by Canadian artists, and cable broadcasters only have to play maybe 2 or 3 truly Canadian films or shows in their line up because a lot mainstream content actually counts as Canadian- especially when it comes to kids shows.&&What's the percentage of content has to be French? Is it a substantial amount? Does French content mean completely made in France?&&Not really cultural exception, it has more to do with media chronology. In france you have to wait up to 30 months for a movie to come on TV and 36 months for a paid streaming service&&I think you meant ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨,‚Ç¨‚Ç¨,‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨&&Everytime I think it must be more complicated than that.&&Exactly. It's very hard for other countries to compete in their domestic markets with domestic content because Hollywood is so successful and competitive. &&Strika didn't say a damn word and broke my heart.&&More than solid, I thought it was fantastic. &&I really enjoyed Okja as well. &&The middle one&&All of them. also the C and the S are silent.&&We pro pronounce it just like ""can"" in English.

So thanks for this&&You a real soulful dude. &&god tier joke&&You're getting downvoted but I think it's a fair point.  The ""average movie goer"" is why Netflix greenlights so many Adam Sandler movies, and why they'd get laughed out of Cannes if they actually entered competition with something like ""Bright"".  The average movie goer won't care about Cannes and Cannes isn't going to lose much sleep over appealing to the average movie goer.  &&So like Khan, right?&&That‚Äôs wrong.

They made a proactive effort to maintain barriers there.

Not the first time the French have done that in the face of American ubiquity I guess. &&Considering the cinema was born with France I would understand why they would be so protective of it‚Äôs traditional aspects. Hell French films are why we have the kinds of movies we have today&&> I don't think any should be dismissed outright just because they don't match someone's specific tastes.

Well that's kind of how you go about focusing on one portion of the market, so you're contradicting yourself a bit here. &&Netflix is a distribution method though.  Other films at Cannes could be picked up by Netflix.

Does Cannes not allow films that have already been sold from participating?  If so then this is at least in line with that.&&But of course it's not ~just~ about art and it doesn't actually make any pretenses that it is. This is just some weird assumption people have.&&Film festivals like award ceremonies are really promotional events. At film festivals financiers get a barometer reading of how the market will receive the film and buy distribution rights accordingly. Meanwhile the festival buzz serves to market the film to audiences. 

I don't know how anyone would think that it's ""just about art"".&&A lot of artists consider the cinema aspect to be crucial to their film. They abhor the idea of their movies being watched on smart phones. &&Bang on. Cannes is a trade convention for selling art.

After being to E3 a few times it was really interesting seeing how the event itself is much more of a trade convention behind the marketing facade. The fan/marketing side is great fun of course, but it's much more work than play once you've done a few laps of each hall.&&The Oscars has rules about theatrical releases too. The movie has to be run in LA for a week before going to DVD or VOD.

It's about keeping the artistic side of mass market cinema alive.

Nothing about that makes anyone a sell out, it's not like you can make one of these things for free anyway.&&They don't need to participate in the business aspect, they've already been bought and distributed, on netflix.  What's the point?&&Film award shows and film festivals are just a massive circle jerk between people of the industry.&&Films that do already have distribution deals will show at Cannes, sure, but there's probably room to get them *more* distribution, theatrically and on VOD, in more territories. With Netflix films, this is most often not the case, and all the sales agents that depend on Cannes as a huge part of their year don't like that. &&Spielberg isn't talking about marketing.

He thinks there is a distinct difference between films made for the big screen and films made for TV.  He thinks Netflix original movies should be getting Emmys, not Oscars.

I don't know if I agree with him or not but it's not a ridiculous argument. &&Generally, films showing at a festival like Cannes don't already have their distribution all lined up yet.&&Probably not, a lot of films being bought and sold at Cannes aren't the type of shit that gets Netflix subscribers or viewers. Nobody has ever signed up for Netflix because The Clouds of Sils Maria is available even tho Kristen Stewart was the first American woman to ever win a Cesar for her performance in it.&&Sounds pretty judgy to me &&> Netflix getting free advertising

it wasn't free, they incur costs&&I think they're more upset at what they sense as a general feeling of pretentiousness and gatekeeping than they actively care about the festival.  &&Cannes is probably the biggest festival on the world along with Sundance. Festivals just aren't that relevant. &&Far off place? If that's what Netflix viewers think that France is some strange exotic country then that's more a judgement on their ignorance rather than Cannes being obscure. 

However, I do not agree with Cannes' decision, but more due to reasons mentioned above in this thread. Although from a business decision standpoint I can see where they are coming from. &&Ah, correct you are! Living in the UK Hulu is a complete non entity.&&But if you're on netflix you've already got distribution and a marketing campaign set, why should they take the place of a movie that needs it and wants to be put in a theatre?

An instant classic.&&They‚Äôre both great films, but Netflix didn‚Äôt actually make either of those. Those two were picked up for distribution after already being finished.

Although the new cloverfield blew ass.&&I don't think the Netflix specific part is doing that, but if France doesn't allow streaming within 3 years of cinematic release then I don't see why a smaller production would want to release there at all. Streaming has become there greatest source of exposure. Which means they don't go to Cannes. (From what I'm reading here. I'm just interpreting so if something is wrong here, please correct me.)

This should be obvious. &&i think it's mainly because people think of it as the film equivalent of an art show / exposition or whatever&&Arts is also commerce, and always has been.&&So it‚Äôs less a film festival and more a trade show?&&And yet, more and more cinemas are cancelling CC screenings. I had to drive 2 hours away to find a cinema that had a subtitle screening for Black Panther. I paid 150% as much as a standard ticket to get the little device, and I had to go at 2pm on an Thursday....

If they want me to see it in cinemas, how about make sure cinemas more accessible? 

Yeah, I totally understand how seeing it in the cinema changes the way the art is received. I can actually hear more in the cinema because the sound system is a) loud as fuck and vibrates the floor and b) usually set up optimally for that screening.

I don't remember Thor Ragnarok having a sound track, I watched that at home on a standard 2:1 stereo with my fully hearing boyfriend. Meanwhile I went home and actually bought the soundtrack to black panther after seeing it in cinemas because I actually got a feel for it and the movie definitely felt richer as a result.


But the soundtrack doesn't tell a movie, and without the subtitles during dialogue scenes I'd have no clue what was going on.

I love the stories, the visual, the characters and narrative choices, movies really are an art.

But it feels like an art form that is becoming increasingly more inaccessible to me, the more content we create the less work goes into distributing it as accessibly as possible. I remember when every DVD released in my country had to have subtitles, you were starved for content but the content you got was always accessible. Now, it will depend on the streaming service, the individual show, the individual content creator, etc. Some people even think that automatically generated captions are good enough for accessibility - they're not. 

And that's fine, I just have to accept there are some shows, movies etc that I'll never get to experience. But if I find a work around and manage to jerry rig a system so I can enjoy a new movie despite accessibility options, I don't feel like the artist gets to complain that I'm doing it wrong. 

And it's not just accessibility from a disability point of view, life commitments, finances, cinema proximity, it all effects how we are able to consume media 

I know I'll never get the full experience, and I've even had some friends who work in film and television tell me that unless the subtitles are a narrative choice, just having them on screen takes away from the visual art of movies - whatever, I'll watch it twice if the visuals are that important and the movie is that worth honouring as an art form.

Tell people the best way to enjoy your art, but then just let them have it.

That's the beauty and the sadness in art. At the time of creation it's deeply personal to the artist and he understands every nuance. But once it's published? It's the public's to enjoy and interpret as they see fit. Death of the author.

You may think the art conveys the artist's message best though cinema.

But if the audience gets the most pleasure from watching it on their iPhone, don't yuck their yum. &&> abhor the idea of their movies being watched on smart phones

Then they'll get left behind as others move ahead.&&If you think Sundance isn't about business you're crazy. Huge deals get made there every year, dude.&&Netflix already has a pretty good reputation the the quality of most of its original content, but getting awards and recognition for their films would attract more people to their service.

I would agree, but only if oscar voters could only vote in categories where they saw every single movie nominated in a theater. ;)&&However - we are not far from having the screens that are like transparent wallpaper and so people will be able to have screens the size of the largest wall in their entertainment room. The technology is already there it's just currently not cost effective.

Compare a tv from 10 years ago to a uhd 4k tv today and think where we will be in ten years. I think the movie industry is being very short sighted when they talk about the different experience between watching at home or at a cinema - the gap is always closing.

And while I'm ranting I remember when all tv's used to be 4:3 pretty much every movie seemed to be made in 16:9 so you always had a distorted picture or black bars. So the tv industry moved to 16:9 And everyone spent a lot of money upgrading their tv's so what did the movie industry do? They said fuck you and started filming in 1.85:1 or 2.39:1 twats.&&A movie like Dunkirk is designed for watching in a theater. It's still really good on a TV, but it's a fantastic experience in a movie theater.&&Generally but why exclude Netflix?

But this seems very specific. &&This is absolutely true because I‚Äôve never once heard of a Cesar award so that would mean zippitty doo da to me.&&I mean... a lot of Netflix watchers are American because there are a lot of us and it started here.

Those two were picked up for distribution after already being finished. 

This is why I have a mild problem with the ""Netflix Originals"" label. I get why they do it, but it's misleading in that implies Netflix is producing this content when in fact, often they're simply buying the rights to a movie.

I'd rather see a ""Netflix Exclusive"" tag added to differentiate between their own productions and movies/TV that they are merely distributing (such as Annihilation outside North America, or The Cloverfield Paradox).&&Not sure why you‚Äôre getting downvotes, that destination is extremely important if we‚Äôre taking about film festivals. &&I know I‚Äôm in the minority, but I don‚Äôt think Netflix has figured out how to make *anything* that‚Äôs traditional studio quality. &&Netflix doesn‚Äôt produce films internally at all. All they do is pick up distribution for other productions. &&Remember that Cloverfield was never a Netflix production.

Netflix bought it at a steep discount post-production because the studio didn't think they'd be able to turn a profit on it.&&Cannes is a film festival in the literal sense though. In a way it stops existing when it ""gets with the times"" because it's basically a festival for selling films for distribution to theatres. There's just no sense to them admitting streaming movies, streaming movies are already distributed.&&At this point, the quality of movies that Netflix has put out doesn't put it in the category of ""must have""... I have no doubt that they will get there someday, and they do have a few decent offerings, but they've also put out a lot of lackluster products &&I don't think Cannes is going to run into any issues by not having Netflix films. They've always been selective about what they allow. 

It's also not like Netflix is putting out award winning movies anyways; that isn't their goal. They want content for their streaming service to make sure they hold a value to you as a consumer.&&I remember a time when blockbuster video had all the power in the video industry. Times changed and they can change again. Movie awards like Cannes and Sundance are no longer necessary for many of the types of films that used to live or die by their reception there.  So, while you may have been intentionally dramatic, you may not have been as far off as you think.&&Kinda like the Oscars never nominating popular movies anymore, and viewership dropping like a rock. &&That's what it's always been&&That's not how it works, to win at Cannes you have to premier at Cannes&&What's the point then? Cannes is a festival built for selling films to distributors. If it isn't competing and it already has a distributor what is it doing there? Truth is Netflix movies don't really have a place at Cannes in the same way any studio movie doesnt have a place there. Its not built for them. &&I don't think there's a lot of overlap in their demographics.&&Honestly, it does kinda make sense. Traditional French culture is a major export for their economy.&&Bullshit. See Bollywood. The Indians don't have legislations like this and their movie industry is huge. &&I don't think either position is likely to be the best measure of what is ""good"". I just take issue with any group stepping on the free exchange of ideas. &&""360 extra lines of resolution"" is one way to put it... but 1080p is actually more than double the resolution of 720p, not that the content isn't more important.&&I know, I'm just stating so that people understand. &&The right choice is obviously move out of France because French Netflix sucks.&&It doesn't, it's designed to prevent a few big players from influencing the market too much, it doesn't have anything built in to select for quality.&&The real answer to this question is it's anti-trust (monopoly) legislation.

It's separation of studios and theatres that have allowed independent films to do well in France.

In the US [even Quentin Trantino got his film pulled from theatres,](http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2016/02/26/quentin-tarantino-vows-to-never-work-with-disney-again-after-star-wars-hateful-eight-theater-dispute) because Disney wanted Star Wars to run longer.

So, as I understand it, in France a studio has to offer it's film to cinemas on similar terms to be considered.

This means Independent cinemas can exist, which means smaller productions with merit can't get locked out of the market.

It also means less clout in one persons hands.

Netflix not offering it's originals for screening elsewhere at all is exactly the monopoly the French consider dangerous to the industry as a whole.

100% ownership, ""vertically integrated""  from production to consumption. 100% control.

No opening for competition to get a viewing if Netflix decide not to let it in.

In economics speak, vertical integration of an industry creates high barriers of entry for competition into the market.

How they react long term will be interesting as streaming is a hell of a spanner in the works.

I'm not convinced streaming will be as effective at capturing cinema goers as it has at capturing TV subscribers. It doesn't replicate the experience in the same way. Cannes is banking on that for now.&&Protectionism&&Can you elaborate?&&I guess so, but IIRC Quebec (French) radio/tv stations must have a higher percentage of French content according to CRTC. I might be wrong lol.

Netflix isn't really doing anything wrong here, but neither is Cannes. There's no inherent reason for Netflix to support Cannes and vice versa since their goals don't align and theoretically their business models clash (Cannes being theater focused while Netflix obviously stream focused). Also if you're a Netflix movie then you already have a distributor locked down, so bringing it to Cannes is redundant as one of the biggest reasons to have your film at Cannes is to show it off to potential distributors.&&I'm pretty sure its elite beautiful people, lots of chic,slim french actresses, intellectual discussion and well-judged tears and standing ovations

Not because they feel dated, but because they just don‚Äôt have the same impact on a tv without an audience around you, and people forget that.&&I mean I expect it's a bit of a culture war, too, and the hugeness of Netflix makes the distributors and exhibitors who prop up Cannes uncomfortable. I'm just offering the more practical side of the argument here, because it does exist, but I don't pretend that Netflix isn't being singled out.&&You should broaden your horizons then, you may like what you find.&&In the UK, Netflix is really shitty about this. They label all sorts of things as ""Netflix Originals"" when it's actually just stuff that airs on US network TV but no channels in the UK have picked it up. They even go as far as inserting ""A Netflix Original Series"" in the title cards, which is bordering on false advertising. At least Amazon is a bit more honest about the distinction between its Originals and Exclusives, even if they do make the labels so tiny and indistinct that it's hard to tell the difference when you're skimming through them.&&Not even shows like stranger things?&&They‚Äôre starting to, actually. According to IMDbPro, they‚Äôre listed as a production company to these in development projects: Dan Gilroy‚Äôs Untitled Film, Noah Baumbach‚Äôs Untitled Film, Bright 2, The Week Of, The Dirt, The King, as well as a few others that are in production. They also produced the first Bright. I‚Äôm not a member, unfortunately, so I don‚Äôt have access to a majority of their backlog. Here‚Äôs the [source](https://pro.imdb.com/company/co0144901/).&&This is accurate. Their awards however will be diluted when something amazing is shown but can't win an award, then whomever does win the award knows it was maybe not deserving of it. &&Film markets, which is what you're talking about, and film festivals, are two different things. Practically, they're often the same thing, in that they both happen at the same place at the same time under the same name, but... They're different. Cannes exists as both, but it's largely *famous* for being strong on the festival side. They regularly premiere and promote films that already have distribution, and are famous for showing high quality non-tentpole films, not just films for sale.

So with this move, it seems to me, cannes is making a move to weaken their festival side for the sake of strengthening their market side. Which is fine, if that's what they want to do.

Except mostly, I think that's not what they want to do. I think they're just mad at Netflix for intruding on what they think their business is, and changing things, and they don't fully understand what's happening and just want it to stop.

Basically, it's a bunch of old guys mad that kids today are wasting time with this newfangled technology, and not respecting the business, and also won't get off their lawn. &&Are films that already have theatrical distribution eligible for competition?
&&So does every studio, though... so I don't really see why it would matter that not everything Netflix puts out is A+ material.&&Netflix does have excelent documentaries, though. And it‚Äôs arguably a better platform than theaters for that kind of movie.&&Then why not accommodate if Netflix won't make the cut anyway? &&They've mastered the art of producing ""good not great"" content.&&I agree what the heck was up with that will smith movie?!

I liked war machine with brad pitt though one of my favourite movies of all time&&I disagree, they've had some solid movies. I've been pretty impressed with a few of them. 

Sure, they put out some that are more typical fodder, but that's the same as any other company. 

Beasts of No Nation was the first Netflix movie that made me realize how good their original content was getting. Plus, as their reputation for original content gets better they're more able to get big name actors, writers, and directors. &&Do Oscars not count as awards anymore? Netflix literally just won an Oscar. It also has several Emmys.&&Honestly, it they *do* consistently make award winning movies it will really succeed in guaranteeing me as a long term customer. A real reason why film festivals ban Netflix movies from competing is to send a message to film makers that if they want recognition, they shouldn‚Äôt go with Netflix which will continue to make them not being able to attract top tier film makers. 

A part of me am glad the festival made this clear cut ban though. I like Netflix but do wish they allow a theater release. As Spielberg said, a film is usually designed for theater first, TV second. Also a theater release in general means as long as you are willing to pay for a ticket, you can get access to the movie when it‚Äôs out on theater. Instead, Netflix just wants the movie *only* available on a locked in platform unless you buy the Blu-ray. At least Amazon does allow for a more traditional theater release first. &&I guess the distributors are he only ones that want to keep Netflix out.  They need the publicity from the festival. Netflix is taking away from traditionally distributed films.&&> It's also not like Netflix is putting out award winning movies anyways

lol?&&""confirming""&&There's a vaster culture and language barrier between USA and India than there is between USA and France. I recall some Indian redditor saying that in Indian soap operas good women wear Saris and villains wear Western clothing.

720p = 1280 x 720 = 921,600 pixels

1080p = 1920 x 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels

1,152,000 extra pixels.&&Yup, you don't have to tell me that. People worry about resolution too much when in reality it's the bitrate that makes more of a difference in image quality. 

A lot of people don't know that most movie theaters still screen films at 2048x858 (scope). The projectors max out at 2048x1080 unless your theater is nice and upgraded to 4k. But then you run into the problem about some (most) studios only deliver their movies at 2k (2048x858/1080) even if they filmed the movie at higher resolutions to keep delivery costs lower because guess what?.. Most people don't notice/care. 

Edit: I had to look it up but the max DCP bitrate that theatrical films are delivered in are 250 Mb/s. Which is a lot higher than your 15 Mb/s 4k stream from netflix, furthering the argument that bitrate is king when it comes to picture quality. &&Yeah but like, remember watching a 12 inch tube t.v. with a light glaze of static over the image because the bunny ears never got the perfect image and cable was barely available to anyone?

The rule makes sense now and I don't see a problem. &&I understand the redundancy of showing films that already have a widespread distribution, but the fact of the matter is twofold: 

1) Netflix and Amazon are being singled out with specific wording about methods of distribution, and 

2) Cannes already doesn't follow this philosophy in that every single year there are screenings of films that already have major distributions set in stone.

Spielberg and Cannes are just being hypocritical toward a growing trend in movie-watching.&&I always pictured a bunch of tents with poor college students.&&*gracias*&&> ""Best movie of the year that we allowed to compete in our competition"" diminishes the value of the award and, by extension, the overall festival.

But that's always what the Palme has been. It's just the best film in competition in the Cannes competition slate.

&&I know this is unpopular opinion but I agree&&It's because Netflix puts out almost no A+ material and a far higher portion of it's films are bad.

Christopher Robin Official Teaser Trailer,27858,82glqf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=425M4M3Opkk,2327,1520355632.0,,"Disney: ""Paddington Bear was amazing... are we blind? Deploy the Pooh bear!""&&Hearing Jim Cummings' voice as Pooh again was music to my ears.&&I'm curious to see how the rest of the Pooh characters will look. Especially Kanga and Roo who are my favorites. Maybe Disney might show more screenshots of the other characters in the coming months. If I remember correctly, I think Owl and Rabbit are the only characters that aren't stuffed like the others.&&Pooh: Hello there&&Ewan McGregor as a grown up Christopher Robin who has lost his sense of imagination gets reunited with the magical Pooh.  This is certain to be an emotional heartwarming tale.&&Hope this leads up to Paddington Vs Pooh.

&&Wow I was not ready to hear Jim Cummings' voice and now i'm in nostalgic tears&&I don't see why people are complaining he actually looks like a stuffed animal. We could have gotten some Smurfs abomination he looks really cute. Also I am 2 times excited now&&[deleted]&&This trailer greatly surprised me because I confused it with Goodbye Christopher Robin. Imagine my surprise when pooh appeared. 

This is much more like Hook and is based on the fictional Christopher Robin and is a ""sequel"" to the pooh books. &&Christopher Robiwan Kenobi&&Will be there day 1. Winnie Pooh has that magical childhood source that I never lost. To this day, I can connect with it and see it through innocent eyes. This made may day. Will be hard to dodge all other trailers to be go in without knowing anything else.&&Hook 2: Winnie the Pooh&&Oh, man, I teared up when I saw Pooh. It looks just like the one I had when I was a kid. I don't understand people who want it to look like Ted.&&Oh how I've missed you.

Please don't leave me again.&&Love Pooh's design. A wonderful mix between the animated, real toy and original illustrations. &&Disney *seriously* does ""from the studio that brought you..."" bits?

That is ridiculous.&&Jim Cummings just brings a smile to my face&&Damn it I haven't cried to a Disney movie since Lion King, but this may be it.&&[deleted]&&Was that Mark Gatiss I spotted in the beginning? Honestly love the look of Pooh though, looks like this movie is going to destroy me emotionally &&aaaaaaaaand I'm teary eyed...&&""From the studio that brought you...""

Fucking hell Disney, everyone knows who you are.&&Will be seeing this opening weekend. &&OH FUCK A POSSESSED BEAR!

This looks like it could be a cute film and it's nice to hear Jim Cummings voice Pooh again, I look forward to this.

EDIT- Also enjoying showing this to people who have no idea what it is and seeing their reaction when Pooh shows up. They get so happy.

It's nice hearing people's emotional reaction to the trailer, it's like rediscovering a forgotten friend which is perfect for this movie.&&Annnnnnd instant tears as soon as I hear Pooh's voice.&&What the fuck how am I already crying&&Shit's mad cute yo&&I'm getting teary eyed just thinking about all the fond memories I have of Pooh. This is going to wreck me. &&> This film is not yet rated

Yeah, I'm sure it'll be a hard R!&&[deleted]&&Gonna have to get used to Pooh actually looking like a stuffed animal. An impressive one, still.

Optimistic about this one. Good director/writing team.&&Im so thankful that pooh is still obviously a teddy bear and not like a cg real bear that happens to stand up right. Like this could have gone so wrong &&""A few wrinkles maybe."" Aww...I'm not crying! You're crying! Shut up.

Yes, Ewan McGregor, yesssss. Make me FEEL.&&Nope. You win Disney. I am tapping out on this nostalgia trip. As a 40 year old male who works a soul crushing 50 hour a week job who grew up on Winnie the Pooh I couldn't even get thru the trailer without tearing up. No way I make it thru a 90 minute movie. I will be crying more than the 3 year old sitting in the seat next to me. She will think it's cute, I will see Tigger and go into some sort of represt childhood flashback and lose my S#&! for the remainder of the movie. I will save this one for a night at home with a 12 pack of beer and some antidepressants.
&&MY EYES!!! &&Very excited for this after watching Goodbye Christopher Robin.  I really enjoyed that film a lot.&&Watching this just wrecked me. I lost my mom a few years ago to cancer. My whole childhood and life was revolved around Winnie the Pooh. My mom and I were best friends and she was always Pooh and I was always piglet. I know this scene was about Pooh and Christopher Robin but it brought back so many memories. I haven‚Äôt seen or read anything Pooh related since she passed. I think I‚Äôm going to have to wait to see this on DVD lol too much ugly crying for a theatre. &&I can already tell I'm going to end up crying watching this movie.&&The wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the only one&&""I've cracked...""

""You don't look cracked. A few wrinkles maybe""

Teeeeeeears&&I have two very big reasons why I love me some Hayley Atwell. üòè&&Careful, Pooh, Christopher Robin has the high ground.&&Oh you mother FUCKERS I am going to cry at this I guarantee it&&He's so cute! I'm glad they're went the route of making them look like real stuffed animals.&&Why am I so emotional seeing this stuffed bear again? I loved the show when I was younger. That voice. My Lord. I'm nearly 30. These feels.&&[deleted]&&It's Hook, but with Winnie the Pooh.  I'm a mess of happy emotions right now.&&Fuck it, I love it. I'll go see with bunch of other 30-somethings and we're gonna cry and laugh like little children.&&‚ÄúHuh, I wonder what this is? Wasn‚Äôt there a movie released about Christopher Robin not too long ago? Wait, is that Mark Gatiss? Oh, this must be that live-action Winnie the Pooh film CinemaSins were so adamantly against for some reason. To be honest, I‚Äôm just waiting for him to say ‚Äú‚ÄúOh, bother‚Äù‚Äù at some point ‚Äî hold on, was that Jim Cummings? Wait, are they doing what they did with *Book of Pooh* and having them as actual teddies‚Äî‚Äú

>*‚ÄùOh, I don‚Äôt see any cracks. A few wrinkles, maybe.‚Äù*

Dagnabbit, now I‚Äôm getting teary eyed.&&I couldn't watch this with audio at the moment, but it looks good. Very dreary teaser, and poor Pooh looks all washed it (which probably matches the tone of whatever is going on with the dialogue).

Pooh not having eyebrows is throwing me off a bit.&&Hearing that voice broke me down so fast. I‚Äôm gonna have to watch it alone so my fianc√© don‚Äôt see my bawling &&I'm glad Paddington has opened the door for other British comedy-dramas involving anthropomorphic bears. An underexploited genre.

In all seriousness, could be good.&&Anyone else think that Kanga low-key really had it going on?&&Right in the feels. 

That voice is chicken noodle soup for the soul and seeing Pooh so old and Christopher grown just breaks my heart...but they're together. :)&&I just want to say that I've been having a horrible few days and this has quite literally made my week. This is exactly what I needed to see right now.&&I can already tell this is going to make me cry.&&I love how pooh looks.&&Welp, I cried at like, five seconds of footage. This movie is going to make a mess of me.&&from the studio that brought you : Your entire childhood &&I know people are kinda thrown off by the Pooh design, but probably this is due to lighting and colour palette of the scene.

I bet later in the movie the palette will be better and Pooh and the others will look majestic. Also, let's have in mind that the VFX are probably not finished / not in it's final iteration.&&Why can't other studios approach beloved childhood classics with this some love and care? So much better than Smurfs or Peter Rabbit and the like&&Peter Capaldi as Rabbit is going to be amazing. As soon as I read he was voicing Rabbit I was super excited. He will nail it.&&The wonderfull thing about tiggers &&I didn't expect to actually tear up at this. I guess I didn't realize how long it's been since I've watched anything with Winnie The Pooh in it. &&I‚Äôm not crying at work.

I live in Florida.

It‚Äôs just allergies ;;&&I‚Äôm not crying, you are&&I wonder how long it'll take for /r/PrequelMemes to make a ""Hello there"" meme out of this.&&OMFG I can't believe it! 

I'm crying happy tears right now

I have always loved Winnie the pooh since I was a toddler. And even now I still love him as much at almost 30. When I was growing up I felt like he was the best friend anyone could ever have. Just a bundle of kindness and goofiness.

I'm so so incredibly happy that this is happening. I can't wait for it to come out.

I haven't been to the cinema in quite a number of years, but you can bet I'll be going to see this. On my own so I can fully indulge in my childhood love for Pooh Bear.

<3 

I needed this today &&""Could you make it ""now and now"" instead? That seems a bit better to me. Sora, if I go looking for you, will I find you?""&&That was so heartwarming, but I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm so scared to see the movie?? I just feel like it‚Äôs gonna be sad. Hopefully not tho. 

Can‚Äôt wait to see my boy eeyore :‚Äô) I loved him so much as a kid. I even had a stuffed animal where his tail came off.. and well, I lost it a lot lol. But I didn‚Äôt love him any less for not having a tail! &&Why did I start crying the moment I heard Pooh's voice? Dear lord. &&Omg

Wife literally teared up at the end

Definitely seeing this!&&That movie is going to produce some hardcore tears, man.&&""From the studio that brought you...."" Really? It's fucking Disney. We know you brought us everything.&&Pleasantly surprised by this teaser. This movie looks better than I expected. Pooh Bear is so cute - wonderful animation! I actually gasped when I first saw him. I'm not sold on the cast for the rest of the animals just yet, but hearing Jim Cummings still voicing Winnie the Pooh makes me more confident that the filmmakers' hearts are in the right place regarding their casting choices. His vocalization is just so special and iconic; replacing him now would have felt wrong. Cummings has been doing it longer now than the original Pooh Bear, the great Sterling Holloway.

I still believe Disney was trying to ride Paddington's coat tails when they started production on this movie, but hey, if *Christopher Robin* is even half as good as the Paddington movies or 2011's brilliant hand-drawn *Winnie the Pooh*, we're in for a real treat. &&I was listening to the Pooh's Grand Adventure soundtrack last week out of pure nostalgia... 

Hearing Jim Cumming's voice in this trailer gave me serious goosebumps... 
Can't wait for the movie!&&This looks so wholesome. Hearing that old Pooh voice after all these years was really something&&It's really incredible how just hearing Pooh's voice brings back that part of childhood&&With another soundtrack this could be terrifying.&&WHY AM I CRYING&&We stand amongst PADDINGTON'S achievement, not yours!!!&&This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!&&[launches Pooh bear from t-shirt cannon]&&Warm fuzzy nostalgia when I heard that voice. Excited to see this.&&Its like hearing the voice of an old friend&&I got chills. Such an iconic voice. He's been doing it since the 80s for the most part right? &&Made me insanely happy to hear him. Glad they went with him and not just some random famous celebrity like is typical in these live action/CGI hybrids&&Wow he even made Pooh sound a bit aged as well. Awesome. &&I legitimately just teared up a little bit. For just a fraction of a second, I was suddenly five years old again. What a wonderful feeling. &&I started tearing up when I heard him&&I love his Pooh voice so much.

I don't get why he doesn't also do Tigger, but I guess it's ok because I really like Chris O'Dowd&&It feels like home.&&Just play WoW, I'm leveling another character right now and Cummings voices at least one third of the voiced NPCs in the game.  &&I cried when I heard it. I basically grew up on Pooh*

Edit

A word
&&He also does Tigger and a million other Disney voices.&&I absolutely lit up when I heard him. I didn't actually think this was going to have character voices, I really thought this was going to be about Christopher Robin and I don't know. 

I didn't expect the voice and I am so happy. Pooh was a huge part of my childhood in the 90s so this sort of thing just means so much to me.&&Jim is the only celebrity I've ever met who I am consistently starstruck by.  He's a family friend and I've met him three or four times throughout my life, but I go completely blank whenever I've talked to him.  

I saw him in Westlake at the farmer's market a couple of months ago and could only manage to smile and wave.  He's one of the nicest, friendliest people I've ever met and is very down to Earth.&&I'm curious how Tigger is going to look considering his tail goes from floppy to spring-shaped constantly.&&I imagine character posters are around the corner &&Robin: General Pooh&&https://twitter.com/antovolk/status/971073835897323526&&I don't like honey.  It's thick, and sticky, and syrupy.  And it get's everywhere.&&Christopher Robin, now that's a name I've not heard in a long time.&&‚ÄúChristopher Robin, the Heffalumps are evil!‚Äù 

‚ÄúFrom my point of view the Woozles are evil!‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh bother. Well then you are lost!‚Äù &&General Kenobi. &&This is getting out of hand... now there are Pooh of them!&&A surprise to be sure but a welcome one&&Pooh got the ""Hook"" treatment&&The real Christopher Robin married his cousin and wanted nothing to do with Winnie the Pooh.&&The look on Christopher Robin's face when Pooh touches his wrinkles just cements how great an actor Ewan is. &&Reminds me of Hook&&Or Christopher Robin turned out to have schizophrenia and one day he decides to stop taking his meds. When his childhood hallucinations show up again Christopher Robin snaps and goes on a killing spree. 

Christopher Robin : 100 Hundred Arces of Blood

Rated R&&Big Fish is the only movie that‚Äôs ever made me shed a tear, and Star Wars Ep 2 but for an entirely different reason. McGregor is the only thing they have in common...&&I‚Äôm going to cry during this movie aren‚Äôt I? &&Reminds me of Hook, where Peter Pan (Robin Williams) is all grown up, and forgets all about Neverland. Still one of my favorite movies of all time. &&please don't make me choose between British bears.&&Paddington v Pooh: Dawn of Jelly (?)&&Dawn of Hundred Acre Woods

*SAVE KANGA!*

*WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME!?*&&The TBCU (teddy bear cinematic universe)

It starts with Paddington followed by pooh, with rupert the bear having a cameo at the end to talk about the ‚Äúbearvengers initiative‚Äù, with Old Bear and friends being part of phase 2.&&If *Christopher Robin* is even half as good as the Paddington movies, we're in for a real treat.&&So when does Clifford the Big Red Dog join the nostalgia cinematic universe?&&PVP

Paddington: You were never a god. You were never even a bear!

Eeyore: If Pooh is all-powerful He cannot be good, if Pooh is good He cannot be all-powerful.

Pooh: The honey was never real..&&weird thing is that paddington is an immigrant but has a british accent, whilst pooh is meant to a native teddy bear but has an american accent.&&Time to rewatch The Tigger Movie and Piglet's Big Movie for me. I really loved the climax where Roo has to wake up Tigger since he was unconscious in the middle of an avalanche. I never expected a Pooh movie to get that intense. I also really loved the scenes between Roo and his Kanga in The Tigger Movie and the bath scene in Piglet's Big Movie with Kanga cleaning Piglet. Seriously please check those two movies out. They will bright up your day and put you in a good mood.&&I was assuming they'd have him voice again but idk why it still hit me like a train. God damn goosebumps! Can't wait!&&I love how he sounds like an aged Pooh as well... it fits perfectly with the theme of the movie.&&I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one with a sudden outbreak of tears &&I love how he actually looks closer to the actual Pooh toy.&&Agreed, it is the Pooh bear we all got when we were kids.  And probably what it would look like after all the years of wear.  I like the look. &&I like the aesthetic but Pooh doesn‚Äôt move as expressively as I want. He still has that disembodied voice feel, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll be fixed in a few months.&&Yeah I think this is the best design to make it integrate with the real world without looking cheap or strange.&&As long as they can squeeze enough emotion onto his little face it'll be great. The way he said ""Christopher Robin"" sounded excited but he looked pretty plain-faced. I hope they don't limit his facial movements for the sake of realism.&&The cool part is that he LOOKS like a teddy bear that‚Äôs decades old like he is in this. The fluffiness is gone.&&Pooh touched Christopher Robin's face T_____T&&I‚Äôm crying again just reading that line. Thanks a lot. &&H E L L O T H E R E&&I was thinking the same thing. I'm okay with it. &&Bangara...oh bother&&This is definitely a movie that‚Äôs gonna cut the onions &&""You've... changed quite a bit,Pooh.""

""Hey, have ya ever heard a Boston girl have an orgasm? 'Oh Haahhhda, hahhhda.  I'm gonna go stuff my fuckin face with Pepperidge Faahhm.'""&&Same here. I wasn't even expecting to, but something about that voice, nostalgia, and the idea of a good man struggling through his adulthood being comforted by a lost childhood friend really hit me right in the gut.&&I was holding my breath for a CGI monstrosity to appear, but instead it was perfect.&&I don't think they want it to look like Ted but they expected more of a design similar to the cartoon. I did too but I actually think going with something more reminiscent of the actual bear and the books is best for live action.&&As soon as he showed up I wanted to reach through the screen and hug him!&&Seriously. And the title card even said ""Disney Beauty and the Beast"" like GEE I DON'T FUCKING KNOW WHICH STUDIO MADE THAT DISNEY MOVIE&&I was like, ""Is this a joke?"" But I wonder if they were trying to indicate that it was specifically the team of people that was responsible for Beauty and the Best?  &&From the studio that brought you ...

... Twice&&From the studio that brought you the Disney Film genre...&&From the studio that brought you...   
    
Literally fucking everything &&Pixar does it too.

The Coco trailer reads like:

*From the creators of Finding Nemo, Up, and Toy Story.*

I'm like ""no shit, mate""

But I suppose if audiences aren't actually in the know about who makes what movies, it's very helpful.

I have family and co-workers who will see Avengers trailers and ask why Batman or Wonder Woman isn't in it.

Or they'll be like, ""Secret Life of Pets is my favorite Pixar movie""

Some people just don't know, because it doesn't matter to them.&&Man, Coco didn't get to you?&&This isn't gonna be popular on this sub but man did the last Jedi get to me in the tears department &&...have you seen Up? That movie will wreck anybody &&Just like the simulations&&Yeah that was him. Peter Capaldi is in this movie too&&Disney isn't itself a studio. They own many studios.

Pixar is a different studio from Marvel, which is a different studio from the Burbank animation department, which is a different studio from the one that does their television shows, etc.

There is one studio, within disney, that has done all of these live action treatments of animated films.

They are letting us know it is **that particular** studio that is handling this.

I actually might have been more excited if a different Disney studio was handling it, as I've largely not been a fan of this particular studio's work. (Beauty and the Beast live action, Jungle Book live action, Maleficent, etc.)&&I had no real idea what this was about.  I know who Christopher Robin is and thought it was gonna be about how much he hated the book. When I heard Pooh speak and saw him tears welled up instantly. Then when he told Christopher Robin ""No, no cracks, although maybe a few more wrinkles."" I lost it. Turning 35 in May and just for a fraction of a second it felt like it was directed at me since the last time I watched Pooh was years ago with The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.&&I thought I remembered the name but couldn't quite put my finger on it. So I watched it and as soon as he said ""Oh dear oh dear oh dear"" it clicked AND THEN POOH TALKED AND I WONT LIE I'M A 24 YEAR OLD GUY AND I CRIED. 

I named my first ever cat Tigger and honestly I don't know if I can see this with a crowd of people. I already know I will cry when he shows up. &&It came up on my fb feed and didn't have a title. 

I thought it was going to be Mary poppins as I recently heard a new one of those was coming. 

Pooh's voice made me yell out and I nearly cried. My sister actually cried. 

What a trailer&&üòîüòî, only friend that never left us. And we left them behind.movie is gonna break my heart&&How fucked up will thos be when someone splices this trailer with Ted. &&I'm glad it wasn't just me.

I thought it'd be a *Saving Mr Banks* thing, y'know? The story of the writing of the original books. I got fucking confused when McGregor's kid was a girl instead of a boy, and then BOOM, WINNIE THE POOH RIGHT THE FUCK OUT OF NOWHERE.

I've spent the last ten minutes going ""WHAT?!"" and crying.&&Who else is curious to see what the rest of the gang will look like?&&God, I'm in the same boat..... is there anybody that grew up on Winnie the Pooh not crying at the mere sound of his voice in this movie&&I got serious goosebumps and my sister cried at the trailer. So, yea its probably gonna happen. My mom probably hasn't seen it yet, but she will cry her eyes out just at the thought of it. &&the casting for this film in general, is astounding. Ewan, Mark Gatiss, Hayley Atwell, Peter Capaldi -- so. excited.&&She needs to be in more stuff. She did get a pretty awesome gig as agent carter though. Brought her to the house of mouse and the mouse never forgets a good performance. &&An actual goddess&&Well, that was a biopic about the real christopher robin, this is a fictional movie about a character who shares his name.

He's also Tigger, Taz, Black Pete, chief Powhatan, Scar's singing voice, Monteray Jack, Darkwing Duck, Dr Robotnik, Hondo, and literally hundreds more.

He does voices in Baldurs Gate, Dragon Age Origins, Fallout 4, GTA5, Kingdom Hearts, Mass Effect 2, Minecraft, The Old Republic, Skyrim, Wow and tons more.

Isa good movie film. &&The dream&&Les Cousins Dangereaux&&Yeah, they just had that movie, Goodbye Christopher Robin, about how Christopher Robin's childhood was exploited by his parents and how he grew to hate Winnie the Pooh and the books. Not great timing for this film.&&I remember learning that he had almost no relationship with his parents and was wanted nothing to do with the book. I am not sure if the movie is going to be true to that...&&Winnie the Poe&&To be fair he loved his father and grew close to him (but became very distant from his mother), and enjoyed his father's legacy. I think he disliked how the popularity of Pooh made it seem like his father was a one-hit-wonder, when in reality he was a popular playwright and author before this (all of this was muddled during the two World Wars he was part of). He also hated business (despite opening a book store), and did not like the idea of the commercialisation of Winnie the Pooh. While his mother decided to sell off all of his father's personal possessions post-death, Christopher decided to donate the toys that served as inspiration to the franchise to the New York City Library as he thought they would have some form of public value (and as a means of letting go) rather than risking these being sold off as well. 
tldr: he loved his father, and the work that he made, and liked Winnie the Pooh. He hated the commercialisation of it all, and how people kept coming up to him regarding the series. &&I am now fighting myself over whether I would never want to see something so horrible done to such beloved characters, or if I've never wanted to see anything more in my life.&&_‚ÄîGrindr_&&Marmalade or honey &&‚ÄúOh bother‚Äù&&Dawn of The Planet of the Bears&&*Return of the Heffalumps and Woozels*&&Phase 3 will be the Bearvengers helping out the Berenstein Bears fight off their evil twins, the Berenstain Bears. &&With Ted as the stoner bear&&What about the Teddy Ruxpin spinoff?&&Ted and Ted 2 could fit in there somewhere as well.&&Where tf is Corduroy in all this?&&Especially Paddington 2, which in my opinion is the best family film ever made. &&Guess I need to watch those ASAP.&&I would like to see Clifford the Big Red Dog vs King Kong vs Godzilla in a triple threat match&&Watch Winnie the Pooh (2011).

I believe the movie twisted the real events into a parable regarding fame and success harming personal lives. In reality Christopher quite enjoyed it and only began to detest it when he went to boarding school: 
""When he was a young boy he enjoyed the attention that fame brought. ""It was exciting and made me feel grand and important,"" he told journalist and friend Gyles Brandreth later in life. As a child, Christopher Robin Milne made public appearances, wrote to fans, and even made a record. In the Goodbye Christopher Robin movie, he does a Q&A session but is depicted as being overwhelmed by his rabid stalker fans. Christopher's favorable attitude toward his alter ego did eventually change when he was sent to boarding school around age eight or nine, something that the movie only briefly focuses on. While there, he was bullied so much for being the boy in the books that he came to detest the bear. "" Source- http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/goodbye-christopher-robin/&&That movie went under the radar. I just found out it‚Äôs already on VOD when the poster for this was released.&&I don't think many people know about that one.

Retroactively make Ronan into a better character. That would really be something. &&That's great that Ronan is back. Gives him a better character arc through Guardians 1, I think. This'll be fun to watch between Captain America First Avenger and Iron Man in future marathons. &&Djimon Hounsou also joined this movie. I think it will explore the Kree race throughly.

Hollywood doesn‚Äôt get how cool this guy is.&&Fantastic.

Now you can give Lee Pace and Djimon Hounsou something to do.

Also, holy shit @ Coulson. Maybe Feige isn't as anti-Marvel TV as some think.&&Clark Gregg yelled, ‚ÄúThere you go!‚Äù Djimon Hounsou  gave a look of pleasant surprise. Lee Pace belted, ‚ÄúWe got a [expletive] squad now.‚Äù And before Brie Larson hit the locker room door, MCU Star Robert Downey Jr hugged her & said, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall look so different.‚Äù&&HOLY HELL!!!!! This is the greatest thing since #Coulsonlives 
&&Good. Lee Pace has the best damn eyebrows in the business.&&Ronan‚Äôs performance is so fire in guardians. 

‚ÄúYou call me boy!!?? I will unfurl one thousand years of kree justice on Xander ‚Äî and BURN IT TO ITS CORE‚Äù (to Thanos no less)&&Is Lee Pace returning as Ronan the Accuser?&&By setting this in the 90s it allows a future Kamala Khan to meet and idolize Captain Marvel while growing up and in her teenage years. Phase Four, baby!&&Coulson! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ&&Holy shit! Clark Gregg???? I couldnt be more excited about Coulsons return! Here is to hoping he is in Avengers 4!&&I miss pushing daisies.&&My mom went to high school with Clark Gregg. She posted a pic of me on Facebook in an iron mask, and he commented ""that rocks"". Probably my greatest achievement &&Is lee pace returning as Ronan?? This is awesome &&You called Ronan?!&&I find the lack of Hayley Atwell disturbing.&&Holy shit Clark is back :O but it might be in a earlier timeline&&Love me some Lee Pace.&&Awesome, I liked Ronan in GOTG, and happy to hear that Djimon Hounsou is also returning. Also, Ben Mendelsohn! &&MY BABY BOI COULSON IS COMING BACK TO THE MOVIES?!  OH MY GOD. &&Awesome! Jude Law too?? Is this the first it has been announced he is also in the film?&&It sucks that Melinda May probably won‚Äôt be in this.&&I do love some Lee Pace!&&Ooooh Lee Pace&&I miss Pushing Daisies.&&Lee pace will be unreal&&Lee Pace is awesome, starting to look like a solid cast&& Their including Lee Pace?....Shit motherfucker, that's all you had to say.&&I really feel like Clark Gregg should be the leading actor in this headline, but honestly just super pumped to see him back in the movies after killing it for 5 seasons (so far) of Agents of SHIELD. Really hoping it leads to some cool story developments for the next(?) season of AOS.&&Hail hydra&&I loved Halt and Catch Fire!&&I love all movies of Marvel, always watch with family. I think this film won't be worse than others! :)&&I love Lee Pace and hated how bad of a character Ronan was, hopefully he gets some proper writing.&&OMFG! I guess if they cancel AoS now, at least we‚Äôll still have Coulson!&&I'm sorry. Did you say Lee Pace? 

https://giphy.com/gifs/submission-lee-pace-sorry-not-IepbiTPt2dORa&&I had to look it up and I'm still surprised.  Ronan's back?

Edit - Apparently this movie takes place in the 90s, which explains it.&&I hope he's back for Ronan. I didn't think he was as bad as everyone cried about.&&Love Lee Pace. He was so good in Halt and Catch Fire.&&You call him Phil? You're on a first name basis with him now?&&I thought his first name was Agent&&Didn't he die in The Avengers? Or are they doin a flashback thing&&yes&&Think Djimon Honsou's casting and the movie being Kree-heavy basically confirms it&&Takes place in the 90's.  He's wasn't gibbed yet.&&Wait.. Lee Pace was Ronan? The fuck.&&...Lee Pace as Joe MacMillan.&&Who says they won‚Äôt? It‚Äôs possible (and interviews alluded) to have Coulson‚Äôs ‚Äúresurrection‚Äù being addressed in Infinity War or Avengers 4.&&Maybe he'll be a part of bookends. Fury and Coulson sitting at a bar shooting the breeze, ""Hey Coulson, remember that crazy shit that went down 25 years ago?"" ""Yeah, boss."" Roll opening credits.&&It's still my greatest hope that the Agents of Shield group shows up in the last movie. I still remember leaving the theater for Avengers on opening night and arguing with my friends that Coulson would be back.&&Maybe he'll mention how SHIELD is building a new base in Tahiti and he's put in a transfer request because he's heard it's a magical place. &&Coulson might die again before that happens, based on the current season... &&Honestly, I'd be surprised if people don't have a suspicion that he's alive... He's on America's Most Wanted in the show. &&Also the kree skrull war&&> So kind of a mini Guardians prequel in addition to a Captain Marvel origin? That's rad as hell.

A GotG/AoS/Avengers 3 prequel &&I want the Ronan from the comics, like in Annihilation, where he is still fiercely loyal to the Kree but not a villain. &&Yeah, they just need to show him from before his family was wiped out or whatever.&&I mean, they did bring back Garry Shandling in Winter Soldier that gave him a bit more depth than his introduction in Iron Man 2. Now I just wish they'd have more Sam Rockwell.&&Ronan was also really underrated as a villain. I watched that movie again recently and he's a total badass in it. He reminded me of Vader in ANH.&&> Djimon Hounsou

WHO?&&Loved Lee Pace as Ronan, and hope they develop him more here. And so awesome to have Agent Coulson back on the big screen, as much as I love Agents of SHIELD.&&oh very nice!  I loved Lee Pace in GotG and Hounsou is always a delight to see on the silver screen&&Maybe Evans recommended McKenna to Feige and crew after working with her.&&It's supposed to take a lot of inspiration from the Kree-Skrull war. Plus Kormac and Ronan players are big on the cosmic side of the comics.&&It would be pretty funny is Ronan turns out to be a real bro to Carol in this movie, only to flash forward to her meeting the Guardians and some real awkwardness comes out of it.&&I agree Ronan wasn‚Äôt particularly well fleshed out, but I loved Pace‚Äôs presentation nonetheless. The bloodthirsty zealous fanaticism he gave his villainous speeches was on point. He may have been a one dimensional character, but he was an excellently executed one dimensional character.&&Yeah Coulson deserves another go in the movies. It'd be pretty cool if he ended up showing up in a movie set in the present as well. &&They know. Coulson has been on the news and the center of a national manhunt. They know. &&But would they really care at this point? Yeah he inspired them at first, but it's been over 6 years since he ""died"", all of the Avengers have faced massive losses and trials and such, and the end of the world is coming. Learning that the rando angent who enlisted them and hasn't shown to be even thought of or honored in any way in the last 6 years wouldn't be a big deal&&What's dumbledore doing in this.&&Another casting addition of note: the directors, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, previously worked with Algenis Perez Soto on their film Sugar, in which he starred.&&I didn't get you anything, sorry.&&> Ben Mendelsohn

Who he playin?&&What are we blind? Deploy the Christmas presents!&&He‚Äôs always been in the MCU?&&(SO)N OF CO(UL)

Coulson is the soul stone.
Thor has been trying to tell us since 2011!&&He was announced ahwile back. He's playing the original Captain Marvel.&&Now we just need Johnnie Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.&&also remember HE SET UP the guest house. tahiti explicitly included removing memories of that experience.&&I think Captain Marvel will be interacting with the Kree and Skrulls outside of Earth, so Coulson may be part of her early recruiting/training sequences, but he won't know anything about what she's actually fighting. According to Kevin Feige, she is going to be one of the most powerful heroes that no one in the current MCU knows about, and who is sidelined for the start of the modern MCU for whatever reason (out in space, in some kind of stasis a la Captain America, or purposefully in hiding a la the comic origin for Blue Marvel).&&Or they're not in the same scenes. &&Before his memories were wiped, Coulson was in-charge of GH facility, so it's possible that he knew about the Kree, but that was wiped before the show starts.&&It takes place in the 90s, so it makes sense for him to be there since S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to be in the film.&&[deleted]&&I don't think it's that Feige is anti-TV as much as Feige is anti-Perlmutter and Perlmutter possibly spitefully fast-tracked the terrible Inhumans show so that Feige couldn't make a movie about them. Perlmutter (the Marvel Entertainment CEO, for those not in the know) also nearly kept Civil War from happening the way it did. If not for Feige going higher up to Disney itself, we would've seen RDJ's role lessened for the sake of not spending money.

Ultimately I feel like Feige would love to eventually integrate TV stuff into the movies but practically, it seems like that won't be possible until one of the TV shows is actually finished.&&Nice to see this branch out.&&Well she'd have been disappeared for a decade though given fury doesn't even mention her to the avengers in the first movie. &&That's more Phase 5.&&Isn't Kamala a teenager in the comics? She'd be an adult in the modern universe if she met Marvel in the 90s?&&She would be in her eighties, so it‚Äôs safe to assume she‚Äôd already be retired.  Interested to see if anyone else shows their faces though: Sitwell? Pierce? May? (omg)&&If it's set in the 90's, Peggy Carter would be in her 70's by then.&&Based on this [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgoSd36Bni2/?taken-by=wellhayley) post, I still have some hope. Especially since she wasn't announced as part of Ant-Man, either.&&Movie takes place in the 90s&&That's been out for a while actually, he was one of the first announced. &&He was announced as Mar-Vell a long time ago &&Yea I mean their track record have been pretty great. There hasn't been a horrible movie since Thor 2.&&Yeah, I wish Ronan had a couple more minutes dedicated to him.

Honestly I think his biggest character-building is in that moment when Starlord does his ridiculous dance and Ronan asks, ""What are you doing?""  Because for that one sentence he drops the voice.  That's, presumably, his normal speaking voice.  Which must mean every other line in the movie is him putting on a show, trying to look like a badass to everybody nearby.&&I think he was pretty dope. We have this weird modern fascination with villains having to be these super in depth characters with lots of motivations and stuff. Back in the day being cool and badass was enough. 

Look at Darth Vader in ANH. He has almost no real motives other than being an evil jerk and it was awesome. Ronan is in a similar mold. It's okay for bad guys just to be bad guys and act cool while doing it. The scene where Ronan beat the living shit out of Drax is still one of my favorite villain moments. &&His character is much too loved for Disney/Marvel to ignore.  I'm sure we'll be seeing him for a long time to come.        
As for the rest of Shield, well..  :(&&http://i.imgur.com/NyJT9Uy.gifv&&His first name is Agent!&&Mr. Coulson was my history teacher in the Framework. Pretty cool guy. By 2nd Semester, he just asked the students to call him Phil.&&\* Son of Coul&&The movie takes place in the 90s&&1. Yes he did die in that movie 
2. In Agents of Shield TV show he was brought back to life 
3. This movie takes place in 1990s 
&&Captain Marvel is set in the past. The 90s I think.&&He was resurrected for Agents of SHIELD, the exact canon of which in regards to the movie has always been in question. That said, Captain Marvel takes place in the 90s, so he's not dead yet.&&While this takes place before *The Avengers*, he is brought back to life in *Agents of S.H.E.I.L.D*.

Spoilers: http://www.slashfilm.com/heres-how-agent-coulson-stayed-alive-after-the-avengers/&&Holy shit, this is great news.  Lee Pace rocks!&&Either that or he's there for a dance-off. &&Interesting that Clark Gregg is also going to be in the movie considering the current season of agents of shield which is also pretty heavily Kree focused.&&[WHO!?](https://media.giphy.com/media/tKLq9YGlFGPxm/giphy.gif) ... YES HIM!&&I wouldn't be surprised if Ronan, Malekith, Ultron, and Red Skull were all sucked into their respective Infinity Stones, and could appear in Infinity War or Avengers 4. It'd be great to see these villains get more development in a second go around too&&It's not like most Marvel villains aren't completely forgettable despite often having interesting actors cast as them.&&Great scene from the Guardians of the Galaxy movie.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8P3X6Esbbc&&Infinity Stones aren't the thing. They're the thing that gets you to the thing.&&IF Agents of SHIELD isn't being renewed for a sixth season... will Marvel Studios go there and *wrap up* Coulson's extended story in Avengers 4???&&I thought he went to Tahiti, it's a magical place. &&[The problem is, this season of AoS is really setting up for Coulson to die, again](#spoiler)&&But it's been about 6 years in universe since he died. At this point, especially during an end of the world scenario, most of the Avengers would just be like ""oh, cool"" and it wouldn't affect them at all&&I feel like having Coulson appear in a flashback context in *Captain Marvel* is a good way of setting him up for a return in *Avengers 4*.  If you think about it, the last time Coulson appeared on the big screen was 2012.  For people who don't follow *Agents of SHIELD*, having him show up about 15 movies and 7 years later might leave a lot of the audience confused.  *Captain Marvel* gives them the opportunity to reintroduce him, while stressing the importance of his contribution to the Avengers (maybe even have the events of that movie serve as a reason Coulson got involved in the Avengers Initiative), and if they remind people of his death, makes him showing back up in *Avengers 4* a little less out of left-field.&&Coulson: ""Remember that time everyone thought you died?""

Fury: ""Shit, remember that time you actually did die?!""

(Hearty laughs all around)&&Can MCU use Skrulls? I thought that's why they invented the Chitari.&&A threequel &&Avengers 4?&&I want the weird star-crossed arranged marriage romance of Ronan and Crystal from the Inhumans, and we should jettison the Inhumans TV series to get it. &&I just want the scene in avengers 4 from the ‚Äòinfinity‚Äô series where Thanos‚Äô lieutenant is on the space station, and he‚Äôs being all super tough, then Ronan, Gladiator, Annihilus and Super Skrull show up and they just say they‚Äôll ‚Äúhandle this‚Äù. &&And they gave William Hurt more to do post-Hulk, in Civil War, that's the one that sticks out for me.  But you can also make this case that they brought back the other Ross, Everett (also in Civil War), and fleshed him out in Black Panther.

This is exactly the sort of thing that makes the whole ""shared universe"" thing so interesting.&&Have you seen any of the Marvel One Shot short films? Thor: Dark World comes with a short called All Hail the King which has Justin Hammer and Trevor Slattery in prison together, with Scoot McNairy as a journalist investigating Trevor's connection to the Mandarin.&&The entire plot of GotG parallels ANH when you think about it. Orphan from a backwater planet gets together with a princess and a wisecracking space criminal who has a hulking sidekick nobody else can understand, and they set out to stop a fanatical villain from wiping out a planet.&&WHERE IS DE DIAMOND&&C'mon man! Legendary actor?&&Only bad thing about djimon's casting was that he couldn't be used for black panther.

If he *hadn't* died, I might have forgotten him.

I don't think Coulson showing up would change much, but it'd be a happy capstone. Have him walk on in the stinger, and invite the Avengers to the diner above the secret SHIELD HQ.&&well considering they're kinda trying to rebuild an agency with only people they know and trust he'd be an excellent candidate&&According to Spider-Man, it‚Äôs been eight years since The Avengers. I remember because I did a double take in the theater and went ‚ÄúWait... it‚Äôs been eight years since The Avengers came out?‚Äù&&Wait wait wait.

So not only does the MCU have both Sherlocks, but both Watsons too? Holy shit! &&IIRC he's the original Captain Marvel.&&You gave him your time, the time it took for you to reply to his comment, and sometimes, time is the most valuable gift we can give to those around us ‚ù§Ô∏è&&I got you an upvote. Here you go.&&His role is unrevealed. He's the main villain, that's all we know. Possibly a Skrull. &&Somebody carol her... Or something!&&I'm mean in the movies.&&Captain Mar-Vell is in the Captain Marvel movie?! Feigned shock!

Edit: a letter&&Which means Captain Marvel might be the movie where they find the original Guest host. &&Ah, so she's like the Snoke of the MCU. Very powerful and totally AWOL for the last 20 years.&&Or the stinger for Captain Marvel shows Doctor Strange using the time stone to grab her from the 90s and take her to the present.

Or, what if Antman and The Wasp find her in the microverse, and her telling the story of how she got there is her film?

Either way, she won't have aged and she can lead the Avengers in the event that Captain America/Iron Man retire or die.&&Absolutely. I just think there's something to be said on that front, because they certainly didn't need to bring him back.&&It depends on who you ask.&&True, but to see May again. Damn. Didn't think of that. Ming-Na Wen doesn't age so it is not much of a problem.&&It all depends when in the 90s it's set, because we see in Ant-Man that her and Howard are still working at shield in 1989, and Howard lives till 1991, so it's possible she could be in a scene.&&They would save some money for the anti-aging budget since Ming-Na Wen has barely aged. &&She was looking pretty good in 1989 at the beginning of Ant-Man. Doesn't seem like a far stretch that she was still kicking ass.&&Must have missed that! Oh well, still very excited for the return Ronan and Son of Coul &&Which had a lot of really potent character moments.  

Like when Loki looks all composed when Thor comes to visit him after their mother's death, and then Thor shatters the illusion, and we see Loki looks absolutely despondent and probably hasn't moved from the spot where he collapsed since he heard.&&Yes address him correctly:

Agent Phil Son of Coul&&Ah! Security breach, that's on you!&&His first name is Director...
&&I loved Phil in framework. Even more when he said ""I am an S.H.I.E.L.D."" agent on live TV in framework and later proceeded to become GR (for one episode)

&&Did he teach you how to make soap?&&Yeah but did he ever talk to you about Soap?  Don't get him started on Soap.&&Is there a reason SHIELD never talks about Captain Marvel in the current MCU movies?&&Oh that's pretty cool, thanks&&Young Coulson is basically Agent Michael Casper&&It's always been completely canonical- he's the one who restored the helicarrier for Fury that shows up to save the day in Age of Ultron. &&Now, if as a young agent 10-15 years before Iron Man, he starts interacting with Kree or Skrulls (not in disguise as humans) it's going to through TV canon right out the window.

edit: TAHITI could have wiped his memory of aliens, at this point I'm not sure of his history of alien interaction.&&From The Pie Maker to an insane racist, to galactic warlord...thats some range&&He is absolutely mesmerizing in Halt and Catch Fire, I have never felt such intense empathy and sadness for a character in a long time. The entire cast was phenomenal but he was what put the show over the top.&&Ronan is also a great character who did not get as much attention as deserved in GotG1 in my opinion. Very excited he's going to be back. &&He was one of the best cast in the MCU. Loved his take on Ronan. &&The Kree have also been in multiple episodes since Season 2 I believe.&&It seems wierd as he definitely didn't know about kree when they first started showing up in AoS. But I guess fury isn't opposed to a bit if minor memory adjustment here and there.&&I would be surprised because they have the black order. It would be cool to see some of the older villains back but the Black order are Thanos' henchmen that aren't totally expendable. Although Ronan wouldn't make much sense, him and Thanos aren't exactly friendly, in fact Ronan got a bit ahead of himself with just one infinity stone and promised to kill Thanos. Plus Ronan doesn't exactly have evil intentions, he is a terrorist and does evil things but he doesn't want half the universe to die, he just wants to defend his people the Kree, he just believes that the Kree have been wronged and deserve better&&And Kaecilius surely? We did see him meet a different fate but having Mikkelsen onscreen with Pace, Eccleston, Spader, and Weaving (even if only Mikkelsen looks like himself) seems too good an opportunity to pass up when retconning it would be easy.&&With the multiverse reportedly being opened up I can definitively see a future Avengers movie where they have to take on all the defeated baddies. &&The only one of those which makes any sense is Red Skull.  I always thought they left it open for him to be in a sequel.  He was also the best of the villains mentioned, so that would be awesome.&&Yeah Malekith could really use it too. 

&&Christopher Eccelston as Malkeith being the biggest example of wasted talent.&&I think Ronan was probably one of the more memorable villains. His introduction is cool, he shit talks Thanos and manhandles an Infinity Stone, then dies by losing a dance-off. Definitely a better character arc than most villains get.&&Honestly, would prefer a season 6&&The MCU was actually all about Phil Coulson's story arc the whole time.&&Coulson is the soul stone.&&I'm pretty sure he's gonna die this season.&&Nah, he found out it sucked.&&""Did I fall asleep?""

""For a little while.""&&Eh depends how desperate they are by Avengers 4. Got a feeling we're going to have a pretty cut-down team either during or by the end of that movie. &&It depends on how it goes. If it was a personal reveal (i.e. Thor is caught alone, he's gotten the shit kicked out of him, and it looks like the end for him, then Coulson shows up with a massive gun and says ""step away, please"" and then obliterates the bad guy while they're mid-monologue), it could work pretty well.

Or they might just handle it as though everybody already knew. Hill and Fury obviously know, already, so it wouldn't surprise me if Cap and Romanov knew, since they worked for Shield after Coulson was back.&&Coulson: ""Remember that time I was replaced by a robot, brainwashed and trapped in a virtual world, then was shot off to a future where the world was destroyed, only to arrive back at the present to have my trauma thrown back in my face by an embodiment of my worst fear, oh by the way the Avengers don't seem to care I'm alive, what's with that?""

Fury: (laughs awkwardly)&&Skrulls is under the special case rights like scarlet witch and quicksilver. It's super skrull that marvel doesn't have (that's in the fantastic 4 rights). Also there's a rumor that skrulls are gonna appear in the new xmen movie just to taunt marvel. &&The Chitauri are just the Ultimate Marvel version of the Skrulls. IIRC they always had the right to the Skrulls, they just didn't want to call the Avengers aliens that because they were so different from the traditional comics Skrulls.&&> we should jettison the Inhumans TV series to get it. 

we should jettison that series regardless of what we get.&&Wait. It hasn't been canceled yet?&&It would be cool if they brought in Abomination into Infinity war as a early bad guy like Hydra in A2 and Cross bones in Cap3, just so they can tie the movies together better. He's supposedly still alive based on a one shot episode. Also good on Ross becoming Secretary of state. When they said the SoS was coming to the avengers faculty I almost got in Sept thinking itd be John Kerry or HRC making a cameo. &&Yep. That was a good one, although I would have loved to have seen a little bit more of Hammer outside of his cameo appearance.&&If you put it like that, all movies are have the same story...somehow.&&I immediately thought of A New Hope when I first saw Guardians of the Galaxy. To me GOTG 1 was ANH for this generation. While I mostly enjoyed TFA I think GOTG better captured that old school fun Star Wars essence.  &&And now we are Free. I will see you again... but not yet... Not yet!&&Unless none of them watch the news. They know.&&Because nothing says you're trustworthy like faking your death and hiding it for 6 years. &&Yeah that threw me off too. I guess it was 8 years in the MCU but it was 5 in real life.&&That's what happens when you cast everyone working in hollywood.&&You just became a mod of /r/wholesomememes&&Mendelsohn is like the go to bad guy now. 

And I‚Äôm completely fine with that.&&Oh for real? I have officially bought my ticket for the hype train. &&The part of the MCU that matters.&&Nah that was in ww2 the howling commandos find it at a hydra base&&Most likely explanation is that she‚Äôs in Soulworld.&&True, but I didn't want people expecting an answer to his death in the film and his current state, when the odds are very high that he's in the 90s portion of the film. It's great that they brought him back in any form, but wanted to keep expectations in check.&&Right? It's weird to think that she was Chun-Li 25 years ago.&&Yeah, but she must be on the brink of retirement even in 1989.

Someone said that early set pics indicate a setting of the movie at ca 1995.&&With the money they'll make from Black Panther and Infinity War, they could take a sample of her blood and develop an anti-aging serum for their actors.&&Here's hoping we get a 1v1 between them -- probably wouldn't be fair on Ronan though&&*This is Gimli, Son of Gloin; Legolas of the Woodland Realm;*

*And Phil, Son of Coul, Agent of Men*&&One of my favorite lines from that movie. Just how shocked/unshocked he plays it is the best&&The whole framework arc made me feel so uncomfortable while watching. That‚Äôs probably what they intended.&&No one else had the clearance level? Right now in the MCU pre-fall of SHIELD:

* Level 10 -- Alpha Level, Omega Level: Nick Fury

* Level 10 -- Alpha Level: Alexander Pierce who is dead

* Level 9 -- Maria Hill

* Level 8 -- Phil Coulson, Captain America, Victoria Hand(Dead)

Nick Fury could know given his Omega Level that no one else has. Then there is the ""compartmentalization"" that Fury did:

* ""I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns."" ""It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all."" ‚ÄïSteve Rogers and Nick Fury in Captain America Winter Solider 

Despite the fact that Victoria Hand and Phil Coulson were Level 8 only Phil Coulson knew about Project T.A.H.I.T.I and it was kept off 100% off the books at S.H.I.E.L.D. Not to mention that in the words of Tony Stark from Avengers ""He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets."" and this could be one of them. 

&&Maybe they will talk about it in the movie. We will have to wait and see.&&Post Credits scene is Agent J and Agent K flashing the neuralizer. &&Well, SHIELD did have a super secret program where they were bringing people back from near death using frozen Kree bodies, and a grand total of like ten people know about it.&&My theory is that Carol will probably die at the end of her own movie and be resurrected in Avengers 4. It's a pretty cheap move but it's the easiest way to pull off a retcon like that and make it make sense, at least that I can think of.   

EDIT: A lot of people are also suggesting that she's probably just been off-world in that time period, which is another good thought. There are plenty of ways that they could pull off a character having been around since the 90's but not mentioned, but killing Carol or leaving her in space definitely seem like the two easiest, and therefore most likely, options. &&Well, since she isn't in Earth in the world-ending events of Avengers 1 & 2, I'm guessing she went to deep space to do space things and SHIELD really has no means of contact. Possibly filed away by them as ""Yeah, that happened"" and forgotten. 

&&[He also didn't die, and there is a 5 season TV show about him](#spoiler)&&And Fitz made the thing Fury used to get out of that truck in Winter Soldier. &&The movies are canonical for the series. The series more fits in the cracks of the movies, and can be completely ignored if they want to. Hence why Inhumans have never come up in the movies, despite being a world-wide phenomenon in the series. &&I'm not sure about that. He knew about Kree at some point before the show, as he was heading up the TAHITI project previously. Those memories were wiped from him to keep his mind intact, so who knows how closely his role in this film will match that of memories that had to be wiped.&&I covered this over on /r/marvelstudios:

I've seen bigger continuity errors be explained away. I can already think of three ways it can be explained.

EXPLANATION ONE: The first Kree that Coulson saw in AoS was that rotted corpsey Kree. Can easily argue that he might not have recognized that it was a Kree, especially since Mar-Vell is ethnically white/pink-skinned and Ronan the Accuser often is almost entirely covered with armor and black facepaint. 

EXPLANATION TWO: Coulson is clearly a man good with secrets and very loyal to Fury and SHIELD. It isn't completely out of the realm of possibility that if Fury told him at the end of whatever events *Captain Marvel* will explore that he must **never speak of any of this again**... he wouldn't. He'd be willing to even act surprised or dumb to the Kree in order to keep it secret.

EXPLANATION THREE: The dude had his brain used as a piano during his resurrection it isn't out of the realm of possibility he lost some stuff. 

(Adding on based on what /u/the_unknown_dude said on Marvel Studios: Coulson himself asked for a mindwipe at one point after working on Project T.A.H.I.T.I., which involved a Kree)


(Also, in some ways the BIGGER continuity error lies in the fact that in Avengers they more-or-less state that Thor and the Destroyer's fight in New Mexico was the first major alien contact... but like with Coulson I'm sure there can be an explanation we can think of.) &&TIL Ronan was the Pie Maker in Pushing Daisies.

Some range indeed.&&Don't forget the weirdo brother on Wonderfalls, or Roy Walker the Black Bandit in that fucking crazy Tarsem Singh movie The Fall.&&And a computer programmer (kinda) in Halt and Catch Fire&&He also played a trans drag queen in Soldier's Girl.&&His Pie Maker is easily one of the most adorable men on TV. He did the facial expressions and body language perfect for that character. Plus the way he started to speak too fast when he got nervous. I love that's he's in movies and doing all these badass characters, but he got my attention as an awkward sweetheart.&&Don't forget the Tech Innovator of the 70's 80's and 90's &&What movie was he a racist in?&&I usually frame it like this: I showed up for Lee Pace but stayed for Mackenzie Davis. Two of my faves who should really be in more things&&I didn't start watching that show until they recently put it on Netflix.  I binged the whole series in a little over a week.  Such a great show.  

It was a bummer when I found out that the series was cancelled.  &&I don't see the Black Order surviving Infinity War, but you're right, it's unlikely the villains I mentioned will appear in IW since it's already too crowded. But Avengers 4 definitely, I could see Marvel wanting to bring literally everybody back&&> . Plus Ronan doesn't exactly have evil intentions, he is a terrorist and does evil things but he doesn't want half the universe to die, he just wants to defend his people the Kree, he just believes that the Kree have been wronged and deserve better.

Uh, did you miss the part where he tried to blow up an entire planet?&&tbf Ronan actually fights the Black Order in the comics so it wouldn't be a big stretch for him to show up and help.

&&Maybe. I feel like he will come back as Dormammu in ""human"" form. It'd be a fantastic way of utilizing the Mikkelsen more&&I can't imagine those actors coming back for something like that.  Also it feels kind of cheap in a way non-comic book fans wouldn't necessarily get excited for.&&Didn't Hugo Weaving say he wasn't interested in playing the role again, though?&&Very unlikely. Ecclestone *really* hated it and would much prefer everyone to just forget the whole thing. &&Why oh why did Thor 2 have to happen the way it did. After Ragnarok, I feel even more sorry for what could have been. &&I literally don't know him from anything aside from Thor 2 and Doctor Who, but I feel so bad for that guy. I can't imagine he'd ever want to act in Sci-Fi ever again.&&I would say Colin Farrell as Bullseye, but we *want* to forget that one. &&GOTG is the first substantive introduction to Thanos as the huge supervillian of the entire universe and what does Ronan do?  He plays him like a punk bitch and proceeds to kick him out of the movie.  Ronan's badass.&&While it was cool that Lee pace killed Thanos speaker to show how powerful and he was not a bitch, but it was sad that they killed off the speaker as I liked the actor alexis denisof ever since buffy the vampire slayer and Angel.  &&6 seasons and a movie&&Why not both. Just have Daisy put on her big girl pants and be the Director already. Law&Order went 20 years with a rotation of different characters AoS could go another season or two with some changes.&&Not the right show but, six seasons and a movie would be nice to&&I‚Äôm cool with that &&OMG, a Dollhouse reference?  You rock. &&At least 2 people need to die or i will be disappointed &&I feel like this movie is the segue into the next generation of avengers. Thor, cap, iron Man, etc are killed by the snap, newer heroes like antman Spidey cpt marvel black panther have to take on the mantle of avengers in their absence, and maybe save them in avengers 4. Makes sense as most of the original avengers team have had all their own trilogies completed and the actors are getting old, so their contracts are probably gonna change to having them in cameoes like rdj in Spiderman &&I want him to show up with the gun he used in The Avengers (the one sort of based on Destroyer technology)&&[deleted]&&If this is real I might start watching AoS&&But doesn't it all belong to Disney now? Shouldn't that make this really simple? &&Pretty sure we jettisoned it already by collectively not watching it.&&Supposedly they were considering bringing Tim Roth back as Abomination for AoU, can‚Äôt remember if the idea was dropped or he declined.&&Well, Rockwell's not in it, but Hammer industries is a plot point in Luke Cage.&&Apparently he wanted to do it but there was an availability problem. They ended up flying to him (Toronto I think?) and doing it all in a day including putting together a single prison wall so it looked like he was on the same set.&&I mean, yeah, it's [The Hero's Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey).&&And then in the sequel he finds out that his dad is evil.&&Love him in that movie. I also loved picturing him and hearing his voice in my head while i read through all his parts in the sequel script...&&Tony's too busy tinkering, Cap comes from before television so he doesn't see the point, Thor same thing, Banner probably too worried about Hulking out to deal with the stress of watching the news. That just leaves Hawkeye and Natasha who both probably already knew because of their security clearance.&&That's a pretty broad definition of ""faking"".&&Marvel running out of actors any time now &&You just became a mod of my heart.&&:(&&Agents of SHIELD is a fantastic show. &&Yea you're right, I do hope we see something about GH though. &&False. It‚Äôs Legolas, son of Ronan, the Accuser. &&""So this is how it ends, not with a bang, but with a-"" &&And it's come back to haunt us.&&Best part of the show, in my opinion. I thought the whole of season 4 was incredibly solid. I'm only partway through 5 and it's okay, with a cool setting, but doesn't feel as connected and powerful as 4 did. It's cool to see the Kree though, so there's that.&&But it led to one of my favorite throwaway jokes in the history of television. 

""We need to make Radcliffe watch ALL of the Terminator movies.""

""Even Salvation?""

""He brought this on himself.""&&That time when network television did the matrix better than the matrix trilogy did the matrix&&Nick mentioning Iron Man wasn't the only super hero in Iron Man is also a good unintentional throw-forward for Cap Marvel.&&Yeah, have to agree here. Retconning is entirely unnecessary when you can hand wave it away as secret spy shit.&&wait and see... in movie #67 of the MCU!&&MiB is actually owned by Marvel so...&&And like half of them will probably be in this movie. But I don't think they're going to go down that route. &&Or the characters of the movie think she died but she's alive and in space at the end. It could be a floating in space type thing until someone stumbles upon her, or she recovers somewhere else and doesn't come back to earth for 20 years.

Another possibility is that the Avengers use Doctor Strange's time stone and pluck her out of history so that she can help them defeat Thanos. They know the exact time of death so they're able to save her at the last minute.&&I am guessing she will have something to do with the Quantum Realm and show up in Ant-Man and the Wasp in the after-credits.&&I've heard it's great in TAHITI&&He actually did die. He was resurrected using alien blood and dangerous experimentation.&&Have they brought Life Model Decoys into that show yet?&&Vision did say in Civil War that enhanced individuals had increased exponentially since Iron Man. It's obviously not a direct reference to the Inhuman outbreak from AoS, but Vision was clearly talking about more enhanced than the 10 or so people in the room, &&also there is now the whole issue of Coulson being most wanted and every LOE having his picture &&Agents of Shield isnt on the same level as Inhumans though. Samuel L. Jackson actually showed up as Nick Fury on the show. As has Sif from Thor.&&> Hence why Inhumans have never come up in the movies, despite being a world-wide phenomenon in the series.

And why the rest of the world didn't seem to understand what they were dealing with in ""The Inhumans"".&&Oh, right right right. hmmm... They could maybe get the Kree from TAHITI during the movie then...but didn't they get him from that Inhuman obelisk coffin box?&&Also an Elf in the Hobbit.&&From the pie hole. As in, ‚Äúshut your‚Äù but really ‚Äúopen your‚Äù because their pies are delicious. The piemaker seems pretty quirky, and his girlfriend looks an awful lot like that dead girl, lonely tourist Charlotte Charles. But that‚Äôs impossible, because she‚Äôs dead. Totally would eat there again. They have the freshest fruit pies. 5/5&&Wud've been great Rhaegar Targ&&The fall is one of my favorite movies, Soo good&&The Fall is amazing!! &&The Fall was an amazing movie, visually stunning. It introduced me to Lee Pace! I also miss Halt and Catch Fire.&&Wonderfalls is where I first fell in love with Lee Pace. I friggen love that show! &&I loved Wonderfalls. Such a fun little show that no one watched.&&> Tarsem Singh movie The Fall

Great movie!&&Nobody has yet brought up Joe in Halt and Catch Fire.&&Crazy AMAZING Tarsem Singh movie, you mean.&&Also Halt and Catch Fire.&&The Fall haa been my favorite movie since I first saw it I want to say 2009 or 10. I have not been able to convince anyone to watch it and it still remains my favorite movie.&&He was more like a idea guy.&&And don't forget his role as Legolas's father in The Hobbit trilogy.&&Don't forget he was an elf too.&&Which he did an amazing job portraying.&&Fun Fact:  Tarsem saw him in Soldier's Girl and cast him as Roy in The Fall because he did not think anyone would recognize him.&&One of my favorite actors, up there with Viggo Mortenson who, yes, was also in LotR stuff, but has done so many versatile things besides. But Pushing Daisies is basically the best thing ever.&&Lincoln w/ Daniel Day Lewis&&The Hobbit.&&No love for the Skootski? The Skootster? Skootarino? I thought he was pretty good in it. He‚Äôs pretty good in most things he‚Äôs in. &&Mackenzie Davis was a mixed bag for me in the first couple seasons because I am sick of the ""magically brilliant"" character who can do no wrong and whose only enemy is ""the man."" The fact that she was also done up as a cliche ""damaged goods punk chick"" in the first season didn't help.

But DAMN if that character didn't win me over. As her flaws came to the surface, she became incredibly sympathetic.

Lee Pace's arc was amazing as well, though. He teeters on a fine edge between phony and earnest, slimy and charming, endearing and detestable. And he makes it work.&&Mackenzie Davis was pretty good in Blade Runner 2049 even though her part was kinda small, Except for one really interestingly shot scene.&&At least they were given a proper send off. That last season was one of the best I've ever seen.&&My guess is that the Black Order gets wiped out by Thanos's snap to show that he isn't fooling around. &&Ronan is much more Lawful Neutral in the comics IMO. &&A planet that had wronged his people.

Like he probably wouldn't have a problem with every planet.&&Which works perfectly with the fact Mikkelsen is doing motion capture performance already with Kojima Productions on Death Stranding, so he'll be familiar with the nuances of mocap vs film/television acting like Hannibal or The Hunt.

I hope he has a flaming purple 4D space face next time, and still has parts of Kaecilius' personality after absorbing him into the Dark Dimension.&&I'm a comic book fan and I'm not getting excited for anything cheap like that.&&It'll unfortunately mean a recasting will happen.&&Hugo Weaving hates sequels and refuses to take roles that he thinks could end up in a sequel. I believe LOTR did this to him haha&&His performance was so generic anybody could come back as Malekith&&If was Jane I would've broken up with Thor's ass too after that fuckin dumper of a movie, but goddamn did they bring it hard for Ragnarok I bet Jane is regretting her decision now lol.&&He was also the villain in 28 Days Later.&&6 seasons, a movie, and then a few more seasons&&6 Infinity Stones and a Gauntlet?

Edit: ""Phil Coulson"" is an anagram for ""Soul on Phil C."" He was resurrected after all...&&Six seasons and, what, six movies for Coulson?&&Apples and Orangutans. S.H.I.E.L.D lost it's weekly format back in season 1, and now it tells big arc stories that focus on the characters. &&> Law&Order went 20 years with a rotation of different characters AoS could go another season or two with some changes.

Idk if I want AoS to have a Law and order production value :(&&Oh boy is it real. Just get through the first 7 or so episodes quickly (they do set up a bunch of stuff for future seasons and you get to know the characters a bit beford the crazy starts). After that you‚Äôre in for a wild, very emotional ride. And every season just gets better and better. &&Disney is going through anti trust/anti monopoly review right now. The ownership has not yet settled. Until the government approves the sale, the xmen remain with fox studios &&Wouldn't really need Roth given his characters predicament. I definitely agree though, I think theres potential to have all the heroes against their counterparts. &&And from Captain America Civil War came The Raft, which is a Jessica Jones plot device. &&There was going to be a sequel? What happened to it?&&Tony knew about Spiderman from youtube. I'm sure he didn't miss that Coulson is alive.&&I volunteer as tribute &&*Cries in ABC*&&And Boromir , King  inda NORF!&&That was one of the most heartbreaking moment for me, because Radcliffe isn't the villian. He just very tragic character, who made some mistakes like all of us do.&&Fitz. That's what they call you here, don't they?

YOU ARE WEAK!&&Goddamnit leopold.&&yeah but in the absolute best way. Scary as he is, Leopold's kinda the best.&&First half of season 5 was definitely weaker in my opinion. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was watching ‚ÄúAgents of Shield.‚Äù Second half is definitely a lot better, more of what season 4 was like. &&And also a nod to Hank Pym‚Äôs days as Ant-Man. I‚Äôd have to assume Fury knew about his exploits as well. &&‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôre the *only* superhero in the universe?‚Äù&&Captain America and Hank Pym's Ant Man and Wasp both work with that line as well.&&I agree to a point, if the movies want coulson back in modern times, it's not like having him die on screen will prevent it

But

I do think the movies have set a relevant tone so far that death is permanent, and going back on that will really lower the stakes. Superman came back from death in the comics and since then, no one has taken death seriously, for good reason... So if, in the movies, they just nix his death, it'll be a pretty big turning point and shouldn't be taken lightly.

The TV shows are a whole different thing, tonally speaking. &&Well, I mean, they're still good. They're enjoyable movies to watch, with very few exceptions.

Some of my friends might have hated Ragnarok for turning Thor from a serious hero into a witty slapstick hero but *god dammit I HAD FUN*.

As long as Marvel keeps making enjoyable movies I'll keep watching them. Already got tickets for IW a week ago.&&MIB films are Columbia, which is owned by Sony which is playing ball with the MCU, as evidenced by Spiderman. It could happen, boys. &&The dog collar is an infinity stone&&Wake me... when you need me. &&I assume she may just have been occupied elsewhere in the universe all this time (stuff that we'll see in her solo movies, at least first one). She is a cosmic side hero after all, she doesn't really take care of Earth threats normally. Of course, Thanos and the Infinity Stones is big enough to warrant her to come back on Earth and fight him. I think we may see her as soon as the end of IW and definitively in Avengers 4 (after her movie).&&It's a magical place.&&Yeah, definitely correct, but for the sake of the uninitiated, it was more important to point out he is alive and has a tv show.&&Kree blood. 

Maybe they got the idea about mixing human and kree from the Captain Marvels.&&Very much so. &&To great success. It‚Äôs a part of arguably the show‚Äôs best story arc.&&Yep, they were a gigantic part of Season Four, and still play a substantial part in Season Five now that the agents are back.&&Wrong Inhumans. I mean the thousands that went through Terrigenesis on SHIELD, not the self titled TV show. 

And again, the movies unquestionably count on the TV show. The question is more if the movies count the TV show. &&[deleted]&&Fun fact: no CGI was used in the Fall, despite its labyrinthine fairyland visuals.&&Love The Fall. One of my favs as well. Great idea for a film and beautifully executed. Visualizing a child's interpretation of a fantasy tale. Lee was great and that girl was so adorable! Googly googly googly, begone!&&There are handfuls of us who watched. Handfuls I tell ya!&&>A fun little show that no one watched

RIP all of Bryan Fuller's unfinished works
&&I own it on DVD. All of Brian Fuller's stuff is so charming.&&I love it. 

But of course Fox had to kill it with their usual fuckery.&&The scheduling fucked up any viewership it was gaining and comparisons to Joan of Arcadia didn't help. However, I'm so happy we got a full release, which is very lucky. As much as I wanted more, it's almost perfectly self-contained. It's become one of my favorite shows and something I can always return to. &&Are you having a sode? &&TBH I always struggle to explain what his characters role is haha. Sometimes I say he's a sales guy but I think 'Idea guy' works pretty well.&&They're the thing...that gets us to the thing&&He became a decent programmer by the end.&&He was racist as Ronan also. Wanting to destory all of Xandaerians, is a  kind of racial motivated.&&I love Scoot!&&Don't forgot her playing Yorkie in San Junipero&&Yeah, luckily AMC has done a pretty good job of at least giving a cancelled show one more full season to close things out properly.

I thought they did a good job with the last season of ""Turn"" as well.

Both series finales gave solid closure to the characters.  &&I think Thanos executes one of them for failing at something. Two get killed in the various confrontations with the good guys and one of them backstabs Thanos and survives.&&I wouldn't give a shit about an actor replacing him if he did the voice over work for it. His voice is too distinct to just blindly recast in my opinion. But, I basically believe he is not coming back regardless sadly.&&He probably knew that LotR would be a multi movie part. He just probably didn't expect 3 Hobbit movies.&&[removed]&&But the three LOTR films were all filmed at the same time. Not really sequels as much as one very long project. 


Weaving hasn't outright said he would never appear as the Red Skull again, but he did make a very negative comment about the prosthetic face and the time it took to apply. He said he never wanted to do *that* again. CGI has come a long way even since then, so I'm optimistic we might still see him again one day. &&The role was so generic I really can't see the point of bringing the character back anyway. &&This guy gets it &&Huh? Anti-Life Equation?&&COULSON IS THE C IN THANOS&&Thankfully, even, or it probably would've been dead on the cutting room floor.&&This is likely what saved the show, but I do sort of feel like it is at the cost of longevity. I'm still enjoying the show, but it seems like every season is trying to one up the last one. Hydra, Inhumans, Hydra as an ancient inhuman cult, Terminator, Matrix, Time/Space Travel, it can only go on like this for so long. They've managed to handle those remarkably well, but I don't think the show should keep going like this much longer.&&They never did it again (AoU was a lame attempt), but one thing people that didn't watch the show live will never experience is watching the episode before and the episode after Winter Soldier came out. They actually took the time to significantly tie in the show to the events of the movie, and by the same token watching the movie with the knowledge of what had just happened in SHIELD the week of release was awesome as well. It didn't spoil the movie, but you went into the theater with a cheeky smile, like you know a secret no one else does because you were so well researched. That was a shit load of fun and the way Winter Soldier effected the rest of the season was just a really cool tie in that made the show feel really important even though it was in the shadow of the real Super Heroes. Like, ya, the big battle is won, but now we're here to do the leg work and tie up the loose ends. 

They never took the time to do that again because Ike Perlmutter is literally a sentient, bipedal piece of colon cancer.&&This would be juicy if the X-Men was with anyone but Fox.&&Boromir was never KINGINDANORF! Only his son. &&And Faramir, CEO of Rand and hater of Ice Cream.&&For me the most heartbreaking moment is when Hope disappears. Poor Mack.&&Yeah that was heart breaking. He did a lot of bad things with good intentions. &&Chist, my heart can't take anymore.

Ian De Caestecker is gonna get jobbed out of an Emmy for best actor. He's giving one of the best performances of the last few years right now. He got robbed of even a nomination last year, IMO&&Daisy:WHO ARE YOU TALKNG TO?

Like, seriously.  The constraints and gives Marvel seemed to have negotiated to get him are pretty ridiculous.&&The universe is in Orion's belt. &&Thing is, though, we already know the Quantum Realm will be in Captain Marvel, they already said so.  A big part of the Captain Marvel (original) lore is his nega-bands, which draw power from the Negative Zone.  Captain Marvel also spent like a decade trapped in the Negative Zone.  How this relates is that the Negative Zone is (iirc) stuck with the Fantastic Four rights.  So it is possible the Quantum Realm will replace the Negative Zone's purpose and we may see Carol get the Quantum Bands (which, yes, exist and draw power from the Quantum Zone/Realm) instead of Quasar.&&It sucks.&&Also good to keep the mystery alive&&See: Theta protocol &&My favorite technically-correct trivia to annoy Tolkien fans: Thranduil made the Dwarves' armor!

Like Buffy before it, the characters have become so well-realized that it no longer makes sense for them to keep doing the same stuff every week. They've grown past what the show can reliably depict. &&Strangely enough, Boromir was next in line to be Hand of the King. &&Fine! Senechal indaNorf... and hand of the king. &&That show is 100% driven by him and Elizabeth Henstridge. I like the rest of the cast and all but they are it's heart and soul.&&> He got robbed of even a nomination last year, IMO

&&Imagine telling somebody during the first season of Parks and Rec that the most expensive movie every made would have an ""and Chris Pratt credit""&&Yeah that really confused me too. Usually the ""and"" credit to the most credible actor who plays a key role, but is not a main protagonist. ""And Josh Brolin"" would have made a lot of sense but ""And Chris Pratt""? All I gathered from this is that Pratt must have one hell of a fucking agent. &&I was wondering why they put him, specifically, after the villain.&&The layout and style are fine, but the weird oversized heads (on RDJ and Johansson and Cheadle in particular) make it look really bad.&&Nah you're right.

Marvel has had some great movies follow silly posters, though. I'm not worried that this poster is a bad sign.

I'd be thrilled if they went that route and got all amazing voice actors rather than just famous people who sound familiar.&&Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, and Henry Cavil &&[deleted]&&It's not regulation. It's contract negotiations. Bigger name actors have more clout so they can push for better billion positions in their contracts. Generally assuming billing isn't alphabetical, top billing goes to the protagonist but that's not always the case. Sometimes if the main character is a no name and there are big actors in supporting roles they'll get top billing. Examples: A Wrinkle in Time, Queen of Katwe.

After that, it's pretty much in order of importance to the plot or order of fame except for ""last billing"". Last billing is reserved for big name actors in a smaller role. ""and"" is the most commonly used for last billing. But if there are more than one famous actor in small roles they'll put ""with"" first and then ""and"". In these cases, the last one is still the better slot. Often for last billings they'll put ""as"" with the character name after the actor's name.

Sometimes, if there are fresh/new actors in the show or movie, they'll put ""featuring"" which I think comes after the normal last billing of the main cast.

Generally it's basically order of importance to plot is the starting order then it gets altered based on contract negotiations. If it's a sequel the politics of holdovers likely play into it as well. Here are some more interesting examples: Revenge of the Sith has Ewan McGregor at the top then Natalie Portman and then Hayden Christensen. You'd think Hayden would be second but Natalie Portman is a bigger name and she was in all three of the prequels whereas Hayden was only introduced in the second one. In Phantom Menace she got third billing and McGregor got second after Neeson. Jake Lloyd got fourth billing. In all three prequels Frank Oz got last billing (as he did in ESB and RotJ). In the first three movies Hamill got top billing even though Ford was a bigger actor by the time RotJ came out. This is likely the case because like I said, the order generally holds between sequels.

Here's another interesting example: In The Force Awakens the billing order went Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Driver, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Nyong'o, Serkis, Gleeson, Daniels, Mayhew, and Sydow. Sydow had a super tiny role at the beginning of the movie (though he did get the first line). Hamill didn't even have a line. Ridley is the main character but is after Driver who is a bigger actor. Ford got the top because he's the biggest out of all of them (which trumped the original order of the first three movies). In The Last Jedi, the order was similar except Hamill is top because Ford is gone. Benicio del Toro got last billing in this case for pretty obvious reasons. One interesting thing is Gwendoline Christie got billing in TLJ when she didn't in TFA (she's just under Daniels and above Tran). Hell, I'd say she had a bigger role in TFA than she did in TLJ. The new actor for Chewbacca isn't even though Mayhew was always on the billing in the movies he was in. That tells me that they prioritize putting legacy actors in the billing even though they play super minor roles. Daniels is barely in the new sequels while Chewbacca is much more prominent in both. Despite that, Daniels is billed higher than Mayhew and the guy that replaced Mayhew didn't even make the cut.&&Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but as I learned it, the ordering of credits are a function of pay level. Top billing is obviously the lead of the movie and thus (generally) paid the most. I believe the person following ""And"" is generally paid the second most, and ""With"" may indicate 3rd most. 

Or I could just be making all that shit up. I dunno, I don't work in the industry. I just feel like I've heard that somewhere. &&The interaction is probably like this...
1. Ironman is in-dubiously number one
2. Edward Norton is no longer the hulk, so Thor will be next as the next successful franchise to launch
3-4. Chris Evans' personality suggests that he probably said ""let me go after Mark"". 

Chris Pratt is too big of a name now to go after Chris Evans now as the 5th lead. The Guardians of the Galaxy is a more successful franchise than Thor really so he does deserve the ""and"" credit. 

Can't believe Tom Hiddleston is not on there. &&With and Ands are more prestigious that 2- anyone else. They‚Äôre negotiated by the agents and producers and usually it denotes payment/ clout. 

It‚Äôs basically just an extra little thing to make the actors feel more important even when they‚Äôre #15 on the call sheet and a big name,

The conclusion could just be Thanos finishing the gauntlet and setting back all the hero work that everyone has done by a century or two with the snap of a finger.&&Wiping out half of humanity would still be a proper conclusion, though, and would leave a lasting effect.

Avengers 4 could be the logical in-universe continuation (e.g. the universe is ruined and we need to turn back time) without being a direct sequel.

IIRC, it was like a respectful shoutout to his career. Not sure how that fits with Pratt, but maybe he requested it.

How weird would it be if every single movie poster with Robert Downey Jr. just continually said ""and introducing Robert Downey Jr.!""&&I always really liked that about Gilmore Girls. Amy Sherman-Paladino and Daniel Paladino really care about their productions and the people involved, and it shows. 

I recommend Amy's new show, The Marvellous Mrs. Maisle if you haven't checked it out yet. 

Also, rest in peace to Edward Herrmann, who played Richard Gilmore (1943-2014). I remember watching an interview with Amy about how Edward wasn't going to be a part of the reunion episodes and she was visibly upset about that fact. She really loves the people she works with. &&Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. Genuinely fascinated. &&The actress who plays Missandei (Daenerys's translater) in Game of Thrones gets a single billing, while the actor who plays Brandon Stark has a billing with two other names. One of the Stark children!&&Top billing does not necessarily equal top paycheck. For example, Oscar Isaac got a higher paycheck than both Daisy Ridley and John Boyega for The Force Awakens but was credited after them. It's usually something the actors' agents negotiate. However, it also helps how important the character the actor plays is to the story.&&Terrence Howard got paid more than RDJ in Iron Man. He definitely didn't get top billing. Top billing isn't always the lead of the film either. It's all negotiated politics. Bigger actors often get top billing over leads. Leads generally get top billing but bigger names sometimes trump that if the lead is a no name. Example: Queen of Katwe.

Last billing is generally the second biggest name actor regardless of if it's ""and"" or ""with"". If not based on name then it's based on seniority. For example, on Burn Notice, Bruce Campbell is pretty easily the biggest name but he got third billing while Sharon Gless got last billing. She got it because she's got seniority. Plus it made more sense for how the intro flowed (which is likely why he got listed after the girlfriend character). If an actor in the main cast of of the movie/series is the main producer, they'll likely get top billing even if there are bigger actors on the cast or if they aren't the lead character. Again, it's arbitrary and based on contract negotiations. It's not a set process with specific rules. There are also things about when two characters names show up at the same time, you show one at the top right and one at the bottom left so neither of them seem more important than the other.&&I already know all of Groot's&&I bet Mantis has like 2&&I wouldn't even be mad...&&There's no crying in Marvel!&&I care. I've liked Hawkeye quite much since all the development he got in AOU. He is IMO the bravest Avenger by going up against those threats with nothing but a bow and arrow. His role in Civil War, as small as it was, was great too&&I mean Renner doesn't expect to do Marvel movies that much longer so Infinity War (part 2?) might be his last proper movie.&&Except for the part where Cap left... and Iron Man was the one in charge of the team that stuck with the ""group"" &&No kidding!

Haha, it's cool to see other people react in an opposite way. Black Panther definitely has more fans than I have him credit for. The internet really does open up to a world of people. I don't know why Black Panther having a bunch of fans makes that apparent for me, but well, here we are. :P&&The T and K key aren't even close to each other, and that wasn't on a phone... what was going through my mind to cause that typo? XD&&I love Jeff goldbulm so much! &&[deleted]&&First one should end like [this](https://babbletop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Thanos_Snappy.png).&&Thanos should win in the first movie and then they should set the second movie like 10 years into the future where the avengers are pretty much all gone except for a few who have been fighting the whole time, only release some animated shorts between movies for key events in those 10 years that pass&&I mean that's what sells. Some people will only go to see their favorite character/actor. That's why Scarlet Johansson is front and center even though she's always a minor player. &&Supposedly although he's a dwarf, he's way bigger in size than any of the Avengers.

Not to nit-pick, it's just more mind-boggling with a shorter time span.&&The dwarves in marvel are not tiny. Especially the ones that forge stuff like this hammer. He's gonna be big. Real big.&&The dwarves are actually giants&&It's probably a mocap thing as well.&&Captain America's new shield is played by Warwick Davis, so the fight between him and Thanos is just them smashing two dwarves against each other.&&Irish actor Tom Vaughan Lawlor is playing Ebony Maw&&*and 1999 MTV Best Kiss Award winner Gwyneth Paltrow.*&&I know the show Raising hope humorously put Cloris Leachman at the end of the credits (that roll as the show is going) with ""Introducing""&&Steven Segall in Executive Decision. 

Bait... and switch. &&Here's me betting that Mantis has more than one of the heroes.&&Also considering Wakanda is opening up their tech and resources, I'm assuming the Avengers will get some nice upgrades so wouldn't having literally a freak of nature with the bow be upgraded with absolute insanely state of the art vibranium tech be pretty damn sick?

I mean honestly with those upgrades I see him as way better than Captain America, the guy is just a bit stronger with a shield that's obsolete now. Even Black Panther is just a bit stronger/faster etc without his suit, but not godlike like the others. So honestly, Hawkeye with sick vibranium tech upgrades would put him on the upper half. Better than all of the Guardians (maybe not full grown Groot), Captain America, Black Panther, Black Panthers entourage, Bucky, Black Widow. Pretty much only below Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Spiderman (with his enhanced suit and stuff, probably even better than him without it), Dr Strange and Scarlet Witch (and Vision with his stone but he's going to lose that so).

Hawkeye has sick potential with that tech. Nobody else can pretty much go full Legolas, add state of the art Alien tech basically and you have a sick superhero. I mean he would be a god to the Guardians crew.&&So Vision and Rhodey?&&Then Avengers *5* is where The Fantastic Four teams up with Professor X and Co. to resurrect Odin, who reveals *he was behind the whole thing.*&&I love it.

I‚Äôm happy Heimdall did, even if it means his demise. &&Maybe they retconned the retcon and made it so there wasn't ever a curse and Puck was just a guy who was in constant pain because of his size.

Maybe Hawkeye‚Äôs role in the movie is something they want to hide.&&He shoots arrows good and does other stuff good too&&I'd love to see a giant Peter Dinklage lumbering around and looking down at everyone.&&They Might Be Giants?&&Had no idea about this, just seen the mocap pics with Cumberbatch. He's 100% getting the Agamoto then.&&Would that have been for a Great Expectations?  Cause she kinda nailed that one.&&I don't know that vibranium/Wakanda tech puts any non super power person above the Guardians.

Drax's race are clearly tough as shit, Gamora is clearly no slouch either, and I wouldn't be surprised if Quill isn't really just a regular human now, but if he is then he is weak....but on top of that, they have access to the best tech in the galaxy, not just the best tech on earth.
&&The only hero Hawkeye could compete with is Black Widow.

Cap is basically a perfect human. If he trained with a bow and arrow he would be better than Hawkeye.

Black Panther is stronger, faster, more durable, better reflexes and heals faster than Hawkeye, that's without his suit. They could probably go toe to toe for a while before Hawkeye wears out.

Bucky is a little weird as we don't really know what kind of Super Soldier Serum got used on him. But if we are gonna talk about upgraded tech he probably got a pretty sweet arm from Wakanda. Again, same as Black Panther they would go around for a little bit but Bucky would win.

To be honest Hawkeye is a cool character and he has great skills but he is not enhanced at all. Which is the point of the character. His shtick is that he has great aim and the most ""human"" of the Avengers which was the point of his character arc in AoU.&&Avengers 6 is when they have to drive street racing cars to prove to Thanos that they're a family, and there's nothing stronger than family.&&Then the Death Star eclipses the sun!&&I honestly wanted to save Dinklage for Modok.&&2nd best line of all the Marvel movies IMO. &&*cries in jarnbjorn*

&&Alien was '79.  Just saying.&&Thanks brother.&&Fun fact: it *was* rated R initially, but Spielberg managed to convince the MPAA to give it a PG rating. Two years later, the PG-13 rating was created as a the result of another Spielberg movie, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.

EDIT: To clarify, Temple of Doom was rated PG. But it led to such a controversy that PG-13 was created as a result. As many have correctly commented below, Red Dawn was the first movie with a PG-13 rating in cinemas. &&With that man peeling his face off? What the fuck, America?

EDIT: Some people seem to think i'm talking about the alien from They Live, but i'm not. If you watch Poltergeist, you will see there is a scene where a man is peeling his face of in a bathroom.

&&Jacque Nicklesun over here doesn't even have an accurate axe. There's no red on the axe in the movie.

He has a whole bunch of original animation cels for sale, things like Mighty Mouse and others.

I was sort of shocked and couldn't really believe it. I walked up and asked if he was Glenn, he said yes. I had the first Danzig release on cassette in my backpack, so I showed him that and we talked for a couple minutes uninterrupted. I remember him being a little 'too cool for school', but whatever.

I am 42 yo male who is traumatized by the movie. I took my 13 yo daughter there not knowing this and she walked right up to Reagan and pushed the button. Shit was cray yo!&&Yeah, Ragtime from 81 had full frontal nudity and a PG rating. Bet there are tons of more. It's weird how America gone more prudish as a society. And then we have TV shows like the walking dead where we literally see people get eaten alive but no nudity or a grown man saying ""fuck"". My favorite was the episode there was a  naked woman nailed to a tree, but mutilated and flayed to cover up the naughty bits.&&total recall was 1990 and that should count as an 80s movie on the flip side.&&[Relevant thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11eop7/the_complete_list_of_g_pg_and_pg13_rated_films/)&&You most likely meant vulva. A hairy vagina must be a painful medical condition...&&In the US it's G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, X. For R you can get in under 17 with an adult but not NC-17. No movie studios will release an NC-17 movie. 

When Terry Gilliam made 12 Monkeys he was only given two absolute rules by the studio. It couldn't be more than 2.5 hours and it had to get an R rating or less. &&Teens now will never understand the struggle.  I had snowy boobs on the TV both ways uphill back in my day.&&Either that scene lasted 30 minutes, or we paused the tape there a lot. &&Man, Peter Weller has just had an awesome career. Just with Robocop, Star Trek, and Batman Returns, he would have been a legend in my eyes. I'll never forget his voice.

Also, Red Foreman's line:

***Bitches, Leave!***&&So fucking good.&&Also the guy being turned into the Toxic Avenger and the car plowing through him. That was memorable. &&The vocal idiotic moral minority seems to have always existed, but it used to take a lot longer for them to find each other, organize a platform, and create a public spectacle. 

Where before it may have taken weeks or months of festering on the social grapevine, now you can stir the shit with a hashtag overnight.&&Exactly. Social media is destroying our collective sense of idgaf and demands everyone pick a bubble of outrage.&&I think he slept through the last election and just woke up.&&Seven Six Two Millimeter Full Metal Jacket.&&Can u post to that? Also,happy cake day !!&&Not enough 'bitch'&&I love it so much&&You are correct, I was too lazy to check!&&Oh. I must be looking at the wrong thing then, sorry. Coz that pose I'm thinking of is 100% Platoon

Edit: hah, yeah, sorry guys. Just looked closer and saw who you were talking about. I thought you were all talking about the guy with his head back, arms in the air. D'oh!

Edit 2: I didn't notice it was 'between his pecs'. I could've sworn I was responding to someone asking about the guy nestled beneath his armpit. Double D'oh!!&&Agreed. Definitely Young Guns.&&Agreed. I flip flop between which one I prefer based on my mood. &&I actually love this sketch AND G2. &&Being a non practicing Catholic, this movie is the definitive example of evil and horror. My typography teacher in college designed the title, he also created the Star Wars fadding away story intro text. I went to his office once in Hollywood and all his walls where covered with Excorsist and Star Wars shit.&&Yeah we‚Äôve got issues. Look at the outside of a natural naked body that EVERY person has? Nope. Look at the insides of that same body due to some horrific act of anger or violence? Sure thing, let‚Äôs even do it in slow motion from multiple angles so you see every detail... 

Just seems totally backward to me. &&Watched Red Sparrow last night (great flick, could have had more Russian, but whatever) and the people on either side of my wife and I were gasping during sex/nudity, but didn't do much for violence. My wife, on the other hand, is European and that violence had her cringing while nudity was so-so. I'm dead inside, so naturally I laughed through most of it all.&&I remember seeing Clash of the Titans in the theater with my parents when I was maybe 8 yrs old and there was seemingly tons of nudity. At least enough to probably make my parents uncomfortable - and to give me an early start appreciating the female form&&Culturally, the ‚Äò80s didn‚Äôt end until somewhere between 1992 and 1993.&&Also the R rating is arguably responsible for a lot of shit movies. Studios today like to take an IP that would obviously be R, cut out bad words and ultra violence, release it as PG13 so the 9th graders can go see it, then nobody does because it sucks, then release the property version unrated, which nobody buys, because 14yos and the director's friends are the only people who saw it.&&It‚Äôs not quite NC-17 and then X, more the NC-17 replaced X. Some companies unofficially still use it to be rAaaaaaDDDiical but it‚Äôs no longer used by the MPAA.&&Or stealing the lingerie section of the newspaper advertisements before your parents threw the paper away... In a way it was better, you had to work for it and were happy with nearly anything.&&I remember seeing him a while back on Sons of Anarchy and thinking oh shit is that Robocop? He also had a pretty good run last season on The Last Ship. &&Go easy Leonard. &&They are both in there. Emilio from Young Guns and Dafoe from Platoon.&&The movie somehow manages the balancing act of being 80s pop kitsch without being silly.  

Also, bonus points for Clamp being a Trump parody.  ""You make a place for things... things come.""  Seems strangely prescient in 2018.&&Absolutely. G2 was just ridiculous in a good way&&I was stupid enough to watch it despite being almost certain before how much it was going to scare me (I had seen the image of Linda Blair's face in makeup before, used in youtube jumpscares etc.). not going to do a repeat watch (ever, probably).
&&Or inside out. &&*Clash of the Tit-ans&&Sears Catalog was my ffn jam. 
&&I almost forgot his dirty cop boss role in SoA. I wish he had played a larger part, we were supposed to respect his position, but he mainly complained when things got loud.&&What is your major malfunction, numnuts? Didn't mommy and daddy show you enough attention when you were a child!&&Ha! That's right on the money. I've been wanting to watch it again sooo bad, because it's a quality flick, but I can't do it. Not even on Saturday morning with all the sun out and windows open. It's safe to say that I'm traumatized.&&Inside Out was also PG!&&The horror. &&",2018-03-04 01:23:59
