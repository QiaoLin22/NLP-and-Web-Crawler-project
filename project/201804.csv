Verne Troyer passed away today,103750,8dy86c,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bh2FcndHgkC/,3386,1524341138.0,,"Suicide? Damn. &&So sad to hear. We'll miss you /u/vernetroyer. You brought laughter to a lot of people. Thank you. &&Verne was taken to the hospital earlier this month after cops got a report he was drunk and suicidal, and was treated for possible alcohol poisoning. 

So sad to hear, RIP u/vernetroyer&&Loved him in Austin powers and always enjoyed seeing his posts on Reddit.  &&Years ago during an AMA Verne was asked who his biggest role model was [and Verne answered:](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xu9jr/i_am_verne_troyer_ama/cfeojhy/?context=1&st=jg9u7kav&sh=0c5ecfde)

""My parents. They never treated me any different than my other average sized siblings. I used to have to carry wood, feed the cows and pigs and farm animals.""


RIP.&&> ""Depression and Suicide are very serious issues. You never know what kind of battle someone is going through inside. Be kind to one another. And always know, it’s never too late to reach out to someone for help.""




So he killed himself? That's such a schock, I don't know what to say.




> ""In lieu of flowers, please feel free to make a donation in Verne’s name to either of his two favorite charities; The Starkey Hearing Foundation and Best Buddies.""

Let's make it happen, in the name of Verne.&&Rest In Peace, you 3-legged stud. &&OH WOW

So sorry to hear this  :(&&
“Mini Me, if I ever lost you I don't know what I would do.
I would probably move on, get another clone but there would be a 15 minute period there where I would just be inconsolable.”

                                                   Dr. Evil &&Quick Summary: (Also posted under a comment above). 


>""Verne Troyer was an American actor, stunt performer and comedian. He is notable for his height of 2 ft 8 in (81 cm), the result of achondroplasia dwarfism, making him one of the shortest men in the world. He is best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series of comedy films, and for his brief appearance as Griphook the goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.""

[Decenct Biography of him here](https://www.biography.com/people/verne-troyer-212241270). 

Edit: Some clarification about his role as Griphook.   ""In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Griphook is played by Verne Troyer, famous for playing Dr Evil's ""Mini-Me"" in the Austin Powers films. However, Griphook was voiced by Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, as well as the first Gringotts goblin. Because the producers wanted a completely British cast, Verne Troyer was replaced by Warwick Davis to portray the role of Griphook in part two of the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. [Source here](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Griphook). 
&&That's terrible. We lost a Reddit legend today.&&Small Man, Huge legacy.

Verne was always a great character when he appeared on the screen or on reddit & this is nothing but horribly tragic.

RIP Verne.&&Damn. Just had a super vivid flash back of watching Austin Powers in the theater with my best friend during middle school and literally crying from laughter when he humped the lazer.

RIP Verne.&&Damn't. No! Why? Any y'all feel like killing your self. Message me. We will talk. 

As a combat veteran I've had 6friends commit suicide. 

They seem to make their mind up, they don't call or seek any more help. They just do it. 


I have been there too, with a couple attention seeking attempts my self. 


I am glad I am not in that bad place anymore. 

Please, if you feel like hurting your self, reach out to someone. Even a stranger on the internet. &&/u/vernetroyer I'm sad to see you go buddy. You have brought happiness to countless people throughout your career. You will never be forgotten as your legacy will be remembered for ages. Rest easy.&&Damn. Verne was never afraid to be open about his demons. It's unfortunate that things ended this way for him but he made the choice that was his to make. 

RIP u/vernetroyer.&&The last and only time Verne acknowledged my existence was confirming that he was still alive. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6066so/comment/df3wrl3&&This has been a brutal week for celebrity deaths: Milos Forman, R. Lee Ermey, Barbara Bush, Harry Anderson, and now Troyer.&&RIP mini me. You were always one of us. &&This is probably going to be buried, but here is the number for the national Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255&&RIP you glorious tripod.&&Mini-Me, you completed many people including Dr. Evil.

But we hope we completed you.

Thank you for the memories.&&As a mental health nurse in the UK I feel so sad this has happened to another male celebrity.

Depression is one of the main causes of death in males 30+ aged and over. There is still so much stigma attached to males and mental health. Many males are too afraid to speak out for fear of being labelled ""weak"" or ""unmanly"". This couldn't be far from the truth. Please don't ever suffer in silence, please don't fear being judged. There is always help for anyone who needs it.

The Samaritans Suicide Hotline is open 24/7 and NHS24 is there as well (UK).

Rest in Peace, Mini Me.&&Fuck. 

The people that have it the worst seem to be the best at hiding it...

Depression is the worst...&&This is so sad. Depression is such a constant battle, and misunderstood by so many. Much love Verne.&&Wow, I wasn't even aware he was having issues. Very sad, seemed like a good guy. &&Oh wow, this is incredibly sad &&First Avicii, now this legend. RIP.&&Oh this is so sad!  I can still hear his voice...

“EEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee......”&&Rest in peace, little dude.

He was seriously one of the most wholesome people I could think of.&&Man, this one hurts. 

About a year ago I followed him on Facebook. He would regularly post super wholesome and upbeat videos about his life and what he was up to. They were so much fun because of how much fun he always seemed to be having in them. What a sense of humor too, he was constantly cracking jokes and laughing throughout every video. They definitely helped me through some rough patches, in more ways than I could ever hope to put into words. I'm not someone who usually gets emotional at the loss of someone I didn't know, regardless of how famous they were or how big a fan I was/am, but this one hurts. This one hurts a lot. 

Rest in peace, Verne. &&It was really nice seeing him post on Reddit.. May he rest in peace. &&Oh, this is terribly sad. I loved when he showed up in the comment section every now and then. He always seems to bring such a positive and funny spin to things. I hope he has found peace. 

Edit: a word &&Godspeed Mini-Me&&Thanks for all the laughs Verne!&&Shit what the fuck&&One of the very few american actors to appear in a Harry Potter movie, he was more than just an Austin Powers joke&&Hearing he committed suicide, I feel this could help someone out there. 

 If you or someone who know are contemplating suicide. Please reconsider, let someone in, give someone a chance to help. Don't go it alone. 
 Depression is not a force to mess with.

OP and reddit, I wish you the best!

Thanks for the list, /u/bootyduty and /u/navert&&Oh wow, didn’t expect this :( though I know he’s struggled with addiction and other mental health issues. Sad to see he couldn’t overcome those battles. RIP &&WTF. He was playing to reddit pretty regularly for a while. Fuck, that sucks. &&Well this fucking sucks. &&Such a shame. He made people laugh- and that's as good of a legacy as any. &&Noo this is so sad!! I loved seeing his posts on reddit =((((&&Damn this is sad to hear. 

I'm going through a depression myself, never been through it before, but it SUCKS. Basically you feel sad for no reason and have no motivation to do anything.  For him with health issues then it was probably amplified 10x more.   I am working to fight it, it comes and goes.   At the peak I was feeling thoughts of suicide too, it's messed up.  I'm on meds now but today is the first day where I feel I might need to up the dose.   I can't wait to see a counselor.  That's part of the issue, there's just not enough help.  I had to wait almost a month for an appointment date.  It's very hard to get to see someone.  I just hope the counselor will be able to help somehow, I don't want to be on meds forever. &&Never forget Mini-Me :(&&These deaths always come in three and a half.&&Any see the cnn.com headline? 'Mini-Me' dies. A bit disrespectful...&&My boyfriend was just showing me his videos on Facebook a week or two ago. How incredibly sad.

edit social media platform&&Please, if anyone is thinking of killing themselves, please reach out to me. I'm hear to talk. There is no reason to end it, there is always someone there for you.&&Sad news! One of the real humans out there. Was a great presence on Reddit!&&I wish this didn't happen. Such a sweet guy and a hilarious comic actor who made millions of people laugh. Rest in peace, Verne. &&Oh my, may he rest in peace. Such a nice guy and left too soon.&&Somewhere i imagine that ""eeeeeeee"" of mini-me drifting through the cosmos. RIP&&If you guys can, please check out his channel on Youtube, he posted lots of neat stuff like food tutorials, food tastings etc. RIP&&RIP Verne...

Devestating to hear when a person goes way too early...&&I just watched Austin powers 2 last night. I'm absolutely distraught this is awful. &&This is a real shock. He was a frequent commenter here on Reddit and his sense of humour was wonderful. A real loss for us all. Rest in peace, Verne. =(&&We lost a top tier celebrity Redditor today. &&First Avicii and now Troyer. Such a sad weekend. RIP both of them. &&To anyone who didn't know, Verne had a [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLDbKMN_2Be5CSXhilgp-2g) he posted semi regularly and always had wholesome content. He loved his fans.&&Poor little buggah’&&Was not expecting suicide. This is so tragic. RIP Verne. We love you ❤️&&R.I.P. Verne. You filled little shoes, but had a big heart.&&Rip my nigglet&&He was a huge part of the Reddit community. Such a sad day, I always looked forward to his posts. God bless him, his family, and all the lives he has touched. 

Depression is a culprit to those who you would never imagine, those who always have a smile on their face. Would do anything to make someone else’s world better, while their own world is crumbling inside. “Awareness” for this kind of stuff is an understatement for what should be looked at, at this point in Hollywood.&&nooooo. this makes me so sad i wish he would have reached out here we all loved him so much. i understand depression and why he wouldnt reach out. someties it just is just too tough when u have to reach out and u feel like u cant
&&[Anyone else having flashbacks?](https://i.imgur.com/4jwKJVC.jpg)&&He ran over my foot with his mobility scooter at an expo a while back. Sad to hear his passing. &&Probably related to his recent health issues.

Really fucking sucks.&&Just got back from my friend's memorial service. He was a surgical resident at Beaumont Health in Royal Oak, MI, the brightest and most confident person you had ever met, and he took his own life. I'm really just stuck in this loop of ""Why did you do this, buddy?"" but there really is no good answer. The only thing I can say is we need to be more open to therapy, collectively as a country.&&""But doctor, I am Pagliacci.""&&I guess In Bruges was somewhat right.&&His posts were always so random & heartwarming.
&&I always enjoyed the days when a random /u/vernetroyer post was on the front page. He will be missed by many. &&[deleted]&&Yep. Gone too soon :(

In the words of Doctor Evil: ""How about no, Scott.""&&Yes. Thank you, Verne. You were a kind soul. Rest easy.&&I don't think he's going to get that notification man, unopened orange mail forever&&To anyone who didn't know, Verne had a [YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLDbKMN_2Be5CSXhilgp-2g) he posted semi regularly and always had wholesome content. He loved his fans.&&I always liked when you would find him out in the wild on a post. &&he also single handedly raised the compensation rate for little people in film with his breakout success as mini me

as lamented by lloyd kaufman of troma&&[When you sort his profile by controversial ](https://i.imgur.com/QyFpuQM.jpg)

# 8|&&Chronic alcohol abuse will ALWAYS cause depression. It's not something to take lightly, hopefully people can use this as an example. &&his random posts were always so nice to see. what a bummer :(&&Mini Me was a great character and his reddit posts were awesome.

So many great posts, here is one of my favorites https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/8xTyQ

RIP
&&He was king of shitposting, but he was our king of shitposting. :(

RIP Verne.&&I guess it's about that time to re-watch Goldmember.&&Apparently he was born Amish, but his parents left the Amish community when he was a kid.&&Quick Summary for thsoe out of the loop:


>""Verne Troyer was an American actor, stunt performer and comedian. He is notable for his height of 2 ft 8 in (81 cm), the result of achondroplasia dwarfism, making him one of the shortest men in the world. He is best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series of comedy films, and for his brief appearance as Griphook the goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.""

[Decenct Biography of him here](https://www.biography.com/people/verne-troyer-212241270). 

Edit: Some clarification about his role as Griphook.   ""In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Griphook is played by Verne Troyer, famous for playing Dr Evil's ""Mini-Me"" in the Austin Powers films. However, Griphook was voiced by Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, as well as the first Gringotts goblin. Because the producers wanted a completely British cast, Verne Troyer was replaced by Warwick Davis to portray the role of Griphook in part two of the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. [Source here](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Griphook). &&As someone with a disability (albeit a mild one), this statement is like music - it's so much nicer when people treat me like any other person rather than holding doors open for me and tiptoeing around the issue like it's The Thing That Shall Not Be Named. 

Being handled with baby gloves in the biggest insult in the work and leaves you feeling alienated from everyone else. That's where the depression sinks in - knowing that everyone around you, by no fault of their own, will always define you by *that*. 

But being treated as an equal...it means everything. Like when the kids on *South Park* rib on Timmy, it means he's just one of the guys and his impediments are just another thing to make fun of. In real life, it's not as simple. For Verne, I'm sure that feeling was hard to come by. I hope he's found peace, wherever he is. I hope he doesn't feel so alone anymore. 

RIP, fellow freak. 

**EDIT:** I'm definitely not saying you shouldn't hold the door open for people. What I'm saying is that people with disabilities tend to interpret the actions of others in light of said disabilities, which makes it hard to tell when people are treating you differently than they would others.&&I mean, he did have three legs.  The world expects great things from men with dicks that big. &&Damn. Just read his last but one comment on here...

*To get comments and reactions like this, is one of the reasons why I love doing what I do. Thanks for the nice words and I'm glad I could put a smile on your face*

RIP man 

&&It made him the man he was.&&I thought he was having health issues, but yeah, it sounds like maybe he took his own life. Very unfortunate and sad.&&He was hospitalized a few weeks ago after making suicidal threats.

This is so sad.&&Yeah that's an odd way of saying he killed himself but I can't really see another reason for including it.

That's sad. Dude has undoubtedly went through some struggles as the description said. You kinda figure if someone makes it that far, they're okay, but obviously not always. It's eye opening, despite already knowing how depression doesn't care who you are.

It's a shame, really. He was a good actor and had some really memorable roles. His roles were memorable not even because he was so short either, but he was actually a good actor beyond being a novelty role.

He was one of us too. Legit redditor, not just using as some PR platform but he actually posted content and discussed things he was into, completely unrelated from his stardom. Lol people apparently even called him a karma whore but all that means is dude knew how to get points, definitely one us

Edit

I think this was his best reddit post

https://www.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/6r7wl5/never_underestimate_the_size_of_deliciousness/dl46l8c&&I think when a celebrity kills themselves, it’s such a shock and slap in the face because we look at celebrities as these almost like, super heroes. But it always goes to show that every one has battles and problems. Regardless of their job or social status. Sad day. He seemed like a genuine human being. &&Poor guy. Lost my sister to suicide 2 years ago. Can't even describe how it feels at the time of finding out what happened to your loved one. I really hope the family is able to cope as best as they can. &&He's been struggling with depression for awhile, recently was hospitalised after a failed attempt too. Sad stuff, must have had a hard life. Talk to someone if you need to, folks. &&Best Buddies is a great organization.&&This is a good sentiment but don't assume if we don't know for sure. He'd been struggling with a lot of health issues lately related to alcohol abuse.&&That's a damn shame. &&Verne '3-Legged Stud' Troyer needs to be put on the tombstone. It's only right.&&""You're like a tripod""&&Is this actually true that he had a bit dick? What’s the source?&&Very active on Reddit as well at times.  He posted some great stuff.  He'll be missed for sure.&&WHAT HAPPENED :,(

This is terribly tragic. &&Quick Summary for thsoe out of the loop:

RIP&&Small or not, I don't think body size matters but he's memorable all right&&He was great in every Austin Powers scene.

Like the scene where he’s humping Beyoncé’s leg, or the look of shear terror on his face when Austin starts attacking him in Goldmember.&&We need more people like you.

But if anyone needs someone to talk to I'm a good listener and even just a great emotional punching bag.

&&[deleted]&&Sometimes even help doesn't work. An acquaintance of mine had pretty intensive care in her last years due to her being depressed and suicidal. It looked like she was doing alright, or at least not worse, when she killed herself in a small window of time where she had been left alone. I think her husband still blames himself for leaving for those thirty minutes. &&That’s a kind gesture. From someone who doesn’t necessarily need that kind of help today, but may in the future, thank you. &&Solve my problems. &&Awkward username, here.&&Sorry to hear that bud, glad you're doing better now. So sad about Verne, he was a funny and amazing guy. &&You're doing the good deed! I'm glad you're still here and help others to not lose hope.

I'm too unempathetic to help suicidal people. But as long as there are others (like you) that aren't, I still have faith. &&Thanks for saying this. It’s often not stated enough that suicide is anything but selfish. 

People who get to the point of suicide have already lived for others as long as they possibly could. &&So it was *YOU*&&You motherfucker &&Bruno Sammartino.&&Dale Winton, too.&&Avicii&&Carl Kasell of NPR too&&Art Bell&&Carl Kassel for NPR listeners :(&&Bruno Sammartino.&&And Bruno sammartino. &&Art Bell also &&No Mini Me, don't eat mini Mr. Bigglesworth.&&Just the two of us.. you and I. &&I hope it doesn't, if you're outside of the United States, [here is a directory of suicide hotlines](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines).&&Yeah, looking at his reddit posts he seemed to enjoy giving people relief from whatever pain they were dealing with.

I count 3 times on his front page where someone would comment ""having a rough week, this made me smile"" and he would always comment ""this is why I do it"".

Solid dude, he'll be missed.&&My father played golf with him years ago. Said he was amazingly generous. ...on the 15th Verne had a double bogey and wrote down par! Just kidding, but he really did say Verne was such a generous and heartfelt person. 


I have an autographed ball somewhere.

&&what health issues?&&Depression and suicide in the medical community is way too prevalent unfortunately. Something needs to change &&i left to go to a concert one saturday night, stopped by my dad's house before i left town with my bros -- everything was normal, he was in a great mood, laughing watching a movie that was on tv. he had money, no money troubles. hell he gave me like $500 right before i left just to ""spoil your friends, have fun!"", he did shit like that all the time for no reason, nothing out of the norm

i got back from that concert the next day, stopped by his house and he was dead. shot himself thru the heart (i guess so i could have an open casket funeral)

he left no note. nothing. no explanation. so yeah, why?

it's been like 4 years now and i ask myself that every fucking day. i have no idea why, and i guess it doesn't really matter anyway. he's gone. like you said, there's no good answer anyhow &&The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling. -David Foster Wallace

I almost guarentee someone posted it, but it really does help the people who have friends/family commit suicide.&&Therapy isn't a magical cure all. It would certainly help a lot of people though and should be made more accessable. Money wise, but also the social stigma. Depression is still scoffed upon by some.

An acquaintance of mine had been depressed for about two decades and had therapy for about as long. The last two years especially were hard on her and she received 24 hour at home care. She still killed herself. Left a note written months before she did. Hanged herself in a small window of time where there wasn't anyone with her. Her husband was only gone for like thirty minutes and found her when he came back.

Edit: I just want to make clear that I'm not against therapy. I do however feel like it's sometimes glorified. That you just have to talk to a professional who will cure you just like how a broken bone is healed by a cast for a few weeks. Unfortunately it's not that simple or fast for most. &&Not just as a country, as a species. People die far too often because they get in their own head about issues that would be easier to resolve if we just talked about things more. &&20 years after my friend taking his life in high school, I ask myself the same thing. Why? &&Sorry for your loss.&&Loneliness, hopelessness, unable to fix your problems, existentialist thought process about your purpose in life, not having a purpose, only purpose is as a joke.

There is nothing to live for if you aren't happy. &&>as a country

??

as a species. It's a problem everywhere. &&When I'm most depressed is when I have the most motivation to act like I'm not depressed so people fuck off and leave me alone. The (few) people who have stuck around knowing me for a long time are fine whenever I'm mopey and sound suicidal, but get pretty worried if I'm being happy. it's different for everyone though, obviously.&&> I'm really just stuck in this loop of ""Why did you do this, buddy?"" but there really is no good answer.

The way I see it, he didn't do it. The disease did it to him, really no different from cancer except in the fine print. That's how I've come to terms with losing a mentor to suicide several years ago, under similarly bewildering circumstances: this was someone who *really* seemed to have it all. But depression doesn't care about that any more than cancer does. It's a biochemical ailment that doesn't require a logical reason to be sad. I know how hard the person I lost fought to try to defeat the disease for many years; that's the action I credit to him. He had to win every time to keep going; the disease only had to win once. And I don't hold that against him.&&A good friend of me and my boyfriends shot himself in the head yesterday. We cleaned up the site for his wife. It sucks. &&I feel your pain, my best friend shot himself when I was 15, I’m 37 now. He still looks the same in my minds eye.

There is a dude that comes into the bar I hang out and he's got some sort of disability. Not sure what it is but he can barely walk, but he does, it's just really really fucking awkward.

It's oftentimes perceived as a threat/manipulation tool (think ""wow now he's threatening to kill himself, very dramatic, "") or as something selfish (""how could you even think about putting your family through that?""). I have clinical depression and struggle with suicidal thoughts at times. It's REALLY hard to tell someone, because they might 1) take it personally 2) try to get you committed just for admitting you have thoughts even if you don't plan to act on them 3) accuse you of being dramatic or manipulative 4) say ""you're scaring me,"" and implying that it's wrong to talk about your suicidal thoughts.

I once told my dad that I had called a suicide hotline that week. He treated me differently for months. There was no ""how do we get you into therapy"" or any of that, he was almost upset with me for going there. We need to work on getting rid of the stigma associated with talking about suicide.

I made this the day Robin Williams committed suicide. I was very broken about it, though I never knew the guy.

He thanked me sometime later. Saying how serious he was about killing himself. 

I didn't do anything. I just listened. 

Him telling me that changed my attitude about it and made me realize that's all I wanted too, was someone to listen to me. 

You may think you are too callous to be empathetic but you can be callous and still listen. Even just the little ""uh huh, yeah.. I know"" while playing video games like I was, could help.

I'm going to show this to my family. I attempted to truly kill myself for the first time in my life on April 10th and you succinctly summarized how I felt and why I did it. 

I've been dealing with mental illness my whole life and for the past decade I've spent my time trying to fix myself. To understand. That fire analogy.....fuck. Too real. 

That pain. Those proverbial flames. I wouldn't wish it on Hitler himself. Hitler was a human. A fucked up and broken human, but he was born human just like you and me. Hate begets hate. 

Tired of trying to find the fix or answers only to end up in that searing agony again. 

Got my BA in psych. Have taken a myriad of meds. I try and eat healthy. Go to therapy every week with my amazing therapist. I try and try. But just the stigma alone of my struggle makes it hard. That my mental incapacities or struggles make me a lesser human than everyone else. That me not being able to handle returning to work two days after I got out of the hospital was because I was weak and didn't know how to handle stress and a normal job. 

Fuck man. That's why I work so hard to make to others happy and smile. I want them to know the joy of love and kindness and not emptiness and fear.&&My Mom took her life last year and I still try to come to terms with it everyday. Little things like this help me to understand it more. thanks...&&Depending on what state or country you live in, saying you feel thoughts of suicide is an instant trip to the men in white coats. Therapists (in most states and countries, it does vary) *have* to report you or they'll lose their license, so you better just say you're fine if you don't want a 72 hour mandatory evaluation period and the stigma that comes with spending a weekend in a psych ward... 

Which is a shame, we should be able to talk about it, it's the whole point of therapy after all, but that's how it is.&&Its sad that some people...honestly...are beyond help. Most the people who feel that way are NOT beyond help, depression just makes it seem that way.

But there are some that even with access to the best care on earth just can't do it. Celebrities and rich people are good examples. They can afford the best therapists and the best medicine complete with DNA analysis and still...

Its not unlike some physical wounds we just can't fix yet. But... just like with physical healthcare, mental health is making huge huge strides which  means more and more formerly hopeless people can be saved and live happy lives.&&Because sometimes it hurts too much to be alive.&&I'm sorry but if it helps in most situations like this  there simply isnt a big reason why,  they just work very hard to hide their mental suffering and they can leave randomly on any day, and its not your fault.  He probably wouldn't want you to feel awful thinking about him years later.&&I feel for you my friend. This November will be 15 years since my best friend in high school killed himself 2 days after my 16th birthday. I and our other friend had no idea he had been dealing with some very personal issues caused by a traumatic childhood abuse experience. If only I had known, maybe things could have been different, but I don't blame myself. It happened, there's no going back, and the future is what is important. The best thing to do is remember all of the great times we had and all of the things about him that made him so special. &&This reminds me of a bit in one of Norm Mcdonald's recent stand up specials. To paraphrase: ""Every time someone commits suicide, a few people always go 'I don't understand, why would they do that?' and I'm always like... what, you don't know about *life*?""

Personally I don't feel like I can relate to anyone who can't understand why someone would commit suicide. If you can't, you must live a very blessed life, and I'm jealous.&&That's fair, I can only really speak for the stigma that exists around myself though.&&That's it man.

If I'm diagnosed with it I'm not putting my kids through that.&&One of the major reasons that newspapers and other established news organization often refuse to mention suicide as a cause of death is because of copycat suicides. My friend used to write and edit obituaries. Even if the family insisted that suicide be mentioned as the cause of death, the paper refused.

So yes, when an obit says ""lost a battle with X mental illness"" or ""suffered bravely til the end"" or ""struggled with addiction,"" the person probably did kill themselves, whether intentionally or not.

The refusal to publish suicide info (whether pertaining to a private citizen or to a celebrity) is part of the ethical guidelines established by news media associations.

I’m noticing that there is a change when reporting on celebrity suicide now. I remember 15 years ago there was this attitude that you shouldn’t disclose that somebody took their own life, because it might inspire others or, more likely because there is stigma tied to suicide. Now, there seems to be a more open approach which I think is good. Depression is very real regardless if people want to know about it or not and we should discuss it a lot more than we currently do.

Check some of his music out, like _wake me up_ or _the nights_ and _adicted to you_ are some of my favorites.&&He was on a TV show many years ago that was like a celebrity big brother with has-beens and he famously would walk around blackout drunk, naked, peeing on everything. Dude's sadly had a terrible alcohol problem for a long time. RIP :(&&Let's not kid ourselves, life ain't fucking easy on little people. They will never, ever, experience truly normal human social interaction, regardless of how normal or desirable people mistake it for.&&Oh that's terrible. RIP&&Completely uneducated guess, but I'd imagine alcohol would be much harder on him because of his dwarfism. I can't imagine how badly it would fuck up his body. &&He was also hospitalized in 2002 for alcohol poisoning, where he nearly died.&&It's not even that. Surgical residents easily work 80-100 hours a week in very malignant and heirarchical environments with the threat of failure looming over the heads. Failure that can mean discarding 9-13 years of sacrificing your social life, relationships, and economic security as well as something you've aspired to do your entire life. Add in 200-300k in loans, being uprooted from your entire support structure every few years, and a constant struggle with doing more and overcoming imposter syndrome and you end up with the abhorrently high suicide and attrition rates among surgical residents.&&I am a doctor in a residency. The patients are not the problem. Like *at all*. 

Regularly working 80 hour weeks and being (silently) encouraged not to log your *real* duty hours because they break the law is the problem. You sacrifice your entire life. 

I have gone two months without checking my mail. I have sacrificed friendships and one relationship; I've missed weddings and births among close friends and family. I wasn't there for my sister when she went through a mental break. I'm 220K in debt, and that will only increase with time as I pay a lower rate on my loans because I'm not making an attending's salary yet. I make a good salary in residency, but if you divided my salary by the hours I work it's less than a minimum wage. 

Add to that the mental stress of the job. Not from patients, but from my supervisors. I am constantly under scrutiny. I am also tested regularly throughout my career--it didn't end in medical school. In addition to the Step 3 exam I take during residency and the boards exam I take afterwards, my residency also requires me to pass a monthly in-house exam. Add to that I am also expected to regularly manage my clinic inbox, where I do orders and answer questions for my primary care patients I see perhaps once a month or less.

So I am working 80+ hour weeks, at a salary that would be less than a minimum wage by hour, constantly under (what can be, depending on the attending, very harsh) scrutiny, with very little social life whatsoever. And when I go home from a 15 hour day I have to then study for unending exams and manage my clinic inbox. 

Now, having heard all that, hear this: I'm in a less harsh specialty (IM rather than, for instance, gen surgery) at a less malignant program than many others, and it's *wayyyy* better than it used to be. 

Residency is a Darwinian crucible. It takes more fortitude than intelligence to survive.&&As a resident I can tell you it’s not the patients. It’s the working conditions where you’re expected to work 80+ hour weeks and constantly feeling like nothing you do is good enough after a life time of being an overachiever, which is what got you into residency in the first place.  &&Suicide happens when the pain becomes greater than the person's ability to handle it.  Mental anguish is a real thing.   &&I think that works for some, but not all cases. My voice teacher in college took his own life, but I understand his action more than my friend in HS. My teacher was an amazing painter, pianist, and singer. Then he had within the span of 3-4 years a brain tumor then a stroke. The stroke really ruined him, and completely obliterated his quality of life. THEN his wife started cheating on him. His action was a response to feeling like his life was spiraling out of his control. Now I most certainly wish he hadn't done it, but I can understand the weight on his shoulders. I saw it everyday. But my friend, 13 years old. Just a kid with his whole life ahead of him. The greatest 3D spacial awareness and ability to build things of anyone I've ever met. I will never understand. Not a single day goes by that I don't think of either of them. I can tell myself stories to satisfy my curiosity in passing, but I'll never know, and I have to be okay with that. &&That's why no one should it against people that have done it. At least they ended their anguish on their own terms.&&I am so sorry. 15 years is big. I know what you mean about wondering if I had known if things could have been different. I agree. Mourn. Cry.

From my exceptionally limited contact with celebrities (literally one, if we're talking real celebrities, but multiple known names and that counts I guess) commenting on stuff online isn't rare for them, it's just not done under an official account. Some random anonymous account you shout at for being dumb could be famous...&&Yeah he seemed like a genuine and fun guy.  As a kid I loved the Austin Powers movies, getting to interact with him through Reddit made him feel like more than just a celebrity to me.

Sad to know that he had so much pain in his life even though he was able to bring joy to many people.&&>one of the few celebrities who posted to Reddit visibly and not using an alias to remain anonymous

Added to that, his exceptional physical characteristics and you can only wonder what post-fame Hollywood must be like.  

You'd hope the guy was able to have genuine relationships vs going anywhere and being treated like an oddity or has been.  

My point being, I never have characterized Hollywood as being a friendly place. I can't imagine it was any easier for a person with exceptional physical characteristics.

Here's to hoping I'm wrong. &&I can tell you there are days where I’d rather take a bullet than go through another cycle of chemo since I was diagnosed &&My Dad always said that if he was getting to a point where he couldn't take care of himself, he'd rather take a bullet. He died a few weeks ago after suffering over a year with cancer. In the end he was a shell of his former self. It was sad & I would not want to go that way. I think assisted suicide or compassionate death, whatever you want to call it, should be a legal option.

As a sober alcoholic it is tough to read because I can relate so much to them. I have lived and known their struggle. Alcoholism is a terribly underrated problem for people who have never suffered from it. Not just the alcoholic suffers. Their family and friends lose them long before the disease takes them. 

If you know someone that suffers from this please try to understand it is very likely that they themselves have almost no desire to be like that either. It is not something I can put into words but when the addiction has you in its grips the ""old"" you is either dead or hidden. Hiding from the monster that is alcoholism. It is terrifying. I would not wish true alcoholism on my worst enemy. Quick edit: This does not excuse their behaviour or make anything ok.&&Not to make light of situation, but does alcohol affect differently based on size? Or does alcohol tolerance play a factor?

Edit: I don't drink. Personal choice &&Tom Cruise has done all right for himself. &&It's also my understanding that they keep those 80-100 hour weeks because the people that came before them have this antiquated notion of ""well I had to do it so we're going to keep the 'tradition' around"".

Or do you take matters into your own hands and end it quickly?&&It really doesn’t matter what’s going on in somebody’s life or how old they are. Kids can experience depression just as well as adults. I don’t mean to invalidate how you feel about everything. I want people to recognize that life can be really hard, even for young people. It seems like quite a large number of adults dismiss the idea that life can be hard for kids because they compare it to how much more difficult life seems to be as an adult. I really hope that you get closer and closer to finding some closure with these people that you really cared for.

On a slightly different note, I watched this incredible movie last night called “And Then I Go” that beautifully illustrates how difficult it can be to be a kid. I definitely recommend it.

Having worked in journalism for about a decade (as a freelancer--I'm not important) I've run into countless and often non-obvious restrictions that editors place upon the medium. It mostly boils down to people in power trying to do good in the eye of the public, even if that sometimes means playing dumb. I do not like that professional attitude, but it is what it is. &&As a Little Person myself, I feel the dark clouds of that realisation now and then, and I think it will always be there. I know even Peter Dinklage has said the same, and how that's why he could never feel comfortable being any sort of representative on behalf of those with dwarfism, when he doesn't know how to be entirely at peace with it - and probably never will.

Fortunately, 90%  of me is driven, self-assured and content with who I am and how the people important to me perceive me. It's just that 10% that says to me *""When you're dead, you're just going to be a fucking dwarf. To everyone else, that's all you are. A joke.""* 

Gotta keep silencing that voice and believe that I can have dignity and nuance like anyone else.

**Edit:** I'm not really sure how to say this, but the people saying stuff like ""don't worry everyone feels that way about stuff they're insecure/depressed about,"" it isn't really helping. I've had depression and insecurity - that really isn't what I'm talking about. I'm *not* insecure or depressed about my dwarfism. This is much more of an external thing. How people perceive me is a very vocal and obvious force. This whole issue started a social movement in Germany recently when a dwarf actor died, because he was primarily referred to as a dwarf and nothing much else in the media. That's sickening. And people with dwarfism commit suicide because of how trapped it makes them feel.  This isn't about having a trait you feel down about. It's about the whole of society clearly seeing you as just a medical condition or a gimmick.&&The show was actually called The Surreal Life&&Considering that percentage of alcohol in your blood determines the extent of its effect, and blood volume is affected by size (among other things), of course.&&Body mass directly determines how much of an ""impact"" drugs of any kind have on you - alcohol is a drug.

That's why Andre the Giant could drink like an absolute maniac (and kinda had to, because he was self-medicating for all the chronic pain his gigantism caused).

&&Yes, it does.  It's not a universal constant, but it does play a heavy role in alcohol tolerance.  

On the other side of the scale there was Andre the Giant, and for him a can of beer was basically a shotglass of beer.&&Yes of course alcohol affects differently based on size. &&Absolutely. I'm physically a lightweight, and when my tolerance is low even a few shots would get me drunk. Apparently he only weighed ‎35 lb (16 kg) which is less than a quarter of my weight, so I'm guessing even a shot or two would absolutely destroy him. &&I was physician recruiter specializing in surgeons for several years. I can tell you that they literally say that. Though as you'd expect things were always harder for them back in the day. ""I slept at the hospital for three weeks once! I had two wives leave me!"" Yeah, that sounds awful. The people in charge should do something about it...oh, shit, you're the guy in charge.&&Yes and it's systemic. They have nurses, doctors, fucking everyone pulling in absurd shifts (17 hours??) on a routine basis. With the amount of overcharging and loss in the hospital system, it's no fucking wonder people die from malpractice and neglect. 

No one, no matter how intelligent is going to be nearly effective at the end of a 17 hour shift...and it's not even for any reason. 

The entire career bath is pretty brutal more often than not. &&Ya, I've heard that the medical community, both during school and while entering the work force, has some serious issues with what is essentially hazing. &&Uhg, such bullshit. What is this called... ""Passing on the Burden""? ""I suffered so you must too""? Theres gotta be a name saying for this kind of behaviour. I first became aware of this in middle school. There was this ""tradition"" of ""trashing"" 6th graders. The 8th graders would single out new to middle schoolers and dump them headfirst into a full open garbage can. I always hated the idea that ""it happened to me, so I'm going to do it to someone else"". I escaped that situation by immediately fighting anyone who tried it on me. 

Why do we do this? It even happens in relationships. ""My last boyfriend/girlfriend cheated on me, so I'm going to cheat on my new boyfriend/girlfriend"". So fucking stupid.  &&Part of the reason for the long hours is so patients don't fall though the cracks during staff changes&&Thank you for saying this. I got a lot of dismissal when I was a terribly depressed teenager. Now I'm a mostly okay 30-something. I made it. Many others do not, and I can understand why. 

The thing with kids of all ages is that we have to remember that what they're experiencing and how ""big"" it feels to them is related to what *they* have experienced. Not what we have. It's like a toddler who goes into a full-blown meltdown over dropping his snack on the floor. To a 2-year-old, that is a REALLY big deal. 

Same thing for teens. I see teen heartbreak dismissed a lot. I guess because adults know that for most people, a teen breakup hurts, but life goes on and soon enough it's just a thing that happened. But to the kids going through it it feels like the biggest thing ever. Add in depression and the fact that kids can't regulate their emotions like adults and you have a situation that is truly awful for the kid. 

Many people have this attitude that being a kid is so great and life as an adult working and maintaining a household is the really hard stuff. And I'm sure it is like that for some. But for me and I'm sure many others, you couldn't possibly pay me enough money to go back to those years. Fuck that.

TL;DR: Treat kids with respect and kindness. Don't dismiss their feelings and struggles just because they're young. &&Yes! Most definitely. I've struggled with depression my while life and puberty was the toughest time. Hormones are fucking horrible and really distort your perception of things. &&My dad had a major stroke and other health complications. It totally changed him as a person and my mom went from being his wife to his full time caregiver. Her marriage essentially ended. She never cheated but I can absolutely understand why someone else would. Not because they don't love their spouse, but because they still have the same desires for a romantic relationship as anyone else but their spouse really isn't in a position to provide that. &&I've never retorted with this, but every time I've been told that, the first thing that comes to mind is that the best Leaders lead by example

He's one of the biggest names in EDM (you've probably heard a song of his at some point in your life even if you don't like the genre). His style isn't everyone's cup of tea, but his influence is undeniable. He was also a genuinely good and humble guy who lived and breathed for his fans.

Not that long ago you'd have residents putting in 48-hour shifts, but the Libby Zion law was passed after the sleep deprivation of residents caused the death of a patient. Now Residents are limited to 80-hour work weeks and 24-hour shifts (which can be extended by 6 hours, but with no new patients.)&&The reimbursements are getting lower and lower and politicians and insurance companies wont turn it around until the doctors stop seeing patients.

Also, having a maximum number of hours and capping shifts leads to more handoffs, which is where issues arise.&&As adults, we often tend to dismiss any kind of drama that happens in high school, because it's so much different than the ""real world"" we live in. To adults struggling to support themselves and find their place in the world, high school seems like life on ""easy mode"" and it certainly feels like compared to adults, most teenagers don't have any real responsibilities. 

Teenagers make a huge deal out of high school relationships and drama because for them, high school IS their whole world. Yes, life is harder post- high school, but these kids aren't there yet, and for them high school is the toughest environment they've ever had to deal with. Even though most of them don't have to worry about supporting themselves, they still have a lot of responsibilities, and there's a lot of pressure to do well in school/ get into a good college, AND be popular among their peers. The fact that they're not yet independent adults does not invalidate their experiences and feelings. &&On one hand, ""In sickness and in health"" is the promise you made in the beginning.

for example: alcoholic neuropathy, white matter damage, decrease in brain volume, hepatic encephalopathy, wernicke-korsakoff syndrome, seizures&&No, you cannot. I think they were saying the diabetes was from alcoholism. Alzheimer’s pathology involves specific forms of cellular proteotoxicity. Alcoholism wouldn’t be causative, but it probably wouldn’t help either. &&Early-onset Alzheimer's is strongly genetic and developing symptoms in one's 30s is extremely rare - early onset cases are usually found in 40s and 50s. But chronic alcohol abuse is certainly a risk factor and these things do happen to young people. &&I can appreciate dark humor.

Looks like they actually married for 5 years '06-'11&&On deck&&> how many hours do they work now? 

For a lot of them... still way to many. I know many cardiologists who work 6 days a week, ~10 hour days, and they have call on top of that. When I was shadowing interventional, they were complaining that 1 guy was on vacation that week... thus the others had to pick up the patient load. The system is nuts... instead of taking less people the hospital (and payment structures) urge them to keep it up.  

That's not true for all specialties or all doctors, but it's true for too many. *Regardless*, the eat-the-young and ""we went through it you can too"" attitudes are still not good and need to go. &&A shitload of hours, still. These guys work too much, in my opinion. Unfortunately there's a doctor shortage on. I did locum tenens (short term gigs, usually filling in for a doc who's sick or having a baby or whatever), and one of the main selling points for the ""locum lifestyle"" as I liked to bullshit it as was that you'd actuslly get regular time off.  Still, they're really throwing their own young into the deep end of the pool, which is also boiling and filled with sharks.&&Since no one here has mentioned this yet, there's actually some evidence suggesting that long shifts help patient safety because they provide better continuity of care. A lot of medical errors happen during shift change because its really hard to sign out a patient you know well to someone who has never met them before and things can easily slip through the cracks during the handoff. So when looking at shift lengths it's kind of a trade-off between tired docs and lack of continuity, meaning it's not quite as black and white as you might think. &&People have studied enforced shorter shifts but you end up with more patient deaths/injuries because the handoff between doctors creates mistakes. The handoff could probably be improved, but probably nobody wants to spend more money to hire more people.

Surgery is even harder to tackle. Sometimes people have 10 hour heart surgeries. You're not changing the surgeon half way through, and even changing the other staff is a pretty bad idea, so when you add the the before and after stuff, you've easily got a 15+ hour shift.&&For profit healthcare is a plague upon America.

I don't want to detract from what you're saying, but it's worth mentioning that the movie is set in the early 90's, which places it over 25 years in the past.

I look up from my drawer and there he was, gruffly asking for his movie. 
    
I was so struck by his sudden appearance that I mis-punched and gave him the wrong movie. The 5ish seconds that followed him telling me this and me realizing I'd possibly upset Gunnery Sgt. Hartman were some of the most tense I've ever experienced. I was certain he was gonna tear me a new one. Instead, he just laughs and makes no big deal of it.

- R. Lee Ermey.&&It never even occurred to me that this man could die.&&Legend doesn't even begin to describe him. One of his most underrated roles for me was as the sheriff in *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre* 2003 remake. His character really disturbed me to the core, his performance was chilling.

RIP big guy.&&Rip&&Veteran, Actor, and Stand Up Guy. A fucking shame pneumonia got him. It should have been a Tank or a Bear &&You climb like old people fuck private pile! Rest in Peace Gunny&&He definitely had the common courtesy to give a reach around.  RIP&&Heaven just got a lot more shouty&&This guy used to be a spokesperson for Toys For Tots.

Sure he was an intense character in movies but he was known to be an extremely compassionate individual.

RIP Sir&&Many of you probably already know this but here goes anyway-
 Legend has it that Ermey wasn’t originally cast in the roll of the drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket. He was hired only to coach the original actor hired for the roll. But Kubrick was so impressed, he fired the other actor and hired Ermey- who wasn’t an actor then himself.&&I hope he got permission to die.  Otherwise someone's ass is getting kicked.&&""If you ladies leave my island, if you survive recruit training... you will be a weapon, you will be a minister of death, praying for war.

RIP Gunny. &&Truly, he was America's sergeant. 

I have no idea what that means, but his performances, especially full metal jacket, will be remembered for a very long time&&I met him in GTMO for the USO tour. He lined us all up like Full Metal Jacket and let us have it at our request. We were all having a ball. He signed all my DVD’s and was really glad to be there. I’m gonna miss him. &&He's had many great scenes, but I always loved that scene in Seven when he's having a discussion with Morgan Freeman at the station, and the phone near the chair he's sitting in keeps ringing, until he picks it up.

When I was a kid I saw Saving Silverman before I saw FMJ so this was always how I knew of him originally.&&SOUND OFF LIKE YOU GOT A PAIR!!!

R.I.P. Sgt. Get them Angels into tip-top shape upstairs.&&I met R. Lee Ermey once. It was at a large gun store and he was touring for some kind of glock promotion or something. 

I figured because of everything I’ve seen that he’d be a hard ass. When I actually met him, I couldn’t have been more wrong. He was the nicest guy with a soft and calm voice. I asked him how often he signs copies of full metal jacket, as he signed my own copy. He says “a day doesn’t go by that I don’t see one of these.” We had a chuckle and posed for a picture. 

After the signing was a hand shake and a photo op. I asked him if we could take a picture of him yelling at me while I did push ups. He laughed and suggested something else. Instead we took a picture of him strangling me. We had a laugh as I shook his hand and I mentioned to him how I had taken the morning off of work just to come and meet him (true story, I really did). He gave me a sincere look as he told me thank you and gave me a solid little dog tag with with the team glock logo on one side and his image on the other. That was about 8 or so years ago and I still have it to this day. &&“They’re...making us their girlfriends.”

“WHAT?? THEY’RE MAKING YOU WEAR DRESSES?!”

RIP.&&I BET YOU CAN SUCK A GOLFBALL THROUGH A GARDEN HOSE&&I am sad he is gone, not because I was like his #1 fan but because hes been around for so long that I can't even think of a someone else to fill the same roles that he has. I'm thankful I got to be around for that, because he was absolutely perfect. &&So sad to hear.  I loved him in his silly rolls like Saving Silverman


https://youtu.be/T1w9K_OrRhg&&This hits home hard for me as a marine. 

This dude is only (I think, don’t quote me) marine to have ever been promoted after he retired. He was a staff sergeant when he retired, but got promoted to gunny because he was such a good dude in his role on mail call. Think about that, and the repercussions. This dude was the mr Rogers of the marine corps. 

I’m gonna have a few beers and call m marine friends and reconnect because of this dude. That’s crazy. He’s still bringing people together even after he died. &&One of the few people Stanley Kubrick let get away with adlibbing.

RIP R. Lee

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlcuPNv8Od8&&I had the pleasure of meeting him at Ft. Benning GA. He was down there for a filming of Mail Call. He was such a humble man and must have thanked me 20 times for serving our country. He only had a brief moment to chat, but he told me that his ribbons and medals on Full Metal Jacket were all his. He was very well decorated. Rest easy friend. I'm glad I had the pleasure of meeting you. &&R. Lee Ermey in the Afterlife

Hey, fuck you R. Lee Ermey. I can so do this. I'll show you, you fuck. How dare you doubt me?&&He looks like he could suck a golf ball through a garden hose.&&Ermey improved most of his dialogue and [all of the ""insult stuff""](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/the-rolling-stone-interview-stanley-kubrick-in-1987-20110307) for his role as Gny. Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  

Probably the only person allowed to improvise dialogue in a Kubrick film.  

>Director Stanley Kubrick had nothing but praise for R. Lee Ermey's skills as a performer. Kubrick originally was going to write dialogue for Ermey's character himself, but he became so impressed with what Ermey improvised, he decided it was not necessary. He simply let him ad-lib, an act practically unheard of for a Stanley Kubrick film. Ermey's performances were so faultless that Kubrick only needed two to three takes to get his scenes filmed, which was also extremely rare for a Kubrick film. The only instance Ermey had to film more than two to three takes was in the ""Jelly Doughnut Scene,"" which he claimed was filmed in 37 takes, to the point his voice kept disappearing from [time to time.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093058/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv)&&[My favorite picture of my time in the Corps. ](http://imgur.com/O5OvQc0)&&""Sir, I can't help it, sir""&&I admire your honesty.

Lee Ermey and Sam Kinison getting into a shouting match.&&He's singing happy birthday to Jesus in person now. &&>I'd say fifty percent of Lee's dialogue, specifically the insult stuff, came from Lee. You see, in the course of hiring the marine recruits, we interviewed hundreds of guys. We lined them all up and did an improvisation of the first meeting with the drill instructor. They didn't know what he was going to say, and we could see how they reacted. Lee came up with, I don't know, 150 pages of insults. Off the wall stuff: ""I don't like the name Lawrence. Lawrence is for faggots and sailors.""

>Aside from the insults, though, virtually every serious thing he says is basically true. When he says, ""A rifle is only a tool, it's a hard heart that kills,"" you know it's true. Unless you're living in a world that doesn't need fighting men, you can't fault him. Except maybe for a certain lack of subtlety in his behavior. And I don't think the United States Marine Corps is in the market for subtle drill instructors.

-Stanley Kubrick&&It's not true that he wasn't an actor at that point. He had already played drill sergeants a couple times previously.&&Also, legend has it, one of the only people Kubrick ever let improvise. &&The original actor cast for the drill sergeant is still in the movie - he's the ""GET SOME"" guy shooting villagers from the helicopter in one scene where Joker asks ""How can you shoot women and children?"" And he replies ""Easy! You just don't lead 'em so much!"" (With the machine gun) https://youtu.be/S06nIz4scvI&&I’ve also read that, when Kubrick was talking to him, Ermey yelled “You stand up when you’re talking to me” and Kubrick instinctively did, which landed him the role. &&It is also said that Kubrick had to ask him what a reach\-around is.&&Wasn't legend, he was hired as a consultant. Order actor couldn't cut it, especially when compared to Ermey. &&Also heard one of the things that convinced Kubrick to put Ermey in that role was Ermey had recorded himself doing the drill instructor scene while being pelted with tennis balls and gave it to Kubrick. He never broke character and Kubrick put him in the film &&I do believe that Chesty Puller had to have come down from Heaven and directly handed Gunny his Transfer Orders.

In the Army you just call everyone a Sergeant but in the marine corps you will get fucked up for that. 

I did my MOS school on an army base and the army people would request we just called em Sergeant but if one of our marine NCOs caught us calling a Sergeant First Class “Sergeant” (for instance) we would be fucked up. &&Gotta agree.

Eight eons of basic training now await him, and he is feeling pretty content. Why is he so content? Because for some strange reason, their new drill instructor is a human that came from the earth above, a mere mortal that is now destined to spend eternity instructing demons on eternal warfare. It is obvious that Satan has no need for another battalion, and they will be spending the next eight eons punishing this disgraceful human for his sins. Satan is always thinking of new ways to punish the damned, and since this is how the human lived on earth, they will be performing several unspeakable acts of psychological madness on him. Seefus sits down on his bunk as Satan walks in, surveying the recruits around him. This is what all the demons believe. They are, however, wrong. Satan looks gleefully at Seefus, then smirks at a couple of other demons playing cards at a nearby table they had set up in the middle of the alley. ""I thought I told you to stand at attention."" He rumbled at the soldiers. They all laughed, but the laughter quickly faltered as Satans face obviously showed he was not joking. Satan quickly smiled and said. ""On second thought, at ease ladies. This will be fun. For me at least."". Satan walked to the front of the alley and stood at attention, before calling out. ""They are ready for you sir!"". *Sir* thought Seefus.. Why would the Prince of Darkness call anyone sir, a mortal at that. Feeling uneasy he stood up and stood at attention. The other demons sat around uncomfortably, readying their pitch forks as they listened to heavy boots walking down the corridor towards them. ""Should we go ahead and stick the little shrimo as soon as he shows up Satan? Or should we commence psychological shaming by acting out of line?"". Droigen asked this as he stood up. But before Satan could say a word, their new Senior Drill Instructor entered the light of the flames, looking at Droigen with disgust. The demons blood ran cold as the moment of realization passed through them, cold as a blade in the arctic tundra. R. Lee Ermey walked up to Droigen, bitch slapping him in the face. ""What the fuck did you just call me you little shit brained maggot! Why the fuck are you not by your bunk! WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE PLAYING CARDS!!!  AM I GOING TO HAVE TO FUCK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU UNTIL YOU CAN NEVER LOOK YOUR PARENTS IN THE EYE AGAIN, OR DO I NEED TO RIP OFF YOUR HORNS AND SHOVE THEM IN YOUR DISGUSTING EYES AND SKULL FUCK YOU? MAYBE THEN YOUR BRAINS WILL WORK RIGHT AND I WON'T FEEL LIKE I AM TEACHING PUSSY TO A BUNCH OF QUEERS!!! "". The demons all scampered to their positions, several, pissing themselves.
Edit: This short story was made to honor R. Lee Ermey. I am no implying I think he went to hell. It is a tribute to how badass he is and how much I will truly miss him. Also, everyone knows marines never die, they just go to hell to regroup. RIP sir, you will be missed.&&When I read your post I'm hearing him yelling those words to the demon lol.  I definitely cannot read it without hearing his voice in my head.  &&I love how we just assume the fact here that he died and went to hell.&&Best wishes to you and your family. Glad you guys have many good memories to cherish about him. :)&&I had the honor of seeing him in Quantico several times. Everyone wanted to shake his hand and he was ALWAYS smiling. I never got to actually shake his hand though.

I always wanted to tell him how much he meant to me as he reminded me so much of my Grandfather - a career soldier, combat officer, D-day veteran, as well as Vietnam. My grandfather loved Full Metal Jacket and I got to watch it with him once. 

I asked him why Hartman man was so mean to the recruits and he replied solemnly ""he's preparing them for war."" That was all I needed to hear.

Your great uncle will be sorely missed. &&Sorry for your loss. &&The family didn't want news of his cancer coming out. About a month ago, his doctor took x-rays and noticed holes forming in his bones. Treatment caused the sickness and pneumonia, and being so weak already, it unfortunately took him. &&Pneumonia is no joke really especially in older people. When travelling to hot places make sure you dress for the flight back.&&Pneumonia is a very common cause of death.&&back when they had actual programming and not re-runs of Pawn Stars/American Pickers/Hitler conspiracy theories&&I literally was thinking about this show a few days ago and was wondering what R. Lee Ermey was up to these days. This makes me really sad.&&Check out the blooper reel from that show on YouTube, it’s like an hour long and it kills me every time.

I’ll get a link in just a second

Edit: Grammar&&You experienced what every Marine recruit feels at the end of boot camp. You enter it, scared shitless of the loud, permanently angry D.I.s and deal with it.

IIRC, Fincher said Emery was 'wrong' for Doe, but his strong presence made him a credible boss for Morgan Freeman (who oozes confidence and authority).&&From what I remember, he wasn't so much about that character all those years after.

Also, all you had to say was “The GET SOME guy” and anyone who has seen the movie will know who you’re talking about. &&That guy definitely wouldn't have made this movie the way The Gunny did, but he played that role perfect. Glad we got R Lee Ermey where he was, he sure pulled off the part in FMJ.

That’s quite a few cast and crew, but then again, the first movie is 23 years old this year, so it’s not terribly surprising. &&I lived in south Stafford County (same as Quantico) and the apartment above mine was pretty much rented to Marines. 4 of 5 had Ermey pictures and stories of him hanging out at local military places.


 I never served, but he really seemed to stick around and hang out with the younger generation. No one had anything to say bad about him. He was always a Marine and never forgot his roots. &&*grabs junk mail and proceeds to the lawn*&&Really...&&his war voice really was perfect. &&And Satan fear it&&That was awesome.&&[mumble] stupid mortal with his stupid hat...[/mumble]

I personally was never too close with him because I grew up in WA and he lived in CA but the memories of him are ones that I will never forget.&&Thank you so much. He was a family man, and I'm glad to hear he gave you a sort of happiness and connection. I'm sure he would have loved to meet you and have heard about your family!&&And it's not even meanness. Drill sergeants might be incredibly tough but usually are fair and are really into their job and really care about training young marines. I wasn't in the marines, but in Army basic, none of my drill sergeants were ever ""mean"" to anyone. You don't take it personally&&Same here when I was a little kids I watched his show and I liked it but I thought he was scary.  Until I saw a twinkle in his eye and a repressed smile one time.  Then I realized he was just like my Pops ( who was a sergeant in WWII) who was also the sweetest kindest most loving family man, who loves spoiling us grandkids and could out Bellow a bull.&&That makes a lot more sense.

By the end, the stuff the DIs said was hilarious, we were constantly having to suppress our laughter. &&Your ass looks like about 150 lbs of chewed bubble gum!&&Yeah go ahead and repost it, your secret is safe with us&&But you still couldn't wipe that stupid grin off your face.

How's your seeing eye-dog these days? &&Cant, images have to be 25 years old to post there. This is from 2003.&&I was on my first on-base liberty with a friend and we headed into Camp Pendletons commissary.  We gathered some snacks and walked outside.  Gunny was there manning a little booth with two stacks of papers in front of him.  The stacks in front of him were 8x10s of his character in Full Metal Jacket.  I recognized him immediately - how can you not? - He's Marine Corps personified.  Anyhow he didn't have a line just him standing behind the little booth. So I walk up and introduce myself.  I tell him how much I adored his role in Kubrick's film and I asked if he'd be cool choking me like he does Pyle. He didn't hesitate and started choking me immediately.  My buddy had my camera - the disposable type- so the smile I have is me nervously laughing and telling his ass to hurry and take the picture! The Gunny had a mean grip! 

We talked afterwards for a while about boot camp, he was really excited to hear about our experience.  He was a down to earth man, I remember being in awe of the sheer size of him. The Eagle, Globe and Anchor ring on his finger was huge. The globe looked to be a diamond! Just massive! He probably talked with us for an entire hour. He asked about us mostly - who we were, where we came from, what our goals were - He was genuinely interested in our stories or at least it seemed that way. I'm sure he'd heard them a million times from different people. But as a boot-fresh Marine it felt amazing to not be talked down to by such a cultural iconic figure especially as we were being talked down to by everyone else. He signed 8x10s for both of us and wished us well in our travels. 

I found out later that he would do that booth thing a lot. He didn't charge anyone a dime. It turned out we were lucky to have had the time we did because most times he'd be very busy. I'm very thankful for everything that happened. I will always remember that day. He made me look forward to my time in the Marines.

He asked what I bought and I told him and asked about his hometown. He asked if I was from the area, I said yes and he chuckled and pointed at the pistol saying, youre going to need that. Felt honored I got to meet him. &&Their job is to train people not to die.  It's a very important job&&Reminds me of David Schwimmer's character in Band of Brothers, captain Sobel. The real life man was also super strict during training, but the men in that company later credited him with keeping them alive during the war with the preparation he gave them, and according to Sobel's family, he was a great father who loved his kids more than anything and was kind and gentle.

Another example is Bob Ross, angry drill instructor, turned gentle and kind painter. It seems to be a pattern.&&He was always super upbeat and never really showed any signs of slowing down. That was the Marine in him!&&I always thought he was older. I’ve seen a lot of those older military guys stay in good enough shape to whip your ass well into their 60s or beyond. &&Young isn't the word I'd use. He was old, but he seemed like one of those old fucks who discovered that the secret to immortality was to be too stubborn to die.  Like realistically you know that he probably isn't long for this world but in the back of your mind you have a sneaking suspicion that he'll outlive you somehow. &&74 isn't very old, so that sucks. &&I think they screwed up by distancing themselves from Chumlee after his drug bust, they should have embraced it and made a 30-minute reality show of him getting all spun out and fighting with his tweeker girlfriends every week.&&R Lee Ermey is a great guy, and I'd really love to have his show on my channel.  But it only makes sense if I can get it at a really good price.

Really the build up process is almost done entirely by yourself. They make you feel worthless and at some point you start to tell yourself that you aren’t and you prove to them that you have what it takes. They will continue to ridicule you because otherwise, you won’t make that change in character.&&So this is just from my experience at Parris Island but they subtly build you back up. The first bit is just shitting on you constantly.  In the beginning you literally can't do anything right, even if you do something right, they make it wrong. 

As boot camp goes on you do more and more things you've never even thought you can do, all while these 3 men constantly berate you. You continue to do more and more things and slowly, your confidence builds.  

As boot camp goes on there comes a point where they stop fucking with you as much, or maybe you just can handle it better. It's honestly hard to tell because you've changed more in two months than many people change in 2 decades.

The final part of boot camp is called The Crucible, and for good reason. They throw everything they have at you for two days. Minimal food, minimal sleep, maximum effort. They push you past what you would've considered your breaking point. It's at the end of this that you realize what you can achieve. You aren't invincible but you're stronger than you ever believed. 

It's why the Marine Corps is so proud to be all volunteer. The title of Marine is always earned, never given.&&DON'T PULL MY HAND TOWARDS YOU, LEAN FORWARD AND CHOKE YOURSELF!&&""Are you through grinning?!""&&""Did your parents have any children that lived""

And when Kubrick yelled “cut” as he will so many times, Ermey when all Hartman on Kubrick, which is a good way to never work in show business again.  After wards he apologizes in private to Kubrick and said it was to establish dominance over the actors, and Kubrick fires the original actor.&&Boot camp is like being stuck in an insane comedy stand up. For 3 months. And you're sleep deprived. And learn how to kill people. And you have to pee into one toilet with 5 other dudes at once. And sometimes you get beat up.

One of my drill instructors was watching us while we pulled pits at the range once. This was on Parris Island which has an insane amount of sand fleas. Anyway this guy sort of pretends that nobody is watching him and let’s one land on his arm. 

He goes through the entire DI chow hall speech with the sand flea letting it drink his blood. “Attack the chow hall!” “Move the blood to your face not your face to the blood.” He isn’t yelling this he is just talking to it. After a few minutes he finally says, “Stack trays.” Which means we are done eating get up right now. The sand flea obviously doesn’t stop eating so he raises his voice a little like, “I said stack trays!” Finally he smacks the sand flea and kills it mumbling something like, “that’s what happens when you don’t listen to the drill instructor.” After that he just kinda wandered away and yelled at recruits and stuff. 

These guys 100% drink beers and come up with funny stuff/share ideas all the time. This was the same guy who crawled in through a window when we were on our personal time and went underneath a recruits bed and just listened. At some point he jumps out and starts making fun of this kid for something he was talking about. Hilarious. It was 10 years ago I wish I could remember more specifics!&&My hats off to you boys!

&&The people that watch this stuff watch it religiously and actually buy the products advertised.  That's why their opinions matter more to the media.  &&Agreed 100%&&I feel it’s become a hobbit/collectibles history channel. They do talk a little bit of history, but it short little snippets here and there. 

The History channel now panders to the average attention span time. 15 seconds of history here and there and then right back to the senseless banter. 

I miss the days of when people callled it the Hitler Channel. No reality programming just documentaries (for the most part). Granted they might have been heavy on the Hitler, but it was hands down way better than watching a man disagree with an experts opinion on the value of his rare Pokémon cards. Without a doubt Pokémon has made a mark on recent history, talking about the value of the cards is not history worthy, that imho is a hobby/collectible. 

I miss those days a lot, but they aren’t coming back because that’s what the statistics have said the average American attention span can handle. 

&&I love how the contestants pretty much never complain about it being unfair, too. Even the most egotistical guy I've seen on that show - and who I was sure would blame the judges if he lost - accepted that his blade was inferior and the winner deserved it.

[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8g52uw/lucasfilm_congratulates_marvel_studios_for/dy8xyw6/) has a safe, interesting comment about previous congratulatory images.&&That light saber could really come in handy in the next movie. &&[A brief history of these congratulatory images](https://imgur.com/gallery/lhYoT)&&Disney high-fives themselves. &&I feel like that is the rude way to hand over a lightsaber.

EDIT: had a spelling error. Also, the hand blaster is also facing out so it's fair. Sorry Disney.&&Dear Disney

Way to beat Disney at being Disney. 

Love,

Disney&&Disney now has 9 of the top 10 biggest opening weekends of all time with only Jurassic World being the exception.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/&&Perfectly balanced, as all things should be &&Infinity gauntlet would be more badass than iron man's gloves...&&*Mickey Mouse laughs evilly in the background*&&Then Ironman throws the lightsaber over his shoulder&&[removed]&&And with a snap of his fingers, Thanos wiped out the DC Cinematic Universe &&That's nice. Feige and Kennedy are friends, nice to see studios congratulate each other.

Would have been better with Rocket's little racoon paw though hahaha&&Does anyone think the iron man hand looks weirdly shaped?&&[I've seen this picture before ](https://i.imgur.com/bIsMGn5.png)&&That really should have been Thanos' hand in the Infinity Gauntlet. That film was his movie more so than the Avengers&&I love this tradition. Dates back to Spielberg congratulating George when Star Wars eclipsed Jaws I believe. &&Dear Disney,

Great Job in your success.

- Sincerely, Disney&&[deleted]&&The tradition continues. &&If only they were handing over the reins to the franchise...&&Disney jerks itself off and we all get to watch. &&""I am the light saber.  The saber and I are one.""&&And then iron man proceeds to throw the lightsaber over his shoulder...&&In all honesty, Infinity War is going to be super polarizing. There's an Iron Man and Captain America sex scene. It's hardcore. I mean r e a l l y hardcore. It's like 50 shades of gray squared but responsible and consensual (always get consent kids). It really brought the movie together and established their friendship and regret for past hatred. Of course they threw their adorable quips (as Disney does) like ""I'm surprised that IRON Man has trouble getting hard"", ""Could you have any more toys, Inspector Gadget?"" (how does he even know what that is?), and ""Thank you for your service"". Every scene they had together held the strongest feeling of sexual tension I have ever felt in a movie. Be it the staring, ""accidental"" penis touching, or when Stark said ""I could really go for a hot dog right now"". Overall, this movie made me gay and fall out of love with my wife. How am I going to tell her? She'll be devastated.

10/10&&Aww, that is nice, but I really hope Kathy is not expecting that lightsaber to get passed back anytime soon, I doubt any of the Star Wars films currently announced will be outperforming Infinity War.&&Well of they keep raising the ticket prices this will go on forever. &&[deleted]&&I like how Chris Pratt was a giver in the hand off to Star Wars and a receiver again in Avengers&&Sonething something Spiderman meme&&Isn't this just Disney patting itself on the back?&&Literally Disney handing a trophy to themselves. &&What a crappy font &&*Iron Man tosses lightsaber and walks away*&&Kathy could learn a thing or two from marvel &&It's not like Kathy Kennedy really did anything ground breaking.  She inherited an extremely popular franchise to make a movie in.  It would be like if J.K. Rowling sold the Harry Potter rights and then WB decided to make a 9th Harry potter movie.  It would probably be very successful, but not because of anything WB did.&&AVENGERS SPOILERS BELOW!!!!



To which Kevin Feige said: You wanna know our secret? We didn't start the movie by having Tony Stark flipping off Dr Strange and being like ""I'm out, come on Pepper"".

We also didn't kill off Thanos like a bitch halfway through the movie, and spend the rest of it with Proxima Midnight slowly chasing the heroes through Wakanda.

In addition, when Gamora died, she died, she didn't float through space and reach out to Peter Quill. And lastly, we decided to have the final battle be with Thanos showing up in person in Wakanda rather than some hologram to fight the avengers.&&Great sentiment, poor delivery. 

Sort of like The Last Jedi.&&What self indulgent ivory tower wankery.&&The Disney corporation congratulated the Disney corporation for making money? Fucking amazing&&Or Disney just saying well done Disney for beating Disney in earning more money&&From Disney to Disney ""Congrats on your big win Disney""  "" Oh thank you Disney, you're so kind""&&* One Disney property congratulates another Disney property in thinly veiled marketing ploy *

FTFY&&To Disney, 

Congrats!

Yours, 
Disney &&Except The Last Jedi was an abomination &&Shut up Kathleen. TLJ is still a train wreck and it's your fault. Episode 9 better be fucking perfect.&&Literal masturbation&&[deleted]&&Fuck u kathy... &&I hope Rey gets a mystical axe in the next movie. &&I mean, ironman had a friggin laser sword in this one and it didn't exactly help.&&Hands do tend to fall off easily in Star Wars...&&The Marvel universe has technology far beyond a lightsaber. There's a character in the comics who has one and it's not really that special.

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? It's almost literally called a lightsaber. It's sweet but not particularly powerful technology compared to a lot of stuff in the Marvel universe.

Now I'm imagining Speilberg desperately making movies in an attempt to overtake star wars over and over.&&Where Cameron's image when his movie got passed&&It’s funny seeing Chris Pratt on the dinosaur for the Avengers seeing as he’s in both universes now. &&[deleted]&&It's cute&&I, for one, would watch a movie with T-Rex Thor.&&r/humblebrag&&I can't believe Jurassic World made that list.  

Was it due to increased ticket prices and 3D/IMAX or something?  I don't remember it having that much hype.&&As a non-American, I had no idea that Jurassic World had sold so much. I've seen little hype for the movie when it was released, didn't see big lines in the theatres (today for Infinity War it was **100% crowded**), and nowadays it really isn't as remembered as the rest.&&Wait so BB-8 get’s a medal and Chewy gets fucking *stiffed again?*.


thisisbullshit.&&So you mean to be telling me, that all of these fantastic franchises and loved movies that will be remembered for hundreds of years, was most likely a bi\-product of a perpetual dick\-swinging contest?

I couldn't come up with a better motivator if I tried.&&Well it's Kathleen Kennedy congratulating Feige more than anything. They are still two different studios with two different groups of people. It's like when the school soccer team congratulates the basketball team for making it  to the finals.&&[deleted]&&http://mrwgifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Barney-Stinson-Gives-Himself-a-Self-High-Five-On-How-I-Met-Your-Mother.gif

&&If I just made a ridiculous amount of money, I would high-five myself as well.&&Only real way to celebrate, tbh.&&Is It weird that they just bought Lucasfilm and they are so out of the loop that they didn't put the four dots after ""[A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away](http://edgeeffects.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/A-long-time-ago-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away....-580x322.png)""? It's like they don't want to know. &&Shit I never thought about that. Just wait 10 - 15 years for when Disney runs out of ideas and we get Dr strange appearing in the third reboot of the Skywalker saga. Rip&&So if a kid congratulations their sibling, is that the parents high-fiving themselves?&&Whoops turned it on&&[deleted]&&You are right. The correct way to hand over a lightsaber is to point it at yourself. Just like you would hand over some scissors. &&yeah surely the handle first scissor/knife rules apply here.&&In all fairness, like another person on here pointed out it's like your schools basketball team congratulating the soccer team for winning a championship. 

Same school, different groups. &&Eventually Disney will own all movie theaters, and the only box office movies will be Disney movies. Everything else will require you to watch at home be it shows or Netflix movies.&&This is only the USA right?  I was pretty sure Furious 7 held the #1 opening weekend internationally till Infinity War.&&Missed op having Rey balance the saber on her finger with Thanos reaching out.&&With that logic you could keep cutting things in half until they're all gone! &&By one giant company &&While I agree.. this all kinda started with Tony&&The gauntlet represents one movie. Tony's glove represents the entire franchise.&&Yeah it seems like Iron Man beat Star Wars there. The Gauntlet is a hand thing and is a clear identifier of IW. &&This is what I thought!&&So uncivilized &&It'll be hilarious and everyone will love it!!!! /s&&[removed]&&Honestly he really did. Affleck is done especially if his solo movie is crap. If Aquaman isn't outstanding that's done. They still haven't gotten anywhere with Flash. Lol at the Cyborg movie. All they have is Wonder Woman 2. They need a reboot in order to be successful again. Which is a shame because Cavill really is a great Superman.&&I think it's fair to say they did that themselves. &&The DCEU is dead. Bury it. Consider this mercy. &&Of course *somebody* has to drag DC in... 🙄&&Or Hulk with just a thumb and forefinger.  &&THANOS GAUNTLET&&It's because it's like they're handing off a baton, so picture iron man facing away and holding his hand back to take it.&&Also the fact that he is MISSING HIS RING FINGER&&My man!&&He's not in it for glory. Just saving the universe.&&I took it as representing the whole universe, passing on the torch to the MCU essentially. Which Iron Man is still very much the poster boy for. &&Would've been kind of a spoiler...i'm sure i enjoyed the movie more bcoz i didn't watch any trailers, and didn't know there was going to be sequel...&&It's nice that Marvel got the record back because they're responsible for starting the tradition back up.&&Yes but it was domestic (?) number 1 title then. Now it's opening week-end. 

It's actually disappointing if it's really domestic that Cameron didn't do something when TFA beat Avatar as number 1 movie domestically. &&*Disney hosting the oscars*

“And the award goes to...”

“Us!”&&Honestly. We're living in a golden age of comic book movies imo. What a time to be alive.&&They've been watching that sort of thing over at /r/rule34 for years.

[NSFW of course]&&We paid to watch&&That's Anakins youngling slayer thank you very much&&That's the one Rey uses so it makes sense.&&If you could even call it a fight. He fucked everyone's world in half a minute without even touching them (outside of Cap, who he laid tf out), and then broke Scarlett Witch as a person letting her kill Vision, just to turn back time, take the stone, and kill him again.

It was so incredibly hopeless.&&I'll never understand how that script got approved, it missed the mark on so many levels.&&... and names it Susan. &&Yeah, I was wondering why Tony didn't just try and cut his arm off instead of pulling the gauntlet off.

Then you remember that they dropped a satellite on him, hit him with a space ship, and after that beating and more the most he got was a cut on the cheek.

Thanos would probably use a lightsaber as a toothpick.&&Yeah, looked really similar to the halo one.  It was cool though.&&Seeing as though lightsaber cuts through Sci fi steel like clay I think lightsaber beats Tony laser sword &&You can tell Tony has played Halo 2.&&He did? I don't even remember and I've seen it twice already.&&In one of the later Iron Man movies Stark deployes 2 laser things from his wrists and slices through everything in a massive range, far surpassing the area of effect for a lightsaber. And the Asgard teleporter gun thing seems way better than hyperspace travel.&&Coming 2021, ""Indiana Jones and the Great White vs Raptor"".&&I remember the first time I saw it was when Star Wars was rereleased with Greedo shooting first.  It had to suck a little for ET to get dethroned by Lucas just juicing the numbers for Star Wars again. &&Spielberg = Kathy

Lucas = Star Wars

Kathy = Star Wars

So basically this is just Kathy congratulating herself over and over again and finally handing it over to Kevin&&Star-Lord aka Peter Quill was on the T-Rex when he was congratulated by the Avengers. Little did we know, Owen Grady aka Velociraptor trainer joined the Avengers to stop Thanos, and will probably have to battle himself for box office supremacy when Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom arrives. &&> its like 75% Speilberg and Lucas trading places

Speilberg, Lucas, and KATHY!&&Was. Now it's just Disney masturbating.&&The Titanic image was for all-time gross. I guess when Avatar passed Titanic that James Cameron didn't feel the need to congratulate himself&&His movie didn't get passed, it's all time gross for the older ones. Well I guess Avatar passed Titanic but Cameron didn't congratulate himself (logically).

Later marvel started the tradition back when JW beat Avengers OW record but it's not the same record anymore. &&I found no evidence that Cameron plays this game, which lends credence to the idea that he might be a bit of a humorless dick.  I love a lot of what he's done, and I respect him a great deal, but I disagree that comic book movies are on the way out and Avatar is on the way back in.&&His movie never got passed if you adjust for inflation and population growth.   

He's not going to congratulate a movie that sold half as many tickets as his.&&To be fair, most of the images were done when the movies passed the top worldwide gross. As of now, Avatar and Titanic still hold the number 1 and 2 spot. 

Furthermore, Avatar and Titanic didn't hold the top weekends (they achieved their gross through massive legs), so that wasn't a record they broke. &&Someone has to pass him first...&&He was then, too, right? I think Jurassic World came out well after GOTG&&Shame they never had him reference himself like Lego Dimensions.  Imagine Pratt's JW, GotG and Lego Movie selves all converse about how familiar they sound.&&He was in both at the time as well.&&Yeah they're basically photoshopping images (pretty badly too) now while they made an effort before. The best one is Star Wars congratulations to Titanic. &&For real... all that money and they can't hire an internal Disney artist to draw a solid ~~torch-~~ lightsaber-passing image?&&I'm surprised that Deadpool didn't try to mock the humblebrag by doing this gag in some way with Matrix Reloaded and R-rated openings, or with X-Men Origins Wolverine for best Ryan Reynolds opening.  &&It was pretty hyped up, I heard many people say that and TFA were their most anticipated upcoming movies in 2015. It was a long awaited sequel in a popular franchise.&&It was very hyped at the time.

Dinosaurs are pretty timeless, and it promised to attempt to recapture a lot if the magic the original did.  Just like TFA, actually...&&[deleted]&&Oh it did have that hype. I remember watching it at the cinema and there was sell out after sell out. &&It had the worst actors (except for Pratt) in any movie I've seen the past couple years. &&Jurassic Park is a pretty big cinematic totem pole. Yeah, the sequels were meh at best, but World offered up a very similar nostalgic experience like The Force Awakens. 

Revive a beloved film franchise at the point many of the original dinosaur loving kids of the first one are adults? Bank.&&To the outside observer it still looks like a circle jerk&&That's actually a pretty good analogy. Well said!&&All owned by the same rich people.  &&I tried to explain to the organization that I work for that it's usually not a good idea to like your own posts but they insist because it ""adds to the algorithms.""

I might be lonely. &&RIP Han :(&&You don't even have to be a jedi!&&I guess in the right hands, it saves the “light” side.  &&Yep, Return of the Jedi [got it right](https://youtu.be/en8bh60K7m8?t=56)&&Ya, same as [knife etiquette](https://lansky.com/files/2613/6553/9450/Pass_the_knife.jpg)&&But sideways makes the most sense.&&I agree, but maybe it's subliminal as in, they'll overtake Inifnity War eventually once Episode IX is released&&It would be more accurate to say if a school had two teams in one sport and one won one year and then the other won some other year.&&This makes sense, but I think it’s more like the  soccer team that won the title three years ago congratulating the soccer team from the same school who won it this current year. &&Fun fact: in Cloud Atlas, people say 'Disneys', not movies, because Disney makes all the movies and owns all the studios and cinemas. &&Considering Disney is also doing their own streaming service, they might actually be the one to require to view it at home &&and then it will be like that show incorporated, and everyhing is ruled by like 5 corporations...disney, netflix, amazon, and prob some chinese corp.&&[You are correct homie](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/worldwideopenings.htm)...

T'Challa is an Obsidian Ubermensch who rules a Secret Technological Utopia that has fought off foreign invaders for Centuries.

Cyborg, on the other hand, is pretty much a utility more than an actual person. He operates the Boom Tubes so he's essentially the Justice League's chauffeur, he's the youngest member of the team so everybody talks down to him, and he has no junk.

Now, if they had gone with John Stewart, it would be an entirely different story. All American Army Ranger who uses his knowledge of mechanical engineering to recreate the same weapons and vehicles he used during deployment.

Perhaps a Rebirth of sorts?&&I don't like this that much because it wasn't Thanos or Marvel who did this, it was Warner Bros making bad choices with the property. They're really the only ones to blame.&&This has all happened before and it will happen again.

There were scattered ones, but 2000 to now has been pretty steady. I suppose you could call Golden Age 2008 to now though, but that feels harsh leaving out what came shortly before that.&&Woah man, watch out with those crazy and unique opinions &&Martha&&I heard Emma Watson is going to be in it. &&Strange should have put a portal over his arm. Boom. Instant win. &&Also he literally punched the mirror dimension at one point.

I was literally thinking before that, ""Why doesnt Strange just imprison him in the mirr....aw shit he punched it. he punched a freaking dimension!""&&They should have poked him in the eye. &&You know who should have cut off Thanos' arm? Thor. Got too caught up in revenge to do it tho 💔💔&&So was my gf, complaining they didn't cut the arm... Us like have you ever played video games? Some heroes/villains are too hard and resilient. &&It's **immediately** before Thanos completely wrecks him, and only for a split second. 

Like another commenter said, it looked a lot like the Energy Sword from Halo. It was so fast and irrelevant that I might not have noticed or remembered it otherwise. &&It's kind of hard to compare. The comics are a mess because of magic and so on, but in the MCU we know that *most* technology is behind Star Wars - a big plot point in Ragnarok is that interstellar travel would take weeks on end, whereas an expensive hyperdrive in Star Wars will get you across the galaxy in a few minutes. Lightsabers in Star Wars are archaic weapons - terrifying in the hands of the Jedi, but more likely to burn the average person's ear off than actually help in battle. We don't seem to have anything along the lines of the (admittedly ludicrously OP even for Star Wars) Death Star in the MCU yet - even the Power Stone is just a Base Delta Zero.&&With head mounted pew pew ~~walkie talkies~~ lasers.&&Yeah but then Speilberg went and walkie-talkied all over ET, so you can feel ok about it.&&Gone With the Wind is #1.  Star Wars is #2.  E.T is #4

&&Aka the Disney Mafia godmother making everyone kiss the ring?&&Who are Kathy and Kevin?&&There's not a chance Fallen Kingdom comes close to Infinity War. A lot of people were disappointed by World and it had a huge opening because it had been a long time since there was a Jurassic Park movie, let alone a good one. Infinity War was a decade in the making with almost 20 movies leading up to it. &&Deepsea Challenger was his congratulation to himself.

Six ex-wives cant be wrong!&&[deleted]&&Fun fact: He’s the first person to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench solo and only the third person ever.&&I wonder what gimmick Avatar 2 will be paired with, the only reason the first movie was so successful was because of 3D which is not that popular nowadays&&He was a good sport on Entourage. That is my extent of knowing anything about his life. &&There have been comic book and comic strip movies since the dawn of cinema. When it wasn't superheroes, it was Blondie (who has over a dozen movies in a few years!) and Jungle Jim. We've had Superman movies and serials since not long after the comic book Superman debuted. We've had Flash Gordon, Zorro, Mandrake the Magician, and L'il Abner since before movies existed, in radio plays and even stage shows. 

People act like comic book movies are a trend, when they're really not. They've always been around. Even if you go back to Greek theatre in the ancient world, the tales of the gods were essentially comic book stories. Super-powered people fighting great and powerful villains to save humanity. It's THE most common theme in our storytelling. &&Comic book movies definitely aren't on their way out. I'd still watch five new generations of Avengers movies if they maintained the quality they have now, but I'm also a big Avatar fan, so I'm looking forward to the handful of sequels written and directed by James Cameron. Don't forget, this is the guy who made the greatest movies of the Terminator and Alien franchises. I have complete faith in him.
Looking forward to seeing how the world of Pandora is expanded with the next few films.&&Just look at other properties that took a long haitus.  Sin City comes to mind, too much time passed and when the second Sin City came out no one seemed to care.  Same with 300, second one came out, people didn't seem to notice.  Independence Day long haitus and Ressurgence comes out, total dud.  It's hard to say what Avatar 2 will do, we're at 9 years now, the fervor definitely has worn off.  Ten years is a long time for a sequel in this day and age.&&Only a year after. Dude has had an excellent run so far. &&There was also no reference to Sherlock despite two actors playing him and being together for so much of the movie. Worst movie ever, reboot the MCU /s.

Though there is actually one small reference.

Got one of the biggest roles in this movie, too.&&My first introduction to Cyborg was the original Teen Titans animated show and i feel like there he was a great character.
Most other incarnations i've seen, not so much.

John Stewart would've been a much smarter choice but then DC thought they could start with their Avengers and work backwards and that people wanted a ""Shazam"" movie so i'm not sure smart choices have been anywhere near them for a while now. &&Well they did try a green lantern movie a while back. It sucked, they know it sucked, Reynolds knows it sucked, DC wants nothing to do with Green Lantern. 

We need a Green Lantern movie that focuses on the Green Lantern and not his powers. Actually that kind of goes for the last few DC movies. Focus on the characters and  not the powers. Powers are cool but they don't mean shit if there is nothing to support them.&&I agree. But then again I think most JL stories are improved by adding some John Stewart. &&For a second I thought I was in /r/marvel with how badly this comment misrepresents Cyborg's origin, history and abilities.&&who said dc’s black character has to challenge marvel’s?? wtf r u on about &&They're convinced he can't be positive because then it would be boring. Captain America proved them wrong.&&Yea I kinda like his portrayal in the end of Justice League movie.  You know,  all smiles,  no angsting,  actually saving people and beating up bad guys. &&I feel like most of the actors are well casted really (Momoa is great as Aquaman too). The problem comes from the film quality itself. Even the best one Wonder Woman is not that good IMO. It would probably be a middle of the road movie in the MCU nowhere near the top. That third act is quite horrible. &&Cavill is a perfect looking Superman. The awful dialogue/stories and his wooden acting did him no favors in that role.

I'd love to see his Superman where he has personality and other humane traits moreso than stoic, depressed, angry Supes. It would also be nice to see him under a director not obsessed with nihilistic, neoliberal Ayn Rand bullshit.&&I really have faith that some day they'll get their shit together.

I actually think Deadpool opens the door if DCU would realize the opportunity.

People don't like DC Movies and they are starting to not sell just because their name. I don't know anyone who saw Justice League and that's fucking crazy.

If DC decided to make its movies ultra gritty and raw as fuck and oh yeah fire the fuck out of zach synder and maybe clean house as far as actors go too. Just for a fresh start, I enjoy gal gadot and Ben affleck, but the others leave a bad taste. I guess Ben was in that trashy BvS movie but I really don't think he was a problem and with a proper story and direction he could be a legit batman.

I say fuck it and do up a flashpoint story. You can weave in Earth 2 and give us a reality where the superheroes don't suck. Grab the guys who write the flash show if you don't want it to be dark & gritty. That show is the best thing DC has done since The Dark Knight.&&They had so much potential with Suicide Squad.&&probably because of the green lantern movie. i keep forgetting that exists. &&That last meme with Chris Evans that popped up yesterday might be what does him in.&&man that clip always makes me queesy. hard to think about &&[deleted]&&My man!&&Aaaaand subscribed&&Of course &&Do you actually agree, or are you just being cheeky?&&That's the malthusian myth.

Id love to see someone use the power of a portal properly. It can cut through literally anything instantly, nothing you can do about it.

Avatar is what made 3D popular.&&lol at people still being pressed about avatar's success&&I happened to check IMDb for this recently bc I have never seen avatar and wondered if they were making a sequel... I want to say they are up to 7 in pre production &&I agree.  The Beatles were trying to make Lord of the Rings, and I recall Bakshi's animated attempt at LotR too.  What changed is the ability of studios to commit to something so epic visually while reducing their financial risk.  MCU figured out how to keep a stable of actors long enough to tell an epic story.  Harry Potter did the same thing.  Game of Thrones and Walking Dead are doing it with varying degrees of success.  It isn't that comic books are the trend, it's that there's a shit ton of great stories out there that people haven't been able to tell through film because it hasn't been possible until now.  And with some properties it's still not possible (Dark Tower and Wheel of Time come to mind).&&Not for long with all those sandwiches he's been eating!&&Dude has 3 lego figures of himself...THREE!

That right there is success.&&My head cannon is that Strange and Tony resented each other upon initial meeting because they shared Rachel McAdams as a love interest.&&Is it?

The biggest problem with the DCCU besides the people in charge of the movies is the fact that all the superheros are just so well known. Everybody has their own idea of what superman should act like or what batman should eat for breakfast.

Marvel has way fewer characters where that's a problem.&&Even better, add John Stewart _and_ Jon Stewart. And then have them both be on screen at the same time. Fuck with people's heads.&&You know what would be cool? If there wasn't a movie misrepresenting Cyborg's origin, history and abilities and therefore murkying up the waters. &&Probably because of Joss Whedon&&Except they messed that up with the whole mustache debacle.&&So like, Superman: Ragnarok? &&So, Smallville?&&Didn't know that about the director.

No wonder the movies are so pathetic&&And they fucking blew it&&That really is glorious. The hand placement kills me.&&Link?&&Yeah, it is actually pretty brutal for a mostly light-hearted movie, that involves Iron Man urinating in his on suit.  The scene is quasi-played for laughs but it is rough.&&It’s really gruesome in a pretty light film. It’s like a really gnarly industrial accident.

As simple as this approach is, I hadn't even considered it. Thanos literally could have corrected all of the problems in numerous other ways. His character was almost so likable that I believed his flawed logic. &&X-men? Spider-Man? (1&2)&&Actually, when Wong teleports Cull Obsidian to Antarctica it looks like he purposely keeps the portal open long enough that he can try to get back through, just so that he can literally close it on him as an additional ""fuck you"".&&In the Wheel of Time series they use portals for this exact purpose. They summon portals then make them fly around, basically just cutting armies down in swathes. &&Wheel of Time actually weaponizes their version of portals. Very deadly.&&It’s not quite portals, but Marvel’s used [intentional telefragging](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L0upj5bpdio/UYqS249wKNI/AAAAAAAAP7g/kX-6-daFMs4/s1600/give+%2527em+a+hand.jpg) several times before.&&Rick and Morty has some clever kills using portals.  Pretty sure he cuts people in half at some point with his portals.&&I've seen this done well in books: in the Wheel of Time series, a character (re)discovers how to use magic to create gateways between two locations. Later, in the heat of battle, he ends up creating a bunch of narrow gateways and launching them at his enemies, with predictably gorey results.&&Completely not related, but in the Book series The Wheel of Time, by the end they started using ""Portals"" aka gateways as means of killing, calling them Deathgates.&&[Not all the possibilities, only about 16 million of them. He just stopped watching futures too soon to see that using a portal to chop off Thanos' arm was an insta-win.](#spoiler)&&Aye, starlord doomed the universe. Good going.&&Yeah, except he proceeded to make Crystal Skull a few years later.&&I'm not entirely sure that would be fair on the older movies.  

Pretty sure you couldn't see Gone with the Wind at 8am on a sat morning (or 8.30, 9, 9,30)  &&It's all Disney now anyway.&&Ohh ok thanks for pointing that out&&Do not agree. IW has a good solid shot at topping TFA's $2.07B, but Avatar's $2.78B is just not in play.&&IW won't come close.  Avatar is an anomaly when it comes to grosses.  Just look at its foreign gross,  They made 2b alone in foreign gross.  Star Wars TFA made 2b WORLDWIDE.  Avengers would need close to a 1.1b gross in America just to have a shot at 1.7b foreign in order to pass Avatar.  Just look at Black Panther.  It's split nearly 50/50 domestic and foreign.  Avengers 1 was 40/60.  So far, Avengers 2 is about 40/60 without China.  Unless China loves it for some reason and pops 600m on it, I don't think it'll get even within 300m.&&Probably not but infinity war has a chance to take second.

That and of course, one of Gomer Pyle's catch phrases.

And I'm sure eliminating half the members of keystone species won't spiral ecosystems out of control. I'm sure wiping out half the microorganisms in the world won't devestate pretty much everything. And what's his plan when the universe reproduces back its lost half?


It was a fun movie, but let's face it, it was kind of a dumb motive, and would definitely not be better for the universe. &&Thanos' 50% logic is shit though the maintain a plant you prune the unnecessary and unhealthy parts you don't just loop off an the branches on one half.&&He snaps his fingers and half the population of every planet is sterile.

Would suck to live on the planet where that half happened to be all the women.&&Infinite power and infinite capabilities are not the same thing. There's a lot of assumptions about the Gauntlet's capabilities that don't really have any validity in the MCU. The Gauntlet is super powerful, but the biggest feat was killing people, not rewriting the rules of reality--and when he actually used the Reality stone to do that, he warped it, and only in a temporary way. &&Those were definitely good movies but The Dark Knight was another level IMO.&&Yeah there is a pause.&&I thought they did that as a set up for cutting Thanos' arm off and then was surprised they didn't even try it. &&It looked like an accidental consequence to me. plus he was already out of the fight by then, so it wasnt used in a way that actually had any results. I'm hoping to someday see fiction that has characters fully understand the potential of their portals.&&Ah, sadly I don't have the required 200+ IQ to watch Rick and Morty.&&Strange didn’t try to stop star lord. He saw the future and knew what had to happened for them to win.&&My friend pointed out that the guardians of the galaxy are the biggest cause of the events of infinity wars, cause star lord not only ruined their plan to get the gauntlet off, but insisted they go to knowhere instead of going with thor which led to thanos finding the soul stone&&Crystal skull still had Lucas heavily involved.&&Nevertheless it's going to be *really* hard to ever top gone with the wind. There simply wasn't nearly as much competition. Like not even close. No competition from home video, streaming, other movies in the theater, video games, not really even television was comparable.

You can't really be fair about looking at these numbers, it's just too different. Better to just look at it as a neat piece of history. &&The Wakandan market should give it a nice boost, though.&&Except star wars isn't big at all in China, the second biggest box office. IW is definitely going to be SW internationally since it has such a huge following world wide. Still I hate that avatar still is no.1 that movie was decent at best.&&Also they haven’t even opened IW in China yet. &&IT may have been double where you were but in most cases it was a between 25&#37; to 50&#37; increase. Also \(speaking from personal experience\) it also had a longer than usual theatrical run \(Movie opened in December 2009 and in May 2010 there were still a few cinemas \<at least in South Africa\> and by the end of June 2010 it was taken off the circuit\). Also it grew slowly during it's first week \(the most important week for a film release as grosses start dropping during the second and consecutive weeks\) as I saw it on opening day in one of the newest 3d screens in South Africa with 30 people. The following week I wen again with my parents and it must've had 500 people it was jam packed.&&And then they released it again a year later with directors cut or something to add to that, didn't they?

Edit: NVM not really sure if they count that but I swear they rereleased it&&3D most certainly did *not* cost double. Maybe 30% more at best.&&Tickets today are more expensive than they were back then. And it didn't get so high because people paid double or w/e shit you people make up. It got so damn high because *everyone* bloody saw it.&&Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh shared the Best Picture Oscar for Return of the King&&I agree. It's a sad state of affairs for married couples.

Should I give Cameron a call? &&The water I think&&You are kind of forgetting that 3D was practically nonexistent outside of Imax prior to Avatar but then push by JC and studios he teamed up was so strong that even a backwater like my hometown in Czechia had 3D projector before Avatar release.

Idk why you guys still doubt him, he made original IP and broke all time box office record with it. Twice. Literally none of the recent original IP’s have come even close in recent times.&&But can my erection wait that long?&&Girth&&4DX is awesome, and movies that have vehicles such as Star Wars and Fast and the Furious even more so. The Falcon scenes in Force Awakens were exciting. Fast Furious 8 was like a 2 hour version of the ride at Universal Studios.

Though, not all movies are great in 4DX. Infinity War felt like it didn’t really fit the format. Lots of talking and punching, so either no effects or lots of sharp movement.

Panther God's opinion > My opinion. &&Well hopefully we get that Dr. Doom movie. &&It wasn't specifically stated, but I'm sure in other media it's made explicit that he means *sentient* beings. Your buggo populations and such are probably fine.

Points that still apply still totally apply, of course.&&Also removing people randomly like that isn’t going to help a planet flourish. Like maybe you can remove specific people but it should be planned out not random. &&I see it as Thanos not being right, but trying to make the death of his world *mean* something. Either he was a prophet or his planet just kinda fucked up and destroyed itself. He cannot handle the thought of such insignificance, so he's created this grand narrative where he alone can see the path. Given how his plan won't actually solve anything, it's the only interpretation that makes sense.&&Not to mention the Gauntlet looked fucked up after the snap. Doubling resources is probably a greater feat than just erasing half of the living beings and since we don't know the limit of the Gauntlet itself, it might not be capable of doing such a thing. And (personal argument) you could theorize that by him killing off half off the universe, the other half could realize how much easier things are and thrive, just like Gamora's planet.  Thanos went around slaughtering halves of civilizations and watched them flourish in the aftermath. He was simply taking what he saw as a working system and using it on a much grander scale.&&[deleted]&&As much as I love the first two X-Men and Spider-Man movies, I gotta agree with you. We had Dark Knight and Iron Man in 2008, Watchmen the next year, and then Marvel (mostly) hitting it out of the park from then on.&&When there is a wong, there's a way.&&Maybe Mr. Doctor looked at that avenue in the 14 million times they fought, saw it was useless anyway and they still lost, and decided not to try at all.&&Sure, let’s concede to you this point.

The fact remains, though, that Ironman, Spider-Man, and Wong *all saw a portal used to sever a hand*.  If that’s not a wasted opportunity in foreshadowing, I don’t know what is.&&>so it wasnt used in a way that actually had any results

Right, but it seemed to me like the previous comment said, it was just an additional 'fuck you'. Didn't need to have any actual results to be on purpose.

The look on his face when he did it tells me it was much more purposeful than you think. Suppose it's just opinion though.

And honestly, portals are OP as fuck.. and realism isn't always entertaining. The film wouldn't have been entertaining if Strange just owned him with portals in 30s. No film would be entertaining with portals being used 'properly' by the good guys since, realistically, it would be too one sided.

So in the end, it's just a movie and portals are inherently unrealistic, so I wouldn't sweat it too much if I were you.&&Blink in DOFP I thought?&&Spielberg has enough chops to just say no to George, but he didn't.  The biggest issue with the prequels is that people didn't stop George from fully releasing his own vision, and the same is true for Crystal Skull.

Was Avatar your first 3D movie and you didn't get overly hindered by 3D-glasses or tech? Without 3D my father would've absolutely hated the movie, but as much he didn't usually care for any kind of tech and story was usually everything to him, he didn't regret seeing it. No amount of convincing would make him watch any Marvel movie.

I agree, I wouldn't ever watch whole Avatar on a TV screen. Still, it was the only movie I went to see twice in theaters. Immersion is big part of my theatre experience and Avatar is still on its own level. No amount of fine crafting in visuals and music wont reach it in 2D since It's still basically a pretty moving painting. 3D Avatar soaked you in, other 3D movies just treated screen as a window and sometimes just tried to poke or throw something blurry at your face.&&",2018-04-30 22:21:42

I was really looking forward to the Sacha Baron Cohen-starring version.  Sounds like it went off the rails because the band members wanted to remove anything controversial from the storyline, and lame it up.

Looks like the guy playing Deacon has a pretty good resemblance there.

One question for anyone who might know:  I see that Mike Myers is listed on iMDB as a cast member.  But it does not say who he will be playing.

Anyone have a clue here?&&[Sacha Baron Cohen On What Happened With The Freddie Mercury Biopic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-M4JA3fIU)&&[deleted]&&I love Rami Malek but I have to agree that he looks too petite.

https://youtu.be/dREKkAk628I&&All looks good so far, the only thing I'm curious about now is how Malek actually looks (close-up) when his face is neutral. So far all I've seen is him screaming, far away or with sunglasses.&&I don't see it. Freddy Mercury oozed sexuality.

Sounds like its just going to be an ego thing for the band members from how they pushed out sacha. &&Needs more sweat&&Is there a good documentary on Freddie Mercury out there? Would love to watch one. Especially if this movie isn’t going to portray how he really was. &&Yea, this movie is gonna fucking bomb, and I hate to say that. Should have stuck with Sacha Baron Cohen...smh&&Big Queen fan, but will pass on this movie knowing that half is with Freddie and the other half without Freddie.

Just me, though.&&Yes, he looks exactly like Freddie and yes, he's a great actor who will probably nail the part. Those aren't the things people were worried about with this film, though. It's the script and director issues that everyone's worried about.

So yeah, this picture looks great, but no, it doesn't make me excited for this film.&&Unpopular opinion I suppose, I think he’s too small. Good actor so it might be ok, but I thought SBC was perfect so I’m biased.&&I am probably alone here in thinking that his childhood should be in the movie?

 - Grew up in relative luxury as the son of a colonial official

 - Sent to a boarding school on a different continent

 - Escaped a potential massacre

 - Moved to a working class neighborhood of London

It's an unfair comparison because Malek's performance is gonna be whatever it is, whereas Cohen's performance that everyone imagines in their heads is the greatest thing ever because it exists outside of reality. You can't compete with fantasy. &&That's exactly what happened with Andre 3000 as Jimi Hendrix. He was amazing-THE SCRIPT WAS SHIT&&Given how the band members pushed out Sacha Baron Cohen, and appear to want a whitewashed version where Freddie's a saint, I expect it will be shit.

Edit: whitewashed as in cleaned up beyond recognition, not racially.&&That's my thoughts exactly. Malek's likeness is uncanny, there won't be another shot for him to play this role otherwise yet they choose 'Bryan Singer' of all people to direct? &&The problem with the film is it's allegedly more about the band than about Freddie Mercury himself, who was everything interesting about the band. If even roughly half the film is about the time after his death, I'm a bit concerned.

And everything I've heard makes this sound like it's a vanity project being pushed by surviving members, rather than a true objective biographical account. So not only will it possibly not be focused enough on Freddie Mercury, but the Freddie Mercury we see will be the one they want us to see.

I like the Malik casting. Just hope it isn't wasted.&&I had hope, but reading through these comments i feel they are dwindling.

Ninja edit: I think both Rami and SBC are fucking fantastic choices, I'm just not convinced either of them can live up to Freddie. That being said, I think SBC could fit better because of the pure chaos which is clearly dwelling inside his head, which I think he and Freddie shared. I think Rami will have a better chance of fully absorbing the character, and he is imo, the only person who has a hope of doing Freddie justice, he's a really fucking good actor. 

Let's just hope the studio focus groups don't interview middle America.&&I would have LOVED to see SBC as Freddie. This guy I'm sure is great but he seems much too short and doesn't really have the same facial structure.... but thats my personal opinion&&According to Sacha the band actually wanted Freddy’s death in the first half so the moral of the story would be the band still thrived. &&I remember Myers was working on a Keith Moon biopic that never happened.

Not only was Freddie's personality larger than life, but so were those teeth. And that bulge. 

edit: I saw the picture, the teeth are indeed big enough&&Yeah, too petite and baby faced. Freddie Mercury was smoldering and manly.

I mean, I'm sure I'll watch it and get over it in the first few minutes, but my brain will do that by interpreting Malek's Freddie Mercury as a ""different"" Freddie Mercury in some alternate universe, rather than if, say, Sacha Baron Cohen did it, in which case my brain would say ""Okay, this is definitely the same Freddie Mercury I know and love.""&&Their the same height and body type.

Malek is one of the great ones of his generation.&&You, my friend, are not an idiot. &&IIRC the reason Cohen didn't continue is because the band wanted the story to not be centered around Freddie Mercury which is impossible and that created differences between the band and him.

Rami's main challenge is not to compete against an imaginary performance by Sacha, but to be able to have his performance glow despite being creatively hindered. &&> Andre 3000 as Jimi Hendrix

Great performance but you knew it was doomed when Hendrix Experience wouldn't allow any of Jimi's music to be used.&&They really didn't want Sacha?

That said, he does seem to have moved a bit on his political views as he's got older.&&Not so much height, but overall size, Mercury had a fucking chest on him.&&Theyre talking body mass not height, Mercury has at least 10 kilos on Malek &&[deleted]&&Tom Cruise is a dwarf but appears like a normal person in movies. If they can add a few feet, they can surely shave off a few inches.&&I am shocked to find out that Cohen is only 6'3"". I mean, that's pretty tall, but he always looks like he is towering over everyone else. &&Will this hold you over?

The good, the bad - EVERYTHING

And the band was like ""no thank you"" and wanted half of the movie to be about after Freddie's death. And...who the hell cares about that.&&From what I read, Sacha wanted to do dig into the character and make an r rated movie that didn't hold any punches. The band members wanted a family friendly behind the music movie. And since they hold the rights to the song the studio went with the band. Disappointing in my opinion. &&It's not that they didn't want Sacha, but Sacha wanted to do an *honest* version of Freddie and the band didn't...so Sacha left/was fired.

Not only would he be the perfect actor to do Freddie, but he was genuinely passionate about the project, and doing a 'real' freddie mercury movie. It's a real shame that's not going to happen. Frustrating too because i'm sure Rami Malek will do a great job, but the whole feel of how they want to portray Freddie as a wholesome saint, and have the second half of the movie about how the band carried on without him, just sounds like bland shit - and not at all how Freddie would have wanted it.&&Well that makes three of them&&Only at the very end due to a scandal.

I don't mean to poo-poo it, but, go and actually read through the /r/smalldickproblems subreddit. Some of the posts in there are from people who are legitimately suicidal. The other subreddit is not going to have that. If they are, and I know this is belittling, but they're most likely being dramatic for the sake of shaking off any guilt, warranted or not. You shouldn't feel guilty for being *born* with any trait. 

I wish I could explain it more eloquently.

Sacha wasn't on board with that either since he didn't think people would care about the second half. &&And by honest, all the exciting stuff like drugs and gay sex.

And by dishonest, none of that and halfway through the movie Freddie dies and it follows the band in a really boring sounding way that no one would want to watch.&&Ah, the edit of death.&&I thought it was more that the band wanted it to be about Freddie and the band, but Cohen wanted it to be about Freddie and his life outside the band.&&>	EDIT: So this is my highest scoring comment now. A comment I made quickly in passing, simply explaining some shit. I’ll never understand you Reddit.

Reddit is about timing, not what’s actually *in* the comment. Comment at the right time, maximum upvotes. &&Fuck off with your dumb ass edit &&You didn't get a lot of upvotes because you're spouting wisdom or anything.

Musically? Mercury needed May just as much as May needed Mercury.

Still, a Brian May flick would be boring as hell.&&I'm mean, that's pretty much a cornerstone of the recording industry.

But he is the new frontman for Queen, yep. 

https://youtu.be/cHTalNt_TAw&&[deleted]&&They wanted more of a pg rating and if  you try to faithfully portray *anything* from that era you're looking at an R easily.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-M4JA3fIU&&We don’t. We want the coke binge with Bowie and the troubled genius Freddie movie. Nobody wants a feel good Queen movie. Don’t get me wrong, Brian May was a guitar pioneer but he’s as boring as a bucket of wallpaper paste. &&wait, they kept popping out new stuff after Freddie? TIL&&Halfway through a Freddie Mercury biopic it becomes an Adam Lambert biopic.&&are you saying people wouldn't want 20% of the film to be about touring with Paul Rodgers?

(I mean, Rodgers is a fine singer and all, but come on...)&&The current film apparently ends at Live Aid, so it doesn't seem to have been too much of a sticking point.&&Dude, they could have had friggin' naked midgets carrying plates of cocaine strapped to their heads, but they went safe instead...smh&&It seems like they want to make the movie a sort of “how we overcame freddie’s death” instead of a true biopic, which is lame as hell and comes across as rather egotistical & disingenuous &&/r/awardspeechedits 

Instant downvote for me&&Possibly, but isn't that what people wanna see?  The band seems out of touch with what the public wants/likes (namely Freddie).

I say this as a huge Brian May fan, but no one gives a fuck about the rest of the band really.&&The latter sounds way more interesting. Freddie Mercury - his character, his promiscuous underground lifestyle, his larger than life performer psyche - that is incredibly intriguing and a story which is yet to be told properly on film. The story of Queen overcoming his death is not really one I care about. They were a great band but none of their characters or lifestyles were as intriguing as his and they come across as out if touch by trying to make the movie about this process&&Which is what audiences *want*.

I want a biopic with drugs and controversy and drama that reflects the life of the greatest frontman of all time then finished with a Richie Valenz style tribute alá La Bamba at the end, closing credits with a PIP shot of Wimbledon 86.&&I actually saw his stupid /r/awardspeechedits and changed my shit to a downvote upon coming back to this thread. 

I’ll never understand why people need to ruin their comments like that &&Brian May is incredibly talented, and I don't mean to diminish his importance to the band, but that is just not true. Brian May with an average lead singer is a mediocre band at best.

Freddie Mercury singing a Cappella in the shower with a bar of soap would still fill a stadium. Brian May needed Freddie to make Queen special far more than Freddie needed Brian. I love them both and am glad it worked out how it did, but it's the truth.&&That's why i said everything else aside, i was a bit to vague to stay on point but yeah that's why i genuinely think he's a scumbag. I'm amazed he survived the mass Hollywood call outs with a career of being reported as a predator. &&""yo Bry, how'd that child rape case go?""

You'd have to find someone truly special to act and sing the part so well. I'm confident in Malek's acting, but I'd be very pleasantly surprised if he could sing like Mercury.&&Yup. The audio playing is from the actual Live Aid performance, including the piano test at the beginning. The real show is really worth a watch on YouTube, about 20 minutes or so. &&Only knowing Rami for Mr. Robot, this is either going to be an incredible display of range or a really forced, awkward performance. Hopefully the former. &&Been googling like crazy, but I can't find anything. I think you might've dreamt it. &&Haven't seen those, but i too remember some Photoshops. But even on the other pre Make Up pictures he looks close to Freddie.&&Why'd we have to switch measurement systems half way through&&Same.  Boys are entertaining.&&Because I’m easy come, easy go &&I dunno man, people love Brian May. Guitar god who built his own Axe and also dabbles as a Bona Fide Astro-Fucking-Physicist. &&I mean, he was a FORCE, and THE frontman. But the other guys in that band were all part of making Queen what it was/is. All the band members wrote at least 2 of the classics we know today. Its not like only Freddie wrote the songs, like it is most of the times with bands\(where its usually one or maybe two people who write the bulk of the songs\)

Go look up the writing credits for their biggest hits, you´  ll be surprised who wrote which songs.

Now that doesnt mean they are interesting people, or that a Mecury biopic should be about them, it obviously shouldnt. But dont diminish their contributions by calling them ""other freddie mercuries""&&'Freddy and the Mercuries' sounds pretty good mind &&Oh, that I know, and he does a pretty good job. But besides that, have they done anything as Queen?

Not dissing Brian May et all, mind you, they are talented people and I'm sure they've done a lot of projects on their own. But as Queen? &&They should've asked George Michael to fill in after Mercury's passing&&Good for Adam Lambert, that's pretty damned cool
&&“Adam Lambert? The American Idol guy? Fuck him.”

*Listens*

“Oh. Wow. Never mind.”&&Still sounds like a producer-groomed pop singer smashing out kareoke&&I watched this with an open mind actually hoping to enjoy, but he sounds like Cher impersonating Freddie Mercury and now that thought has ruined it for me. &&Are the two even related? To me, getting everything they could from him meant finishing *Made In Heaven*. I don't see what that has to do with touring as Queen+.&&Ah so it’s not that he did anything wrong, they are just afraid of showing him human. &&Damn. Its crazy how quickly the /r/HowardStern show, Howard and the guests he has on have gone down hill.
Two years ago it was all still much more interesting and alive. Almost seems like either Howard lost interest or just got old, who knows.

When he doesn't have Amy Schumer or Adam Levine on for the tenth time (no hate!), there are actually still from time to time interesting guests but a lot of potential gets wasted/lost by Howard asking the same questions as always and interrupting the guest too many times.
The Last great interview I can remember might be the Navy seal guy.&&Who wants to watch a movie, or even half a movie, about queen in the 90s/2000s? Its like when they make those documentaries about Van Halen or The Who and its called like ""Still Tourin After All These Years"" or some shite. And its just old guys playing to sentimental crowds and acting like theyre exactly the rock stars the once were. Too bad, if have loved to watch a Freddie Mercury biopic with all the debauchery included&&I too, feel apathetic about the proposed half-hour climax to the movie where he talks keenly about astronomy.&&I want to see when he dressed up Princess Diana as a man to sneak her into the clubs. &&Somewhere out there, there's a bucket of wallpaper paste feeling sad now. I hope you're happy&&you do realize that the 70s/80s drug fueled party haze sequences are just as big a trope as any feel good parts? Like that’s not actually how life is, or how parties are. Biopics have become all the same with that stuff, I actually always want to see more of the actual creative genius at work, the dedication to the craft, the connection with the band and the music that is the whole reason they’re known. and not just an overdramatic montage of their personal life. &&They took some time off but yes, they attempted to (and failed miserably imo) to keep it going. A few times. At best they played a few big one-off charity concerts but they weren't the grand stadium stars without Freddie. No offense to the singers that they tried; they weren't bad, they were just impossible shoes to fill. &&Which gives Cohen's reluctance a lot of sense. I didn't know that either. I think Queen fans were just Freddie fans&&Say what you want, but Adam Lambert crushes it vocally with Queen.&&New York’s hottest club is “Queen”. It has everything...&&Give me $1000 and I can make that scene happen&&Faded into obscurity with really cringeworthy concerts?&&Yeah, I’ve heard that too. No disrespect to Brian May and all, but they didn’t exactly flourish post-Freddy. It’s not like AD/DC or Van Halen - or even the Journey doc for that matter. I dunno what that second act would even be.&&Thanks. Yup, same for me. I knew there had to be a sub for it haha.&&eh, agreed Mercury was the biggest draw. But like Lennon and McCarney, they were only the best together as collaborators. Each one tempered the other.&&Exactly.

And for the record, I'm not one to want to try people in the court of public opinion, and I'm fully aware of the dangers of mob justice determining a person's guilt.

For anyone that cares to learn more, if you research Singer's past there have been allegations that he's into kids for well over a decade. Same thing goes for Dan Schneider.

Hell, I could remember Schneider's name, but he has so many allegations against him that I literally googled ""Nickelodeon pedophile"" and his name was the first hit.

I just don't understand how some people are losing their jobs, meanwhile these two child abusers keep getting work.&&Keep yourself Alive&&From my understanding of the premise of the second half, it ought to be ""The Show Must Go On"".&&That's how you know that Rami has watched that footage as much as humanly possible and then a few times more.  I had my doubts after the falling out with Sascha Baron Cohen, but damnit if this doesn't give me hope.&&We're not worthy! *We're not worthy!* We suck! We're scum!&&There's apparently a voice double/soundalike blended with actual Mercury and a bit of Malek. Should be interesting!&&No one can sing like Mercury &&191cm&& A Little high, little low&&> people love Brian May

But do they care enough about Brian May to enjoy a Queen biopic where Freddie Mercury dies halfway through? &&I’m fairly obsessed with Freddie Mercury... I had a female cat named Freddie at one point (who also died too young, R.I.P. fluffer), but I also really adore Brian May. As a person and a performer! His “Too Much Love Will Kill You” is my favorite. 

My stepdad got to see Queen when Mercury was still alive though and we’ll watch concerts together but he steadfastly refuses to see any of the Queen+ shows. His voice and his presence really did make the band. 

In any case, I’ve been madly in love with Rami Malek since The War At Home so as much as I think Cohen would have rocked too, I’m geeked. &&[deleted]&&Indeed, in any other band Roger, Brian, (probably not John but he’s fine with that) would be famous in their own right. What other band has multiple number one hits written by all of the members? The talent contained in this band is unparalleled. The available tools in their collective kit is unparalleled. Freddie just shines so bright that he casts a shadow even over this.&&They released Made In Heaven which was released 4 years after Mercury's death, but with vocals he recorded knowing he wouldn't be alive to see them released (mother love is an amazing song from this album and shows how strong his voice was even when he was at deaths door).

They (May and Taylor, Deacon left Queen once Freddie was gone) also released an album as Queen + Paul Rodgers for a tour in 2008. It's mostly just meh rock/pop songs.

They pretty much just tour as a legacy act now (still great live mind you.) Both Taylor and May have released solo stuff since Mercury died which is pretty good.&&Saw them in Toronto, had this impression going in. Didnt even know who Adam Lambert was before a pre-show google. Blew me away.&&They should have went with marc martel, in my opinion. I like adam lambert, but his style isn't my jam.

This is mark doing somebody to love, and I think it sounds pretty good.&&i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that howard has found his audience and likely doesn't get a lot of new listeners, like he used to when he was on actual radio.

&&And saving badgers.&&That’s s really good counter argument. I can see exactly what you mean. But I’d still rather it went the other way. &&Well, I mean, he was the front man and thus the face of Queen. People argue if he was the best singer of all time (I don't think so), but he may well have been the greatest frontman of all time.  
  
With him being front man, it was impossible for the others not to fall into his shade.&&Not even in the same galaxy as Freddie&&Okay, I have to ask ... what is a “Bohemian Crapsody”?&&A shaved lion that looks like Mario Batali&&Actually this would be a great way to get around this. Make a movie about a club called ""Freddie"" and have all the characters play out different portions of Mercury's life, from outing himself from bi to gay, his party life, love life, drugs, music career and eventually dealing with aids. It would be like a better version of rent or club 54&&I'm not a midget, but $1000 is $1000.&&I know right? For some reason he's the most uncovered one but even though he's not exactly a big shot or talented when it comes to feature film Directors like a Cameron or Tarantino yet he's protected to the point he's bulletproof... It reminds of Bill Cosby in that all his crimes we're literally on his Wikipedia page along with the allegations but it took a random joke in a small club from Hannibal Buress to set off his prosecution? &&From my perspective, I don't know enough Queen song titles to make any suggestions.&&[deleted]&&Anyway the wind blowssss
Doesn’t really matter... to meee&&Depends on how well they develop the characters. Seeing them deal with the fallout could be really good. But if it's just a complete switch of the attention from Freddie after he died to the band still having some success, it's going to suck.&&They're the only band in the Rock and Roll HoF with all of its members also inducted into the Songwriters HoF.&&TIL Brian may likes to party&&What other band has multiple number one hits written by all of the members? 

The main thing that comes to mind is the Beatles having three songwriters who wrote number ones.  That’s damn fine company to keep.&&Mother Love is the saddest song I know.

Lot of dentists, insurance reps, etc. &&Surprisingly, over 30 million people (I'm pretty sure that's just the US too). Not exactly a dying medium.&&Car owners&&You can get it for $99 a year if you ask. But I recently canceled the SXM subscription we had in my wife's car that has a built in satellite radio, simply because after two years she does use it. She finally started listening to podcasts and we have unlimited data so we can stream music as well. SXM just wasn't worth it even at the cheapest price. &&Howard fans&&Nobody is paying 15 bucks a month. At least nobody with any damn sense. When your initial free trial runs out you call and cancel. They will give you a few better offers, refuse them. After a few days you will get a mailer with an offer for 29.99 for 6 months. After that six months is up rinse and repeat. I have tried to ask for the 29.99 for 6 month offer when I call them to cancel but the rep always say's that they cannot offer that deal. So every 6 months I miss maybe a week of satellite radio. 5 bucks a month isn't bad. I travel quite a bit throughout Oregon, especially Southeastern Oregon and there is no cell service in large chunks of that territory so satellite is nice to have.

"Isao Takahata, Studio Ghibli co-founder and director of Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, Pom Poko, and The Tale of the Princess Kaguya has died. (Japanese Article)",59064,8a3f0h,https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20180406-00000503-sanspo-ent,976,1522961466.0,,"Oh no! This is tragic, but he lived a full and incredible life. I hope he felt that he lived up to the values of his movies to really cherish every moment. 

If any of you are unfamiliar with Takahata, absolutely check out The Tale of the Princess Kaguya. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. &&I highly recommend people to watch Only Yesterday. My favorite movie that he made and a gem in Ghibli’s catalogue.&&The film's he did for Ghibli were phenomenal. Miyazaki always seems to get all the credit but Takahata was just as integral to the studio. He'll be sorely missed.&&I never cried so much watching Tale of The Princess Kaguya and I still don't know why, this movie rewired my eyes directly to my heart.

&&Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most heartfelt films, animatrd or live-action, of all time. He will be missed.&&Grave of the Fireflies have me shedding tears every time I watch it. I never knew I could cry to a movie..&&I really wish Princess Kaguya won the Oscar that year. &&People mainly talk about Miyazaki when they talk about Ghibli, but from what I've heard and saw, Takahata has been just as important to the medium of animation. I feel ashamed for never having watched a film of his. I'll have to change that soon.
RIP&&*Why must fireflies die so young?*&&Isao Takahata was one of the most versatile directors I have ever seen.

While Miyazaki took most of the fame, I also found Takahata's work to be the most nuanced and well developed.  All of his films took risks, and disregarded the typical mass appeal of Ghibli to produce astounding art.

If you love Ghibli but haven't seen many Takahata films, I suggest you start.  In my opinion he deserves accolades as high as Miyazaki.&&I know it's cliché to say you grew up watching somebody's work but I grew up watching Only Yesterday. It aired like almost every week in my country. I've probably seen it more than 50 times and it's one of my all-time favorite movies. So, I want to thank Mr. Takahata for making a movie which made my cry last night reminiscing about my childhood, for making a masterpiece. May he rest in peace!&&>Takahata told entertainment news website Variety in 2016, ""I have several projects that I still have in mind that I am currently working on to get closer to realizing. Whether those will be finalized as films is something that no one, myself included, can know.""&&Princess Kaguya is my favorite Studio Ghibli movie and it made me cry, really really hard.

I was in college, and I didn't know at the time but I am autistic. I was also extremely depressed. I know that I thought about things differently, I've know all my life. As a kid I wanted to run into a wall and give myself brain damage so that I would think differently. This before I knew I was autistic. Anyway, a lot of autistic people identify with ""changling "" narratives, we feel like an alien or something switched out at birth. We don't belong to this world. I didn't feel like I belonged in this world at college. It's why I attempted suicide. I felt a lot like Princess Kaguya. When her parents wish her goodbye and cry knowing she must go back to the moon, I balled. I wanted to die, I wanted to go back to wherever I was from, I know it hurt being here because I didn't belong. That hurt a lot.

Anyways, that's what Isao Takahata gave me. One of the most important films to me in recent memory. Also, the choice to look like a Japanese watercolor painting (don't know the proper term for it) was great and the animation is beautiful. I'm so sad he's passed. Genuinely. Never was sad for a celebrity passing before this, but no one who gave me something like that died before. I'm really devastated. I wish I could express it properly. That's autism again. Family and friends aside, I'm not sure anyone else will morn him in the same way I will. Maybe they're morn as much, but it will be different. What that film means to me is so singular. I'm so devastated.&&R.I.P.&&Miyazaki deserves all the credit he gets but Takahata's films are really underrated (at least here in the West). I definitely recommend Only Yesterday to anyone young and old. 

RIP you brilliant artist &&Kaguya was a true masterpiece.&&Birds, bugs, beasts, grass, trees, flowers

Flower, bear fruit, and die

Be born, grow up, and die

Still the wind blows, the rain falls

The waterwheel goes round

Lifetimes come and go in turn

-Kaguya-hime no Monogatari

RIP&&I grew up to 平成狸合戦ぽんぽこ (Tanuki War Pom Poko) as one of my favorite film as a child and 火垂るの墓  (Grave of Firefly) was the first time a movie ever make me cry. I'm so thankful for all of his work.

For me, tonight I will be watching かぐや姫の物語, or Story of Princess Kagura, is probably his best ever movie, and amazing to watch!&&This is truly hurtful if this is true. His movies are some of the most beautiful to ever grace the silver screen. He has made me laugh with classics such as My Neighbors the Yamadas and has made me cry more than any other filmmaker with Grave of the Fireflies.

RIP an animation pioneer.&&Losing Takahata weighs down my heart more than I had ever imagined. This is a man who shaped not only the anime industry, but the film industry as well. His movies will live on as the greatest legacy I could imagine someone of his caliber leaving.&&The sad part is that his passing will be a flash in the pan meanwhile if ever anything tragic would happen to Miyazaki the entire industry would be livid and in panic. He is the true better half of Ghibli and his final work, Tale of Princess Kaguya, I consider one the finest set piece of Japanese animation. 

Until now I'm still fucking mad the Princess Kaguya lost the oscars to a very mediocre disney animated movie. THERE, I SAID IT!&&Oh man that's so sad. Miyazaki is up there in age as well.

Ghibli films are such a huge part of my life. His most recent film (The Red Turtle) is amazing. I highly recommend checking it out.

His movies will be a part of people's lives forever. I can't imagine a world that doesn't appreciate Ghibli.&&Aww.. thats so sad. I love this man. His work is absolutely beautiful. Grave of Fireflies, Only Yesterday, and Princess Kaguya are some of the finest films ever made. Grave of Fireflies is indescribably well done, emotionally moving and thought provoking. His work is simply regarded as some of the finest there is in animated story telling. Its a damn shame he's gone. 

As I read the post's topic... I feared it would read that he had died...

If you love film, story telling or appreciate the finer things in life... Isao Takahata is a man you should get to know. Watch his films. They are truly stunning.

I sincerely beg you to watch Grave of Fireflies, Only Yesterday and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Even if you dont like anime or cartoons... I beg you to watch these films. Read nothing of them. Do not risk spoiling them. They are true works of art that will make you think, cry, and laugh like only the best can. He's gone but his work will remain. They are a gift, please go unwrap them for yourself.

Isao Takahata could always make me cry, even one last time.


&&Reaching the end of the title was beyond awful. Only Yesterday gave me a cozy childhood. Godspeed to a giant.&&He also co-directed the original Lupin III series with Miyazaki.&&Aw man. Really sad to hear. What he helped create with Miyazaki is beautiful, I'll really miss seeing new art from him.&&A life well lived.&&God, this if fucking heartbreaking to me... Takahata is so underrated having lived in the shadow of Miyazaki who was the far more prolific animator at studio Ghibli. He made some truly incredible films and I will never forget picking my jaw up off of the floor after witnessing Princess Kaguya's stunning water color style or balling my eyes out after seeing Grave of the Fireflies or being overjoyed to see Only Yesterday finally receive a blu ray release in the US.&&Holy fuck

I’m devastated. If you haven’t already, please watch Grave of the Fireflies. One of the most eye opening movies I’ve seen, and the only movie I’ve ever cried to.

Rest in piece. An absolute legend, and one I’ll never forget&&I gasped out loud when I read this :'(    
I've always thought it was a shame that when people mentioned Studio Ghibli, they'd only think of Hayao Miyazaki when Isao Takahata made probably the best and most powerful film to ever come from the studio: ""Grave Of The Fireflies"".    
To me he remains one of the most underrated and underappreciated directors in all of animation.   
He will sorely be missed. &&A true loss. Just got a new copy of Pom Poko the other day too.  Looking forward to seeing those magical raccoons and their giant balls.  :)&&A great man has passed&&Only Yesterday is my favourite Ghibli film. A tragic loss of a great talent.&&Just saw Grave of the Fireflies last month in Japanese. Such a beautiful film that packs a heavy punch along with it. Seems like he lived a great life. RIP&&RIP

I’d not heard of Only Yesterday nor The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Will watch these over the weekend.

Grave of the Fireflies is an amazing film.&&He showed the world the beautiful struggle of Setsuko and Seita, as well as the lightheartedness of The Yamadas.

Maybe fireflies die so young because they have to take turns illuminating the lives of the next generation.They can’t stay lit forever,but their light under the Reaper’s veil is always a beautiful sight.&&Ok, THAT is creepy. I was literally just watching this video by Digibro like two hours ago where he was mentioned and now I read that he passed away. Damn. Out of his works I have only seen Grave of the Fireflies but this movie has moved me so much that I consider it one of the most beautiful but also gut-wrenching movies of all time. You will be missed, Isao Takahata :(&&I will never forget the first time I saw *Grave of the Fireflies*. Such emotionally brutal yet beautiful movie. 

Some of the images and moments in that movie will stick with me for the rest of my life.

And the train scene in *Only Yesterday* is probably one of my most favorite scenes I’ve ever had the pleasure of watching. Whenever I watch the movie, I find myself rewinding that scene multiple times, just because of the emotions the character is going through and how perfect it is visually, even if it’s simple and on-the-nose. 

RIP to a legend. &&Truly a great loss for the animated film work. Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. &&Just wanted to pay my respects to a true Master. His humanistic viewpoint shaped a lot of how I see the world. 

I don't think we'll see another like him, but I'm desperately hoping we do.&&I just feel infinite sadness.&&shit, I was flipping channels on TV this past tuesday and happened to catch Princess Kaguya for the first time. rest in peace, guy. i really loved your movie.&&Huge Miyazaki fan and seen all his movies, but every movie listed in the title has been on my list to watch. I can't wait to see them....RIP&&The german fans will remember the series Heidi from their chidlhood.
A small hint [Its very old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu7MjOd0o0Y)&&Noooo!&&A shame, he was a truly incredible man.&&Only Yesterday and My Neighbors The Yamadas are two of my favourite Ghibli films. What a career he had. RIP.&&Only Yesterday is probably tied for my favorite Studio Ghibli. I’m so glad that I’ve gotten the chance to watch his wonderful movies.&&I just got to see Pom Poko like 2 weeks ago. :( it was such a well done movie too&&I hope if there's an afterlife he's happy with his sister. : ) RIP Mate
&&I guess today will be a sad day. Thank you for the childhood memories.&&Heart shattering. &&Man my heart is shattered. He's truly one of the greatest directors to ever live. The world is truly going to miss his wonderful works of art. May he rest in peace knowing that he made the world a better and more beautiful place to live in because of his existance. &&Ramsey scored two today&&Just finished ""The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness"" today, the documentary about Miyazaki and Takahata's creation of The Wind Rises and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. Really sad to see this.&&Just recently watched only yesterday, it got rerelease due to the dub coming out, man that was such a great film. 
He was clearly miyazaki’s friend and greatest rival, sucks that he’s gone now.&&The Tale of Princess Kaguya is my favorite movie. He was an amazing director. Sad to see him go. &&I'm currently standing in the ghibli museum. I feel so lucky to honor his work here. It's a truly gorgeous place full of sketches, illustrations, and unique exhibits. It won't be the same without him.&&I still remember the first time I watched Grave of the Fireflies, it was one of the very few movies that can make me ugly cry in public.&&This makes me so incredibly sad.&&RIP
Really sad, i'll have to give one of his films a watch this weekend.&&I am really sad to read this. Visiting Studio Ghibli was one of the highlights of our vacation last year. He was so very talented.&&Rest in peace friend&&- Grave of the Fireflies
- Only Yesterday
- Pom Poko
- The Tale of Princess Kaguya

These have just been bumped up to the top of my list to add to my movie collection. R.I.P. Mr. Takahata. Thank you for enriching the world with your art!&&May his soul rest in peace.&&As someone who has enjoyed his movies and also currently playing Ni No Kuni 2 which is the most recent project Studio Ghibli has been involved with this is even sadder news.&&Grave of the Fireflies was one of the movies that changed my perception of life, thanks for all and rest in peace.&&R.I.P.&&Ripped our hearts out one last time. 😭 You'll be missed!&&God damn that sucks. hope he had a procession of Celestial Beings because he totally deserves that kind of send off. &&RIP&&F&&Fuuuuuuuccccckkkk&&Grave if the Fireflies is the first animation/movie which literally had me in tears. &&I'm glad he lived a full life and made so many great movies, but as someone who grew up on Ghibli it is still really sad nonetheless. RIP.&&RIP &&May he rest in his own castle in the sky.&&An enormous, enormous loss. One of the greatest animation directors in history. At least he went out with one hell of a film, Kaguya is a masterpiece. &&The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is my favorite animated film of all-time. This is devastating.

 If you haven't seen it, definitely give it a watch. It's stunning.&&Wow, just watched Grave of the Fireflies for the first time last night.  Heart wrenching.&&What amazing movies. Grave of the Fireflies was hailed as not a mere cartoon or anime, but a war movie. Can’t remember if it was Ebert or Siskel, but it was highly regarded with one of them.&&Seita !!!!!&&No one mentioning pom poko.  That movie was so bizarre, but very entertaining. My favourite movies always make me feel confused but extremely intrigued.  Pom poko was one of my favourite ghibli movies, I recommend it to all ages.&&If anyone hasn't seen Grave of the Fireflies (and is in the mood to cry), I cannot recommend it more highly.  

Takahata was one of the greats, he will be missed.&&He has the strangest movies. I don't like a single one of them but I would watch whatever he released regardless because when his movies finished, I wouldn't stop thinking about them for months. 

No one made movies like him and probably no one ever will again. I'll miss his work, he was a true auteur.

I think I'll watch Only Yesterday again, in his honour. &&RIP you talented heart wrencher. Never have I seen a sadder anime than Grave of the Fireflies. If you don't feel all messed up after watching that movie you probably don't have a soul. &&Oh no, this is horrible news. May he find peace, and happiness in his next life.&&I highly recommend checking out Gauche the Cellist, one of Takahata's pre-ghibli era films. A really charming film, and the interaction between animation and music and the attention to detail is amazing.&&Very sad to hear, Grave of the Fireflies is my favorite animated movie and always the film I show or recommend to people who say anime doesn't impact them the same way as live action. &&F&&Grave of the Fireflies is the best film about the experience of children in WWII Japan that I have ever seen.

I wish I had the chance to show it to my mother, who was about the same age of the characters in the film, but grew up in Portland OR. Pearl Harbor happened on her 8th birthday, and she didn’t even realize that the evil “japs” were just humans who lived in a different place until several years afterwards. &&I just watched Only Yesterday for the first time a couple of weeks ago. As someone who's nearing their late twenties it really resonated with me on a lot of levels. It's a really beautiful film and he will be missed dearly.&&/r/titlegore&&You will live on through your works. Truly representative of your genius and worthy of carrying your name.&&Rest in Peace Takahata. Thank you for all you have done. Your legacy will forever be remembered as truly amazing and uplifting. The movies you worked on were amazing. Goodbye.&&RIP, I remember walking outside with a new perspective after watching Grave of the Fireflies.&&Princess kaguya was such an artistically beautiful movie! I enjoyed it visually.&&Goodbye to an animation legend, may he rest in peace.&&He was arguably Ghibli’s soul. ONLY YESTERDAY, POM POKO, and GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES are masterpieces &&He and Miyazaki are two of the most essential creators the last century has seen. Takahata's loss is, and will be, truly felt.&&This one hit me hard. If you read Miyazaki's book of essays (Starting Point), the guy was just such a major influence and inspiration particularly during his prime when he was producing all those TV shows.&&Princess Kaguya is a visual masterpiece. R.I.P&&I didn't know how lucky I was at the time, but I was able to take a graduate course from Takahata-san one year while studying at Japan University. Very interesting man! He taught how ancient scrollwork has impacted Japanese thinking around anime and how the Japanese have been telling visual stories that transpire over the course of these scrolls for hundreds of years. RIP&&Are there any movies from studio ghibli on netflix? &&He was a great filmmaker, and I will miss him.&&From Heidi to Grave of the Fireflies to Tale of the Princess Kaguya, this man gave us so many fascinating films worth watching.

He will live on in his films.&&Glad I’ve seen all of his movies. I still remember the first time I watched Grave of the Fireflies, I cried so much my eyes went puffy the day after. Rest In Peace Isao-san&&Goat&&dude, im beyond devistated. this man was a genius and i hold his films in such high regard. i dont see him as a second to miyazaki or anyone. im about to cry rn&&I’ll never forget when I first watched spirited away, such a dope movie.&&Sad &&Pom Poko is my favorite environmental movie of all time, shows the effects of human habitation on nature without being too preachy. It has an [incredible soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz4OLOpXKCo) too.&&Nooooooooooooo 😢&&This has to be the worst title for a post ever, for multiple reasons.&&I still get emotional thinking about the one time I watched Grave of the Fireflies, and that must have been 10 years ago. I think it will stick with me forever. Thank you, Takahata! RIP. &&I am crying almost as much as I did when watching Grave of the Fireflies&&R.I.P. and thank you for all your work that has made the world a better place.&&Takahata once said..that he feels he allowed to make the film he does because of Miyazaki, that he can make films that might make no money because of the strength of Miyazaki’s name. This was an amazing arrangement that we might not see again for generations.
  
Rest in peace sir.&&Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most, if not THE most emotionally impactful, animated films I've ever seen. Such a wonderful filmmaker, and a heartbreaking loss, but as others have said here, he lived a full life. RIP. &&not too many films really get to me but as an older brother to a younger sister, Grave of the Fireflies absolutely ruins me 

RIP&&Grave of the Fireflies is the only movies almost make me cry just by thinking about it&&reminder that the tale of princess kaguya lost out to big hero 6 at the oscars. travesty &&Grave Of The Fireflies ruined my Christmas Eve, one year. Such a sad movie. But, it's brilliantly made, and I appreciate the memories Takahata gave me and my friends. Rest easy.&&RIP great man. I never knew you but one of your works, Grave of the Fireflies, was one, if not the only movie that moved me to tears. Thank you for the masterpiece.&&Directed a good lot of awesome films, produced another good lot of awesome film and really shaped Ghibli as we've come to know it.

Did you know he was the one to bring in Joe Hisaichi in Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind ? Can't imagine the same Ghibli films without this team&&I agree with what has been said. Grave of the Fireflies is a movie that I feel every human being needs to watch once. I can’t ask another person to rewatch it, but I feel it is an experience that must be known, not only in the aspect of tragedy, but with the perspective of war as a whole; how it affects individuals in a country so different yet so similar to a lot of others. The tragedy and suffering caused was ultimately avoidable. War is more damaging than people want to think about, especially in a media culture of violence being commonplace, numbing the mind to how deeply tragic it really is. For me this film was an act of tough love; a punch to the gut to open my eyes and regain a better grip on reality. I am so, so grateful to Takahata and to Studio Ghibli for creating an experience so poignant I cannot forget it.&&Only Yesterday is my single most favorite Ghibli movie ever. So criminally underratef.&&While it was inevitable for it to happen given his age, this is still heartbreaking. We just lost one of the greatest anime directors of all time. 
He leaves behind a monumental legacy however. His films spoke about the tragedy of war and mid-life crises but also about family, comedy, and fantasy. And this is only with Ghibli, as during the 60s and 70s he was among the industry's pioneering directors. His influence cannot be truly measured.

May you rest in peace, Takahata-san. While I cannot bring myself to rewatch Grave of the Firefiles, I will always say that it is the best war film ever made.&&Press F to pay respects&&I am heartbroken. Takahata was the underappreciated master of Studio Ghibli and an absolute gem. 

I know he'd already made his last film, but still very sad news. I lived in Japan for about three years and watching My Neighbor the Yamadas makes me instantly nostalgic, for how well Takahata captures the smallest, most nuanced moments in Japanese culture. 

A master of making magical moments out of the mundane. &&I’ll pour out saké for my nigga Toshiba&&And Grave of the Fireflies, the best movie you'll only watch once.&&The art in Kaguya is unbelievable. There's a great making-of with the blu ray too. &&Pom Poko as well. Each of his films have their own magic.&&I liked his other works but princess Kagura just didn’t click with me&&Thank you for the suggestion. I'll try and give this a watch in his honor.&&A great retrospective on his career:
The Royal Ocean Film Society:  ""Isao Takahata- The Other Master""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anQeqlax0qk&&Such a great slice of life movie. The scene where the family tastes pineapple for the first time is so sweet and relatable.&&Started watching Takahata's work over the past 3 months, Only Yesterday really stuck with me more then the rest.   Really outstanding film&&This may be my all-time favorite anime. As highly rated as it is among the Slice of Life genre, it still feels underrated among all anime.

The film is really the best type of exploration of the feelings of growing up, feeling lost and lonely, looking back at your childhood for meaning. Ultimately the point is coming out on the other side by exploring the world, finding new meaning in life, someone to love, and a place in a community.

It's a great movie that is truly about life and what it means to be human.&&This is my favourite Ghibli movie actually. Great to watch when you're stuck in a rut or in a crossroads.&&Only Yesterday is basically the film Yasujiro Ozu would have made if he were an animator. It's really fantastic and underseen in the US because it took so long to actually be released here.&&Agreed!

The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect. The scene wherein [her father slaps her for wearing shoes indoors](#spoiler) was very powerful to me. [He's immediately sorry for what he's done, and never does it again. She even remarks to herself, ""That was the only time father ever hit me, which is why it was so confusing that it happened at all.""](#spoiler) (paraphrased)

Very real, very human experience. Definitely came from a heartfelt place in the writers' lives.&&Yeah it's my favorite movie. I've watched it so many times over the years. &&My absolute favorite parts are the night drive from the train station to the farm and the ending.&&I watched this a couple months ago and loved it. The ending scene with all the past versions coming together was so impactful.&&I second that recommendation. *Only Yesterday* was one of the most emotionally impactful movies I've seen, and definitely the most when it comes to anime.  
  
There are so many scenes in that movie that have the capacity to nearly move me to tears, and the ending definitely did. That song killed me.  
  
There was even something is the colors and animation style itself that just evoked this incredible sense of nostalgia.&&My favorite part, by far, is when she is running and the memories of the children are following her and encouraging her...I cried like a baby watching that scene. &&I finally got around to watching this last week. Such a good movie. &&Hirota: Rainy days, cloudy days, sunny days . . . Which do you like?

Taeko: . . . Cloudy days.

Hirota: Me too!

*Hirota runs away. 

What an absolutely adorable scene. Made me nostalgic for memories I didn't even have. &&I absolutely adore this movie. It's so sweet and stays with me no matter how long ago I watched it&&I always struggle to name a favourite, but Only Yesterday is the one I feel the most connected to. Absolutely devastated to hear of Takahata's passing. &&And don't watch grave of fireflies unless you don't want any magic and only want to cry&&The ending of the film coupled with the Japanese version of ""The Rose"" is still etched in my memory.

That film also won me a free week in Japan for two, so double love for it. Cheers Ghibli.&&Only Yesterday is the Country Roads one right?&&I think it is because Takahata's work are much more solidly grounded in Japanese culture and are made foremost for a Japanese audience, so his material are a lot harder for international audiences to connect.

To be fair, Miyazaki's stuff are equally Japanese, but he does have more of an eye for the universal message.&&Takahata's films were rejected from the Disney/Ghibli distribution deal, so Miyazaki's films are way more widely known.

Rejected for:  
Grave - death  
Tomorrow - woman has a period  
Pom Poko - 'war'  
They did finally give in on Princess Kaguya after it crushed the festival scene.&&And even the films and TV he did before Ghibli were exceptional.  I highly recommend this excellent [video essay](https://youtu.be/anQeqlax0qk) on Takahata that talk about his style and themes in all of his works.&&Miyazaki gets all the credit only in the West and outside of the animation/film industry.

Takahata was a household name and a very endearing person in the animation community.

I know Miyazaki has that dumb meme stuck to him about anime being a mistake but both of them really cared a lot about the animation industry not just in Japan but internationally. They strived to help the animation industry continue to produce quality films. Takahata will be missed.&&You cried because we are all ripped from our true selves in order to live, to bear the weight of the world and connect with others ... only to lose everything, and finally be erased when our time is up.  The movie is about coming to grips with this contradiction.

I am not sure the movie provides any real comfort or answers though.  It's more like a surgical documentary ... uncovering and examining the wound.&&Kaguya is one of the few Ghibli movies I still have to watch, and the only Takahata one. I guess this gives me a good reason to getting around to watching it.&&Takahata was a sneaky director. He could really get you to empathize with intense but repressed emotions of his characters in a way that you can't really feel in the moment-to-moment of the movie, but slowly builds up until he can just poke you lightly to make you fall apart. &&That was such a beautiful movie. I saw it on a list of must see movies for whatever year it was. Truly loved it. Recommend 100% to anyone that likes animated stories.&&I try to avoid watching movies like these. I lose it and cry very easily at touchy stuff. My family was watching the grave of the fireflies the other day and I quietly slipped into my room. &&Gotta watch it now since Kaguya makes me think too much of another character in Japanese animation...&&The film is based on the true story of its author, Akiyuki Nosaka. Akiyuki lost his father to the bombings, and both sisters died to malnutrition. In the film, he killed off the brother because he wrote it as a apology to his dead sisters. That's just heart wrenching. &&As a big brother it made me cry like a baby.&&[deleted]&&I've cried in movies before but Grave of the Fireflies is the only one that completely ruined my day. I had to cancel plans so I could stay home and weep&&I first watched it in a film class. The whole class played the Don't Cry game. We all lost. At the end the room was filled with collective sadness and embarrassment. 10/10 would cry with strangers again.&&What ended up winning. Please don't say some crappy dreamworks cgi crap fest. &&I thought this for a long time, but then i learned how the majority of voters feel about animation in general and now I don't care for the approval of such people.

Still would've been nice though I agree. &&It really was the best movie of that year, even beyond animation. If I were the dictator in charge of the oscars it easily would have won Best Picture. &&There's more important things in life than trophies. Those that recognize the film know just how wonderful it is, and no physical token can truly represent that. &&Grave of the Fireflies is a movie everyone needs to see once (and probably only once).  It's an *amazing* film, and has honestly stuck with me over the years more than anything else Ghibli has made, Miyazaki included.&&I recommend Only Yesterday, it is a hidden gem among hidden gems. Incredibly relatable if you're in your late twenties / early thirties.&&The three in the post title are all great, grave of the fireflies is the nost famous in the u.s.  and everyone ahould watch it but be ready to be sad.

Princess kaguya can only be described as a masterpiece, visually and emotionally beautiful I'm still sore thar it lost best animated oscar, but that categories treated as a joke anyway.

Pom poko is weird. That's the best way to describe it. Loose story about shapeshifting japanese racoons with magical testicles. Nit even a clear story structure, but I cant recommend it enough. Through the weirdness it has a real soul more than almost any movie I've watched. I won't lie for parts I was bored during it. But it made me feel so much in such a unique way, definitely give it a try&&They worked on many projects together when they started out like the [Heidi animated series (1974)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi,_Girl_of_the_Alps). It was directed by Isao with the screenplay by Miyazaki.&&Noooooooo :(&&I’m one of those people who has seen every Miyazaki Ghibli film, but only *Grave of the Fireflies* and *Princess Kaguya* of Takahata’s, both of which I throughly enjoyed. 

Which of his works would you recommend for someone who isn’t so familiar with his work? I’ve heard great things about *Only Yesterday* and *My Neighbours the Yamadas*. &&You could watch the [Heidi animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi,_Girl_of_the_Alps) directed by Isao with the screenplay by Miyazaki, made in 1974.&&I hope he wrote some of those down so they can either be released or actually turned into movies in his honor. &&Kaguya is my favorite as well.  I think it's Ghibli's masterpiece.  There is **so** much going on unspoken.  You have to really be paying attention.  But thoughtful watching is rewarded 1000 times ... it is so powerful and so full of universal wisdom about what it is to be human.  You're making me want to  watch it again...  Gah!  I have to get on with life.

I want to add ... you may relate to it because of your condition, but trust me ... the movie's message speaks to everyone.  We ***all*** feel like Kaguya.  Even if we are aware of it or not.&&I think you've expressed yourself perfectly.  I understand what you're conveying, and I can feel your pain.&&Perhaps you can respect his memory and his gift to you by keeping yourself safe.&&Hey iaswob. I hear you. I felt like an alien growing up or changing as you put it. Sometimes I wished I was an alien and could go away. Maybe I have autism, I've never been checked? I'd that what people do? Check themselves?? Heheh... Anyway, at the end of the day autism is just a word, and words are symbols, and the symbols make up our reality. There are no rules to it, this reality thing.. People say it is one thing, but, it's anything. Therefor, anything you can imagine or feel, is valid. Albeit unpopular. I hear you though and I get it. Greetings fellow changeling.. Maybe you should look into some proper ways to grieve, if it's really affecting you. Perhaps there's something you could do in Takahata's honour.. :) take care! &&If it’s any consolation, you expressed yourself beautifully and I feel you captured his essence more than anyone else in this comment , all credit to you &&Thank you for sharing. Ever since I stumbled across a free screening of *Kaguya* and could not leave my seat for 20 minutes at the credits and because the film and the song Inochi No Kioku were making me bawl, I've held the belief that anyone who has ever struggled with thoughts of suicide should watch  this movie. It's nearly single-handedly changed my perspective on the subject and relevant experiences, and is both cathartic and hopeful in a way that I can't possibly describe with just text.

I watch far more live action than I do animation, but because of *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya*'s profound emotional effects on me as an audience and outside of the theater, it remains my favorite film of all time. I will watch it again very soon in Takahata's honor.&&Actually, Red Turtle had a Dutch director, so not a Miyazaki film, but still a beautiful film nonetheless.&&And Anne of Green Gables way, way back.&&He touched so many lives, I guess ultimately thats the most you can hope to do in life. I sincerely hope he was happy with what he achieved.&&It's so good, a real experience&&He also directed My Neighbors the Yamadas, which I unfortunately forgot to mention in the title.&&To be fair, Ghibli as a studio was not active during Ni No Kuni 2's development, so the only influence on the game came from the composer, and the character designer.&&F&&Ebert loved Ghibli anime and is the reason I started watching it. He made a lot of people sit up and notice what anime could be.&&F&&エフー???????????&&My Neighbors The Yamadas is one of my absolute favourite Ghibli films - the style, the way it's presented in those little ""chapters"". It's funny, it's cute, it made me nostalgic in a way I didn't even know I *could* be, having never lived in Japan.

An absolutely devastating loss.&&[deleted]&&My dad and I rented it a few years ago and we thought ""Hey, it's Ghibli and they always make those feel-good movies for the whole family. Right?""

#**WRONG**&&Grave if the Fireflies. The most emotionally exhausting movie I have ever seen. &&And Only Yesterday, it's one of his more underrated films and very slice of life but so beautiful.&&I'll probably pay my respects to watch Grave of the Fireflies (I haven't seen it yet) because it is a personal tradition to honor an influential figure who recently passed. When Robin Williams died I watched Good Will Hunting.&&Watched it with a girlfriend who had never cried watching a movie before. We were both sobbing at the end. When it was over, instead of going to bed (it was late), she demanded I put on literally any movie 'as long as it isn't depressing.' As a sort of pallette cleanser. 

 So we watched Die Hard. &&I watched it around 20 years ago. I keep thinking I should rewatch it but I can’t ever do it. Every time I consider it I’m like nah, I don’t feel like being depressed right now. &&I remember watching Grave of the Fireflies and Pom Poko back to back, and oddly enough I found the latter to be more upsetting because I wasn't expecting it. I knew that Grave of the Fireflies was a sad and depressing film because people had told me, so I was prepared for it, I thought Pom Poko was a child-friendly film like My Neighbour Totoro with a similar tone, and boy was I wrong. The last act in Pom Poko the onion cutting ninjas really came out of the shadows (after being rather freaked out by all the weird stuff in the middle).&&Saw it like a week ago and it has me remembering it from anything I see. I felt devastated.&&Saw that it was recently put on Hulu, if anyone needs an extra push to seek it out

&&Too much to go through it again. It was very powerful. &&I will never ever watch that again.  I don't even want to hear the music.&&It's coming back to theaters in August.

https://www.fathomevents.com/series/studio-ghibli-fest&&I cried my eyes out after watching that and cannot bring myself to watch it again.&&It was one of the few Ghibli films I hadn’t seen, and I’d heard such great things about it, so I got it for Christmas from my sister last year and watched it as a family as the opening film of our annual Christmas movie marathon.

Beautiful film and incredibly moving, but I’ve never felt such melancholy on Christmas Day before...&&I originally watched it because some guy on a forum said it would make me cry (circa 2004, 14yrs old).  Little did I know that by ""cry"" what he really meant was ""be plunged into a monthlong depression"" that never really ended.&&Speaking of, both sub and dub versions of this movie were added to hulu.&&If you watch GotF and don't cry, you're not human.&&I've actually seen this movie several times. It's the saddest movie I've ever seen, but it didn't stop me from watching it multiple times because I just love the movie so much. After a while I stopped crying at the end. I'm dead inside.&&That's so true. I just realized how much I love that film but also that I've never seen it again after the first time and probably will never see it again.&&I own Grave if the Fireflies on DVD... it's as good as new, and has only been watched once. &&It is the one war movie I suggest to everyone who is not depressed. I watched it once, never again. Beautiful, moving, brilliant, top 10 of my list. Never watching it again.

I suggest to everyone, and will talk about it. But no, I won't watch.&&I watched Grace of Fireflies in Middle School. Fuckin made me feel awful to be American. &&My wife and I sat down to watch that movie one time.

I can never watch it ever again. The greatest movie I'll never watch again. It's the only movie where I cried at the end, not in a slightly, ""aw sweet/sad"" kind of cry. The kind that makes you depressed, distraught. &&I've tortured myself a dozen times to make sure others can share the pain. &&Grave of the Fireflies is the only thing that someone has stolen from me and then returned. 
&&Went into that movie what it was about and I have never cried harder in my life 
&&Spot on. I will never, ever, ever re-watch that movie.&&Despite all of the attention that Grave of the Fireflies receives, and justly so, as it is a remarkably poignant and beautiful film, I was moved to tears by The Tale of Princess Kaguya and find it to be arguably his greatest work. &&There's really nothing like that movie, in terms of the art. I'd been a fan of Takahata's long before I saw it, and all I could think throughout was that I was seeing the work of a true master of the craft, someone who had successfully taken all the lessons from his long life and career and applied them to one final piece.&&ooh i'll definitely have to hunt down that making-of, i'd love to see that. &&that's perfectly reasonable, not all movies have to appeal to everybody. &&Yeah, that film, and the pineapple scene specifically is always the first thing I think about when I think about Takahata. Such a simple but delightfully observed rendering of a specific time and place. The rest of the film is fantastic too of course, the past in conversation with the present and all that. Beautiful stuff.&&The part where her dad smacks her got me kinda emotional&&The scene where she's a child and walks home with the boy was so unexpected and delightful I grin like an idiot whenever I think of it. Such a great movie by a guy who really understand families.&&I think this scene is from My Neighbors the Yamadas.
EDIT: Yeah, I was wrong. This is really weird because I was 100% sure that this scene was from the Yamadas. I even had the scene in my head with the Yamadas animation style. Really odd. Sorry for the mistake.&&it makes me happy to know that i still haven't seen all of ghibli's movies. i've seen most of them, but with their track record i'm certain i'll absolutely love the rest of them as well.&&That movie is also such a great example of having really sombre adult themes in an anime movie and having it work. It's the kind of movie that would usually be live action but it still works so damn well as animated.

When it comes to people saying that anime is just for kids this is one of the example movies I usually give to the opposite. Sure you have things like Perfect Blue and other examples of thriller or horribleness but this movie is just such a perfect slice of life drama and so different from much of what I have seen.&&Way to put it. &&Oh, both of those music tracks are amazing. &&People who won't cry at that need to be on a watchlist. I couldn't help it, my eyes were crying and my lips were smiling on their own. &&That's Whisper of the Heart. Only Yesterday is the one with ""The Rose"" at the end. &&You're thinking of Whispers of the Heart!&&[deleted]&&Miyazaki's works were highly optimistic and cheerful and more Disney-like compared to Takahata.  It's not really a surprise they were so much more popular.&&I'd argue that it is mostly because Takahata always covered more mature topics while Miyazaki just stuck to fantasy.&&IIRC Pom Poko also got rejected because the raccoons had testicles. Magic testicles which they could grow and stretch to form a parachute. That movie is fucking trippy.&&Pom Poko was released by Disney on DVD:http://movies.disney.com/pom-poko
Uncensored, with no visual changes.
My Neighbors The Yamadas was also released.
Grave of the Fireflies was rejected because it wasn't licensed by Tokuma. All the Ghibli films released by Disney were Tokuma Shoten. Kaguya was GKIDS. Only half of Takahata's films weren't Disney.&&I woke up 30 seconds ago and then I read this. Christ.&&This is perfect, I’ve always struggled with that movie and this put it in a different context for me. Wow&&Oi, don't ambush me with feels like that.&&I feel like I have to see this now, but I also kind of don't want to.&&That first paragraph made me tear up a bit &&You will not be disappointed. It is one of Studio Ghibli's absolute masterpieces. Takahata truly went out on a high note.&&Wow. The apology thing makes everything even more sad than it already was, which I didn’t think was even possible. &&Nah it's cool, I didn't need another reason to cry from this movie....&&As a big brother, it made me furious at the older brother Seita.

So your aunt's a bitch and borderline abusive? She's still providing food and a roof over your sister's head - swallow your fucking pride and do what you need to do to look after your little sister for fuck's sake!

From interviews I've read, this was the actual emotion that the author was going for and hence why the whole film was an apology - for him being unable to look after his sisters.

Like many people, Grave of the Fireflies will probably be the best film I will watch only once, but for a very different reason (mainly because I don't want to put my fist through the screen in a misguided attempt to bitch slap some sense into Seita).&&""I'm sorry for your loss"" feels hollow to say, but I am.&&My husband gave me a plot synopsis of Grave of the Fireflies yesterday and before he was done, we were both crying. Jesus Christ, that movie broke my heart, and I never even watched it!&&Other movies I cry because they're sad but Grave of the Fireflies had me grieving for the characters. &&That was the year that How to Train Your Dragon 2 was nominated, and The Lego Movie was not. Since The Lego Movie got snubbed, Kaguya should have run away with it, but of course the Oscar voters, as always, have no appreciation for non-Disney animation. &&Big Hero 6 won that year.&&>(and probably only once)

Never seen a more accurate statement on Reddit before. This movie made me feel everything, yet managed to leave me feeling so hollow afterwards. I think that’s a definite sign that Takahata achieved what he set out to with the story of *Grave of the Fireflies*.&&2014 is a perfect example of the Best Animated Picture category being a joke. Big Hero 6 winning was pretty embarrassing and a perfect example of the Disney/Pixar circlejerk that occurs with the award. I enjoyed the movie, I enjoy most Disney/Pixar movies and often find them my favorite movies of the year. But Big Hero 6 was outclassed that year by all the other nominations besides Boxtrolls. I would've gone Princess Kaguya for Best Animated Picture that year, at least of those nominated since The Lego Movie was snubbed. &&I am still bitter about the Oscar lose too. Such a beautiful movie. I appreciated the movie and the Japanese version even more after watching the behind the scenes and it was shown that they did the voice acting before even drawing any of the scenes for the movie. &&Pompoko is absolutely insane.  It's more adult than it appears.  Has moments of classic folklore and surrealism that are pretty wild.  

Only Yesterday is a very simple film about nostalgia, and I found it to be very memorable.  It's comparable to an Ozu film. 

And Yamada's? Well it's the only Ghibli film I have yet to see... so I really should get around to watching that. &&Yeah but it is the last movie Isao was a art producer for. &&They also did [Heidi animated series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi,_Girl_of_the_Alps) directed by Isao with the screenplay by Miyazaki, made in 1974.&&I took a good friend to see it when they brought it out in a new dub a few years back.  She'd never seen a Ghibli before.  She was laughing with the giant magical raccoon balls super hard.&&Pom Poko is also forgotten eventhough it's one of Ghibli's more enjoyable films. &&Schindler's List didn't hit me as hard as Grave of the Fireflies.  Both are sad.  Schindler's List is, in an odd sense, beautiful.  It's incredibly sad but also heartwarming by the end but you have this feel of the tragedies that occurred.  Grave of the Fireflies is completely heart wrenching by the end.  It's a punch in the gut.  I can rewatch Schindler's List many times and be reminded of what happened.  Grave of the Fireflies really messes me up though that I don't want to rewatch it.  It tells a great story, but I don't want to hear that story again.  

Edit:  I still think Grave of the Fireflies is beautiful, but in a very different way.  It is blatantly, right from the start, a tragedy and you know it's going to be a tragedy.  It beautifully shows the errors of humans.  How we kill each other.  It's not a pro-Japanese/Anti-American movie either.  It criticizes the loyalty of the Japanese to the Emperor and what cost them while also criticizes American firebombing and what that causes.  It shows that what we do with ignorance and stubbornness can cause.  The fireflies are us.  The people.  Setsuko accidentally smushed the first firefly she got her hands on.  That is a beautiful way to portray the error of our human ways.  This is a completely Anti-War movie in the form of a tragedy.  &&I have a kid now about Setsuko's age...... yea, that shit is a wrecker. &&I had a similar experience. When I was like 7 or 8 my parents got me a couple of older Ghibli dvds as a birthday present. I really liked Totoro and Spirited Away at the time and was super excited when I opened them up. One of them was unrated and the other was pg13, but my family thought ""hey theyre just cartoons by the same guy who did that movie with cute furry monster and the cat bus, how bad could it be???"" Those movies were Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke. Shit fucked me up real good&&That’s The Road for me. It’s an incredible film I’ll never watch again.&&Yeah I saw Graves of Fireflies at about that age too. I remember it came out around the same time as My Neighbor Totoro and little me went in expecting a heartwarming story along the same lines. (The mother’s storyline in Totoro is a bit bummer, but it ultimately went well. So I thought I could handle a bit of sadness.) Oh man, I was NOT emotionally prepared for that. Mind you, that was well before the age of internet spoilers. The reviews just say it’s a very good cartoon with a very good message. 

I LOST IT, when they showed the sister prying out the last bit of candy from the tin and wasting away. A couple other scenes also made very deep marks on me. Including, when they carried out the mother, all bandaged up because she was hit by the bomb. And that was the BEGINNING of the movie. It gets worse for the kids! I had nightmares about that for ages. 

I have not seen the movie front to back since then (maybe a few clips here and there on YouTube to jog my memory). It’s just too hard. &&I'd need to watch Schindler's List again to be certain, but Life is Beautiful hit me more than it did for some reason. &&Oh my god, absolutely wrecked me too, watched it about 10 years ago and don't plan to watch it again any time soon  it's still so fresh in my mind, but princess kaguya was brilliant! &&Still haven’t seen grave of the fireflies a second time yet. Haven’t rewatched Life is Beautiful yet either. I know I will one day. Just not today. &&Hahaha this reminded me. I worked at a movie theatre as a teen when Princess Mononoke was out. This guy brings his maybe 6 years old daughter to see a movie. I remember she was all dressed up so maybe it was a daddy-daughter date, but he seemed really...I know know, harassed and rushed and he didn't know what movies were playing.

He asked what cartoon movies were out and I answered honestly. The minute he heard ""princess"" he was like, that's the one. In tried to tell him it wasn't Disney princess or really kid appropriate but he didn't listen. 

I watched them walk out be about 15 minutes or so after the booth started the film. Didn't even ask for a refund.&&My friend forced her 3 kids (8, 10, 12) to watch it after they punched each other fighting. Not as a punishment, but just so the siblings will get along. &&I thought this was true until I saw Barefoot Gen, another Japanese movie, except this one about the bombing of hiroshima. I'd maybe consider watching Grave of the Fireflies again. Watching Barefoot Gen again would probably shorten my life expectancy by about 10 years. &&The marble. The fucking marble. I hold it together okay for most of that movie but her trying to eat the marble just hits me in the gut everytime.&&I thought Requiem for a Dream would take this place for me. I was wrong after watching Grave.&&My mom had my sis and I watch it at 8 and 6. We were a bit traumatized.&&A couple years ago I watched Grave of the Fireflies at a local theatre. It was a double bill, featured back to back with, of all movies, My Neighbour Totoro \(they were screened together upon release\). That night was such an emotional rollercoaster. &&Too bad I didn't understand the real depth of the movie when I watched it when I was 8. All I thought of when it finished was 'why are there like two characters in the movie and they both end up dead???' So...yeah didnt leave a great impression on my childish brain but gonna have to rewatch it sometime (FYI I love Ghibli films in general so don't take this the wrong way). &&[deleted]&&The ending of the film coupled with the Japanese version of ""The Rose"" is still etched in my memory.

That film also won me a free week in Japan for two, so double love for it. Cheers Ghibli.&&That's my favorite anime movie, tied with Porco Russo, and one of the rare anime that speaks to adult women. Though adult men would enjoy it too.  I watch it at least once a year.&&I've bought it, but haven't had a chance to watch it yet. &&I bought it a year or so ago when they finally released it in the US (I heard Disney held the rights for a while without ever dubbing it).  I should watch it soon.  It's sitting next to Akira, which I also still need to actually sit down and watch.&&One of my favourite films too. I bought it for my mum on DVD for Christmas. She’s never seen anything from that world, and honestly, she hardly watches films at all. But she really loved it, and lent it to some friends.&&It's part of Studio Ghibli Fest this year. It's playing in theaters in August if you want to see it on big screen.&&Make sure you watch it in japanese with english subtitles. Grave of Fireflies will be a film you will never forget. Also appreciate that its based on a true story, a real man and his sister (actually 2, although only 1 is depicted in the film).

&&I would have called 911 first. &&Noice, smort.&&The best Christmas movie! Good plan man.&&Pom poko is severely under rated, and I mean that in both senses, people dont give it tue credit it's due and  not enough people watch it.  It's weird and beautiful in the best possible way&&Pom Poko lures you in to thinking it's a fun film, then hits you hard. Fantastic film.&&I watched it by myself on holiday a few years ago and same &&It's really strange because I am such a cry baby when it comes to moving and sad moments in film and TV, but for some reason I barely teared up watching GotF. I don't know if it's because of how much hype people gave the movie or if it's because I was more angry and than sad at the brother for [not sucking up his pride and staying at the Aunt's house (or at least leaving his sister there), though I know he was a young boy who probably wasn't thinking rationally, or who couldn't predict the consequence of his decision.](#spoiler). Now at the end of Princess Kaguya on the other hand, I literally wept.&&I don’t know whether to be impressed or appalled at what you’ve done to yourself.&&The grandpa from that movie reminds me of Takahata&&It's called Isao Takahata and His Tale of the Princess Kaguya and is feature length. &&or the part where she waves to see the birds off on stage. classic moment.&&I recently rewatched Only Yesterday (because of the Daisy Ridley dub), and it's from Only Yesterday. I can see why you'd think it was My Neighbours the Yamadas though.&&Also a great Ghibli film!&&Nah, it's Only Yesterday. The main character was being a brat the morning of a family day out. She decided not to go and they decided to leave without her. She changes her mind and steps outside without her shoes and the father smacks her one. He's taken aback by what he did and they stand there. It was the only time he hit her. &&I watched all 22 of them last year for the first time ever (most of them in the cinema) and Only Yesterday stands towards the top for me, even in the English dub it was great (Dev Pattel was casting that stood out like a sore thumb) but I plan on watching most of them again. 

Aside from Princess Mononoke, Takahata's films were the ones that resonated most strongly; Fireflies, Only Yesterday, Princess Kaguya and Pom Poko are all so special and wonderful. &&RIGHT?!?!?! The entire film gave me the feels in so many ways, but THAT part...fuuuuuuuuck...I felt like I was finding love and the entire world was cheering me on. Like, suddenly, my life became so simple in that one moment and nothing else mattered. And then tears and smiles and fuzziness....&&Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Whisper of the Heart directed by Takahata as well? Love that film.&&I think this is an underestimated aspect of Miyazaki's appeal above and beyond the average anime among American (and international) audiences whose expectations for feature length animated films were pretty well defined by Disney.

Obviously there are a ton of differences, and Miyazaki himself has been critical of parts of even the classic Disney films. But there is a lot of common ground. Both are kid friendly. Both have a fairy-tale quality to them. Typically, violence is deemphasized in both (Mononoke is a notable exception here, and is perhaps the Miyazaki film that most resembles action oriented anime familiar to fans of the medium). Most things are always very cute (again, Mononoke is arguably an exception as some of the imagery is actually quite grotesque).

This isn't to say the two styles aren't clearly distinct in all sorts of ways. But there is definitely enough in Miyazaki that jives with the expectations engendered by Disney to not totally throw off the casual American viewer. This is less true nowadays, especially among millenniasl who grew up on Dragon Ball Z, but back in the day I imagine it helped Miyazaki garner a wider audience. As a parent in the 90's, you would see an advert for something like Kiki's and recognize it as the sort of film you like to take your kids to see. This is less true of something like Grave of the Fireflies.

Obviously this in no way reflects on the quality of Miyazaki's films (which are often masterpieces), other types of anime (which are sometimes also masterpieces, like Grave of the Fireflies or Akira), or even Disney (Disney films are also often masterpieces like Cinderella).&&I think I know what you're trying to say, but take error with the wording. Fantasy isn't mutually exclusive to meaningful storytelling, and Miyazaki is one of the best examples of someone pulling both off. 

Like, Howl's Moving Castle is about the moral confusion of warfare in the age of the Iraq War, Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa are about the delicate balance of industrialization and nature as two forces at odds with each other that also are somehow dependent on each other, Kiki's Delivery Service is about that awkward period of life where you're learning how to become an independent adult, and even Ponyo is about the impact of natural disasters on local communities. 

Miyazaki has always tried to make a product that's easier to digest at a surface level as mass entertainment, but he always has something powerful and insightful in his spirit inspiring the stories he tells. 
&&Miyazaki tells fantastical stories to get across very real messages. Takahata tells more realistic stories with a hint of magical realism.&&The Wind Rises is not fantasy - though it has a few fantastical visual elements - and I'd say it is maybe the best of Miuazaki's movies... though almost all of his are fantastic.&&I'm not sure what you're trying to say but mature topics can be and are covered a lot in fantasy. 

&&Not racoons, Tanuki [\(ie. Mario 3\)](https://www.mariowiki.com/images/thumb/9/96/TanookiMario_SMB3.jpg/600px-TanookiMario_SMB3.jpg) but yeah it is a bit weird for a first experience.&&""...oh fuck, it's one of *those* days""&&Good morning!&&That's how the character feels too&&You will enjoy it. Even from a purely artistic standpoint it's a phenomenal experience. It doesn't have the raw emotional gutpunch of Grave of the Fireflies, but as stated above, it does have this sort of... Existential sadness that might not hit everyone, but will also stay with you for a longer time if you let it. &&And it’s really faithful to the folktale, too, which makes me really happy as a lover of Japanese mythology. 

Edit: if the ending doesn’t make sense to someone, think of it that it’s a Buddhist myth, and think about how that applies. &&Damn, Big Hero 6 isn’t bad at all to me, but literally every movie you mentioned is a lot better. They definitely have a Disney bias&&> That was the year that How to Train Your Dragon 2 was nominated, and The Lego Movie was not. 

Well, How to Train Your Dragon 2 was better than The Lego Movie. 

That year my ranking would be: 

1. Kaguya

2. HTTYD2

3. Lego Movie

4. Song of the Sea 

5. Big Hero 6

And I say this as someone who really enjoyed Big Hero 6. &&You'll see that statement about eight dozen times in this thread alone. &&Reddit needs to stop this ""only watch once"" circlejerk. Grave of the Fireflies gets better with multiple viewings.&&Pom Poko gets too much undeserved hate. I thought it was genuinely funny and charming. &&Yamadas is fun&&I am pretty depressed by this news, but man, very few people can boast of leaving this shithole of an existence with making Princess Kaguya and the art style of The Red Turtle (which I like more than the film itself). &&In case you didn’t know, both films are not only based on true stories, but fairly faithful to actual historical events. &&That's actually one major focus of criticism of *Schindler's List*.

Someone once half-jokingly called it *Survivorship Bias: The Movie*.&&Grave of the Fireflies has no upswing. It's quite literally a punch to the gut and then that's it, the movie ends. Put me in a sad mood for a day, such a powerful movie.&&Grave of the Fireflies hits harder because of the self wrought tragedy on top of a terrible backdrop. It takes a shitty situation and compounds the suffering it with personal mistakes. Schindler's List is about the goodness of humanity rising in spite of the original situation which makes it hauntingly beautiful.&&My sister had, at the time, the same age that the little girl in Grave of the Fireflies. It was not pretty when the waterworks came. &&i have never seen grave of flies- but have seen schindler's... but after reading this thread am now intending to.... when i have the emotional strength. anyway what made me reply to this was thinking about how i cant rewatch iron giant..... i know, it might not be quite on the same level as the two mentioned but the way they hit on the absolute innocence of being, it hits me so hard and when he sacrifices himself in the end... omg i literally haven't watched that movie since i was a kid. i'm 25 now &&Japanese are incredibly good at re-framing the war from children's 
point of view. I thought that reading Barefooted Gen, watching Now and Then Here and There, and watching Gundam series. I don't think any other nation has so many works about war that are told from children's point of view, and show how children are used and suffer in the war. &&The first and only time I watched it my kids (a boy and girl) were about the same age as both the main characters.  That movie destroyed me at the end.  &&When released, ""Grave Of The Fireflies"" was a double feature with ""My Neighbor Totoro"", so tons, tons of kids were in the cinemas in Japan.  &&I watched it once. Was an amazing 40 minute movie. When they found the small bunker with the canned food and I turned the TV off, I was very relieved everything ended well. &&Try reading the book&&Boy in the Striped Pajamas :/&&Great film, for those unaware, it's a lighthearted romp about a father and son on a walking tour across America. You won't believe the people they meet. &&What's it about?&&I think the decision was final when Ashitaka amputates two arms with one arrow and decapitates with another. &&Holy shit that's actually brilliant. &&And?&&It is a good movie to teach you why you should listen to your elders. Seita’s aunt was just bitchy, but she still fed them and gave them shelter. It was wartime and everyone was on edge. But no, despite his sister getting pellagra, he still refuses to just GO BACK TO HIS AUNT’S HOUSE so she can get something to eat. It was sad, but not devastating. Even the author said that Seita was being a spoiled brat. &&People might know Barefoot Gen as the one with [*that* bombing scene.](https://youtu.be/D22kzf_bDvg)&&Fuck man. That bomb scene was so graphic and devestating. &&I have it coming in the mail from my DVD rental thingy. Might do a Barefoot / Fireflies double this weekend...&&Thx my dude! Im a sucker for good movies and I love discovering hidden gems like this. just by reading reviews I know I'll have a good time.&&They're both devastating, but to me, for some reason, the most devastating Japanese film I have seen is Rainbow Song. Fuck. &&I just watched this movie after reading your comment. I haven't cried this much in a long time. It doesn't help that I have an 8yr old and a 6month old, but holy shit that was brutal.&&I took your statements as a bit of a challenge, because as terrible as the subject matter is, I love Graveyard of the fireflies and have always thought of it as the most depressing anime film.
Well kind sir or madame, you win that challenge.....&&In a permanent damage way? My kids are 8 and 6 and love the Ghibli movies. But I haven’t seen Grave and I’m not sure what age to expose them to it. &&Yeah I'm not sure at what age people more-or-less start to really get a handle of those emotionally gripping movies. I'm sure it varies from person to person though.&&I cried during the ending sequence as a 23 year old man&&Honestly, I think the film is best viewed alone or with someone in private. In a theater you're likely to be viewing it with a bunch of fans who have seen it before. I think that might ruin the experience for a first time viewer. This is a film you need your own space to process.&&Don't. Don't watch this movie with other people. Watch it alone then never again. &&Are they playing different films at different locations? Because the theater near me isn't listing it but a bunch of other Ghibli films. &&Oh damn. I might have to see it. But then again, I don't want to bawl like a baby in public.&&Yeah, same here, Grave of the Fireflies left me sad but not crushed. Only Yesterday got tears from me, Pom Poko as well for how poignant it was, Princess Kaguya floored me and I will possibly never watch it again despite it becoming one of my favorite films. &&Both are absolutely incredible films that I'd call ""must-see"" for anyone that calls themselves a fan of good cinema. I think GotF hot me so hard because I was just feeling all of the emotions at once, including that anger you mentioned. Also, as a big brother, it was especially hard to watch.&&GOTF is also an allegory for Japan in WW2, the main character respresents Japan not giving up and the futility and loss it went onto create.&&I'm confused. Did I reply to the wrong comment? I was talking about the pineapple scene.&&Whisper of the Heart was directed by Yoshifumi Kondō. It was the only film he directed with Ghibli before his death in 1998. He was animation director and key animator on several other films. 

The Ghibli films directed by Takahata are Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, Pom Poko, My Neighbours the Yamada's, and The Tale of Princess Kaguya. &&> Obviously this in no way reflects on the quality of Miyazaki's films

Oh absolutely not.  I love both directors equally.  But from a ""craft"" perspective, I actually think Takahata was the superior director just in terms of depth and sensitivity.  He explored the human condition way more deeply and honestly than Miyazaki, who is famous for striving  to depict the nuances of outward human behavior honestly, but it was always within an idealized dream-like universe and his characters were very simple in comparison to Takahata's.  &&Yeah! Calling something like Princess Mononoke not mature is doing it a massive disservice. It’s one of those few movies that are made up of completely grey characters, with their own motives and own trials, rather than simply being servants of good and evil.&&And Spirited Away too has a core message about suddenly adapting to a strange, new, hostile world that you probably aren't prepared for which will resonate for all ages, even though Miyazaki said he targeted the plot of the film at his granddaughter's age (9 or 10 iirc). I've found the exploration of this theme has resonated with me so deeply on my current life as a young adult moving from the city I called home for 12 years to go to university and living independently for the first time in my life, that I'd never consider Miyazaki's work to be immature in that regard. &&I agree, The Wind Rises is probably my favorite movie of his. Some of the scenes are border-line fantasy in their whimsical feeling (especially some of the scenes with Caproni) and some of the scenes are dark and much more real. It's one that I think everyone should watch!&&It is a bit sad but it's full of joyful moments throughout, especially at the beginning but even here and there in the 2nd act (though that part is perpetually  tinged with bitterness - oh hey just like adulthood irl!), but tbh I think it taught me to hang on to the things that matter and live your best life whatever your circumstances.  Birds bugs beasts ...&&The animated section is usually a joke. They have admitted to vote for the movie their kids like.. Big Hero 6 deserved an Oscar in my mind tho. If The Lego Movie was nominated, it would have been a competition, but Big Hero 6 is one of my all time favourites. :)

Just to add to this, Lego Batman wasn't nominated last year either. &&My personal ranking is: 

Kaguya/Lego Movie (depending on mood)

Song of the Sea

Big Hero 6

HTTYD2

I put The Lego Movie in my personal top 10 non-Disney/Pixar/Ghibli animated films. This is partly due to the fact that I always loved Lego bricks growing up, but I also think the movie is a hilarious, intelligent deconstruction of Hollywood chosen one narratives. &&Lol you're getting downvoted for admiring his great work. Great job Reddit.&&I'm sure it does, but I truly cannot bring myself to find out.&&I didn't even realize it was hated.  I think people hate it because of how Ghibli it *looks* , but it's still just another weird Takahata film. His films weren't really meant to be popular. &&The only difference between Grave of the Fireflies and real life is the guy lived and then went on to write his story with him dying as he wished he had so long ago.&&It’s a major criticism among people that didn’t understand the damn movie. &&That‘s absurd. That scene with walking in a field of burning bodies is imprinted in my memory forever. I remember feeling lile I was seeing hell on earth. I only got the same nauseating feeling by visiting one of the actual camps.

There‘s criticism and there‘s throwing stones at something well done. &&Very apt :) &&Yeah I definitely ugly cried &&We were shown Grave of the Fireflies in school in Japan in 5th grade. Every single person in class cried and sobbed, including the teacher. &&I can understand that.  It's worth the watch because it tells an accurate story that is good to know about.. It grows you as a person.  You don't want to hurt yourself by watching it again unless you need to cry and get emotions out.  
I was born in 1990 and I loved The Iron Giant.  That ending hurt me.  He did it to save people though so he'll always be a hero.  Grave of the Fireflies just kicks you again and again and again and then it ends.  Moral of the story is basically, ""War sucks and people suffer. Now let me tell you a story about how some people suffered.""    &&Jesus Christ. I know we often joke that some Disney movies like Bambi are ""too sad for kids"" but Grave of the Fireflies makes the most depressing Disney movie look like Bugs Bunny. I also can't imagine the emotional whiplash of going from Totoro, which while dealing with real issues and deep emotions, is ultimately a very kid friendly movie that, because it does not assume kids are dumb, is also a movie that speaks to adults. Fireflies is actually not kid friendly imo, and I think is really best viewed as a cartoon made for squarely for adults.

I mean the movie it gets compared most often to is Schindler's List for crying out loud.&&Feels to me like that was well planned. Traumatise kids in the hope that when they grow up, they don't allow anything like that to happen for their generation.

Or maybe they just liked seeing children cry. &&That is the smartest move I’ve ever heard.

That movie still gives me that rock in your stomach fell just thinking about it. &&Like Life Is Beautiful. It's a heartwarming short film about a happy Jewish family living in Italy before the war. I loved how they ended it on a high, leaving us to assume that they escaped to the US and lived happily ever after.&&I did the exact same thing with the book! I just couldn't bring myself to go any further because I just knew it was all downhill from there.&&I'm sorry Phoebe, your mom Lied.&&Nice try, Satan&&Yeah, the book doesn’t sugar-coat everything like the movie does.&&I read the book in one hit because I really wanted to see the movie, but generally prefer books to their adaptations. So I read the book in a couple of hours, then watched the movie straight away. I was numb by the end, and just took myself off to bed where I rocked myself to sleep.&&Princess Mononoke opens with a demon-possessed giant wild boar wrecking the countryside, while the hero, Ashitaka, tries desperately to kill it. He does, but the demon infects his arm, and the infection slowly starts spreading. 

Overall, the film is an epic about the struggle between several factions of forests spirits and animals, and two factions of humans, with our hero caught in the middle trying both to purify himself and not die. The titular princess is introduced to him when she is sucking blood from a giant wolf's wound. It's an awesome movie, arguably Hayao Miyazaki's greatest work. &&God that scene is so badass.&&Question is did it work?&&Peaceful for a day she said&&Ooh! I have a story to share about Barefoot Gen!

I taught a group of adults, who were really fluent and just wanted to keep their skills up. Well, one man in there, older, but stupid well spoken, told us a story. 

He’s from Hiroshima originally, and lost his older sister in the bombing. He was sent away to the countryside about two months before, but his sister wanted to stay at her school. 

He was within visual distance of the bomb, and, as a 5th grader, went in afterwards with his classmates and family right after. He said that if you want a “tame idea of the travesty” to watch Barefoot Gen, as it’s some of the closest to it, but still only scratches the surface. 

He said that he’s happy his sisters school was near the blast point, because he couldn’t handle the idea that she would have lived for a few hours or days in the absolute pain and horror he saw coming into the city. 

It’s why he spent his life learning English (his dissertation for his masters was about Huckleberry Finn and how American racism relates to the Japanese treatment of foreigners in an attempt to explain and broach the cultural divide and make sure it doesn’t happen again).

Next time I’m back in my old city, I’m really hoping to get to visit him again. As of a year ago, he was in good health, but with some problems in his nervous system. He was a great man, and I want to visit and ask him to recount his early life and record it for others to hear. &&holy shit going in blind and DID NOT expect that considering the art style&&And it gets worse from there.

I remember reading the manga for some Japanese culture class I had to take. Seeing that animated was even more horrible.&&Went to a local screening of Barefoot Gen in January. About the time that the film started, I realized there were a a parent with a couple of children in the audience.

Man, I felt so bad for those children. They were actually completely silent when that scene hit. Not a word. It took about 10 or 15 minutes before they left their shocked state, enough time to get deeply traumatized by the subsequent horrors, and before they started crying. It was not until that point that the parent decided to make them leave the auditorium.

Who brings their small kids to watch Barefoot Gen?

And not even a year prior I had experienced something similar with In This Corner of the World.&&Holy fuck...&&Why do you do this to yourself&&Throw in *When the Wind Blows* for a perfect triple feature. &&Aw jeez, well I guess I'm glad that you watched it. Really it's a movie everyone should see at least once. I had to watch it as part of a ""Pacific War Through Film"" class and both Fireflies and this movie were in it. Fireflies made people cry, but Gen straight up made people leave the room or just become enraged. Funnily enough, the only two animated films definitely packed the most punch. &&I don't think so. Though, I had never been exposed to that degree of continual suffering before. Those kids went through hell. Short description of the movie is living through the firebombings of japan during wwII, [the focus being a brother and sister who survive](#spoiler)&&27 here. Only Yesterday's cryometer was only topped by Your Name, in which I cried on 3 separate occasions.&&Polite way of saying you should watch it alone as the amount of you crying in front of strangers and strangers in front of you is just embarrassing.&&https://www.fathomevents.com/series/studio-ghibli-fest Is like the main page for it. Scroll down for Grave of the Fireflies and put your zip code in.&&Bawling in public alongside a whole theater of others doing the same doesn't sound too bad, kind of therapeutic even.&&In my experience, this film is too sad to make you bawl. &&There’s an amazing museum/memorial on Okinawa that was erected in the wake of the Battle of Okinawa. It lists the names of all those who died both military and civilian during the battle. All nationalities. Over 200,000 names. Over 200,000 dead when there was realistically no way for the Japanese to further influence the outcome of the Pacific campaign. 

Within the museum there are exhibits covering life on Okinawa before, during, and after the battle. One story that sticks with me is of a woman fleeing an area that is being shelled. She had her baby on her back in a carrying apparatus. She reached safety and took the child off her back, only to find that it’s head had been cut off, likely from shrapnel from the shelling.

I’m a Marine, working on Okinawa at the time as an activated reservist to earn money to send home to my wife and then 1 year old son. 

That museum and park tore me up. I was so sad and angry at the same time. Pissed at the futility of it all and the losses suffered by a bunch of farmers who just wanted to keep on farming.&&I think Ashitaka's a pretty perfect character honestly - he's selfless, brave, and willing to stand up for strangers. The other main characters are much less perfect. &&mononoke was the first anime i saw that i thoroughly enjoyed. completely changed my perspective on the genre. still think (like most genres) that the bulk of it is trash, but there is some phenomenal art to be found&&As someone who offcially started being adult a few weeks ago after moving in with my fiance, I feel like I need to watch Spirited Away now. (It's one of the few Ghibli movies I haven't gotten to watch.)&&Similarly, I see Spirited Away's ""main"" feeling to be about remembering your true self despite the tumultuous world around you.  
  
The most peaceful point in the movie is on the train leaving the bath house, and in the end Haku ""remembers"" who he is. &&Most bashing I have seen is that it's supposedly over the top with it's environmental message, which I can sort of see to an extent but I don't really think that's what the movie is trying to do at all. Essentially it's a movie about life and change and adaptation to that change, both internal and external.

Also to me much of it is just a really funny and endearing movie.&&holy fucking yikes&&I didn't know that. Thank you so much for sharing. My heart hurts for him just thinking about it. I can't seem to get my husband to watch it all the way to the end. It is such a powerful and tragic story.&&Oh good, now I can feel even more shitty when I think about the movie.&&I remember when I read that it wrecked me all over as the movie flashed through my mind with the extra thought that it was born into this world as this man's eternal regret...

&&[deleted]&&I think Totoro was played after, to lift the audience's spirits.&&Grave of the Fireflies is plenty kid friendly. It tells the story from the point of view that kids can relate to, and empathize with. Its just audiences in America are not used to kids reading/watching about real life tragedies. In Japan I grew up reading Barefooted Gen manga (Hiroshima nuclear strike survivor story told from the point of view of a kid who lost almost the entire family) it was in every classroom and every school library. My class watched Grave of Fireflies in 5th grade. This is how you keep horrors of the war from being forgotten - you teach them to the kids by showing age appropriate but brutal truth. This is how you keep the country from sending troops to fight proxy wars oversees, and from fighting unending wars for phony reasons. &&After living and teaching in Japan for so long, you may be on to something. 

Many elementary schools have things like “Peace Day” assemblies, which in the surface are a great idea. They talk about the world, and wanting peace. 

Then, they go off on a sharp left that made me, an American, feel uncomfortable. One school just read kid-friendly stories about peace, using animals or whatever. Another one, though, went full on “Americans and the ravaging of Okinawa” on them. 

There are 1st graders here, mind you. And they’re telling the story of a boy who’s had his whole family killed in air raids and has to hide in a cave, gets attacked, and somehow by the end has lost an arm and leg to the American invaders. 

Then, at both the schools, the 5th and 6th grade kids go off to watch a documentary on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

I wish I knew what days these assemblies were, so I could catch the flu and miss that whole week, I always feel like kids who loved the big, fat, goofy white lady who plays games with them are now looking at me in a different light, and by that time it was too late to say “I’m Canadian!”

So shock and awe does happen here. A lot. So your theory wouldn’t surprise me one bit. &&Ikr, for me it felt like a bucket of ice thrown into my stomach. One time is enough. :(&&I've seen both and honestly imo it's actually really faithful to the source material besides stuff they had to cut for time&&This is a fantastic summary.&&Nope, Laputa will always be his best work. He wrote the story, scenario, dialogue, drew most of key frames, directed it, and even wrote lyrics to the main song. Its a shame that English dub is awful - they added extra lines that weren't even there, and tried to simplify and spoon feed it to you.  &&That's one of those things I feel like I very vaguely remember. I must have see a bit of it somewhere. I should probably explore it then&&nah they're long gone. Mistook Grave of the Fireflys for Lord of the Flies.&&For a day haha&&Now behave or I make you watch it again!&&Thanks for sharing that.&&>It’s why he spent his life learning English (his dissertation for his masters was about Huckleberry Finn and how American racism relates to the Japanese treatment of foreigners in an attempt to explain and broach the cultural divide and make sure it doesn’t happen again). 

I was just in Hiroshima the other week. I was in the Peace Memorial Hall, reading the stories of survivors mourning the victims... Really gutwrenching, really touching. Only stayed in Hiroshima for a day unfortunately, but it was really powerful.&&I've been seeing a lot of comments like this lately. Comments about how the Japanese are really welcoming towards Americans because they don't want history to repeat itself & that embracing another culture is the best defense towards that. I think it's really endearing & hopeful.&&There was a guide/volunteer in the Peace Park circa 2011 who survived the bombing as a small child but lost his older sister.  She was a part of the group of about 8,000 students who were cutting firebreaks through the city, the vast majority of whom died in explosion and resulting firestorm.&&If you ever get a chance to see him again, you can record his story on the storycorps app:

https://storycorps.org

It automatically uploads his story to the library of c congress. &&I've read stories about what Hiroshima was like immediately post-bombing. I understand completely why he was happy his sister was killed instantly because those inflicted with radiation burns really suffered. He sounds like an amazing person.&&The mother reaching for her baby...Jesus Christ&&We read the first Volume of Barefoot Gen for my Graphic Novels course.  It was a powerful a depressing read for sure, but this was a whole other level.  I didn't even know they made a film, but wow. &&Oh yeah, don’t trust the cover of the book. Super happy looking. &&Complete the night with In This Corner of the World, for the complete Hiroshima experience.&&Which I also set aside a couple of days ago, purely because I just finished cataloguing 2563 DVDs / Blurays in my lil collection&&I watched it in theatres and the worst part was walking out of the theatre since my eyes were blood red and stained with tears. Absolutely worth it though.&&Nice. It's showing at one of the theaters in the suburbs. Bummer it isn't at the nice one in walking distance from my house, though. Thanks! &&Thanks for the link friend!

A bit disappointed that Kiki's isn't being shown, as it is my personal favorite Ghibli film. But I will definitely try and make one of the showings of Spirited Away or Mononoke &&If you want to know something more nauseating, it’s what the Japanese government did to the Okinawans. You know why so many people died and most were civilian casualties? Because the government refused to evacuate the island. They told the civilians that the Americans were going to come and slaughter them all. So many killed themselves out of fear. The Japanese military also stole all the food on the island. There was little left for the civilians, so the soldiers forced the civilians to either kill themselves or kill each other so they’d have more to eat. They also used the remaining survivors as human shields. Initially, the Americans would try and help the Okinawan civilians but soon the Japanese would send Okinawans to trick the Americans. So they no longer could afford to help the civilians. Once the battle was over, still more Okinawans killed themselves and each other for fear of getting brutalized by the Americans. When the Americans actually treated the survivors nicely and fed them, they were shocked and confused. Basically, the entire Battle of Okinawa was a disaster all because of the Japanese government. 

This treatment throughout history has caused Okinawans to still resent the Tokyo government and not caring about them and throwing them under the bus. &&the bulk of mononoke is trash, or the bulk of anime?&&Spirited Away is one of my all time favorite movies, maybe only eclipsed by The Green Mile.  I highly recommend you give it a watch.&&Kiki's Delivery Service also explores the themes of growing up, moving away from home and being unsure of your place in the world like Spirited Away does. IMO it's a lot more direct in this theme but both movies are an enchanting delight from start to finish, so if you're keen on that theme give them both a watch.&&He ended up living well, being rather successful and well liked, and died in 2015. It's funny to think that he would have rather died with his sister than lived the life he had. Oof.&&I wouldn’t try to get your husband to watch it all.   He is probably completely wrecked by the story at the point he stops watching.   &&https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grave_of_the_Fireflies_(short_story)&&Schindler's List after would lift my spirits. GotF wrecked me the first time I saw it and I was an adult!&&According to this [article](https://www.tor.com/2017/06/07/studio-ghibli-shows-their-range-my-neighbor-totoro-and-grave-of-the-fireflies/), you are correct, though they test-screened it both ways:
> Apparently when they planned the feature in Japan, they noticed that if they showed Totoro first, people would leave early on in Grave because it was too much to take after the joy of the other film. If they swapped them, Totoro could lighten the mood enough for people to experience both films.&&Yeah I was wondering about the order. Because they would effect each other. Would almost be cruel but not impluasible to have played it with the negative end though.&&Pro-tip: Don't claim you're Canadian either. We did some awful awful shit to our Japanese-Canadians during that time.&&Oh man. Same here in Korea. I feel like these kinds of things were taught to me as a child in Canada and the UK as 'some of the horrible things we and other people have done'. Overall world history. But in Korea (and from the sounds of it, sometimes Japan too) it's closer to 'tragedies inflicted upon us that we must remember'.

Hiroshima was horrible. Colonialization of Korea by Japan was horrible. But the point is not to sit there and feel sorry for yourself and wish everyone was as kind as you. (Ask the Vietnamese about Korea. Ask the people that worked in Unit 731 about Japan.) The point is to realize that normal people are responsible for small parts in great atrocities when they're not careful. The point is not that *our great nation is unique in only ever being the victim and all the bad shit we did, well that's the old us!*

Sorry... Tangential rant I know. But I feel your discomfort on this. And god forbid you bring any balance to the discussion because then you're the foreigner attacking our country. &&Went to school in Japan. We had Barefooted Gen in the classroom starting with 5th grade. Gripping story, I cried rivers over that manga. I still remember some images from it - burned into my brain. &&It is a very similar feeling for a Japanese-American, like myself, sitting in school during Pearl Harbor day&&I kinda agree, it is one of the first book based movies I have watched that fit my idea of the book almost perfectly.

I either have a couch, or can recommend places to stay (my good friend is a Buddhist priest in takachiho who runs a Air BnB at the temple, stuff like that!)&&I want to be cynical and brutally honest about this. From what little I have read on the topic and given Japan's widely conservative and isolationist culture, I call bullshit on this moral high ground.

***

 I don't think the Japanese people broadly embraced US culture out of a desire to mend fences and prevent future strife. They were decimated and have US military base/s within their territory to this day. The surrender of the Japanese high command and introduction of an occupying force and the economic relationship that has been fostered between the two is paramount when considering why a proud culture might come to absorb an enemy culture.

I haven't been too pushy, I just really love the movie. I asked him if he thinks he'll ever be able to finish it and he said he's not really sure.

Even the small things can have a big impact.&&I know that, here in Japan, the generation born in the 30s and 40s had some extreme hate towards the previous generation and the imperial military for instigating the war and making them grow up in a war-torn country. Postwar pacifist activism (esp. in the 50s and 60s) often turned violent, because not only was it a yearning towards some universal ideal, it was also a venting of frustration against the very real injustice and suffering that the prewar Japan had caused, which was all too apparent by that time.&&I get what you mean. I agree that it feels like most anime is pretty bad or mediocre. Gotta do some good digging to find a great one.&&Ironic, not comical&&Funny in a ""forcing laughter is the only way I can not cry right now"" kinda way. &&Ouch&&And then you got to Night Watch and it hit you right in the feels like every time.&&It is a very disturbing book but I think it is worth finishing. The ending is not really dark it is almost hopeful you just have to get through all the dark stuff to get to the end.&&Exactly, i still remembered when i was 7 and saw a street kid no older than me holding his younger brother literally grabbing a half eaten burger from a trash bin and gave it to his brother. Broke even my younger self heart. Still sad when remembering that. This was in SE Asia&&Luckily because there are so many titles there are still plenty of good series out there.

As usual I picked my favorite character, Waluigi. My cousin said to me, ""Anon why do you always pick that boring character???"" I couldn't contain myself, ""HE'S NOT BORING YOU FUCK! HE'S THE BEST CHARACTER! NOT JUST IN THIS GAME BUT OF ALL TIME!"" My mommy came running over and swiped the wiimote right out of my hands. ""ANON"", she said, ""If you're going to be like that on thanksgiving then you should just go to your room!"" ""FINE!!!"" I screeched, holding back tears as I stomped upstairs to my abode.

 ""They just don't understand"" I whimpered tearfully, when suddenly I hear a shuffling in my closet. ""W-what was that? Who's there?"", I inquired. ""it's-a meeee..."" the voice cooed. ""W-waluigi?"" I peeped. The double doors gently opened and from my enormous walk-in closet, my lord and savior, Waluigi, emerged.

 He glided towards me, erect. ""W-what's this?"" I whispered. He did not answer. I felt myself floating backwards onto my bed and I felt a strange arousal come over me. My clothing removed itself from my body, my belt unbuckling of its own accord. Once I was fully exposed I was lifted into the air, and rolled over onto my hands and knees by the Purple One's big, strong arms. 

 Then... he mounted me... claiming my body for his own. As he enters the cave of the unspoken holy, I feel his warmth encompass me. I feel filled up. I feel complete. With each thrust of his love, met with a ""WAH"", I feel that I have found my purpose for being. To serve him and his flesh with my flesh. Suddenly, with a mighty ""WAHHHHH"" he is finished. As his final trumpet of passion sounds, I know that it is finished, that I have served my purpose. I feel him slide out. Flesh out of flesh. And though it was painful I remember that life often is, and to suffer pain for such a great purpose is the only true joy of life.

First Image of John Travolta as a Crazed Stalker in Thriller 'Moose' - Directed by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit,56651,8epi2t,https://i.redd.it/sopzgv7cbyt01.jpg,2747,1524616999.0,,"**Description:**

A rabid film fan stalks his favorite action hero and destroys the star's life.

**Release Date:**

Unknown, 2018&&TIL Fred Durst is directing his 3rd feature length film.&&I love Mad Libs.&&Holy hell. &&Fred Durst is directing now? I guess I’ve been under a rock....&&If you had told me in 1999 that Fred Durst was going to direct a movie starting John Travolta when Donald Trump was president, I would have thought you were full of horse shit. And I was only 11. &&Picture taken before he got the part.&&Holy shit, that's amazing.&&Sounds like this will be The Fan meets One Hour Photo.  The Fan had the stalker plot about Robert Deniro becoming obsessed with Wesley Snipe's baseball character, yet Deniro's character had a fairly bold personality.  From this image, it seems like Travolta's character will be more of a loner/loser type.  

It has been years since I've seen One Hour Photo, yet I remember it had some good eerie scenes of Robin Williams' character ""people watching"" and thinking about how to infiltrate the stalked-family's daily lives.  Travolta may be a (formerly) big star, yet he's proven himself to be good at these smaller, lonelier characters.  I really liked the scenes in the movie Phenomenom of him being confused or feeling isolated by his character's newfound special abilities.  

I also liked him in Mad City with Dustin Hoffman, in which he played a soft-spoken musuem employee who loses his job and becomes desperate to get it back.  His character in that one is technically doing something ""bad"" yet you can't help but feel bad for him.  I wonder if his character in this stalker movie will be sympathetic like that.&&Prediction: this will be surprisingly good. 

Edit: BE&&That title piqued my interest with every word&&They're both Scientologists.    
  
As I recall, John Travolta's last movie based on a Scientology collaboration did not turn out well.  &&Pretty sure that's just Fred Durst. &&That sentence was a rollercoaster. &&He looks like one of those new young rap stars.&&This looks more like a real person than the actual John Travolta&&Holy hell. It's Simple Jack from ""Tropic Thunder"".&&Disclaimer: 

Do not do Scientology kids...&&Pumpkin pie hair cutted freak&&Got drunk and watched him film some scenes in Bham in this exact outfit. Made for a nice Sunday afternoon. &&Limp Bizkit fan: ""I really can't wait for Stampede of the Disco Elephants! They've been working on it since 2013. I hope they don't delay it again.""

Fred Durst: &&So John Travolta is cosplaying as Fred Durst?&&I realise Travolta is wearing a wig for this movie but I really wish he'd do a Bruce Willis and just shave his head and be bald full-time. 

Seeing his awful hair pieces really just make him a sad caricature of his former self.&&Doofus Rick.&&This is actually just a paparazzi shot of John Travolta this year. Carry on everyone. Nothing to see. &&Hey if Durst ends up being capable I'm all for it and good for him for trying something different and for others for giving him a shot.&&Most anticipated movie of 2002!&&Looks like a burnt out Stephen Baldwin.&&It’s just one of those days. &&First image of John Travolta as a Crazed Scientologist playing a Crazed stalker in Thriller 'Moose'.

Atleast John has had loads of real life experience to add to this new role.&&Well played wardrobe and make up. Stalker look is pretty convincing. Also shades of niceguy and incel in that look. &&The bowlcut never dies!&&Heard they spent so much money on film stock cause Fred insisted on “Keep rollin’, rollin’, rollin”&&John Travolta  - Directed by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit

Thats not a sentence I thought I'd ever read&&Man, you'd think John Travolta of all people would know that you never go full retard.&&He hasn't looked this good in a long time&&This is happening and we’re going to let it happen.&&the movie will start w a bit of guitar, a small drop, a breakdown, some lingering on the break, a visual equivalent to ""YEEE"" and then a heavy drop where everyone jumps in unison. &&See kids this is what happens when you take too much Scientology&&Is there also a pic of him in character? &&Homosexual John Travolta trapped in Scientology.&&He has plenty of Scientology members he can use for role research as a stalker. &&Was Fred Armisen busy?&&Isnt that similar to a Robert DeNiro movie, but in that its an athlete.&&Is it bad that I am currently wearing that same shirt and own a pair of those shorts.&&Why does the film description feels like the plot from Perfect Blue?&&So King of Comedy as if that wasn't thrilling enough! Hell, that's the plot of The Incredibles.&&Spoiler: Fred Durst is the action hero and we get to see John Travolta ruin his life&&TIL that IMDB also lists Fred Dursts' own 2005 sex tape under his Filmography as the Director.&&Huh. TIL Fred Durst has two other feature length films. &&I love imdb- it says Fred Durst: known for Real Steel. No imdb, no he is not.&&Thought I was in /r/subredditsimulator&&I read the title to my wife, prefacing it with ""hey, do you want to hear a movie description that gets progressively less interesting with each word?"" Honestly, this title probably has a better arc than that script does.&&I swear that Waffle House shooter story sounded like Mad Libz...

I mean, I made NONE of that up... what the holy fuck. I feel TERRIBLE for the four people who died, but this story was dreamt up by a deranged LSD rodeo clown.&&First image of (weird, old, probably gay actor) as a (my Aunt Jill’s night-time hobby) in thriller “(animal with the same name as the best drinking game ever created)”, directed by (best rock/rap artist of the late 90s/early 2000s)&&It's the haircut.&&Okay, Mr. Travolta, there are two possible ways that you could get people to completely forget about Battlefield Earth.

""I'm listening.""

Okay, the first way would be to play a character that is so unique, and so original and *out there* that it shatters everyone's expectations of what you are capable of and highlights your true undeniable talent as an actor.

""Alright, what's the other option?""

I have a script here for a movie called Moose directed by Fred Durst from Limp Biz-

""That one! I want to do that one!""&&I guess Durst is not going for subtlety. &&Looks sorta like Fred Durst&&Doofus Rick&&I know right! Scientology really did a number on his health.&&""Should we cut?"" 

""Just keep rollin' rollin' rollin' ""&&He directed their music videos and The Education of Charlie Banks starring Jessie Eisenberg. Wtf?&&He went on hiatus but he directed a few things about 10 years ago&&Like a chump heeeyyy...&&Travolta said Fred was the best director he ever worked with. &&The education of Charlie banks is a perfectly fine movie.&&My dad was an extra in a movie directed by Fred Durst. The Longshots or something like that. He said he was a nice guy.&&He didn't direct it, but he was fantastic in Population 436. &&So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst&&2019 Academy Award winner for Best Director, Fred Durst.  That is about the only thing that could top this off.&&""Donald Trump? The casino guy with the TV show?! And who's the Vice President, Vince McMahon?!""&&I don’t understand life&&Here lately I feel that John Travolta has been digging deep and bringing great characters to life. He did Robert Shapiro on American Crime Story, Gotti in the biopic (are they ever going to release that movie!?) and now this...I’m very impressed. 
&&>  One Hour Photo

Thanks for reminding me of that - great film.&&One Hour Photo was what immediately came to mind. 

If Travolta can channel even a fraction of that heart-breaking, terrifying genius, we are in for a ride.&&Are you sure you don't mean Phenomenon? In your second example you talk about new found abilities, but in Michael he played a bombastic Angel. He was the epitome of confidence and... joy?

 In Phenomenon he's scared by his own development and doesn't know what's happening to him.

Also One Hour Photo was some of Robin Williams best work. &&It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, but isn’t he powerless all of Michael? I remember the premise being him being a fallen angel. From your description I thought of Travolta in Phenomenon. &&I saw One hour photo twice in theaters, the second time I went by myself in my Walmart Photo lab lab coat and sat in the back&&The Fan was such a solid flick, I hope so. &&I'm not sure why you'd think it wouldn't be. Travolta can act, Durst can direct. If the script isn't shit, it's going to be great.&&I read that in HK-51's voice lol&&Wait is Durst really a Scientologist? Lol didn’t see a quick answer, but I did find this kinda interesting quote given the current political shit-show:

“In 2015, Fred Durst stated his interest in obtaining a Russian passport and spending half of the year in Crimea. He wrote a letter in which he stated that Vladimir Putin is ""a great guy with clear moral principles and a nice person” (edit - source is Wikipedia)

Apparently, the Limp Biscuit wants to become a Russian Triscuit.

&&Wait Fred is a Scientologist too?  GOD FUCKING DAMN IT&&This reminder should be higher — scientology is a dangerous scam rife with abuse and Travolta is their golden child (along with Cruise, of course).&&Fred isn’t a scientologist, i’m not sure where you got that from&&He is not a scientologist. Neither Google nor Wikipedia comes up with anything.&&Fred Durst is not a Scientologist.&&No kidding. Was just thinking why did Fred  make John, look like Fred&&Thats what happens when you do it for the nookie&&i could see tyler the creator wearing that tbh&&[deleted]&&Seriously, it's fucking bad.  Clearwater, Florida is fucking atrocious to go to lately.&& Suckin back on grandpas old cough medicine? &&You'd keep your mouth shut if knew what was good for ya!&&No, it’s a cardigan, but thanks for asking!&&Tic-tac, sir?&&So Stephen Baldwin.&&The Fan&&Are you also John Travolta?&&I mean, it’s not good.&&Yes&&Shirt is fine (or can be). The time to purge your wardrobe of all plaid shorts was 5 years ago though. &&My first reaction upon seeing the pic was ""he looks like someone who sits on reddit all day"".&&I just sent this pic to my friends and told them in getting a biopic

I own like 15 shirts like that, currently wearing those pants, always wear a back pack, have a shitty haircut, and slouch. 

I’m way more handsome tho &&... I’d get rid of the shorts.&&Very much&&You should try to find an action hero to stalk, Moose.&&It's pretty bad.&&Well I wouldn't take it as a *good* sign.&&The shirt is fine. Plaid shorts are absolutely abominable. &&Thats what youre going to do. Make me go watch Perfect Blue tonight? damn you reddit.&&Half of the plot at least. &&I wonder if they will be able to make the stalker _as creepy_ as Perfect Blue did.&&I'd pay good money to see a Fred Durst re-imaging of Perfect Blue. If nothing else, I'd be entertained.&&I’ve never heard of Perfect Blue, but there are so many movies with this plot. I can’t recall any of them being good.&&I fuckin love The King of Comedy and I think it was a travesty that DeNiro didn't at least get nominated for Best Actor. I think it's one of his best performances and the movie is incredibly underrated. Even Sandra Bernhardt was awesome, considering most of her lines were improvised. &&He has a sex tape?&&Wouldn't he be the DP technically?&&well good to know he has quite a range as a director.&&Lmao I love everything about [the way the imdb page reads](http://i.imgur.com/c8Ylzy4.jpg); the fact that it's labeled ""short"", the fact that he's ""uncredited"" as ""director""...I mean it'd be pretty weird if his homemade sex tape had credits at the end. Then again, it'd be weird if a different person was credited as director. I'm so amused with this.&&That's... The same TIL.. &&Think they’re any good? I think we would have heard more if they were terrible. &&Probably the weirdest title I've ever typed out.&&Holy shit you are 100% right. The strangest timeline....&&I’ve always seen that posted in various threads over the years, but I never went. Now that I have, I don’t know why but it seriously gives me the creeps..&&It's basically a rollercoaster that only goes down.&&I think the most progressively worse title would have been: **First Image from 'Moose,' a thriller about a Crazed Stalker, starring John Travolta and Directed by Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit**&&I kinda want it to be ""better than I thought it was going to be""&&Less interesting? More like MORE CRAZY!&&I swear I'm not disrespecting your opinion at all but for me, it feels like the complete opposite. &&Fred Durst shockingly enough is a pretty solid director. I’m looking forward to this. It’s a lot weirder than his other stuff so maybe this will be his breakout film. Seriously, go check out his other stuff. It’s pretty damn good.&&Probably a One-Hour Photo remake, but with selfies.&&> (best rock/rap artist of the late 90s/early 2000s)


Bruh&&It says directed by Fred Durst, not Zack de la Rocha. &&Simple Jack!&&The slouch and and the slack jawed staring help too. &&Got that ZuccCut&&Yeah, he looks like the poop eating, dumber version of a mad scientist. &&He seems like a cool person pretending to be a nerdy person, and going way overboard with it, which is exactly what's happening.

Like, if he wasn't muscular and had bad skin I'd maybe buy it, but he's too toned. The haircut, glasses and offbeat clothing choices are too on the nose, meanwhile Travolta is too obviously not the kind of person he's trying to portray.&&Well the wig, he wears a wig in real life too, and to be honest even that one looks creepy.&&It's just one of those days.&&He's probably doing it all for the nookie.&&""I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might
BREAK YO FUCKIN FACE TONIGHT""

- William Frederick Dust &&Fred Durst made a movie about himself and he’s trying to lure the girl he’s stalking to the premier. &&Take 5 everyone, help yourself to some hot dog flavored water.  &&""This scene needs an intense, background score""

""Check, check, check check... out my melody""&&“Mr Durst, thank you for meeting us today. Could you explain what the movie is about?”


“It’s all about the he said she said bullshit”&&Also that terrible football movie with Ice Cube *Longshots*. Charlie Banks is a good movie though, he's capable. &&Was his sex tape POV? I imagine he’d get a director credit for that too. &&Durst originally started out just wanting to direct LB’s music videos. He’s always been a director at heart, but somehow Wes managed to convince him to join the band instead. It’s actually a really interesting story. In hindsight, Limp Bizkit (the band, not so much Fred himself) were actually really creative, talented musicians. Musically, there was a lot more going on than you’d expect if all you did was pay attention to Fred. I still jam to Chocolate Starfish every now and then.&&Q: You know how much it costs to have F. Durst direct?
A:  He did it all, for the nookie.&&Like a chump heyyy.&&Was this before or after he started marketing this movie?&&Should have got him to do Battlefield Earth. Maybe he could have properly mounted the cameras.&&[deleted]&&After Roger Christian of course, wouldn't want to upset the CoS&&Take that Tarantino. &&Usually this just means they liked how the director worked with them and had a great on set experience. It doesn’t mean they make “the best” movies. &&Take that Tarantino!&&I really liked that movie. When I saw Fred Durst show up on the credits, I thought it was a director with the same name as THE Fred Durst.&&I once met Fred Durst at the avenues mall in Jacksonville Florida. He was a legitimately nice guy, at the height of his popularity around 2001 or so that took the time to make me feel like I was on top of the world. He didn’t have to do that.&&Back in the day he used to post his Xbox gamertag. I added him and played a bunch of cod with him. Was actually pretty cool and felt like I was playing with any of my other friends. He did like to talk about conspiracies though. 911 type shit&&Hear them argue over who she gave head to first&&Real talk. Eminem Show is top 5 best albums in my lifetime. Still firmly hold that opinion. “Cleaning out my closet” is ruthless. &&God I knew his name was in a song but I couldn't remember what song. Thank you so much.&&If Kobe Bryant ever wins an Oscar, I'm going to be a very rich dude. &&Doc, I'm tellin' ya!&&Not sure if implied in the joke but for anyone who doesn't know, Linda McMahon (Vince's wife) is literally in his cabinet and Trump is on the WWE Hall of Fame.

We are now trading WWE Hall of Fame for cabinet positions.&&Not quite... but Vince’s wife ~~Stephanie~~ Linda is part of Trump’s administration as Administrator of the Small Business Association (whatever that is). &&He was great in ACS. Glad hes acting again.&&Don't forget his role as Edna Turnblad in Hairspray.&&His Robert Shapiro was so hamfisted but so damn entertaining&&You should check him out as Terl in Battlefield Earth!
&&One of my favorite Robin Williams roles. Absolutely terrifying. &&>If Travolta can channel even a fraction of that heart-breaking, terrifying genius, we are in for a ride.

Granted, but Robin Williams was a much better actor than John Travolta is.&&Did he edit his comment? &&Let me get this straight, Fred Durst, the man who did it all for the nookie, is a good dir ctor?&&Is that gospel that Fred Durst is a talented director?&&The Education of Charlie Banks is a pretty good movie.  Definitely not one you'd ever think the guy from Limp Bizkit directed if you didn't know it.&&Travolta can be seriously cheeseball in the wrong role. Durst directed two crappy films 10 years ago. He is a director. Jury is out on whether he is good or not.&&Durst’s two previous directorial projects have a 40 and 45 on Rotten Tomatoes. I wouldn’t exactly say he can direct. &&Oh god damnit.&&Story checks out: https://sofrep.com/73760/fred-durst-became-tool-russian-propaganda/&&> He wrote a letter in which he stated that Vladimir Putin is ""a great guy with clear moral principles and a nice person”

Putin has a video of Durst fucking underage prostitutes, confirmed.  This is the only possibility my mind can accept for why these celebrities and public figures suddenly go full sycophant for Putin.  They got honeypotted and now they have to spread the propaganda or face the consequences.

(By the way, ""a great guy with clear moral principles and a nice person"" is interestingly just about the exact opposite of what you would call the guy who hired underage prostitutes to entrap and ultimately blackmail you with.  It hits all the notes of what that man really is and flips them on their head... Here's what it says to me: ""We know he's a piece of shit with no morals or principles and a genuinely terrible person, but we have to try to convince the world otherwise!"")&&Noo what! Scientologist AND a Russian puppet?! My childhood.... RIP. &&IFONLYWECOULDFLYYYYYYYYY&&Limp potato&&Did you somehow have a favorable opinion of Fred Durst that survived his music but can't survive his being a Scientologist?&&I think you mean XENU FUCKING DAMN IT&&It makes sense. He was in a shit place last I saw, Im sure that was before he became a scientist...he  was their perfect prey-vulnerable, familiar with the good life-so he wanted it back badly, willing to do anything to get it


Like it’s said below-didnt know about beck-but that would explain the success he has somehow continued to have even though his music had turned to shite&&[Practically twins.](https://i.imgur.com/2u0nIU4.jpg)&&yeah&&And a week later every Urban Outfitters would be sold out of it&&tyler can pull off anything idk how he does it&&Never go full retard.&&Man cults are scary. From the outside looking in it's hard to see how people fall into this shit.

A cult has sprung up in my town recently, and a friend of a friend is in it now. I don't know all of the details but it involves the 2nd coming of Jesus being alive in Korea or something like that. Also they're believed to be involved in sex trafficking.&&The Fan is super underrated. It's not like...really good, but still somehow super underrated.&&Yes.&&You may be handsome but you’re disguising it with ugly&&In that case you should watch Perfect Blue if you want to see it done right. &&Sandra Bernhardt, Jerry Lewis, and DeNiro deserved Oscars. What an underrated movie this is! &&According to IMDB and like 5 seconds browsing pornhub&&It did not win any Oscars. &&TIL those two TILs are the same thing.
&&[deleted]&&Education of Charlie Banks is in fact a competent and good movie. He seems to have some talent. 

Never heard an actual bad thing about the guy, it's not like he deserves to be pigeonholed just because a bunch of us 30 somethings make fun of his old band. A band that was also successful... &&And ya didn’t fuck it up, proud of you OP&&Sounds like a wild ride. Isn't going down the best part?&&Like John Travolta in the steam room of the Scientology Celebrity Center in Hollywood.&&*keeps rolling&&Only thing to make it worse would be ""Produced by Harvey Weinstein."" Just him personally, not the Weinstein Company. &&**First Image from crazed stalker thriller starring John Travolta.         ""Moose"":  Directed by Limp Bizket singer Fred Durst.**

I'd contend that a generic ""crazed stalker thriller"" sounds better than one with this title.  Also that there must be ex-Limp Bizkit members less risible as directors (if only because I wasn't aware of them--so they could have directed some halfway decent stuff w/o me knowing).     

          

                &&I want Fred Durst to drop the next Citizen Kane and do an Inside the Actors Studio as an older, distinguished Durst with slacks and a dress shirt draped in a rustic earl-brown sweater.

His eyes look worn and his cheeks visibly weathered by our great father time. He didn't drink as much coffee these days, the wife had convinced him to see a gastroenterologist about his acid reflux symptoms. He did it to please her, for he loved her so, but this night he admittedly ignored his pharmacist's advice and had a few drinks, something his wife definitely wouldn't approve of.

You see, Frederick had been feeling anxious that evening about his interview with James Lipton. His box office smash launched him into superstardom overnight and he felt out of his element. ""You really did it, old man,"" he said to himself as he walked out on stage to the queue of Lipton's dulcet toned introduction. 

The standing ovation was loud, he thought. Deafening. ""The lights aren't that bright, why do I feel so hot?"" But before he could finish that thought he dropped suddenly to the floor, in front of everyone there. James rushed over amidst the collective gasps that had pierced the room and dropped to his knees over Frederick but it was clear he wasn't breathing. ""BREATHE FREDRICK! COME ON YOU BASTARD, BREATHE!"" At this point James was pounding his fist on Frederick's chest as he roared, ""Breathe in, now breathe out – hands up, now hands down!
Back up, back up – tell me, don't you go and die now!""

But it was no use, his fire flickered out as quickly as the flame had rose. Lipton, still on his knees by Durst's side, reached down and pulled the fitted, red, New Era Yankees cap down over Frederick's eyes. ""Keep on rollin', partner."" &&He directed *The Education of Charlie Banks*, which started Jesse Eisenberg. It wasn't the best, but it was better than I'd expected from him. &&you had me up until that point &&I’m so triggered &&Last I checked, Chester Bennington left us last year.&&You will be hearing from my lawyer, Munky from KoЯn&&Speaking of which, Rage needs to come back. I like Prophets of Rage and Chuck D is a legend, but it's just not the same. &&You ma-ma-ma-muh-muh-made me happy!&&This made my eyes rain. &&You never go full retard&&We are Church of Scientology. Simple Jack belongs to us, now.&&Ga - ga - ga - ga - ga - Gooooo Grease Lightnin'&&I just had my kids watch Tropic Thunder, and they loved it. It’s hard to believe it’s 10 years old, the only thing that really aged it was all the TiVo references.&&It's most things, really.&&He looks a bit like Stephen Baldwin.&&Every time John Travolta does a movie, he talks about how he believes it's important to come up with a new walk for each character he plays. He claims the walk is always the key to embodying the character. In a way it's sort of interesting, but it has also gotten kind of cliche.

Whatever the case, I guarantee when he does interviews for this movie he will talk about the walk he devised to embody the character.&&It Zuccs as it cuts!&&Doofus Rick&&I’m not going to pretend I didn’t love the shit out of that song. I was 12, what was I so angry about lol &&GIVE ME SUMPIN TA BREAK

JUST GIVE ME SUMPIN TA BREAK
 
GIVE ME SUMPIN TA BREAK

HOW 'BOUT YOUR FUCKING FACE&&What about the chocolate starfishes? &&Opening credits gonna start with

""This is dedicated to you Ben Stiller. You are my favorite motherfucker.""&&Bro I just tasted the 90s and Pokemon cards after I read that.&&Who the hell is this Aaron Lewis producer anyway?&&Yes it was&&https://i.imgur.com/YUbThii.gifv&&Man, Wes was the most talented person in that band, period, and didn't give half a fuck about being a rock star. Fred may not have wanted it initially (this is news to me), but he was the one that slipped the tape to Jonathan Davis, and he was the one that went full Scott Stapp/Chad Kroeger douchebag rockstar, where they consider themselves the *brand* of the band, and consider the people in their band ""backing musicians"". He had shirts made that said ""Limp Bizkit Sucks"" so he could make money from anyone that hated or liked the band. Fred Durst went on to make a bunch of terrible music, directed one of my favorite episodes of House, and then decided to throw his hat in the ring to leave America for Russia, not to make movies, but to be a rock star there. That was like 2016. 

Wes left the band before they even recorded Three Dollar Bill because Fred was such a dickhead, came back, got famous as fuck, and left again. He's technically still in the band, but hates the music business, was never interested in fame, even though he was a **huge** draw and extremely popular. Wes runs a non-profit cat sanctuary and does the Limp Bizkit thing on his terms. I don't even like fucking cats and Wes is the real winner here. Who seems happier?

No bullshit, I will rock 3 Dollar Bill, Y'all$ on Spotify frequently enough for it to show up in my Time Capsule (I'm a big fan of the entire album and can rap-scream-sing my way through the whole thing), but Fred is the biggest issue with the band. Wes is raw fucking talent. DJ Lethal is amazing. John Otto was pretty good. So was Sam Rivers. Fred wants money and fame, period. I just can't respect someone that doesn't respect their craft, and insists that they're amazing. Show, don't tell. &&What?&&SO YOU CAN TAKE THAT COOKIE AND STICK IT UP YO&&Like a chump heyyyy

&&>worked with

It's a mystery, I suppose.&&Sounds like Fred didn’t want to argue with the talent too much, or travolta nailed it, or Durst didn’t have much vision in the first place until it happened on camera. Not saying that’s a bad thing. Spielberg admits this happens to him, but durst ain’t Spielberg. &&honestly, it's not bad directing as long as you also get a shot the way you want it.  
always get too much footage and then edit (with the talent out of the room)&&Last time Travolta got to do everything he wanted we ended up with Battlefield Earth&&He definitely seems like a good dude and gets way too much hate. Even though Limp Bizkit didn't age well they were a game changer at the time. I remember when I first got their first album three dollar bill yall, it blew my damn 12 year old mind. &&Sorry, are people trashing Fred Durst or something? Because that dude ran an AMA awhile ago and he was well spoken and seemed far more intelligent than I’m seeing redditors give him credit for.&&This is the most Duval thing ever. &&Is Fred Durst the most successful person to make it in showbiz out of Jax? &&People love to hate Limp Bizkit, and that’s fine, but anyone aged around 30 who says they didn’t like chocolate starfish when it came out is lying.

They generally believe that christ has been reborn in Korea to the mother and his second coming will occur after she dies.

It's fucking absurd.&&It’s a solid film and it’s got some really intense creepy parts to it. Like DeNiro slicing off Del Toro’s tattoo to give to Snipes so his character can have his number. Also, Tony Scott was a huge Nine Inch Nails fan and there are a lot of deep cuts and lesser played tracks in his films. He has a few songs from Further Down the Spiral in this film, and he also used a lot of NIN in Man on Fire. &&Mystery solved.

I guess that for he, and Travolta, it may be a literal, all body character creation, but I interpretated it as fleshing out the character and thinking about physical tics. He broke down how different types of people not only have a different walk, but even how the walk wild occur, more balls of the feet, toes first, aloof, foot dragging, etc. Like I said, this may be something that helps them design their portrayal, literally from the ground up, and if it helps then achieve it, good then, but I have heard of this before. &&Well it certainly does Zucc! &&Same.

Apparently he's directed a movie with Jesse Eisenberg, which surprised me a bit. I don't really keep track of these things, but going by some other commenters here it was decent and well directed.

Reason enough to give him a shot anyway.&&I never got into Limp Bizkit (even though half my high school fucking loved him) but I always liked Boiler. Really stands out from the rest of their singles.&&Whatever shall I do with this cookie?&&He basically played a middle aged version of the Taxi Driver, and it was still super effective. Or Cape Fear meets baseball.

God damn it, De Niro used to give a fuck.

There's your answer.&&Shumma bummafly, shuguh, beh beh&&I saw them at Ozzfest at the Great Woods ampitheater. As soon as they revealed the giant toilet my friend and i went to get beer and rocked out to Motorhead instead. &&The fuck were they doing at Ozzfest??&&It didn't do a great job promoting anything though because that's when the main character realizes that even in his dream school of intellectuals everyone is still shallow and doesn't care about anything. It carries a negative feeling for the film.

Am i remembering the movie right?&&We can thank the Red Hot Chili Peppers for their success. It's the only thing I hold against them. &&Tropic Thunder was Tom Cruise’s best work, by far.&&Seriously though... a nutless monkey could do your job&&You spank that ass, Les!&&Dis is flaming dwagon!!!!

Someone says he's a masterful director and everyone believes him without looking up the evidence? There is none. 

I'll believe it when I see it. Which I probably won't see it, because I didn't see any of those other movies, and Travolta is NOT a good actor, nor has he chosen any good movies lately. He's a relic of the past whose last good movie was maybe From Paris with Love. &&Stick it up your yeah?&&King of Comedy too&&I just watched heat and that movie showcases how good he is when he gives a fuck and isn’t just showing up for a pay check.

No idea he was such a talented writer.&&Apparently Tom was the one really pushing to make his character into such a grotesque parody. Stuff like the hair, the ferociously meaty hands and forearms, and the dancing were all his ideas. And every time he would come top to Ben Stiller with a new idea to make the character even more disgusting, Ben was just like ""This most recent idea is now the new greatest thing ever"". &&He needed it too.

The Onion: Fans Excited As ‘Solo’ Trailer Sheds Light On Specifically How It Will Suck,55138,8b1j9u,https://entertainment.theonion.com/fans-excited-as-solo-trailer-sheds-light-on-specifica-1825112914,6532,1523304460.0,,"I Want a movie about the cantina band. How did they start? Was there more members? Any get hooked on drugs? &&Having low expectations is the first step to being pleasantly surprised.
&&Problem is, I feel like Han Solo is the OT character *least* in need of a background movie. His entire arc revolves around being this mysterious and almost neutral space cowboy who all of a sudden gets thrown into a galactic civil war. I'd much rather have a Lando movie where Lando meets Han and Chewie, not vise versa.&&It seems like they are trying as hard as they can to avoid showing Solo/playing clips of him speaking in the trailers.  That doesn't strike me as a good sign.&&The apathy people feel towards this film is incredible.

It's almost been 24 hours and the trailer has less than five million views on Youtube.  For comparison, [Rogue One had around 15 million by that time.](http://deadline.com/2016/04/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-trailer-online-web-traffic-1201734264/)

First to identify 5 tropes on screen will win. 

1 spaceship chase in asteroid belt. 

2 ""never tell me the odds"" 

3 ""I got a  ad feeling about this"" 

4 someone tells young solo.  ""don't get cocky kid"" 

5 C3PO ""oh my"" 

6 the origin story of his jacket, or blaster, or pants or shirt. 

7 ""I know"" 

8 some bullshit about the kessel run. 

9 the debt to jabba

10 nerf herders&&I’m still waiting for ‘Jar-Jar, A Sith Story’. &&I actually thought this trailer made the film look decent, at the very least. The last trailer did nothing for me.&&I'll watch it only bcuz of Gambino&&It's because this isn't the stand alone we *really* want...give us an Obi-Wan with Ewan McGregor in it and take our fistfuls of cash. &&I hope we get to see how he developed his ultra-neck reflexes and his super rubbery neck. I heard he also has a neck accident and it's a bionic neck. *""When the time is right, I know my neck will save my neck""*&&The problem:

1) Han Solo can't die

2) Lando can't die

3) Chewie can't die

4) Nobody else matters even remotely.&&Like RDJ and Iron Man, I feel like Harrison Ford *is* Han Solo, so to speak. With that said, the new actor just doesn't seem like he's capable of replicating Ford's characteristics and personality. I'm much more interested in Donald Glover's portrayal of Lando. &&Everything time I hear the guy talk as Han Solo, my ears wince&&No one hates Star Wars like Star Wars fans. &&The short score segment at the end of the new trailer sounds like someone slapped it together using Windows Media Player.  &&I thought this latest trailer was a big improvement, but i have to say, i fucking HATE the take on the Star Wars music these trailers have had. The music is usually the thing that resonates with me the most - special shoutout to that first main Force Awakens trailer - music that wasnt even in the movie. But the music in this Solo trailer- the take on the star wars theme in particular, i absolutely cant stand it. It's just so honky and horrible. &&If I'm being completely honest, the guy playing Han delivered his lines so stiffly. I know he has huge shoes to fill, but the trailer painted him in such a light that made him seem like a high school theatre kid who landed a role in a multimillion dollar blockbuster. &&Looks generic and uninspired is the honest truth, in a way that none of the other current series films did.... say what you will about them, but the trailers and movies for the last three at least felt like Star Wars. This didn't; it felt more like a branding scheme. 

On a more story note, everyone realizes that Solo is basically a complete asshole at the beginning of his arc in the original trilogy right? So either this is a movie about Solo being a complete asshole, or they are just going to bastardize it to make him more likable, which kind of ruins it as a prequel. &&It is my greatest hope that people will hate this movie, it won't make money, and some executives realize that can't just shit out Star Wars movies for infinite money because the fans are too stupid to realize they are being had.&&Han Solo's actor looks incredibly dull and out of place. Something the contemporary Star Wars franchise has a bad habit of doing.&&We should make a ""ham-fisted prequel bullshit"" Bingo card. One square for every little thing that Han Solo ever mentioned from his past (He's gotta win the Falcon in a gambling game, gotta dump his cargo when the Empire's on his tail... Free space can be doing the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs. People love that line, so of course we all want to see it on film right?) Some for direct quotes from the OT (describing the force as ""Simple tricks and nonsense."" ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" is another strong contender for free space."") A square for the random applause shot of young Greedo shoehorned in like the Ponda Baba / Dr. Evazan one in RO (bonus points for a line akin to ""Someday that guy will shoot me... Unless I shoot him first."") A square for Jabba the Hutt having diminishing returns. Hell, why not one for a loving shot of him picking out his vest, or getting a cut on his chin. Everything iconic must have an origin story!&&I think the movies are coming out too often for casual fans to remain focused and the more hardcore fans are turned off by the seeming dismissal of decades of lore. &&I know it's just the Onion, but I'm actually pretty excited for this after seeing the last trailer. Not 100% sold it won't suck, but it's looking better than I thought.&&Honestly the Sabotage Version makes me want to see the movie.  The normal version and I'm not bothered.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TPY4TKo6uQ

Amazing what a difference there is between them&&First Star Wars film I won't be in a rush to go see, and won't be seeing it at full price. To me Harrison Ford is the only Han Solo. This new guy just doesn't do it for me. &&Unless Solo goes into depth on his prior military career, the Life-Debt Chewbacca owes him and why he turned to a life of being a scoundrel/smuggler, I really don't care about it. He's not a hero here, he's just the guy in the right place at the right time. He becomes a hero in IV.&&This movie doesnt feel like Star Wars, it feels like a bunch of actors cosplaying Star Wars.  It feels like an attraction at Disney Land, not the actual thing the ride should be replicating.  

I don't fault the people who made the trailer for this.  There's just something fundamentally wrong with a franchise that simultaneously wants to ""let its past die"" (Last Jedi) while continuing to reference and mine its past for material (Rogue One, Solo, etc).  

&&“Do you like Han Solo?”

“YEAH!!!”

“Well, here’s a different actor as Han Solo in a low-stakes adventure where you basically know how it ends!”

“... Does Daenerys at least have a nude scene?”&&It's shocking how much steam the Star Wars franchise has lost over the last months. You can tell fans have lost faith in how Disney will handle the franchise. I also don't get why this movie is coming out mere months after The Last Jedi debacle.&&I am genuinely excited to see this movie AMA &&[deleted]&&To me the trailer kind of looked fan made. It doesn't seem to have near the production quality that other Star Wars trailers have which makes me think that it might be a low quality movie.&&I've been of the opinion that this trend of expanded universes and tv series like treatment of these franchises is ultimately bad for fans long term. 

It's a relatively new phenomenon for movie franchises but like a tv show that goes too long, eventually any good series jumps the shark.  I think Star Wars has jumped the shark several times and each time it looses a huge chunk of fans that go from die-hard to meh pretty quickly. I can't remember exactly when the series lost its appeal to me, it was somewhere during the prequels, I think after Attack of the Clones I just sorta lost hope that it would redeem itself.  I've watched every Star Wars movie since Clones mind you, but it's never been with the same love I once had, they're just a sterile generic movies for me now and that's how they'll be for all of us sooner or later.

How many people are going to look back 15 years from now and tell stories about what it felt like to experience Solo or the Last Jedi?  I watch Star Wars movies like I watch Pirates of the Caribbean movies, for mindless entertainment, not to be inspired.

&&Then “Star Wars: From a Certain Point of View” is for you. There is an entire short story from the perspective of a member of that cantina band. &&Theres a wonderful book called ""Tales of Mos Eisley ""  with a bunch of awesome short stories from the random citizens there.

I’d really love to see a movie dedicated to the old Jedi academy/order.

It just doesn't look good.

I was excited for Rogue one because it expanded on a plot point that was directly tied into the main trilogy, something familiar to get excited over and it had new characters we'd never seen before

A Han Solo origin story could literally be anything, not to mention we already know what happens to the main characters. Not so exciting.&&I just don't care. I never saw the need for a Han Solo movie and I still don't see one. At least with the prequels, there was the big question of why Anakin turned to the Dark Side. With Han Solo, I don't care about how he met Chewie and I certainly don't care about how he met Lando. &&Personally it’s because with each new Star Wars release it’s becoming more and more clear they are less concerned about creating a good story in the Star Wars universe and more concerned about churning out as many Star Wars films as possible to make even more money.

I was worried Jabba, Greedo, and Boba Fett would all show up and the film would center around Tatooine. It seems to be doing it's own thing as a heist movie, which is good. With a bit of Solo's origins thrown in. 

Edit: Totally wrong about the Kessel Run, apparently it's in lmao.

&&I'm most excited for The Onion's Peter K.

Rogue one did a great job of making a war film out of unknown characters. Why not make a western with unknown characters.

Definitely worth checking out the Rogue Squadron book series if you really want to get into the weeds with the back stories behind some of the Rebel starfighter pilots like Wedge Antilles. They provide a lot of great universe-building that doesn't rely solely on the main characters from the movies. Well worth reading the Thrawn Trilogy as well.

Edit: a word&&I especially loved the Kabe and Muftak one! Also, the Butcher of Montellian Serat. &&I'd watch it&&Getting To The Gig: The Max Rebo Story&&The drummers would keep being accidently killed be blaster fire.&&In my very first play through when I was 11 or 12, I didn't understand that I could actually read datapads until much later in the game, so to get past this puzzle (after being blown up several times) I turned on solo mode, positioned Carth and Mission well outside the room, then had the PC trigger the bomb so only he would get KO'd (versus the whole party being KO'd at it being a game over).&&To be sure &&Same here, and it was still super corny.&&Nah, it's because Lando clearly got a story arc that happened prior to his appearance in the movies. We knew he was another criminal type like Han, he lost his ship to Han, and became governor of a mining colony. That's some major life changes - there's room for a story there. 

With Han, all we really get is a scoundrel acting scoundrely. :D Although, what I'd love to see happen is for the Han of this movie to die, and then see the Harrison Ford character steal Han's identity. &&Not OP, but I admit it and stand by it&&I mean im thats the reason I wanna see it. In fact id prefer to see a full length Childish Landino movie instead.&&Well, to be fair, the original trilogy was basically HIS origin movie.&&We get to see him shoot small animals for fun! And then he’ll farm...&&Duke Dirtfarmer: The Younger Years.&&I've been hoping that Glover will have the third most screentime behind Han and Chewie. I'm so much more interested in Lando and Donald Glover is my favorite creative on earth.&&Can someone please explain to me the Donald Glover hype? I really don't understand it at all. The man isn't some genius actor and from what I see in the Solo trailer he doesn't really adopt Landos mannerism or tone of voice well either.&&I'm 99.9% sure the kessel run line was a joking line about a generic space racing/hauling event and Lucas would cringe if he knew people were literally taking it so seriously to make it a focus of a movie&&part time&&Aside from the fact that Harrison Ford was an absolute snack in his heyday, his voice alone is iconic and memorable. You’d be hard pressed to find someone with as much charisma as Ford, and from the trailers I don’t think the actor fits either bill. I’ll see the movie before I write him off completely though.&&Because it sounds like he's focusing all his energy on making his voice sound deeper than it is lol. 


&&I don't think it was BAD, but Harrison Ford set the bar very high and he got a charisma impossible to mimic. That's why I didn't like the ideia of a Solo solo movie.

Ford is Solo. &&He is missing that smug, playful, debonair charm that Ford had. And without that, the character is missing his core.

It's the kind of charm that Robert Downey jr or Chris Hemsworth has, but from those clips this guy is stiff and self conscious&&> If anything, that’s to avoid people saying “He doesn’t look or sound like Han Solo.”

Which is a legitimate criticism.  Han Solo looking and acting like Han Solo in a Han Solo film is not an unreasonable demand.

I don't expect the new guy to be completely indistinguishable from Harrison Ford, but they should cast someone who can do a reasonably good imitation.&&>A Han Solo origin story could literally be anything

Even without the reshoots and associated problems that have been often reported on, I fundamentally don't really care to know more about the character's background.&&It's funny, because I actually think a Lando movie may have even worked better. They already had perfect casting for it, so half the issue surrounding the star and a bit of the unease about portraying Han, wouldn't exist really with a Lando movie. &&> not to mention we already know what happens to the main characters. Not so exciting.

We knew what happened to the Death Star too&&Yeah, I think it's just a bad idea for a movie. Especially without Ford's involvement. If they had done a ""where's Ford been for the past five years, he's clearly split from his wife, he's gone back to the smuggler thing now that he's not involved in the Resistance, blah blah blah"" I think it might have been a fun film. But they knew Ford wouldn't do that shit. They went to milk it too soon. In twenty years or so I could see them doing something like this and being excited, but it's like ""We just saw the one and only Solo in a film like two years ago..."" 

I'll probably watch it once its on DVD, but I'm not going to rush to the cinemas. &&> the trailer looked like a really generic action movie with a Star Wars filter applied to it

You mean like the new Star Trek movies and Rogue One?&&> I was excited for Rogue one because it expanded on a plot point that was directly tied into the main trilogy, something familiar to get excited over and it had new characters we'd never seen before

> A Han Solo origin story could literally be anything, not to mention we already know what happens to the main characters. Not so exciting.

This is such a strange comment. We knew *exactly* where RO had to end up, and you're still arguing it was entertaining. Mening that you can know the destination and have a fun time getting there.

Second, ""we already know what happens to the main characters"" could easily be renamed ""Episodes I-III"". You know just as much about where they came from and what they encountered in Solo as you did for the prequels.

Look, I am not going to tell you that this movie is going to be good. But people have a gross misunderstanding of what makes a film good. Telling a strong story with emotion and that gets an audience invested is really the only thing that matters. IMO, this can be done even when we know where the pieces will come to rest on the board at the end of a movie. &&Member when everyone was happy that at least Han Solo wasn’t tainted by the prequels. Someone wanted to change that.&&Honestly whether or not the movies are good this is bound to happen and I'm sure Disney knows this. You had a beloved franchise that had 6 movies over the course of almost 30 years then all the sudden this'll be the 4th in just four years since the first new one and we're being told they'll be a yearly occurrence. No matter what your stance is on whether or not the movies are good, that'll dramatically change the landscape of the franchise and fanbase.&&Yeah, when a Star Wars trilogy only came out once (or less) in a generation, they were special and big events. With a SW movie every year it's like, ""Oh. OK.""&&When it became obvious the ""new trilogy"" was being written without a plan and they were winging it from movie to movie they broke my interest.&&Yes! Lando has the mysterious background and a charming personality that we want to know more about. Han, on the other hand, is just cool. I don't care why he's cool -- just that he's cool.&&The cries of it being about political correctness would have deafened the galaxy. &&It's not just Star Wars being a cash cow. Marvel movies are a cash cow but you can still feel the heart and direction put into them.

Star Wars just feels... empty and meandering. Hell, even Rogue One had a vision the rest of Disney SW just doesn't.&&**proceeds to watch Jessica Jones on Netflix**&&L A Y E R S&&You can do that? &&It's gonna be a short film.

That's what I thought about Episode I.&&>Also 3PO won’t be in this

You sure about that? The droids have been in every movie so far. Disney would have no problem shoehorning them in even if it’s for a few seconds &&ah yes, classical music.&&glad that this is the first Solo trailer i saw :) thanks for the link&&No they fucking wouldn’t, they’d be flipping out over how the music choice doesn’t fit the universe and how it was further proof of Star Wars being sold out. &&That just solidified how much this movie looks like Star Trek 2009.&&My god, that trailer was so much better than the original. Lol. Like, a way bigger gap in enjoyment than I expected&&Yooo that was so good! &&>fan edit

Sure thing J.J. Abrams. Suuuure thing. &&Not really.

Lots of people dont like the beastie boys, and more importantly that song was heavily used in the reboot of Star Trek twice. Including a key plot point in film 3.&&I think Woody harrelson and Emilia Clarke will die.


It's inherently difficult to write prequels because of this. The best way to create drama is to raise the stakes, but that's challenging when we already know who dies and who lives&&I’ve never understood this line of thinking. Since when is a character dying or not the only place to find drama?

I mean, did you ever actually expect Luke or Leia to die in the original trilogy? Did anyone think Harry, Ron, or Hermione would die in any of the HP books or movies? Did anyone go to see Iron Man 2 wondering if Tony Stark would make it out alive?

It’s pretty rare for a protagonist to die. Even rarer in a Star Wars type film. Whether they live or die is a small part of the story. &&Just waiting for the Lando spinoff to be honest.&&His name is Troy and he's the best constable an Inspector could ever hope for. &&Glover is great but Billy Dee Williams is... well, Billy Dee Williams. He had a certain spark that it feels like Donald Glover doesn't quite have. His appeal is different than Billy Dee's.&&I think it's a decent performance but a bad Lando.  Billy Dee puts a lot of vim into his words, a lot of power and energy.  He almost overacts - uses his eyes dramatically, moves a lot, grinds his teeth.  Glover seems too chill and too in control.  OT Lando is always about to spiral into an anxious mess.  &&the ""I hate you"" nightmare in the second one gave me chills.&&It's referring to the way the Han/Greedo scene from ANH was edited for the maligned later editions. Greedo suddenly shoots first, and to avoid it, they try to make it look like Han dodged the shot before shooting his own. What it ends up looking like instead, is Han's neck stretching in a weird way.&&That would require decent writing and more risk than the Disney suits are willing to take.&&We won't get a death. We'll get an emotional betrayal as she sides with the Empire, cementing Han's objectification and distrust of women and government entities.&&> The problem with the prequels

One of many, yes.&&But then also those weren't good. &&I don't get why he hasn't retired on an island or something already&&No one hates himself, his films, fans, or legacy quite like Harrison Ford.&&[sometimes he's a bit more honest](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hxMIECU0sK8)&&This is the essence of the dark side.&&Only a Star Wars fan deals in absolutes.&&""No one hates children as much as mothers.""&&Huh. I really like that analogy. Star Wars fans treat Star Wars as their baby, and when it does something really stupid, they get mad. &&Probably meant ""Windows Movie Maker"" which is a free, bare bones ""editor"".&&Well Rogue One had a few bits where the known scores would play, but even then I felt the music in Rogue One was pretty relevant, and for the most part felt like Star Wars, if weaker than John Williams' score. The Imperial Theme and the music during the battle of Scarif stand out to me.&&That's what I'm thinking. Maybe he's not the cynical, lovable douchebag Han we know yet.&&""A crew? Not possible, I only work alone. You could say I want to ride.."" *look at camera, wink* ""...Solo""&&How do you know Chewie doesn't die right there? HOW?

EDIT: attempt at humor&&Do ya think he will live ^^^lmao&&Pretty sure the movie *is* about the Kessel Run.  And who's to say that Jabba, Greedo and/or Boba Fett won't show up...?&&The kessel run is a plot point of the movie. Plus meeting Chewie. Plus getting the ship from Lando. The trailer is edited around hiding the reference/nostalgia overload because fans are preemptively complaining. But the movie is done and the toys are waiting to be put on store shelves so all they can do is tweak the marketing.

It was actually really interesting to me. &&It's an amazing book! the story of the Droid Luke picked, that blew up was touching. The band's story is really well done as well.

We all would. &&Hello there.&&That actually sounds cool...until you wonder what to do with chewie in that situation?  I suppose you could drop a moon on him or something&&Yeah that's a good point. Lando could have had character development. Young Han in the trailer just acts like old Han really, all cocky and shit.&&Only if he transforms into Childish Gambino playing Lando with lots of sultry soul/funk musical numbers. &&not as in depth as Anakin's origin&&> small animals

Where the fuck do you live where ""not much bigger than 2 meters"" is *small*?&&Oh my I would love to see that as I’m a huge Donald Glover fan but you’re forgetting about Emilia Clarke and Woods Harrelson. I can see Clarke and Harrelson receiving more screen time in the movie and Glover being a ticket sales magnet from the trailer. &&I'd say it was less a joke and more a lie.  Baby-face Luke bought it, sure, but Obi wasn't having any of that.  Seriously look at Ben's reaction as soon as Han said it.  He knew it was total bullshit.&&**part** *time*.
&&Mr. Plinkett, you survived.&&Now there's an obscure reference.&&What's funny is that Harrison Ford is so bad in interviews. Watching some of his old late show interviews, it's jarring how nervous he seems. &&>  You’d be hard pressed to find someone with as much charisma as Ford

It's a fucking Disney funded Star Wars movie, these people exist, that's what casting is supposed to do, and they should've done it. The voice is far more critical than the look. Donald Glover seems like he's killing it as Lando.&&I noticed this also!&&Ahhh Dane DeHaan syndrome. 

&&I think there are active actors that could've pulled it off, just not the one they cast.

And no, not Anthony Ingruber, as neat of an impersonation he does.&&We just need Ford to play his younger self, he'll look young through shear willpower.&&Empire/Return Han was kinda stiff/self conscious I guess??? But that's because he's getting his shit kicked in for the whole movie.&&Like the one guy that literally got famous for his Han Solo/Harrison Ford impersonation because he looks and sounds like him. It landed him a small gig in a movie where he played a younger version of Harrison Ford's character. And to all the people that say he doesn't have enough experience, I'd like to point out that Harrison Ford was a carpenter when he got the role of Han Solo. 

[Here's what he got famous for.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bba_wPdLxp4&t=16s)

We also knew what happened to Anakin and Obi One too!&&Yeah I feel like the reasons being listed are people trying too hard to not like it before they see it.

Personally, I love the idea of telling Solo's backstory. He was always my favorite character. I haven't read the books. I don't know what is or isn't canon. I'm just a guy that grew up loving the movies and playing with the toys. And I want to see more Han and Chewie. 

I have concerns over being able to buy into a different actor as Han. I have concerns that it will be a bad movie. But I'm not going to dig deeper for reasons to hate this movie before it even comes out.&&Wait for ""Leia: The Alderaan years"" ! 
&&Someone who saw the $$$. That’s what Star Wars has been about almost since the first one came out; hype the fuck out of it and prey off of people’s nostalgia. That is Star Wars.&&> we're being told they'll be a yearly occurrence

ODG...Lucas sold to the beast. It's really a shame. I think this is doing a disservice to it, but at the end of the day we're only talking about movies. For Disney, as long as they see $$$ it's a win.&&I never imagined that Disney would fuck up Star Wars so quickly. Between ditching the EU, assigning director titles to the lowest bidder, and changing it from a saga to just another generic series...they blew it so badly.

Actually, a generic series wouldn't have blown Leia into space and had her come back to life.&&That’s really the problem. I don’t know what Kathleen Kennedy is doing. The MCU has this arc that has been leading to IW almost from inception. They have given directors some freedom to make their own style of movie, but at the end of it the story should push us closer the IW. Something related to an Infinity Stone or the relationship of the Avengers has been pushing the movies. 

To me the Resistance/First Order thing makes me irritated because what was the point of the Rebellion?

There are systems that want representative government and systems that want a leader with consolidated power. That was what the prequels were about and the OT undid that, now they are back at it. Yawn. 
It would have been a better story to have Leia the chancellor leading a new era of peace when the FO shows up and the New Republic must defend itself. Instead we have a ragtag group of fighters with little funding or support destroying the bad guys against all odds. 
We complain because Snoke and Rey have no real back story. Well as an audience we want to know what motivates them. Why do we care if they live or die. What do we hope the outcome will be? If the FO is destroyed for good will the Second Order show up in 40 years?&&Yea that blew my mind when I found out they didn’t even have it planned out. Such a huge franchise and you would think they would have a basic outline&&Han is cool because (1) Harrison is cool and (2) he's not impressed with Luke.&&As long as I stay out of these threads, I think I’ll have a good chance. &&I mean that's a lot of space to traverse...&&I hope they show Han giving the same line with a completely different ship, showing that it's just a lie to lure in customers.&&It's the ship that made the run, Han may not have been the pilot &&They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate. &&Exactly what I was thinking - I’m scared to watch the official one now &&For real.

&&Tatooine, apparently.&&I feel like Harrleson may not. His role seems to specifically be the one who brings the group together to do the job, and then I see him as more of a background character until the end when the job is done and he betrays/pays them.

Thank you!&&In the previous draft it was all lies, and Han didn't even own the Falcon. He was a cabin mate, and there were something like 5 crewmembers including a guy named Jabba and led by a guy named Oxus.

Han makes the deal with Ben and then steals the Falcon from them.

Also, Han's costume originally had a big collar, but Harrison Ford refused to wear it because he said it made him look like Peter Pan. I am pretty sure an extra in Mos Eisley can be seen wearing this shirt as they first come into town. It looks like Han's undershirt but with a big collar.&&Sir Alec is only following the script. [No seriously](http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.html):

> Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.

Only later did we get the hideous attempts to salvage that line with even more misinformed horseshit about black hole clusters and feats of navigation. 

Oh I need to avoid a stellar obstacle on the *parsec* scale? Let me fly 1 light day out of the way that should do just fine. For IRL reference that is a little less then *twice* the distance it would take to go from the Sun to Sedna at present so yes would do just fine for avoiding anything. And would make a 1/14278.8 percent difference. That's 1 light day on the scale of 12 parsecs for those that don't wanna look it up.

I'll take Han being full of shit any day over that nonsense. &&Would that it were so simple. &&Why did they use that take? You know.. the bad one..&&I'm immortal.
&&Anyone want to help me milk my cat? It's time for breakfast.&&surprised?&&I KNOW WHAT THAT IS&&Yeah, Harrison suffers from pretty bad anxiety. This is a dude who, while acting in the '60s and '70s, kept up his job as a carpenter. He enjoys the actual work of being an actor. Reading scripts, working on them and contributing where he can, getting in the zone, and actually *acting*.

When he's not on set or doing interviews he's anxious about, he's flying around enjoying some God damned alone-time. Or cooking with his wife, [Calista](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001222/). His son Ben (Ford, not Solo - yes I'm serious) is actually a [rather successful chef in LA](http://www.chefbenford.com/).&&He hates interviews and does them for the money. I don't blame him. Most interviews ask the same questions as all the other interviews.&&Funny you say that cause Glover doesn't have Lando's voice either. Dee Williams was far more boisterous than Glover.

He has the look but he just doesn't sound like him&&I feel like he's really been painted into a corner with his boyish face and physique, which is a shame because I actually like his acting. He really needs to expand his appeal&&That was my immediate thought when I saw the trailer. He reminds me of Valerian and that's a **terrible** thing for a Han Solo movie.&&Oh man I remember the Ingruber hype &&I remember seeing him in Age of adaline where he actually played a young Ford and thought he was actually a good actor(from the short amount of screen time he got).&&First line in the film someone pulls him up on his obvious age, and Ford just stares them down.&&And also being Frozen and unfrozen, that can't help&&Because he was goddamn blind. &&I hadn't seen this until now but that man should absolutely be Han Solo.&&Do you like Angelina Jolie? Does she give you a big boner? Well here's Jon Voight's ball sack!&&You like Han Solo?

Yes!

Want to see what he was like as a little kid?

No!!!!&&To quote Harrison Ford: “I don’t know and I don’t care”&&>""I dont CARE where the things I like come from!!""

I think people would be much more interested in a Boba Fett movie. I wouldn't be interested in an origin story though, a movie about his exploits before ep. 5 would do great.

I think an origin story movie would ruin the character for a lot of people because a large part of his appeal is the mystery behind him. 

Now that I really think about it, a Boba Fett movie done in the style of Dredd where he never takes his helmet off and doesn't have many lines would be absolutely perfect.

&&Something something Jon Voight's ballsack.&&This is Disney. he's not going to be a scoundrel. His background is going to be noble and heroic. Sometime during the movie he'll have like, three drinks and he'll claim he works alone and doesn't need friends - but by the end of the movie, he'll learn that working together can solve everyone goals. &&I also feel that Han Solo is literally Harrison Ford, you can't just make a young Han Solo film because you can't have a young Harrison Ford ever again. Alden could be a great actor, but he doesn't remotely look or feel like Han Solo, it ruins it.&&Same issue with the upcoming Joker origin movie. The character is better when you don't know his background. &&I just hope that he is a complete scumbag in the Han Solo movies, and not the ""bad guy with a heart of gold"" kind of thing. He gets his redemption in the later movies, I want to see him at his scummiest and lowest point. Everyone treats him like a smuggler and terrible person in the movies until he redeems himself, so I want to see that scumbucket solo.

On that point, I like Rogue One because the rebels were treated like rebels, non a bunch of do-gooders with good intentions. Rebellion is dirty work, and portraying them like a misfit band of anti-heroes who were doing some mortally grey stuff was good. Their heart was in the right place, but the way they were going about things was a good representation of an organization consisting of smugglers, gangsters, thieves, and anarchists.&&Also that they are probably going to try to make him out to be some kind of hero in this, which sort of destroys his entire character arc of the first movie. &&Exactly. I feel like their going to make Han Solo ""good"" in this movie when he definitely wasn't that at the beginning of a new hope. He wasn't a bad person either... I just feel like their going to have him be to ""good"" when that doesn't happen to him until the OT.&&Yup, it's why I think people would actually be down for a Bobba Fett movie too. The underutilised characters from the movie universe probably have a better chance at success then the beloved ones. &&SpaceBalls 2: The search for more money!&&Yeah, Disney will continue to do what makes them money. It may mean driving the franchise into the ground, but so far it's been working with Marvel. My only concern is that Marvel has a much deeper and richer source material to mine than Star Wars.

One thing to note is that we as fans all have to remember that what we loved before still exists. The same old series is still there and thankfully Disney doesn't seem keen on doing a reboot or even what Lucas did to them with new digital insertions. I'd much rather they keep doing spin offs and sequels than that, so at least we have a win there.&&You’re upset about ditching the EU, and not following the skywalkers? That seems contradictory to me. &&Don't forget shutting down Lucasarts and signing an exclusive contract with EA.&&>They have given directors some freedom to make their own style of movie, but at the end of it the story should push us closer the IW.

Agreed. All I wanted was a cohesive trilogy of trilogies that could be collectively titled **The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire.** Thrawn is and always will be the logical conclusion of the sequence. Dark force users could have been explored *ad ifinitum* in other awesome stories, but Thrawn could have been adapted to be hiding in the outer rim and consolidating the remaining Imperial factions for thirty years. Here is a logical farewell to the Galactic Empire; the swan song embodied in a man that *lives and breathes* the ideals of the Empire, but is ultimately and irreducibly alien. *He walks amongst us but is not one of us.* 

I love the idea that Leia would at this point be the chancellor. Her soul could have been burdened with the leadership of the fledgling New Republic, the PTSD of the events of the OT, the saga of motherhood. Imagine her waking up with a start from a flashback/nightmare of her torture aboard the Death Star. 

I never wanted to see Luke the Ultimate Warrior. I wanted to see Luke the *Teacher.* I wanted to see echoes of Yoda's tutelage in Luke's training. I wanted to see him struggle with gaps in his knowledge, seeking to fill those gaps, and being wary of his own struggle between light and dark. I wanted to see him walk the halls of the Masasi temple with the grown children of Han and Leia Solo, to impart subtle vicissitudes of the Force unto them in their adulthood as they struggle with light and dark themselves and begin to bear the burden of keeping peace and stability in the New Republic. I wanted to see the younglings adore Luke, and for his sense of humor and optimism to emanate in his lectures and exercises with them. 

I truly believe that the Thrawn trilogy could have been adapted to the age of the main characters. SPOILER ALERT: Imagine the daughter of Han and Leia Solo, struggling with light and dark herself, have a light saber duel with a clone of her uncle 30 years younger! Imagine her shock and confusion, especially after receiving conflicting Jedi teachings from Joru'us C'baoth - the only other Jedi master in the Galaxy at that time. 

Sorry, I am rambling with wishful thinking. I mostly regret missing out on a cinema version of the spine-chilling scene where Thrawn calls out to the group of villagers:

**I seek the Guardian of the Mountain!**

Side note: Thrawn could have found *Camino* cloning cylinders at Tantis.

Fucking hell, DC.&&The Killing Joke was an excellent graphic novel on one version of the Joker's origin&&> I just hope that he is a complete scumbag in the Han Solo movies, and not the ""bad guy with a heart of gold"" kind of thing

I would sincerely be shocked if they took this angle.  It would probably still be 'risky' to do it even if Star Wars wasn't owned by Disney, but I'm sure they're going to try to make a legacy character palatable for younger viewers (so they can then buy the toys, etc).&&He's not even supposed to be a good smuggler. His greatest skill is a con man. That's why everyone fucking hates him, his character is supposed to lie to everyone and half ass the job, then run away with the money before his employers wise up. 

The only gangster who finds him endearing is Lando, who is also rich enough to write off a small time conman like Solo as not worth the resources to get revenge. 

This movie is gonna change the whole character. Even if it's a great movie, it's gonna cheapen the character.&&> Rebellion is dirty work

That should have been on their crew jackets. &&Rogue one took me by surprise, is by far my favorite star wars movie. Ofc original trilogy holds special place. But rogue one is something else but fits best into star wars&&It was the same thing with the special edition where Lucas made Greedo shoot so Han could defend himself. Han's not supposed to be the noble guy who just defends himself against this evil alien. He's a bastard who's willing to kill a random guy just to get out of that (admittedly bad) situation. If he's been the good guy all the time then he can't evolve and  struggle to *become* a good guy.

Hence this whole ""Han shot first"" thingy which I really don't like because it validates Lucas' shitty decision. Han didn't shoot first because Greedo never shot. Without a second shooter there's no first shooter. There's just a shooter. Now I understand that ""Han shot"" doesn't really have that ring to it but ""Greedo never shot"" does.

#\#GreedoNeverShot&&[deleted]&&Exactly, he was concerned with good and evil or any of that moral bullshit; he was in it for the money and/or clout.

All that probably would have added up, as far as the running time.&&In the *rough* draft of The Star Wars, yes. But that's a much earlier draft than I'm referencing. And the character had no resemblance or relation to Han Solo other than the name. Lucas swapped names around a LOT, so in my opinion the whole ""Han Solo was originally a green skinned alien with gills"" has always been overblown.&&Very cool&&:)&&Her casting got me thinking about my attitude towards famous people in Star Wars films.

Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, Max von Sydow — they feel right, because they add needed gravity to their parts.

Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman are Samuel L. Jackson and Natalie Portman. Years later and I'm still not convinced. Actually, Portman was sufficiently bae to believe Vader went nuts over her tight ass, so…

Hell, Lucas shoehorned his development by having Greedo shoot first. There was nothing wrong with Han starting out a selfish scoundrel, only to be redeemed by the end of the first film (thats a good character arc), but no, now it was totally self defense and justified.

Crazy times.&&You're suprised that they're making a bad decision?&&The Killing Joke also made it explicitly clear that it was *one version*, and that his origin has been changed and twisted so many times that even Joker doesn't know what's fact and what's made up anymore.&&And they even fucked that up when they made it into a movie.&&I know they are going to do the 'heart of gold' version, I just hope they don't. This is Disney we are talking about here, they don't take risks. Like, to the point that a hint of controversy will have them write out people from episodes that aired 2 years earlier. For example, Gravity Falls had a Louis CK cameo 2 years ago, and they redubbed the episode last year when his scandal happened. Same thing with another show, Star vs the Forces of Evil, where the character Glossaryk was recasted when the hint of a scandal was popping up.

The mouse doesn't play around.&&Greedo had a gun on Han, it was still defense to shoot him first. 

Han refuses to go with Greedo: Over my dead body.

Greedo is pleased: That's the idea, I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

Han: Yes, I bet you have... {shoots under table }


Its clear that Greedo was both willing and able to shoot Han, so Han was perfectly justified in shooting 'first' by any standard definition of self defense. This is the problem I have with Lucas' changes, it was totally unnecessary since there was no real ethical question to begin with, Han fired first in totally justified self defense. &&Hollywood is particularly bad at doing prequels. They could make a Jabba the Hutt prequel movie, and I swear to you by the end of that we'd find out he'd been abused by his fucking father or some shit and that's why he's such a bad guy now. &&It strikes me that they're probably doubling down on the Special-Edition-Han (the one who shoots *back*).  

Instead of a morally ambiguous, dangerous, and self-centered character who ultimately redeems himself, he's just a ""good guy"" scamp who has fallen in with unsavory characters in his attempts to survive the travails of the depressed outer-rim economy. 

Which is bullshit.&&Totally this.  Han was a drunk guy who ran errands for Java the Hutt. That’s pretty much it. &&Marvel has cohesion.  Yes, there's artistic license within each movie, and some of the plots are better than others, but they all play into a much grander narrative that's plotted out by folks like Kevin Feige.

Star Wars just seems to say to directors ""here's your movie, do whatever the hell you want with it, if it becomes too much of a trainwreck, we'll fire you and replace you with someone to cobble together something in a couple of weeks that won't lose us money"".

While I like what Hannibal did, shout outs should first and foremost go to the women who, using their real names, publically shared their story over and over again until justice as done. https://www.thecut.com/2015/07/bill-cosbys-accusers-speak-out.html&&Wait how is Hannibal Burress connected to all this?&&Shoutout to the women who were raped by him for years and were ignored and never gave up.&&It's a good example of how sometimes it takes a certain person at the right time to speak up in order for people to take it seriously.  

>  From the stage, he implored audience members who didn't believe him to ""Google 'Bill Cosby rape'"" once they left the show: ""That … has more results than 'Hannibal Buress,'"" 

Many people had been speaking about it for years.  It was not a secret, yet nothing happened.  But for whatever reason that one moment where one more person spoke up was the time people seemed to take note.  And it changed everything. 

That's why it's important to keep talking about things that are being ignored.  There is always opportunity to being change.  And to understand that sometimes you can't predict when and what will inspire action.  

Also shout out to Gloria Allred who has spent her life fighting for these women.  And getting shit on and disparaged for it.  I highly recommend the Netflix documentary on her.  It completely changed my view of her and the work she has done.  &&I was discussing rape jokes with someone (sensitive topic, I know), and they pointed out that Burress's joke is the perfect example of why the context of a joke matters more than the content (in other words, why you can ethically defend making a rape joke).

The concept of rape was definitely the exaggeration that Burress used to make the joke funny, which some people think is unforgivable--but without the shock factor of that joke, it's very possible that none of this happens.

We didn't continue the discussion from there, so if anyone has a counterpoint to that, I'd love to hear it. &&Except women comics have been talking about this for years and years and no one gave it shit. It took a man getting mad at it for people to care.&&I've heard this so many times, never actually seen the bit.. is it on YouTube somewhere?&&Hannibal Burress is my favorite. &&Can we also have a shoutout to Christina Applegate while we’re at it?&&This whole thing must seem very strange to Hannibal. Like, it literally started with him saying to a small crowd of people in a club ""you know this, right? This should be common knowledge."" And now one of the most prominent show-business legends of all time is (probably)going to spend the rest of his life in prison. That's some powerful stuff.&&I have a comedian friend who told me about this over a decade ago, also about how Louis CK whips his dick out and how Paul Mooney is in the closet, apparently, like in all worlds, there are insider things that everyone just ""knows"" and comedians all apparently KNEW he was doing this forever.&&What flavor is that?
&&Get da puddin' packed.&&""Hey old weird Harold, how have you been man""&&*Tune in next time on ""Inmates say the darndest things!""*&&Pill Cosby&&[deleted]&&> suspended sentences with extensive probation,

Ehh... Yelling asshole at the judge and having his lawyer attack the judges credibility is not a great way to get a suspended sentence. &&Yeah, we'll get to see our first class action rape litigation get rubber stamped lol &&No way, he's absolutely going to prison.&&Is there a link to the joke I haven't heard it&&Hannibal Bustin' Through!&&just another reason to love Hannibal.&&Crazy to think the accusations of over 40 women didn't mean shit until the jokes.&&It was a different era when the allegations were first made. It was easy for a few papers to ignore the story, and no one else would have heard about it. There was no mainstream internet which would have picked up on it. And Cosby's image was that as Mr. Perfect, or Mr. Rodgers. ""No way he could be a rapist! These are just some jealous crazy bitches."" 

Modern world you can't bury stories like this. They spread like wildfire online. Hannibal Buress was probably the first time most people had even heard that Cosby was accused of sexual assault. &&Not only that, but Cosby's downfall was the harbinger of the entire movement to unveil gross sexual misconduct by men\-in\-power.&&One thing is for certain. He won’t be wasting away his youth in long drawn out appeals court. &&Appeals process will take about 2 years&&Or he might just Aaron Hernandez his way out of jail&&Won't the fact that his attorney allegedly fell asleep during the trial be an adequate reason for an appeal?&&Bingo. Everyone's saying he's going to die in jail. I'm thinking no way. Assuming he's got the money for longterm representation, he's going to appeal the shit out of this, stay out of jail on an appeal bond, and die of old age before they rule on it. &&But he does rape.&&Yeah, I don't think so Dave. &&Where have I heard this before?&&You can't rape feet. &&Unfortunately he ruined more than just that one show for me. I grew up on Bill Cosby comedy albums and watching Fat Albert cartoons. Cosby had some classic routines and in a way blazed the trail for black comedians at the time. It’s a shame his secret life as a serial rapist burned that all down and wiped out some happy memories from the youth of my generation. &&Sadly, so many things now I have to separate the art from the artist...&&Thank you for putting into words what I haven't been able to.  I'm a first generation Turkish-American, born & raised in SoCal, my parents weren't raised surrounded by any person of color that wasn't olive-skinned.  We are very pale.  We watched primarily white-American shows, with The Cosby Show being the exception.  This man truly made his way into our weekly TV habits, we all watched this show.  He truly became ""America's Dad"" for us.  He was my favorite comedian, I'd memorized his standup routines and most of those episodes.  His jokes became our jokes, our family's punchlines (my 5'3"" mother repeating him quoting his dad, ""I brought you into this world, I'll take you out of it,"" and me ""acting"" scared, etc).  I can't explain how much this man influenced my and my white-immigrant family's lives.  And the fact that he did these vile things, just makes me so ... disappointed. 

I *wish* he didn't do these things, because I miss his positivity, his comedy, his interactions with his tv-kids.  His show was so great, so classic, and even the thought of watching an episode or listening to his standup disgusts me to no end.  

And if I, a pale-skinned white Turkish American with a great family, feel like this, I can only imagine how those who had him as a pseudo-dad, how young black kids who looked up at him and his character on TCS as someone to emulate, feel?  The whole thing just makes me so so sad.  And again-disappointed.&&Don't look up to them.&&The show is still pretty good though &&Not according to literally every news broadcast airing right now. PA is pretty strict on this, and they're saying it's very likely he will see actual time in prison...

Unfortunately, it's more likely to be on the minimal side, which is about 2 years, as opposed to the max, which would be 30. &&He's gonna die on the bus ride if it hits a bump. &&Hopefully, this monster does not deserve to live out his life in happiness and comfort. &&Don’t they have to appeal from jail though?? You go to jail straight from the guilty verdict don’t you??&&More than likely endless appeals. I’m from the US and I don’t even understand it outside of “oh, right, they’re rich, they can fucking get away with anything”. &&If he is sentenced to jail he will go to jail, then appeal from there. &&First post, three years ago, well before Cosby's accusers came forward, about basketball.

THEN hauled back to court - to be denied bail.&&He was basically just repeating what the DA said, but correcting him.&&Why the hell won't anyone acknowledge this question?!&&It's kind of a normal retort when someone is saying something you consider to be obscene about you in the third person right in front of you. &&I’m assuming it’s because he’s a bit flustered (I know I am whenever I’m found guilty of multiple rapes), so he adopted the third person manner of reference to himself from the lawyers who were talking about him.&&If he'd been sitting quietly, he probably felt like he was being discussed while he was in the room. 

""Mister Cosby is a serial rapist and liar, clearly he is a likely flight risk to avoid death in prison.""

""Yes, but he has been nothing but cooperative throughout the proceedings.

""Even so, he has a plane which will allow him to escape justice if he so chooses.""

""Maybe, but--""

""He doesn't *have* a plane, you asshole!""&&Yes, like

“He did this”

“No he didn’t.”

Just a manner of speaking I guess. I don’t know why he would do that&&He was answering a question about himself that he wasn't asked. The third person reference makes sense. And he was probably a bit irritable by that point so the yelling makes sense too.

Also, fuck Bill Cosby.&&CAN YOU SMELL...WHAT THE COSBY...IS....COOKING!!? \(\(raises eyebrow, drops roofie\)\)&&The statement was posed in the third person. So it's generally acceptable, though less common, to correct said statement in the same person.&&You tell Bill I said to have a Coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.&&I didn't say no ""flith, flarn\-flarn, filth"" to anybody.

Man, that bit plays slightly differently now. Still funny &&You did what now&&Still a G-IV?&&I think it’s like this:

“*He* is a flight risk. *He* has a plane.”

Intonation. Happy cake day. &&Does he have a plane? Because if he does, why would he say this? Is it in the garage for repairs? Did he think everyone would go ""oh okay our mistake"" and grant him bail? Owning a plane is not exactly an easy thing to lie about. &&The prosecutor was referring to Cosby as though he was not present in the courtroom. Cosby responded in kind with the third-person attempting to defend himself, “*He* doesn’t have a plane, you asshole.” &&I think it’s more

Bill Cosby was the black community’s Mr. Rogers.  Imagine if it turned out that Fred Rogers was a serial sexual assaulter and rapist.  Imagine the feelings of disenfranchisement you would feel, how betrayed you would feel.  As if all those things he taught you when you were younger about being kind and caring and selfless to others were suddenly untrue.  Was he right about what he said or were those the words of a monster?  Bill Cosby was an icon for the black community and for an entire generation he was seen as a kind of guiding figure.

Yes, he apparently did.&&If you were Bill Cosby, would you bring the fact that you were Bill Cosby to anyone's attention? &&When's dinner?&&That's how we deal with mental illness in the US.&&Agreed, don’t think it’s an ego thing so much as a mirroring obscenity with obscenity thing.

It’s funny though how he doesn’t have an outburst when being accused of raping women but when you accuse him of having a private plane that’s TOO FUCKIN FAR &&I believe he was convicted of three offences in relation to one sexual assault. Though he is almost certainly guilty of many more. &&This could be an important point. All this time, he’s heard himself referred to as “he”.

Not sure why people misunderstand that so much.&&Idk if he owns a plane, but I guess it worked because he's out until sentencing. &&I know that depending on your wealth level you can essentially do plane sharing where you don't want to pay the expensive of a personal private jet but you still want to be able to use one occasionally.&&This makes a lot more sense.&&If I'm forgetting something, please advise, but in English there really isn't a way to refer to someone in third person that differentiates between if they were in the room, or not in the room.&&That's DOCTOR Huxtable, thank you very much. &&The prosecutor dude referred to him in the typical way in a court room, like he's not there.

""*He* doesn't have a plane, you asshole."" -Cosby&&Fuck, that's fresh meta. &&bird up&&Seashells by the seashorphius&&it's a joke from the eric andre show&&It’s from his TV show with Eric Andre. It’s a surreal talk show parody where the guests aren’t usually in on it. In one episode Hannibal yells “I wanna give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate!” for no particular reason and gets a ton of applause while the guest is baffled. &&Don Adams is spinning in his grave...probably onto his back.&&yea they don't even have a similar type of standup I guess they both have teeth so that's 3 things they have in common&&No no that's not the point. Once you destroy Bill Cosby, you become Bill Cosby. Bill Cosby wasn't the first Bill Cosby either, at this point no one knows who was the first.&&Hannibals role in The Eric Andre show is basically the same as Bill Cosby's role in the Cosby show.&&Yeah, we can't know for certain whether or not Hannibal Burress rapes. &&Honestly, a lot of people (especially in the black activism community) disliked Bill Cosby before they knew about the rape stuff. He often talked down to black communities and denied the existence of institutional racism.

That’s the subtext in Hannibal Buress’ bit. When he mentions the pull up your pants thing that’s a typical condescending Cosby remark&&Dude, it wasn't some dark kept secret Hannibal brought to life. His bit was literally asking people to just google it. 

I was shocked to find out it was something people genuinely didn't know. I had known it for years. Because I read it on Cosby's Wkipedia page.

its like if a comedian were to do a routine today about Bryan Singer being accused of molesting underage boys and people being shocked about it. 

 &&From what I’ve read in interview Hannibal doesn’t really want to take any credit for it. He just kinda brought it up and left it at that. &&Yeah, that's the issue that we still need to resolve, even as people like Cosby start to face prison time. Society's tendency to ignore women while listening to men. Dozens of women came forward over the course of decades and accused the same person of rape and they were ignored. One man made an offhand joke about that same person being a rapist and charges were filed. I'm glad justice has been served but it's time for women to start having a voice equal to men.&&Including here. Until today, roughly half the comments were about innocent until proven guilty and false rape claims for money&&[deleted]&&I hadn't heard of this before so I tracked down a video of the show. 

Here it is:
https://youtu.be/dzB8dTVALQI&&when did he ever say anything about his aunt? I might of missed that, I thought it was just how hypocritical he is and that he's a literal rapist&&I think it was a podcast or a show where he said he’s being saying that in his stand up routine for a while. But this time someone recorded it and it went viral starting the whole thing&&Not even a special, just in one gig someone bootleg taped. &&That was Wanda Sykes! She's hilarious and that was also a pretty good joke&&[grapist](https://youtu.be/9Yt0b_QBP_A) &&[deleted]&&You don't know that. They have tranquilizers in prison!&&Yes, he was, but to a judge, that really shouldn’t even matter. It’s conduct not fit for a court room. &&Prosecutors and judges go way back like car seats and spinal cords. &&Who’s going to bat for bill Cosby at this point? The public doesn’t care there’s no reason not to just jail him &&Rich man in America, but also black man in America. Let's see how this plays out&&Tell that to the east area rapist. Both are going to prison. Mark my words.&&[deleted]&&Remember when he grandstanded about the black community committing crime?&&""when you get home, Google that shit because you get more results than...Hannibal Buress...""&&That’s not even a good joke really but I guess maybe he felt he needed to just get it out there? I love Hannibal though. Dude seems down to earth. I’d hang out with Hannibal. &&My buddy's brother was at the comedy cellar and he came up and performed an impromptu set a year or so ago. I'm still salty about not being there.&&Where is this from?&&HOW CAN HE RAPE, SIR?!&&where can I find it? Been scouring youtube &&> he taught you when you were younger about being kind and caring and selfless to others were suddenly untrue

I mean he's not wrong about it, necessarily, he just wasn't following his own advice. &&I'm Black, I fully understand what Cosby represent, but Cosby need to be a wake up call. We can't idolize these celebrities.&&That's what people said about Cosby in the 80s.  Literally that right there.  Not just his TV show Cosby but the kids show Picture Pages or Kids Say the Darndest Things.  30 years later....

Who knows?  Even Del Toro?&&Guillermo or Benicio?&&Dude, don't jinx it!&&But at least he'll die knowing his legacy will forever be tarnished&&For real. This comment really struck home with me. &&😔&&Isn't it also just rape rape? Like with drugs?&&I want some sort of celebrity scumbag live ticker that shows the status of all the infamous Hollywood rapists. &&Never knew this, just looked it up. How the fuck does he still get work?&&[deleted]&&It was rape-rape as well. She didn't want it. &&And people still made movies with him. After he fled the United States. That’s ridiculous. &&Didn’t he get a standing ovation recently at some awards show? All during the #metoo stuff?&&This guy reddits.&&And what are your feelings on the intelligence of Rick and Morty fans?&&Yeah. That's how one of the reporters said it&&Hold up, in order to be a flight risk... Do you literally have to own a plane? I figured it was a term used to avoid your actual sentence which could be accomplished by a multitude of forms of travel. Wtf?! &&Thank you very much.&&I’m confused. /u/smells_delicious referred to himself in the third person?

&&Goddamnit I actually went into your profile to look.

Anyway here's the specific comment https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8f4rzt/bill_cosby_guilty_on_all_three_counts_in_indecent/dy0r274/&&fuck no i'd want to keep that a secret &&He is still trying to lure someone in so he can date rape them.&&It was the end of the trial. Any outbursts before that would have likely hurt his case. He didn't have anything to lose at that point.&&You'll never find anyone more indignant to be accused of something they didn't do than those who have done other bad things and gotten away with it. He knows he raped those women. But to be accused of planning to escape in a private plane, when he doesn't even own a plane? How DARE you!&&This probably still feels great for all the victims that won't get their day in court with him because of the statute of limitations&&Or he was just being sarcastic. It's way more simple. I've done the same shit many times. Hear someone talking about you (he this, he that) and then interject with your own ""he"" comment.

I can just see the conversations.

Cosby: You use too many drugs!

Pryor: And you drug too many women!&&GOONYGOOGOO!&&That could be because of other reasons, though. Eddie had a falling out with SNL during the 90s when David Spade made that ""falling star"" joke.

It must have hurt because Eddie saved that show. To basically be kicked when he was down by them must have been quite a blow. 

Really amazing that he was at the 40th at all.&&when his guilt was still in doubt, murphy felt hitting someone when they're down wasn't cool. and he didn't want to trivialize the potential victims either.

It's not his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. It's just that people only started really caring when he said something and that's frustrating when victims were not being listened to when they said something. Nothing to do with Hannibal taking credit because he definitely didn't. &&Seriously it was on his damn wiki YEARS before it was major news.

I know people that think he got screwed over because his show was so funny and he wasn't bad in it.&&*I'm Bill the Cosby, Bill Cosby, Bill the Cosby*

*Don't act like you don't know!*

&&And now it's stuck in my head again.

Stupid piece of shit.&&Remember when he built his entire career on being a lovable father figure to TV watchers and comics alike? You can find articles like [this one](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/10/bill-cosby-sweaters-women-fall-2012_n_1956001.html) just from 2012 casually referencing his trademark sweaters.

Cosby is probably one of the biggest sources of fuel for skepticism towards the outward facing appearance of people of all time.&&He was probably just testing material. I seem to remember him saying on his podcast ""The Handsome Rambler"" that he wasn't intending to cause the storm he did; he was just trying out jokes.&&With Hannibal dilevery that shit is halarious.&&At SXSW in, I want to say 2015, he sent out a tweet saying he was willing to play drums for any band that would be willing to let him do so. Speedy Ortiz took him up on it at the show I was at. The actual drummer gave him his seat and just chilled there on stage for a bit.

Hannibal didn’t know the song, the band, or how to play drums whatsoever. It was awesome.&&Netflix. Probably won't be on YouTube because copyright or whatever &&One of his Netflix specials&&Not everyone has real life role models to look up to. On top of that, how are you gonna stop a young and impressionable person from admiring and developing an emotional connection with such a prominent figure who is so relatable and wholesome? 

Human beings are gonna be human beings, you can’t beat people up about that. &&I think it is reasonable to idolize someone who portrays good family/community/personal values in media. Those are the people who should be idolized and supported. 

It's just a tragedy when it turns out to be a facade, but I can't blame people who used to love him. &&Juan Del Toro?

&&Neither, just Juan Del Toro from Monterrey&&Steve Del Torro. Super nice guy.&&Not sure why but im getting a Guillermo vibe&&exactly, unlike Jimmy Saville.&&Maybe im a Nihilist, but i personally wouldnt at all care at all what my rep was if I lived a confortable life and am near death.&&I hope so, I really do. I have co-workers that are still on his side because his show was so funny and he didn't do bad things to women in that. &&Rape and sodomy. Polanski publicly claimed it was consensual by saying “she was down to party”. The victim was a thirteen year old child at the time of the attack, and Roman Polanski drugged her prior to victimizing her. 

She spoke out fifteen years later and slammed Polanski’s claim that what is obviously a clear case of rape and sodomy was consensual. &&It was the trifecta of rape -- she was underage, drugged, and also said no.

It was all the kinds of rape that you can possibly rape.&&His victim was 13 years old.&&I kind of suspect that would be a very long ticker, hollywood is full to bursting with scumbags. Full to bursting with rapists and their victims, you have money and power and fame all tied together with a sense of entitlement. For every accusation I'm sure there are 50 victims in Hollywood.&&Polanski is famous and infamous?&&Hollywood seems to have a rather incestuous relationship with sexual assault. &&a lot of people, many of whom have since been outed and alleged rapists/sexual abusers who were powerful in the industry, supported his claim of innocence (and many still do) and believe it was a setup.

Not joking. &&This guy this guys.&&They are the smartest person in a room by themselves.

Edit: my original comment was deleted. It’s a conspiracy &&Shallow and pedantic. &&George is getting angry&&You don’t have to...but it doesn’t hurt &&They also use Float Risk if the accused has a boat.&&Not a lawyer but I believe stuff like this puts your name in a system so it flags if you try to board a commercial flight where as owning a plane is a much easier way to essentially smuggle yourself out. I can send my plane anywhere for any reason I don't have to be on it so it's not weird to register a flight of no passengers or say my kid. Much easier to do that privately. Again not a lawyer so I could be wrong.&&I think in his case the implication is he could leave the courtroom, hop on the hoopty, and be in France before sundown. Or make that decision at any moment in the days or weeks or months before the sentencing (immediately after which he'd be dragged off to jail).

Having the means just sitting there makes it much more likely, even if everything else so far says you're not disposed to that choice.

Chapelle spoke about this recently; it's a challenging thing for many of them to come to terms with and some were able to do it faster than others&&>and he didn't want to trivialize the potential victims either.

I can totally see that in that making jokes about the situation focuses the story on Bill Cosby and his fall from grace, he becomes the protagonist, rather than keeping the focus on the victims whose stories and receipt of justice should be center stage&&And he’s probably pissed that these mouthy broads made him sell his plane to cover legal expenses.

But then again, I suppose that's what Carnage is for!&&She is literally the WOOO-O-O-O-ORSSTTT at hiding in plain sight 

&&John Ralphio's sister? ""Give me Symbiote, please"". &&I'm gonna guess that the actual full Venom will be onscreen for less of 15 minutes.&&[deleted]&&> The Guy you work for is an Evil Person.

Does Avi Arad have a cameo?&&Sorry Sony but ""EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO"" is not as epic sounding as you think it is. &&Well the dialogue is... oof. &&Why are so many movie villains obsessed with finding 'the next step in human evolution'? It's becoming this strange trope. &&This is the music from the second Infinity War trailer, is it not?&&Lmao did they use the same song from Avengers Infinity War Trailer 2 for this one?

Edit: yeah Redshift from Audiomachine
https://youtu.be/c4G2sWk5jvM&&Reminds me of that Prototype video game.&&Like:
1 The voice of Venom

2 SONY remembered that Venom refers to itself as We 

Dislike:
1 The way the mouth moves when Venom speaks, it looks off

2 The pronunciation of Symbiote

3 ""The Guy you work for is an evil person""&&I like Tom Hardy, but that accent&&If this Venom never met spider man, then why does it look like spiderman?&&This feels like the hottest movie of the 1997 Christmas Season. &&This looks like one of those shitty early 00's Marvel movies. 

Like Daredevil, Hulk and Ghost Rider.&&On one hand, I really want this movie to be good since the Venom design is sick.

On the other hand, I don't want Sony to keep making Spider-Man spin-off movies that have no connection to Spider-Man in them. &&""The guy you work for is the evil person"" 

Oh my god... this is gonna suck isn't it.

The ""We Are Venom"" was pretty Bad-ass tho.&&""SymBYEote""&&Predicting a disaster of a third act when Venom and Carnage fight.&&A Venom movie with Carnage and a hard R rating could and would be incredible. I’m so disappointed they’re not going to take notes from Deadpool and Logan. &&I seriously didn’t realize Jenny Slate was in this and now I can’t unsee her Parks and Recreation character.&&this looks like a B movie.&&Just not feeling it. Hope it proves me wrong when it comes out, but if it doesn't, this film better teach Sony their lesson. And hopefully we'll get ALL of the Spiderverse in the MCU.&&Why is Tom Hardy giving me strong Forest Gump / Simple Jack vibes at times?&&Looks like Sony is getting ready to sell the rights for Spider-Man to Disney...&&>In association with Marvel

There's going to be people who will be mistaken into thinking this is part of the MCU.&&You can't make a Venom origin movie without Spider-Man. You just *can't*. Venom's origin *is* Spider-Man.


It's like a Bizarro movie without Superman. Or a Mecha-Godzilla movie without Godzilla. It's just *wrong.*&&Super cringey dialogue from what I heard. Yeesh. Except for 'We are Venom!', that was cool. &&So... I'm not getting a good feeling from this writing. I'm not sure if it's the delivery, or how ham-fisted it is but some of these lines *really* felt off. Brock practically turns to the camera and says ""The love interest works for the villain.""

Not 100% on the direction they're taking with the action either. I just saw the trailer for [Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36PDeN9NRZ0) and its done the same way: Action hero is super good at beating up bad guys but pretty much has everything done for him. I mean it's not that big a deal because that kinda happens in the source material, so whatever.

Look I get it, he looks bigger than Topher Grace. He looks more accurate to the comics than Spidey 3. Everyone wants to see Venom on screen, myself included. But I'm still not convinced.

I don't want to be the person that goes to watch a movie already soured, and I think that's the worst possible way to watch a movie. I'm just saying that if I were a gambling man, I wouldn't bet on this.

Edit: Oh yeah, as for the weird pronunciation of *symbiote*.... I was thrown off for a bit but I guess they're going with [symbiont](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symbiont) instead. So while not technically wrong... such a weird decision when there's a lot of source material with an agreed-upon pronunciation. The conspiracy theorist in me says this was mandated by Marvel Studios in case they ever want to introduce the sybiotes separately.&&Looks like another generic and forgettable story with a character that looks cool. &&This feels more like a movie of the game Prototype than a movie about Venom.&&This movie looks EXACTLY how you would not want this movie to look.&&[deleted]&&I'm... Still not sold.&&Released on the day of the premiere of infinity war. Hmm&&Wowee, babyyy I am no longer excited for this!!&&Why did they pick Jenny Slate for this movie lol&&It reminds me more about the game ""The Darkness""&&You know Sony is in a bad place when people breathe a sigh of relief from seeing the Venom character in a Venom trailer. &&""I'm hearing a voice.""

*EDDEEEEEE*&&I love Jenny Slate, but she doesn’t fit this kind of film, especially if she’s gonna mis-pronounce Symbiote like that. &&That looks... Not great. That motorcycle jump is laughable. 

Maybe I'm not as knowledgeable as other comic book fans, but it seems weird to introduce Venom as an antihero. &&Venom sounds like Mr. Claw from Inspector Gadget

https://youtu.be/V1j7lyRnxVE&&Whoever came up with ""Embrace your inner anti-hero"" should never be allowed to be involved in film again, just terrible.

SIM-BUY-OAT!

Still excited cuz not Topher Grace, but who the hell can't pronounce symbiote correctly?&&This is definitely a movie!&&I can't over the symbiotic appendages coming out of Tom Hardy's stomach. It looks comical. The movie doesn't seem as dark as the teaser portrayed it.&&Yiiikes.... the arms and motorcycle stuff.... 

The full suit looks great tho so it’s got that going for it.

Edit: /s&&""the guy you work for is an evil person""&&A Venom movie! and by Venom I guess they mean just Tom Hardy shooting black columns of cgi jelly out of his hoodie and then about 5 minute of total on screen actual Venom. Also very skeptical that Carnage does not appear at all in this trailer. Something tells me he'll only appear in the very final scene and the rest of the time will just be Tom Hardy punching generic gun men.&&Let's make it plain and clear and simple: Marvel are succeeding because, ever since Iron Man, they've been making character-piece movies about characters with powers. Movies that happen to have a lot of cool action set-pieces, yes, but that revolve around character development.

Every trailer showcases that character development, not the powers.

Sony, the questions your trailer should be answering are things like ""Who is Eddie Brock?"" and ""Why should we care?"". 

That you don't/can't answer these questions is what tells me this is an action puff-piece with no substance, the content of which will be dissavowed by Marvel, robbing us of a great Spiderverse character.&&omg Sony just stop...&&There should be a Venom movie-based breakfast cereal called Symbi-Oats.&&It's been 4 hours... why isn't a new SONY film greenlit, what's taking so long? &&Ok understandable have a good day sir&&Hollywood screenwriting isnt all about dialogue. Its about taking notes from producers idiotic ideas and their friends idiotic ideas and stuffing them into the movie somewhere without the movie falling apart.

Cue giant mechanical spider. &&Remember, your screenwriting has to match the budget and CGI is expensive as hell. The producer is gonna gut your script to add more filler dialog so the industry can make a profit.&&Doesn’t take much apparently&&It's going to be a lot of Tom Hardy playing a guy named Eddie Brock with a small amount of Venom. &&I'm thinking some of the other people in the thread are right. It's probably one of the last few scenes of the film. &&Yeah I suspect you saw 80% of Venoms screen time in that trailer. &&I'm also curious as to what exactly Venom's powers are going to be and why. I mean, Venom's powers are *meant* to be a mimicry of Spider-Man's that the symbiote ""remembers"" from its time on Peter. That's like a key point of Venom. Will he still have Spider-Man style powers in this movie? If he does, why?&&*Damaged*&&It'll probably be nothing. In the Ultimate line, there was no symbol on the suit initially (and later? I forget). The only white on the suit was the eyes.&&I heard from a pretty legit source that it will be a 'V'...&&It means hope.

&&[deleted]&&That’s something Deadpool would ironically say&&Cue the villain getting Carnage-like powers then fighting Venom at the climax... if this doesn't happen I'll be seriously surprised.&&Carnage will unfortunately be fucked up by Sony whenever it's his time. They won't be willing to make him as a psychotic and evil as he needs to be, and we'll get this edgelord character that acts ""OMG so random lol"". &&Money pleasssseeeeeeeeeee&&Simba-ote&&https://youtu.be/pKZFMjknquM&&When life gives you a venom symbiote, you sell your grandmother’s jewellery and go clubbing!&&""Give me SymBYEote, please""
FTFY&&PWEEASSSEEE*&&“She’s the wooooorrrrrssssssttttt”&&Remember Sony spoiling the Rhino fight for ASM 2 in the trailer and it was the last shot of the film? 

I bet it’s the same here. &&Not even. That ""We are Venom"" scene will be the climax of the movie, probably 10 minutes from the end, and it will be the only scene with full Venom.&&I’m sensing this’ll be like the Ghost Rider movies. The stuff with the full Venom suit will be the most unbelievably badass shit ever, but the rest of the movie will be mediocre (or just painful to sit through if this trailer’s dialogue is any indicator). Great for 4 minute clips on YouTube, basically. &&I'd be ok with that as long as they make Eddie Brock interesting. From this trailer, I like Hardy's acting but hope the writing is up to par. Though the dialogue, from what we heard thus far, is sub par throughout.&&Yeah looks like they are doing that stupid shit like in xmen where mystique is just j law for most of her appearance. I get they can save money on fx that way but...fuck man you are doing a movie about an alien humanoid monster here that's big and hulking...&&""The guy you work for is an evil person!""&&Venom sounds pretty fucking cheesy too. Who wrote this...

Kelly Marcel, Fifty Shades of Grey.

Oh... god.

&&If you're going to stay here, you're only going to hurt BAD people.&&Hahahahaha but for real- fuckkkk Avi Arad.&&Demons, as cheesy as it is, sounds much better than 'Anti-Hero'.

Oof.&&just like that, sony fell into one of the most simple traps in movie making - assuming your audience is retarded.

we dont need you to explicitly tell us venom is an anti hero, or a hero, or a villain, or a brainless beast. we can decide on our own. there's no need to bash us in the head with it.&&""I'm a reporter. I hear you're trying to kill people. So what gives?""

10/10 give them the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay already goddammit &&I cringed when they flashed “Anti-Hero” on the screen. Feels a little diminishing &&Ok good it's not just me. &&""The man you work for is an evil person""

""If you're going to stay you're only going to hurt bad guys""

I have a feeling this will be an oof that will be heard around the globe when it releases...&&>It's becoming this strange trope

More like it's BEEN a trope, especially with superhero fare&&People keep finding steps man. And the more steps you find, what do you get? ... Stairs dude..  stairs&&Welcome to the plot of 99% of the ultimate marvel comics. Everything is tied to captain americas super soldier serum or tony starks super soldier armor or hulks super soldier transforming radiation, or the mutant gene that could develope super soldiers or green goblins failed super soldier serum, or Spider-Man’s fluke of a success super soldier serum, or........&&I noticed that! Thought I was going crazy. &&Came here to say that. Was wondering if it was meant to imply something but I doubt.&&Exactly. It's [Audiomachine - Redshift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFuYyHiOmXs).&&Sony is like Joey in that episode of Friends where he finds a Porsche parked on the street and starts hanging out nearby it so people will think its his, only the Porsche is the MCU and it's somehow even more pathetic.&&VENOM IN THE MCU CONFIRMED! ^/s&&lmao i knew it... jesus christ sony you aren't making this easy on yourselves.&&SONY 6D chess to promote their new Spider-man video game on the PS4&&> Reminds me of that Prototype video game.

Exactly what I was thinking.&&To be fair, Venom's mouth doesn't make anatomical sense, so I'll give them some leeway on lip-syncing weirdness.  Still agree completely though.&&Everytime he uses an ""American accent"", he sounds a little slow. He tends to slur and sound constipated. &&He sounds like he took a similar New York accent course that Gosling took for his accents.

The Marlon Brando institute of New York accents.&&I mean, it's not the worst New York accent I've ever heard, but it's far from good.

If the movies good though, I'll probably forget about it really quickly.&&It's Sony...

They kinda just do stuff without reason.&&Cue the montage scene where Venom tries to find his look and sees Spider-Man on the news.&&haha this does look like spawn&&Reminds me more of catwoman. Beloved villain/anti-hero removed from all context of the original comics while an unrelated movie is forced around them.&&Don't forget Elektra&&Pretty much my same mentality. Love Tom Hardy, so I'm there for him regardless. But if it isn't set in the MCU with Holland's Spider-Man, that would be beyond idiotic&&From what I can tell, Sony is going to say it’s MCU canon and Marvel is going to say it’s not. &&It's from the writers of 50 Shades Of Grey & Gangster Squad...

:/&&Why is dialogue so easy to not fuck up where they end up fucking it up.  

""Allegations that say you recruit the most vulnerable people for tests that *end up killing people*.""

That is so weak and easily re-written. No journalist beyond a high school newspaper would ever waste a one-shot opportunity for a pointed question like that. Ughhhhh.&&[deleted]&&I know, right? I grew up on Spider-Man video games pronouncing it as ""SymBEEyote""&&They seriously couldn't get someone on set to correct her in its pronunciation?

Still does.&&In before they make that company president Carnage instead of Cletus Kasady&&Literally the wo^oo^^^ooo ^^oo ^o oorst! &&Definitely don't search YouTube for ""Marcel the Shell"".&&It looks like a fake trailer in a real movie.&&Don't hold your breath. This is Sony we are talking about. It IS going to suck.

This trailer gives off the pre 2008 vibes. &&I know right? Spiderverse is such a cool concept to have its own movies; Carnage, Venom, Spidey vs. Venom, Spiderverse itself. Venom is a crucial part of Peter's story, it really deserves some attention. Too bad the suits won't let simple folk enjoy the movies because of all these rights mambo-jumbo.  &&""You're *only* gonna hurt people who do *bad* things.""&&Because when Tom Hardy does an American accent, he goes with mentally disabled.&&""Everybody knows you never go full spinoff.""

""What do you mean?""

""Check it out. Sony, 2007, *Spiderman 3*. Shitty villains, shitty third act, not a spinoff. Studio meddling, emo dancing. Disappointing sequel, sho'. Not a spinoff. You know Columbia Pictures, 2011, *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*. Sequel, yes. Minor franchise, maybe. Nicholas Cage starring. But he co-starred with Idris Elba and piloted a [flaming bagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDzQddhYmJs). That ain't spinoff material. It was a badass battle scene. You know any spinoffs with flaming baggers? You went full spinoff, man. Never go full spinoff. You don't buy that? Ask Fox, 2009, *X-Men: Origins: Wolverine*. Remember? Went full spinoff, went home empty-handed.""&&At least he didn't go full retard.&&Sony: Ha! Try to revive this character like what you did with spider-man&&Just hypothetically speaking, how much would that cost? 500 million? &&Spider-Man VII: The Force Awakens&&thats probably sony's plan&&Or a Joker movie with no Batman, which WB is already planning.&&the guy you work for is an evil person&&And that line is lifted directly from various Spider-Man stories so can’t commend the writers for that one.&&I saw the trailer for Upgrade as a youtube commercial and totally thought it was the Venom trailor because that guy even looks like tom hardy.&&Try 2006 &&It was leaked when they showed it at cinemacon and it was gonna be attached to IW anyway.&&Using the same music as the second Infinity War trailer too&&Alia Shawkat was booked?&&She was the WOOO-OOO-oooo-OOORST choice for a serious role. &&That would be such a better idea too. The Darkness is awesome! And, coincidentally, the main character isn't dependent on Spiderman!&&This looked more like a Darkness rip-off than Venom.&&That was the first thing that came to my head when I saw the tendrils take control. Even the voice talking to him reminded me of that game.&&I’m waiting for the edit now of “I’m hearing a voice.”

“ED EDD N EDDY”

*high pitched whistling*&&I can’t help but think the pronunciation is an intentional choice (albeit not the right one) by Ruben Fleischer, otherwise I’m sure someone would have corrected her. Just like the pronunciation of “Aang” in *The Last Airbender.* So I don’t think I blame Jenny Slate for it.&&“Symbiote? More like uh-Sym-uh-BYEEEEE-ote okayeeeee”&&Venom is an antihero in the comics, he is a villain to spidey but its because he hates him for personal reasons, not because he is a bad guy&&Venom is a hero, Carnage is a villain. Spider-Man and Venom have the same relationship Daredevil and Punisher have &&Seriously, what’s with the motorcycles? It feels like I’m watching a really campy, early 2000s action flick— which is not a good thing.&&Just as shitty as “So that’s it huh? We’re some kind of Suicide Squad?”&&Idk they may just not wanna blow their load on Carnage in the first trailer

I'm trying to be optimistic&&Seriously, Netflix has produced 6 comedy specials, 3 indie sci-fi films, and 22 seasons of digitally rendered anime in that time.&&Trying to get Adam Sandler in another rocom with Drew berrymore and Kevin James as a support character... &&“You want me to write a scene where Brainiac is razzlin' polar bears?”&&Bright proved that

Somehow sold for 3 million

Brb getting into screenwriting&&Tom Hardy is almost good enough to make that worthwhile on his own.

Almost.&&He's a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude &&> Tom Hardy playing a guy named Eddie Brock

It's going to be Tom Hardy playing a dude pretending to be a Symbiote dude.&&Looks like his powers are pretty much what they usually are. He has super strength, toughness, and agility just by the symbiote itself. Even the creature on it's own looks much larger than the comics. Instead of wrist-webs he projects full extensions of the symbiote. Reminds of me of that game, Prototype.

Edit: Apparently the game *The Darkness* is very similar to this too.

Edit 2: And Ultimate Spider-Man, it seems.&&I didn't think this iteration of Spider-Man had web slinging as a *power*, isn't it something he wears?

&&HA hA ha ha Ha hA&&Oh god no.&&Until this moment I wasn't aware I have suicide squack related PTSD.&&You're right! Ultimate Venom did not have anything on his chest. Great comic series by the way.&&On his planet it means hope.&&Please no&&""V"" for Vaio to advertise more Sony products?&&jesus christ&&What's the joke here?&&🖕

What does this stand for on your planet, *gratitude*?&&This.

The only reason they said that is because ""anti-hero"" was used in conjunction with Deadpool.

And they want the Deadpool hype to carry over to here.&&I think they'll leave it to the next movie. Betting they'll end with Brock in prison meeting Kasady and then the symbiote spawning Carnage. Maybe a post-credits scene later with Carnage but that's it.&&Shitt, I knew I had seen her before somewhere!&&Oh, my bad, no problem. I'll just destroy this store. MONEY PWEAAASSEEE&&Pub\-liz\-ity.

this does not bode well.&&I bought Ghost Rider when it came out just to see the giant flaming hell wheel scene on Blu-ray and I don't even regret it. &&> but hope the writing is up to par

It absolutely will not be.&&Well, from my point of view the Jedi are evil!&&The greatest writing always does away with vivid imagery and colorful prose. 

*How do I describe this person as the villain?*

""The guy you work for is an evil person""

*How do I let the audience know I'm good at hiding, but this girl is not?*

""Hey, you suck at hiding.""

*How do I tell the audience that the main character is conflicted - but not exactly a villain*

Spell out that he's an anti-hero right in the trailer. 

&&Destined to become the new “I don’t like sand.”&&please say you're joking......&&Why in the fuck would anyone give that person a gig writing screenplays?

Literally her entire body of work is a warning of how bad a writer she is.&&I was getting an ice cream cone at Rite Aid, and when the cashier asked me what i wanted, someone fake coughed behind me and said ""two scoops"". It was Avi Arad. I was really surprised, so i turned to look at him, and he started scooping my man-boobs up and down really fast, staring me dead in the eyes and saying ""two scoops"" the entire time. I tried to turn back around and ignore him, but every time i opened my mouth to order he'd interrupt with another ""two scoops"" behind my back, really aggressively like he wanted me to fight him. The cashier and I were in shock, but I finally choked out that I wanted a single scoop butter pecan. Avi Arad just smirked and threw his entire wallet down on the counter. He told the cashier ""he wants cake batter. Two scoops"", then walked out of the store.

There didn't end up being anything in the wallet.&&Thank god he dropped out of the MCU before he had the chance to fuck it up.&&Good one. Embrace your demons would be a badass tagline (if no one used it yet) which is why Sony will never use it.&&I was expecting it to say ""venom"".&&This is typically what happens when you pitch ""EMBRACE YOUR INNER DEMONS"" as a tagline.

""But will 18-25 year old males understand Venom isn't a literal hell creature?""  
""We want to make sure audiences know Venom is a type of super hero who's also sort of bad, not a demon.""  
""What if if we just go with 'EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO'?""  &&""Don't worry guys. He does some bad things, but only to bad people. But he's really good! He'll be good by the end!""&&Wasn't it the half in the bag guys that said Sony executives basically have a pipeline of incompetence that just churns out bad movies? 

They have a culture of playing it safe and historically making really stupid decisions that end up ruining otherwise good films. &&Sony's been in this rut since the Amazing Spiderman movies. These movies feel like they're designed by committee. A committee of old farts that are grossly out of touch with what current tastes and expectations are for a movie. This is shit that would be mediocre even in the 00's. But since it's a post Marvel cinematic land scape people expect better. It's why Marvel/Disney had to bail them out with the Spiderman team up.&&It's really annoying when trailers introduce characters by having say what their job is. The guy is asking questions and has a camera crew. What else could he be?

Lots of other bad dialogue that feels forced&&This is gonna be like Charlie's script for Dennis' political speech.

""You are bad man. I good! So halt or you will regrets have.""&&As a journalist I can confirm this is 100% authentic-sounding&&I was super disappointed at that too. Anti-hero? Really? Isn't that a bit on-the-nose? And reductive. &&Makes sense too.

I don't know any super villains that want to reverse human evolution. That's not very spooky.&&You’d think with all these evil scientists running around they’d have taken an evolution course at some point. &&“Big evil governments want to make armies stronger so that they can take over the world”&&[deleted]&&Lmao this is a fantastic analogy. Have you seen that interview with Amy Pascal and Kevin Feige? It's pretty much also this, with her being Joey and Feige being the Porsche&&Careful, you're going to give Feige an aneurysm &&Well, Eddie Brock is supposed to be a little slow and beefy.&&It's honestly just how Hardy is. He's rarely in anything where he sounds normal. Love a lot of his acting, but his voice is either muffled, slurred, changed, or just plain odd. &&**Why** is it a New York accent though? The film's emphatically set in San Francisco.&&I'm still in disbelief this movie is even happening.
&&Seriously though, when they flashed the sony logo at the start, I was like wait is that supposed to be a good thing?&&Part of the problem is that I can't tell whether or not this is a joke.

Tom Holland is currently listed on imdb for this movie, but given that some sort of plot isn't even listed yet, I'd wager he's just on there as a placeholder.

**OR HE COULD BE IN THE NEWS MONTAGE**&&Maybe he'll touch the TV screen and moan ""learning"". This looks like that kind of movie. &&Catwoman was possibly one of the worst movies I have ever watched. 


Especially that [super-cringy basketball scene...](https://youtu.be/rNlmRId2FVQ)

&&But I tried so hard to forget it.&&""In association with Marvel"" makes me think it's not.&&Sony are wrong though.&&:(&&Oh holy shit... Not gonna lie I enjoyed Gangster Squad but wow... What a resume haha&&It sounded like that dialogue was made for the trailer by splicing together several lines.&&But did you see that quickly cut to reaction?!

He totally nailed him. Clearly nobody had ever asked such a thought-provoking question before. &&To me, that meme has been up for centuries.&&Sony has a good track run of fucking up Spider-Man though.&&Also the first line Eddie says is ""The guy you work for is a evil person.""

That's the opening line you give your character? Really?&&**Assistant Director**: ""Fuck it, close enough. CUT""&&They really go in on that pronunciation too haha

It's like the ""**bye**"" is emphasized. &&Fingers crossed for a blue sky laser&&That’s my fetish. &&With the right director, that would truly be a terrifying film&&""The Evil Person"", rated R&&""The *guy* you work for is an *evil person*!""&&Feige: Hold my beer

Legit though the aftermath of Infinity War would perfectly stage the Symbiote's arrival on Earth. Peter just needs to find it in some back alley and boom, you've got black-suit spiderman. It can even corrupt Karen and be a better version of the voice from the Venom trailer. Not sure where they would get Eddy Brock from though.&&not less than 1 billion, probably more. make it a little more money and Disney gets the whole Sony studio.&&[That's literally Sony's plan](http://collider.com/venom-mcu-spider-man-homecoming-amy-pascal/)&&Not crashing this plane?&&I was going to say that, but at least the Joker didn't base his appearance around Batman.

How can Venom possibly be a completely separate entity from Spider-Man, that just so happens to look exactly like a monstrous black-suit Spider-Man, and also just so happens to have all his powers, too? That is crazy.

Now, if the Joker movie is an origin story, and fucking Batman *isn't there* at Ace Chemicals with him when the time comes, *I will riot.*&&I'm getting frustrated with all these studios trying to copy the MCU without putting in the actual work that Marvel did. 

I get it, shared universes are the hot shit right now, but you have to put the time in. &&Dennis is a bastard man&&I thought of the Upgrade trailer the entire time I was watching this, and not just because of the similarity between Tom Hardy and Discount Tom Hardy. 

Lots and lots of similarities. Tom Hardy has a girlfriend he's trying to protect. Lite and Easy Tom Hardy has a girlfriend he's trying to avenge. Tom Hardy gets superpowers that come with a scary voice in his head. Store-brand Tom Hardy gets superpowers that come with a friendly voice in his head. Tom Hardy's powers beat people up on his behalf while he goes like 'whoa what's going on'. I Can't Believe It's Not Tom Hardy powers beat up people on his behalf while he goes like 'whoa what's happening right now'

What's a shame is that Upgrade is probably made for 1/10 the cost, will be 10 times better and make 1/100 the money that this Venom movie does. 

Moral of the story: ensure you buy genuine approved Tom Hardy &&Oh man, with one of those horrible bro-friendly soundtracks featuring original music by Nickelback, POD, and many others of the mook-rock genre, the only one making it actually into the film would be a song in the end credits.&&Toot... Toot toot... Toot toot tweet... Toot toot twee-dee-deet, tooot, TWEET! &&He used to be an outright villain in the beginning, but compared to the other symBYEotes(why movie?) has really mellowed out in his later years.&&Venom was definitely a villain at first, pure hatred for Spider-Man. As time went on he became more anti-hero. &&If we're going to pull shitty lines from characters that should've been intelligent in suicide squad then you need to go with the following.

Goddamn, it was brilliant. &&What do you mean, ""you symbiote""&&If I remember right he also had those extensions on the maximum Carnage game for snes&&The scene with Eddie’s arm turning into black symbiote shit and attacking the goons gave me a huge Prototype vibe.&&I feel like prototype is somehow unheard of, underground game, that's literally everyone has played. It's weird.&&***IF*** Venom gets a chest symbol it likely won't be until the end. Or if they let Tom Holland shoot the sequel maybe then. But think about it...all of the marketing material so far uses the menacing face design as his calling card over the usual angsty version of the Spider-man symbol. 

I'm 99% convinced were getting a marvel themed prototype game adaption movie. And I'm super down for that. The voice and suit look awesome. He can evolve into Marvel Vemom later on. &&Or the darkness&&When Spidey gets the Venom suit, he is able to generate webs without his web shooters.&&> suicide squack

It seems that you were also bitten by a radioactive duck.&&Ahem, that's *Academy Award-winning* Suicide Squad.&&IIRC the movie is based on the Lethal Protector story with elements from the Ultimate line, so with that in mind, I actually like this trailer and I think I'll enjoy the movie.

That being said, I'm sure the general audience won't be on board, critics won't like it, and it'll be a flop. But I'll still be there opening weekend.&&Hope is spelled with an H, stupid.&&I hear it's just going to be a picture of Tom Hardy.

I’ve been saying sim-bee-yote since I was a kid and this was weird to me.&&She is the WOOOYOYOYOOORRSST. No seriously she is the worst. &&How much you wanna bet that it's really the last scene of the film? The kicker being that throughout the film Tom Hardy refuses to embrace the symbiote, referring to himself as 'I' the whole time. At the end he finally gives in, and both voices combine to say 'we'.

Edit: Yes, I get it. He does say 'we' in some scenes. I'm not going to defend my statement because I actually want to be wrong and get a decent Venom movie.&&Luckily there was probably only about 7 of them because why would you go purely to see a mid-tier henchmen.&&Roll credits&&this dumb shit never fails to make me lol&&All my friends are inky sym-bi-otes...&&This is the symbiote.

Dunno anything about the movie, but Venom looks perfect.

Well they're writing him right then.&&Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's just his go-to accent and since Brock has some connections to NYC they just went with that lol.&&That’ll be his cameo. Eddie will watch a TV with Spider-Man saving the day (maybe the boat scene from Homecoming?) and the voice in his head will see it and like it and say something poorly written like, “I like what I see.”

You get the idea &&Anyone can edit IMDB though right?&&And John Cena was in Thor Ragnarok too! IMDB confirmed it!&&I hate how right you are.&&I don't even have to click that link, I'm already dying inside.&&I mean it's a 100% Sony produced film, unlike Homecoming which was a collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.

I would be all for this. &&Disney would buy it for any amount. &&Don't forget that practically five minutes after this news broke, Feige came out and said 'The fuck are you talking about?' &&I like how the only thing she's taken from the success of the MCU is that a connected universe is a good way to maximise profit by making people feel like they have to watch every movie in order to keep up.&&Amy Pascal can fuck off&&I still hate the idea of a Joker origin film. His whole thing is that he genuinely doesn't remember anymore, that his backstory is whatever he wants it to be. The only thing that matters is that night at Ace Chemicals. *That* is the origin of the Joker, cut and dry. An origin story showing how he became a feared crime boss, before he started terrorizing Gotham? I could buy it.

That alone sold this movie for me. &&Yeah but only with spiderman, they ended in good terms after a while and venom became an antihero&&Seriously when are we getting an Adam Sandler anime, I thought Netflix was good at linking popular things together to make more popular things.&&He was credited as ""starring Tom Hardy & Tom Hardy"" for *Legend*, and [deserved that dual billing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdZlcF6uJt4).&&He is that bloody good isn't he?&&That movie is a testament to his acting ability. &&Don't forget Separation Anxiety too!&&[He had those powers in Marvel Heroes \(R.i.P\) as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FIjUNDH9Q)&&Lol i dont know i clearly remember it was quite popular when it released.&&Prototype and prototype 2 were fantastic games, I’m shocked they never made any further sequels.&&Prototype was a very popular game when it came out with nearly no staying power. 

Prototype 2 tried to capitalize on the success of a game that not many people remembered very well, and was horribly optimized and DRM ridden iirc. On PC at least. The console version was very well received from what I remember. 

The first one though was generally well received but super forgettable. The only thing memorable about that game is the gore and the the fact you had weird mutant super powers. 

Edit: The studio also had large lay-offs post Prototype 2, and activision said that the game didn't find a broad commercial audience, basically saying it wasn't financially worth it. &&Was Spider-Man in that line? &&Bitch I'm a Hopeman.&&[deleted]&&*flips the bird*

I've always just assumed that it was somewhat regulated. My bad.&&My dude, he was in it..... just couldn't see him.&&Especially because they're having Eddie find the symbiote first.

Now he's alone.&&Man I loved that game&&Yeah, prototype and infamous was the shit!&&Iirc the studio went under. 

Ninja edit: Nope Wiki says they're still around, but had some large lay-offs post Prototype 2. 

Apparently activision didn't deem it financially viable to make a third because 2 wasn't as successful as hoped or something. At least that's what the wiki page alludes to. &&Yeah but he didn't do much. Got the news that Venom was in San Francisco, went out there to take him down, realized Venom was doing good, helped him take down the other Life Foundation symbiotes, then fucked off back to New York. He wasn't necessary in the story, pretty easy to cut him out.

There was a lot of dumb shit in that story but I'm assuming what they're taking from it is Venom is the original symbiote that bonded to Eddie organically and the Life Foundation took symbiote samples and mutated them and forced them to bind to unwilling hosts to make soldiers (as always) and things go horribly wrong and the hosts have no relationship with their symbiotes so Venom has to fuck their shit up. You can get the gist of it from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_Lethal_Protector), the comics themselves aren't a great read but having read them I can see how it definitely lends itself to being easily adaptable into a good movie.&&Aren't your parents dead?&&He's going to have a giant V for VAIO.&&Calm down now, there's no need for that language.&&Just give it to her, it makes it easier. &&Soooonnny.

Pack it up, boys. Let's go home.&&It is still so fucking bad. If anyone has not seen it, watching the Funhaus group watching all three of them should say enough about this person. This movie is going to blow due to writing, CGI (where was it in the first trailer?) and weird lines and acting. Tom Hardy seems to be the best thing about this movie at this time. &&Sony exec: IT ROLLS OFF THE TOUNGE!&&I don’t know... that transformation looks like the motorcycle scenes conclusion which feels like it’s earlier in the film. Like when Eddie first realizes he’s got this other half driving the car? Could be wrong though &&Embrace your inner rapist&&Yes I love that scene. And the fact that Charlie is passionate enough about it that he's mouthing the words to it lol...&&""Ohhhhhh shit! Look at that door, dude. See that door there? The one marked ""Pirate""? You think a pirate lives in there?""&&""embrace your poison""&&They need ""hero"" somewhere in the marketing otherwise people (the average moviegoers not Marvel fans) will think it's a horror flick. &&One day my dad said ""Bobby you're 17, it’s time to throw childish things aside"" and I said ""OK Pop"", but he didn't really say that, he said ""Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job"". &&Which is weird that they're writing him as a wise-guy reporter that says dumb shit like that.&&I can't say I've ever remembered Eddy Brock being anything BUT slow and beefy in the comics. At the very least since he originally gained and lost and gained the suit back, he's always had the ""Sort of slow on the uptake but just a mountain of muscle"" persona going on. He has his moments here and there but that's generally how he's perceived with the suit doing most of the thinking for him.

Edit - It's honestly probably why he was always written as a bad reporter as well to be honest.&&Somehow the mental image of that scene happening and some guy just getting up and walking out has me fucking dying&&It’s also why Venom has Spider-Man’s powers. Because Peter bonded first.&&Sony are the Hutts.&&To be fair, the script for The Thing (remake) wasn’t the bad part but more of studio interference and the practical effects being replaced with CGI. &&Seriously?

When you’re thinking: „Why does it look like this now? Normally it looks like that“, that means you’re consciously thinking of the regular logo design. That’s something you’re probably less likely to do when you see the unaltered version. 

Obviously, this only works as long as the normal logo really is the norm. If too many films use these effects, the logo just becomes random and the change doesn’t have an element of surprise anymore. &&I have also heard that logos are a big deal in advertising.&&I remember saying (under my breath) in the theater: ""What is this, 1999?"" and then the text popped up: ""1999.""&&I actually really liked that opening.

In fact, the whole script is like a perfectly compressed diamond. It took the Wachowskis five years to complete & refine their script. Every scene serves a purpose. The opening is doing double or triple duty in this regard.

To summarize, the movie's world has the following ""power levels"":

1. Ordinary schmoes who don't realize they're in the Matrix
2. Cops
3. Redpills (like Morpheus & Trinity)
4. Agents
5. ""The One""

Every action scene in the movie obeys these rules, throughout, from beginning to end. This is very important, there's no scene in the film where Neo gives Morpheus & Trinity some kind of Braveheart pep talk and then all of a sudden they're able to kick the Agents' asses together. Morpheus and Trinity are still running from the Agents at the end of the movie. Everyone is static, Neo is the one who changes and grows. Every single action scene Neo is involved in (from the sneaking-through-the-office scene where he fails his nerve & gets caught by the cops, to the Dojo scene where he fights Morpheus but then fails the jump) is illustrating Neo growing step by step. A really good example of this is when Neo barely beats Smith in the subway but then has to run anyway because Smith just occupied a new body. It isn't until Neo is truly the One and sees the code that he can effortlessly defeat infinite Smiths.

The reason the opening is so great is because it compactly illustrates the different tiers of power that the movie will need you to understand in order to tell the story. First time viewer: ""Wow she kicked those cops' asses, wait she can leap roofs is she some kind of superhuman? WAIT WHAT the Agent jumped too? Wow she's scared of those guys... wait where the fuck did she go? Why isn't she in the phone booth rubble?"" 

Immediately you understand Normal People << Trinity <<< Agents. The opening serves ""double duty"" in that it also sets up the mystery of The Matrix by having Trinity escape the phone booth in a way that's totally unclear to the viewer until half an hour later in the movie.

All of this is done with some very well shot & choreographed ACTION and almost no dialogue.

If this were some kind of Milla Jovovich / Paul WS Anderson trash movie it would open with a 4 minute monologue about how robots took over the world and now brave heroes organize in the sewers to fight back. &&[deleted]&&“This is extremely dangerous to our democracy “&&""...removing the head, or destroying the brain.""&&""Oh honey, don't forget your breakfast on your way out!""

Edit: Don't get the downvotes... [that's literally the first line Cypher speaks after those words appear on the screen.](https://youtu.be/pqqEriE0ogc?t=51s)&&The Matrix (and yes even its sequels) are ingeniously plotted and planned out. While at one level, there is the construct of what you said: the brilliant storytelling choices. But the whole movie trilogy operates also on a metaphorical inner level.

The Matrix is Mind, or to be more precise: the imagination, the world of images. Imagination is a blessing and a curse. It creates comforting illusions but also births fear within us. The Wachowskis stated that they see movies themseves as Matrices and wanted to further drive this point home thorugh the film.

The illusory nature of our own imagination keeps us trapped in a system of control created by ourselves. The residual self image is the Ego created by the Matrix to give us a contructed but false sense of self. These RSIs can be infiltrated by the personification of Ego and false self themselves: the agents, men who conform solely to their programming and identities. They serve to spread fear in the mind through false narratives of authority and control.

When Neo awakens to the Real World, he sees the Body. It is decayed and malnourished, nearly dead. The world is unconscious literally and metaphorically but through this realisation, Neo is shown how to connect mind and body and awaken to the ultimate truth. 

 To go further, we are shown two direct colours: blue and green: Body and Mind. In the third film we are show a new colour: gold which is spirit and flows through all things machine. But that's another discussion.

The machines in the Real world represent mechanical thought patterns. They operate simply to exert control over free choice as represented by humans.  It is this mechanical thought that has created the prison of the Matrix within our minds. Though they were intially good, they became negative thought patterns through repeated abuse and so The Matrix was born within and everyone became a slave to it.

So how does Neo free himself? Through true love's first kiss, a biological physical reaction that can only occur between two people with exceptional emotional chemistry, that transcends the mind's reality and destroys Neo's Ego (Smith), allowing his true self to arise within. This is why we see Neo literally blow up Smith from within.

But also beyond this, on a spiritual level, Trinity is called Trinity for a reason, she bestows the Holy spirit upon Neo, allowing him to be born again as his true self, while the Father (Morpheus) watches on.

 Neo, having overcome the world of images and seeing its falseness, now has complete freedom from mind made contructs and thus his fears, to the point he can fly and fully explore the possibilities of imagination.

Worked wonders in Donnie Darko and that Gears of War trailer. &&It's a Tears for Fears song from 1983. The thing is, the original is only upbeat stylistically. The lyrics, as everyone knows, are incredibly dark. This gives the original a sarcastic and cynical tone and a layer of cognitive dissonance that the Gary Jules cover version everyone knows from Donnie Darko totally lacks. The cover is a one-dimensional sad song. It works for the movie and has a nice sound, but I'll always prefer the original.&&Wait...I'm confused. Mad World *is* a medium-tempo, melancholic song from the early 80s. As far as I know, it's an original song, not a cover.

Edit: Okay, I'm feeling old, I just realized that when people in this thread are talking about Mad World, they're not talking about the Tears for Fears song, they're talking about a cover, and the 1982 medium-tempo melancholic Tears for Fears version *is* the ""upbeat popular song from the 90s or 80s.""&&They need to recreate the logo morph into the blimp from the 90s animated series. &&Ben affleck's batman is pretty much that.&&""Do you like our satsuma?""&&Or banging holograms overlayed on real women.

In fact, this [quora answer](https://sockrotation.com/2013/07/26/colour-and-meaning-in-the-matrix-universe/) speaks to precisely one of the major themes in your comment regarding the colors used in the Matrix.

Edit: I'm partly wrong. The doctor slipping was apparently added to scenes from the original story that [was not working and needed to be saved](http://ew.com/article/2013/06/22/world-war-z-ending-sequels/), apparently the scene after in Jerusalem was part of the original screenplay.  
I think I found an editing ""boop"".  
Notice in Jerusalem they never mention the doctor at all and in the immediate scene after he is in flashbacks when Pitt figures out the illnesses?  
I'm guessing because they needed the doctor as an explanation for the terminal illnesses, they added him to scenes that are easier to edit.  
But because the Jerusalem scene was too expensive and difficult to edit him into, they just killed him off before it. (The scene he dies in, they only talk to him and about him for all of 15 seconds, probably reshoot scenes and after that it's probably the original film scenes where he never existed).  
They did a really good job editing the doctor in... Sucks they couldn't find a way to keep him for after Jerusalem. &&Or how about Pitt's character having his fucking cellphone ringtone on while doing a covert ops mission in the night?

It pisses me off every time I hear it. 

Buuuuuuuuuurrrrrrr......

I feel like they want me to feel something when I hear that, and it does the opposite. I feel nothing. &&Specifically on Exact Release Date&&This film is not yet rated (since it's undergoing frantic rewrites and reshoots.)&&Yeah I'm not interested in another Hollywood whitewashed version of a classic story.

I'll pass.&&It's actually hilarious watching that and remembering that trailers have always been similar to one another, but they go through their own phases.

\*throws giant Hello Kitty Pez dispenser*&&You say that like it's some sort of dark revelation. Being an artist means using your medium to evoke a reaction in people. In order to do that you need to understand how people think. All art is applied psychology, and it always has been. &&But the trailer was not for a real movie!  It didn't even have things in it!  It was just placeholders for those things!&&>when I was a kid called books.

Your books were laced with sound effects, music, and voice overs?

It has nothing to do with ""playing a trailer in your brain."" It was a trailer without visuals but (*surprise*!)* It's all about the sound - visuals don't convey emotional very well on their own. Two scenes can play out with different songs/sound effects and the emotion of the scene will change.

Trailers tend to make cringe. It basically makes me feel like my entire life is some weird parody when I'm sitting there watching them. It makes my skin crawl. 

But I'm kind of retarded I guess &&Not exactly the same, but your comment reminded me of this movie a lot:
https://youtu.be/EiCwrjV06fI&&Ichi The Killer and I Saw The Devil are two fucking awesome movies to get you into horrible atrocities on the human body, moreso Ichi, Devil is just the greatest revenge flick ever made.&&Zzzzzzing!!&&I feel like the sort of low-grade version in the song comes off with more of a cutesy, ""spoil me"" kind of vibe that seems less likely to make people uncomfortable.

The bigger issue is how the song seems to be primarily satirical. I feel like it's actually mocking more of a superficial, materialistic, and decidedly non-BDSM sugar daddy/gold digger-ish relationship. The singer is saying that she's happy to be nothing but an airheaded bimbo and do anything you want as long as she's provided with material comforts. With this being presented as  an unrealistic fantasy for *both* of them. Barbie (the actual doll) is fundamentally complicit in this both as a reference point and as a model of a ""plastic"" and unrealistic depiction of femininity, relationships, and consumer culture. The light, poppy tone of the music is ironic and reflective of the general superficiality of it all.

There are several possible interpretations. Maybe it's fully-informed and kinky (even if the authors don't realize that). Maybe it's a scathing work of satire. Maybe it's just a fun pop song about wanting nothing more than to wear cute clothes, fuck, and party. It's still catchy.&&In my opinion, pretty much all of the trailers from Halo 2 until Reach are the best trailers in gaming history.

This [ODST trailer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjamhIPVvnI) and this [entire Halo 3 ad campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GX5Kh1f5ksY) are probably the peaks though. There's something about the realness and genuine emotion in the acting and cinematography that just really drives home how desperate the position of the humans is in those games. We were genuinely facing extinction until John-117, Master Chief, accomplished the insane feats of heroism that you pull off in the games.

In Gears 3, Dom had grown to be his favorite character in any game besides Master Chief.

Edit: Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time, some people are thinking I’m talking down on it. Just saying Cameron’s take would have been interesting too.&&Everyone is acting like this would have been terrible. I just imagine this run:

(1984) The Terminator 

(1986) Aliens

(1989) The Abyss

(1991) Terminator 2

and then

(1993) Jurassic Park

The run up to Jurassic Park would have been some of the most fantastic sci-fi/sci-fi horror/sci-fi action ever put on film. I have all the faith in the world that he would have pulled off Jurassic Park masterfully.

One on the agreements that was made by Crichton was he would sell to Spielberg only if he directed.&&I love Cameron's movies but I agree with him, he would not have been the right fit for this one.

Kids love dinosaurs. I remember loving them as a kid. And it's that sentimental touch and appreciation for the dinosaurs that I feel helps enhance the original Jurassic Park.

None of the sequels have had that vibe. They only present the dinos like Godzilla or monsters. Jurassic World attempted with the raptors but it was overkill. &&Personally, I'd take a James Cameron sequel to Jurassic World over 7 more Avatar movies any day

The game is...over.""&&I love Spielberg's vision, but I don't think this would have sucked. We consider Jurassic Park this marvel of special effects, suspense, and storytelling. This is the version we were given and fell in love with. James Cameron would have done this justice. If he had made the movie, that's the movie we would have loved too. If the shoe was on the other foot, we would be saying that Spielberg would have turned it into some shitty kid's adventure film. Comparing it to ET and Goonies. &&I'm I the only one who thinks the original JP had an Aliens vibe to it anyway?&&The dinosaurs would've been fucking monsters had Cameron made the original JP in his vision. 

The newer movies with Chris Pratt certainly seem to be taking that direction, which i like, considering that they technically are monsters if Dr. Wong was to be believed from the last movie.&&Spielberg...uh...finds a way. &&Why doesn’t Cameron still make that film but title it something different?&&I'm glad Spielberg did it. Dinosaurs deserve the wonder that Spielberg brought, not a Crichton or Aliens style horror feel. We needed the joyful moments with the apatosauruses.&&He also pitched the sequel to ‘Alien’ by writing 

#Alien$ 

On a whiteboard. &&James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron. James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron.&&I would have loved to see Mouldoon fight a T-REX in a power loader. &&I don't want 'Aliens with Dinosaurs'. I want *Jurassic Park with Aliens*.&&I feel his would have been too adult and would have robbed generations of kids from their first borderline horror movie.&&James Cameron's Jurassic Park would have started Ellie, she would have had Grant's arch of learning to love kids, the military would have come in at some point, Hammond would have been the big bad. I'm just guessing because, I like Cameron don't get me wrong  but metaernity as strength, corporate bad guys, and military forces are the three pillars of a Cameron film. &&Some parts of Jurassic World did kinda remind me of Aliens, specifically when they send that security team out to take care of the Indominus Rex and they all get picked off while observers watch the team's personal cameras. I thought the sequel could have gone in that direction, with a shady project to breed super raptors, and a military team + Chris Pratt getting trapped in some high tech facility fighting for their lives.  &&I'm glad he didnt, personally. Jeff Goldblum wouldn't of been casted.&&Interesting. I loved the book, and Spielberg's interpretation of the book. Always wondered how it would have been as a horror film rather than sci-fi thriller. Then again, Spielberg's version has so many memorable moments. &&Thank God Spielberg got the rights first. 

&&""He described his version as *Aliens* with ______"" seems like an excellent template for jokes about the plots of movies.

He described *Titanic* as *Aliens* with icebergs. He described *Terminator* as *Aliens* with robots.

Jordan Peele described *Get Out* as his version of *Aliens* with suburbanite white people.

Iñárritu described *The Revenant* as his version of *Aliens* with bears.&&Actually, I would rather have seen Cameron do the movie adaptation for Sphere.&&Goddamn he would've been fucking amazing with Congo. That movie has such a great premise, a pretty good book, but the movie is flaming vomit.&&Which would have been a mistake, imo. Big part of why JP 1 works so well is that you feel the excitement and enthusiasm of the ultimately misguided humans in charge. You can relate because, hey,  it's fucking *dinosaurs* and they're so cool! His heart is in the right place but he's too naive/confident to see the enormity of what he's meddling with. He's humanity in a nutshell.&&probably would have spared some expense too...&&I actually finished the book two days ago and that was one of the most jarring character differences between book and movie. I HATED him by the end of the book. Towards the end when he's sitting in the room with Malcolm and the vet and he's thinking about how he'll do it again and blaming Muldoon and Arnold I was praying he would get eaten. So glad he did.

Oh and Lex was fucking awful.

Edit: To anybody whining about a spoiler I don't care, the book is 28 years old, after that long you don't get to complain.&&I much prefer the Spielberg/Attenborough John Hammond though to be honest.&&*Miracle on 34th Street* John Hammond.&&The first book has way too many characters and scenes to fit into a 2 or 2.5 hour movie. I think Michael Crichton did a pretty good job adapting it to a screen play.


I think the real crime is how badly The Lost World was butchered. That screenplay is like 90% different from the book. However, I could argue that movie isn't that bad UNTIL the girl does the gymnastics move and kills that raptor. That's when the movie goes off the rails into Steven Spielbergs whatever mode.&&Cameron should just make a Dino Crisis movie. Then everyone gets what they want!&&I mean, the author himself did the screenplay and deemed the changes necessary. Some parts of the book were kind of meh and definitely shouldn't be there (except maybe not kill the lawyer who was a pretty alright dude and kill the guy who actually deserved it)&&>Spielberg obviously did it justice too

A bit of an understatement.&&I would like that in general. Not remakes, but 2 movies made at the same time about the same story, just to see how they diverge&&Man, its such a shame that Cameron doesn't work more. He has a real skill for grounding scifi in the real world and making it believable. I would be happy if he did a few failed movies if he just worked a bit more consistently.&&It would have been amazing, no doubt.&&[deleted]&&People like to shit on Cameron because of Avatar and Titanic but the dude is one of the best directors of the last 30 years. Infact if there is one director other than Spielberg who could have pulled it off, it's Cameron.&&A xenomorph hatched from a *T. rex* or a raptor would be terrifying.&&With Bill Paxton as Dr. Malcolm.

^(RIP Hudson)&&Arnold is Muldoon. He's now a much bigger character and he fights several raptors with his bare hands. &&Okay

right

but

picture this

buddy cop movie

with the og Muldoon and Michael Beihn

they have wacky adventures and hunt dinosaurs

not sure why I felt the need to make this comment in greentext format but what's done is done&&Biehn would be Dr Grant, Paxton would be Dr Malcolm and Weaver would be Dr Sattler.

Shit that would be fucking awesome.&&I was gonna say someone needs to tell Jim about Turok&&The original Jurassic Park is a movie about people that uses dinosaurs to explore humanity’s role in the world. Every sequel is about CGI dinosaurs with some people in it. &&I don't know, I guess it depends on his mindset for the film. If ""*Aliens* with Dinos"" was his mindset, I could see how this would *not* be a good fit for him. What I loved about Spielberg's *JP* was the wonder and amazement you felt in seeing the dinosaurs for the first time. I'll be goddamned if I still don't get a little teary eyed when they first see the Brontosaurus(?) on the island and John William's score ramps up and I just feel like a little kid again, amazed at the magic of feeling what its like to see, what felt like, a *real* dinosaur on screen. 

If Cameron could've had the same mindset for *JP* that he had in *Titantic*, giving us the same sense of wonder and beauty of the ship and the scope of the tragedy, I think he could've nailed it! 

Shit would probably look pretty fucking dope in James Cameron 3D too! lol

Edit - Changed James Horner to John Williams because I fucked it up... royally. &&IDK man, Avatar is like his calling and passion project, something he dreamt about doing for decades. I really wanna see him running wild with his imagination than adapt an existing story.&&""I like to uhhh.. keep this theory for uhh.. close encounters"" &&It was a bit more action/adventure, but I thought it had a good share of suspense and horror.&&I'm glad they brought back BD Wong. He actually does play a pretty good villain. &&Here's the thing; Spielberg shows them as magnificent creatures of wonder that none of us will ever get to experience for real. Cameron would show them as a force of fucking nature that was once the dominant species of the planet and would make us feel glad that we didn't exist during that time.&&""Billy and The Clonasaurus""&&And in my book it's still one of the best sequels ever.&&So Space Jam. &&thank god you didn't have Ripley riding a motorcycle around with a pack of xenomorphs&&I’m definitely happy with the film we got but I’d definitely be interested in seeing Cameron's version. &&No kidding. Jurassic Park is one hell of a movie and expands on what SS did 20 years prior with Jaws, taking all these elements which, in any other movie, would not play nice with each other and making them work extraordinarily well.&&Sounds like he only has one idea.&&That would have been a perfect fit, but he already kind of did *Sphere*. It was called, *The Abyss*. &&Or Andromeda Strain (which is still my favorite Crichton novel).&&The movie features Tim Curry doing a terrible Borat impression the whole time. It's amazing. &&I will forever defend this movie for three reasons:

Bruce Campbell, Delroy Lindo and Tim Curry.&&i own it ... fight me.&&But, hear me out, we wouldn't have gotten the best line in cinema history.&&you ever see the interview with Bruce Campbell talking about getting the pitch for the roll.
It's like, ok, its based off the book written by the guy that wrote Jurassic Park. It's being produced by Kathleen Kennedy. It has an all star cast and big budget. Interested? 
Congratulations you just made Congo! &&>Mr. Homolka, stop eating my sesame cake...

For that scene alone, I'm glad he didn't make *Congo*.&&I sincerely hope that you’re not counting Tim Curry as flaming vomit, he showed a masterclass of acting in that film.

&&""Stop eating my SESAME CAKE!""&&K but I love Congo though&&> movie is flaming vomit

someone missed the scene where they were shooting a laser at gorillas in a flaming volcano city&&I’ve heard it’s hilarious &&His flea circus monologue is one the best moments of the film and gives you a glimpse of the man who bit off more than he can chew.&&The music matches the excitement. You would need a totally different score if Hammond is different. &&Yeah, and really when you look at it, it is there a bit anyway, its just not so hamfisted as it could have been.  That makes Hammond a better developed character.  Most ""evil"" people arent totally evil from their own perspective, and its totally appropriate that we see Hammond from his own perspective.  It all goes to shit anyway so the point is there.   Hell even the bad guy in Jurassic park is actually this pitiful, pathetic man, not some ham fisted comic book villain like in the Jurassic World movies.  Hammond's greed is still there, his blindness to the repercussions of his actions.  In the end, he isn't really expressing regret over all the people that died as much as he is backing off the release date... Kind of like how Zuckerberg is reacting to data abuses--he just doesn't fully get it, even in public.  Or how leadership behind recent self-driving car fatalities are acting.&&Just imagine him as Burke from Aliens, it would've been an interesting dynamic. &&[deleted]&&>You can relate, because, hey,  it's fucking *dinosours* 

Tart-ranou-sour-us Rex
&&That was my one gripe about westworld, we didn't see enough of the park under normal circumstances to fall in love with it the way we do in jp. I think it's a tougher sell because we instantly connect with the wonder of nature, even more with ""nature unattainable"" of dinosaurs, and WW is derived from experiences, and people driven, which is less dramatic. We see Dr. Ford's wistful love affair with it, but not quite our own before the horns start to sound and the walls start to come down. &&He gets eaten in the book? That's satisfying.&&Lex was a realistic child in the book which I found interesting, but yeah she was annoying as he'll. &&Not to mention to flip flop of age between the boy and girl. I was like, whyyyyyy the change in dynamic??

Dr. Grant and the kids attempting to get to the boat, the Rex chasing them down, swimming after them, and then chasing them down the river was one of my favorite parts of the book.  &&Spoiler! We’ve got spoiler here!!!

See? Nobody cares.&&The entirety of the jurassic park post from last week in /r/books was mostly about the book differences and how shitty lex was lol. For real though that was the most accurate depiction of a child I've seen in the worst place ever&&>I actually finished the book two days ago

>To anybody whining about a spoiler I don't care, the book is 28 years old&&Spielberg's take had his trademark childhood wonder with the John Williams score, story arc of Grant and the kids, happy ending, etc. Cameron would have made more of a technical fiction with a focus on the ethical issues of mankind manipulating great technology with an emphasis on the bare survival of the characters. Spielberg's version worked, but I would have loved to see Cameron make Jurassic Park look more like The Abyss. 

Spielberg's version probably made more money with the family friendly appeal and merchandising opportunities. Cameron has always made distinctly adult movies. &&Totally agree, I just think Cameron’s tone would have been a lot more like the book, like when they first get to the island they already know shit has gone horribly wrong even before they check it out because Grant sees the added safety bars on his windows that weren’t in the original blueprints. TLW book was really butchered and I’m not a huge fan of the movie although the first half is still pretty good and I actually liked the T Rex in San Diego scenes.&&Not killing off Hammond in the first one kinda changed a major part of TLW's premise from the book.&&I'd be ok with a more realistic version where the raptor grabs her and rips her apart in front of the family. &&> That screenplay is like 90% different from the book. 

It's not like the book was all that great TBH. Crichton obviously only wrote it because someone paid him a ton of money to do it, and he obviously wrote it with an eye towards being a sequel to the movie and being easily adaptable into a movie. He threw a dead character onto an unmentioned island mostly so he could feature dinosaurs that weren't on the first island, and offered half baked reasons for it because he couldn't just straight up say ""casting and merchandising"". Which makes it weirder they didn't use more of the book in the movie, but I really don't think anything that great was lost. A cool Carnotaurus scene, that's pretty much it.

IMHO the crime when it comes to this series is that *Crichton set up an amazing sequel at the end of the book and then didn't use that at all*. Jurassic Park (the book) opened with the fact that procompsognathus had gotten off the island and ended with clear evidence that Raptors had too. The sequel should have centered around hunting raptors in the Costa Rican jungle and trying to figure out what to do with the ones on isla nublar. I still want to read *that* sequel.

Meanwhile if you're writing a straight sequel to the movie, then Jurassic World was a much more logical place to go. There's no way anything that happened in the first movie would have stopped a corporation with billions to throw around from opening the park anyway more or less as it was originally conceived.&&I really wished a true-to-book version of The Lost World would be made. IMO it was better than Jurassic Park (the book).&&Both movies took a lot of liberties with the children's characters. In JP Tim was originally the one good with computers while Lex was a whiny spoiled brat who kept getting them into trouble.  In Lost World, they took the male child out altogether. The only thing they kept from him was his race, switching Ian's daughter to being black.  I remember something about the gymnastics from the book, but I think it was something along the lines of ""dad never comes to my gymnastics tournaments.""&&Was it really that bad that it tilts the whole movie for you into the water? And by a similar vein lotta people hold the dream raptor in JP3 in that regard. 

I totally understand: they're quite ridiculous for the movies they were in. But these are sequences which breeze through in less than a minute, and yet some people treat them as if they were the greatest offenders or something. Maybe they were just the straws that broke the camel's back, but I do find it ridiculous that some people are holding it over their heads every time the subject of the sequels comes up. At least they're not glaring plot holes that cause the movie to fall apart when brought to scrutiny.&&I just want a proper sequel to the games. If they could do a reboot like they did with RE7 I would fucking pre-order that shit 12 times over. &&Well, that's definetly Aliens with dinosaurs so...lol.  &&My understanding was that he only wrote the book in order to get to write the movie. The two were very much parts of the same project.&&So Armageddon and Deep Impact, or Antz and A Bug's Life?&&What do you mean? You don't want Avatar 2, 3, 4 and 5?&&the problem is that his work is great because he takes his time. Steven, regrettably, pumps out a lot of junk for each winner.&&Well you're in luck my friend, because you can look forward to 4 more Avatar movies from now until 2025! /s&&Fuck that!

His version would have been great too, but for other reasons. &&I could definitely see Cameron get a little closer to the source material. Muldoon firing rocket launchers at a T-Rex definitely feels right up his alley. Hell, I love the movie but he easily could have had the better version.&&Cameron said he wanted to treat the dinosaurs like monsters. 

Which I think is the wrong approach. That approach misses the elements of dinosaurs that have captured our collective attention.

They were just this group of hyper intelligent killing machines that they kept around.

Just one note that self-driving cars are still much safer than human piloted ones. To me this is a knee jerk reverse Jurassic Park situation. Even with two fatalities on the books, Teslas on autopilot are much safer than humans on a per-mile-driven basis. Don’t know as much about the Uber one but I’d guess it’s got a similar track record since this is its first fatality. &&Woah pump the brakes there on the car comparisons.

He falls down a hill a bit, just enough to immobilize his old body and bad knee, then the little dinosaurs from the movie sequel start nibbling on him.

I read the book decades ago and that's the one part I remember clearly, because in the book the old man and the lawyer are switched. The old man is an asshole and lawyer is actually a badass saving the kids like Malcolm in the movie. &&Yep, Hammond got Dieter Stark'd before Dieter Stark was ever a character in the franchise.&&The movie is a pretty weird adaptation, in that the actual scenes and story are pretty close, but the characters are exact opposites and the ones that live die and the ones that die live.

Steven, regrettably, pumps out a lot of junk for each winner.

He makes more films, so he has a greater spectrum of ups and downs. Not to mention, I think Spielberg has more range than Cameron in terms of stories and direction (I can't see Cameron doing something like Schindler's List to the Adventures of Tintin to Lincoln to Bridge of Spies). 

I am also not a fan of Avatar on anything than technical appreciation, and I REALLY didn't like Titanic. Not to take away from Cameron as his first two Terminator films and Aliens are fantastic. &&I wouldn't say Spielberg pumps out junk.  Even Spielberg by the numbers, like The Post, is still a very well made movie.&&that’s fuckin’ dope&&Unzips pants....&&it's literally just her holding her arms up like a t-rex and making dinosaur noises.

She still wins the Oscar, because she's so good at it.&&And THIS is podracing!&&It's insane how much better the effects for the original look than Jurassic World's. The CGI industry for major studios is just in an awful place right now. It's *capable* of great things but it all just gets handed off and sped up for cost/efficiency and out churns more generic, worse-looking junk.

Makes me wanna go back and watch all those featurettes on the LOTR extended edition DVDs again.&&That's not really why the effects hold up. The effects hold up because the special effects team had very little faith in how convincing the CGI would be. That's why they go above and beyond to convince you the dinosaurs were real.

There's a ton of CGI in Jurassic Park but for every single shot they carefully considered what would look better. CGI or practical. Broadly speaking, practical effects worked best for close ups where the texture and the real world presence of the suit or animatronic interacting with the real world is emphasised.

CGI worked best for full body shots where the animals moved, walked, turned, jumped etc. because CGI created far more fluid and convincing motion than suits, mechatronics and the discarded stop motion did.

But much more importantly, they spend almost half the movie convincing you the dinosaurs are real before the action starts.

It's stuff like...

* Showing the brachiosauruses interact with the world by pulling leaves from branches
* Seeing Grant lie on top of the sick triceratops while it breathes
* Having the rex eat a goat and drop a leg on the sunroof
* Seeing the little rex paw pull on the wire fence
* The vibrations in the glass of water
* The way the rex sinks into the mud and leaves a foot print that fills with water
* The way the rex's pupils react to the flashlight
* The way the rex blows off Grant's hat

Hell, the entire rex escape is in darkness and rain to blend the composited footage better.

Stan Winston once said that none of the effects (CGI or practical) looked anywhere near as good in broad daylight when you see the rex kill and eat the gallimumus (or any other part of the movie afterwards.

But it doesn't matter. At that point in the movie people have been thoroughly convinced that the dinosaurs are real forces in the world of this movie.

Practical effects aren't inherently better than CGI. The best result is still achieved by combining both. But what set JP's creatures well above any other movie is how much effort was put into making them convincing parts of their world instead of just popping them out when needed.&&There's an element of truth to that, but you can't forget that the first Jurassic Park did in fact use CGI, it just used it to blend the practical effects into the scenes, and not as a replacement for practical effects.&&*The Lost World* and *Jurassic Park III* had practical dinosaurs as well. 

So did *Jurassic World*, for that matter. But, for some reason that is beyond comprehension, they painted over a lot of the animatronics with CG. It's most notable with the raptors.&&> including an animatronic T-Rex that took like half the budget for the movie.

AND YET, Jurassic Park to this day is still a gold standard of how to properly use CGI and combine it with practical effects. CGI is a tool, not a crutch. Please don't contribute to its demonization.

[Check out a great video by Freddie Wong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24)&&I know you are not saying CGI is all bad, but I wanted to provide a link to [an interesting video on CGI's place in the industry.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24)

It's overall a positive, except when used in the wrong places.&&Yeah, definitely this. The thing that gives the movie an element of wonder are the scenes where we get to see friendly dinosaurs. The Brontosaurus scene, for example, is something the makes one enjoy the setting. Actually hell, the whole first act before shit goes bad makes the film. The cool cars, the general anticipation of the main characters. &&I think people are being too quick to make hard rules about this. Dinosaurs can be portrayed in any way people want. It's cool that we have Spielberg's dinosaurs but there's definitely still room for a movie like Cameron's version that uses them more like horror movie monsters.&&The abyss movie was better than the movie sphere. Sure. But the book was phenomenal and was far better than the abyss.&&Ed Harris? He was great in that role. And although I can't recall the actors name, the military guy that got the bends I remember his face vividly. Especially the scene where he's slowly operating the chain pulley. A lot of great moments in that movie.&&Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio :)&&I loved it as a kid because you saw that lady’s boobs. &&Man I dont knwmow why but the sphere scared the shit out of me as a kid.

The 1 guy that ruins it for everyone else. &&The warden doesn't just live, Muldoon is the biggest badass in the book. When the fences go down, before the raptors are released, he leaves the bunker to hunt down the T-rex with nothing but a flask of whisky and a tranquilliser rifle.

When the raptors do get out, he doesn't skip a beat and switches out his weapon for a grenade launcher.&&What happened to the lawyer?&&And the reason he falls is because the kids are dicking around with with the computers and play sound clip of a T-Rex they use to scare other dinosaurs out of certain areas &&Also, didn't Nedry's fate turn out more gruesome as well? It's been years since I listened to the book on tape (actual tape) and I seem to remember him getting disemboweled and holding his own intestines before he died.&&Do the raptors and t rex team up with burt macklin you son of a bitch and fist bump and eat shawarma at the end?&&compies (AKA procompsognathus)&&I wish my saliva had an opioid effect.&&> Their saliva has an opioid-like effect

I saw Aliens four years before Jurassic Park came out. The 80s and early 90s were kinda weird like that. &&James Cameron isn't wrong. It's also fair that his take on the movie would have been a great film. &&I remember at the time news reports saying this movie wasn't suitable for kids. Too much blood and too scary. &&Haha how pissed would we have been 8 years old, amazing dinosaur movie, parents won't let us see it but that one kid whose parents smoke in the house gets to see it. I saw that movie in the theater with all my friends on my birthday, we got folders full of dinosaur facts and shit. Awesome&&I mean those are in line with Spielberg style. What Cameron's talking about would be more like aliens or maybe terminator. Not that those weren't money makers haha&&Neither of those films are 'R' rated.&&A giant monster rampaging through the city and Japanese tourists gaping in awe. What's not to like?&&Nah man it's got all the hunters, it's got the velociraptors in the grass, the scene where they have to be still while the TRex sniffs their pants hanging above them&&My favorite small detail was Jimmy Buffet saving his margaritas in JW.&&Babe and that other movie no one cares about&&I read an interesting observation that Avatar is the most successful film ever but its impact on pop culture is negligible. It's virtually never quoted or referenced.&&He left it wayy to long. Not only did the hype end 10 years ago, but everyone's completely fogotten about it.

He's left those sequels cooking on the burner way to long, we all got hungry and ordered takeout.&&But they will be in 4D! You will be able to smell them fucking this time.&&It's Jaaaaames Cameron, the bravest pioneeeeer!&&That's a different kind of movie. lol&&Hell yes!

I think the main reason that despite loving it by far the most as a kid ROTK is now my least favorite is because as Pellenor rolls around the CGI is just more and more obvious as time goes on.

As a kid if you'd asked me which battle was better between that and Helms deep I'd have scoffed 'ELEPHANTS'.

Now there's no question that Helms deep is the better filmed, acted and portrayed sequence. Seeing REAL water fall on REAL actors in REAL make up in REAL armor, I still believe they are Uruk-Hais. The fact that Jackson set it in the dark was also really clever. The moment where the ladder snaps and the uruks fall on top of each other STILL looks amazing because of the lighting choices, even though its a CGI sequence that's FIFTEEN years old, which in SFX years is an epoch.

The 'make a quick buck' mentality of studios means we're destined for a cycle of things looking fake but vivid for a couple of years and then as they're beat by better cgi just fake. The Hobbit is going to age sooo badly. It's such a shame.

 &&I thought many parts were pure CG... Like the T-Rex walking out of the padock at night, and the scene of chasing the gala.. galla... gallimimus.  

They just took the time to REALLY perfect the lighting. Which in various ""How it's made"" style interviews and specials they always said was a big deal.  &&Yeah, there's been some very good CGI. I can think of a lot of ""wrong places"" as well, though; namely Superman's upper lip.&&Those scenes stick with me as much as the T-Rex ones. When I had the Jurassic Park 'Build your own park' game as a kid, I think it was pretty telling that I made an entirely herbivorous park. I didn't care about the big, nasty t-rexes or little velociraptors. I just wanted a park full of friendly dinos to safari through.&&I always thought the story of Sphere was more mysterious than The Abyss. &&That adaptation was one of my biggest Crichton movie letdowns

Edit: oh wait I know which bit you mean now. I concur with your *Dun Dun Daa Daas*&&The best parts of them to me, is when they just are a character being a character and not (as of lately) blindly obviously trying to be the whole ""look at me, I'm a strong FEMALE protagonist."" Ripley and Sarah were just well written and compelling protagonists that happen to be female.&&This part is my favorite by far! I wish it was in the movie. 

Run program (numbers match) ""see look it's fine""
Then they run it to not cap off at the expected number (what a bunch of dopes) and they see they are so many more than there should be.

Queue....it was at this moment they knew....they fucked up.&&One of my favorite parts of the book was the graphs and statistical models that Crichton threw in. It made it seem like all of this was real and all the genetic science had actually taken place at some point &&He hides in a construction pipe and blasts one raptor in the face, only surviving the second raptor because he got far enough into the tube they can't bite his feet&&Also in the book the Asian genetic scientist (Dr Wu?) gets eaten alive and gutted by the raptors during the raptors siege of the hotel everyone is holed up in. In the movie he just gets on that last boat out and leaves &&That's pretty hardcore but I have to question his choice of appropriate weapon for dinosaur. &&Been a long time but I'm pretty sure the lawyer lives, along with the game warden.  Hammond & the geneticist die in fairly gruesome ways.  

Edit: for clarity, those are the differences.  Grant/kids/Nedry/etc have the same ultimate fate in both.&&Gennaro survives after decking a raptor in the *snout but dies between the book and The Lost World to dysentery in Mexico.

What the hell, Crichton.

Edit: Fuck Autocorrect.&&The lawyer, Gennaro, is a badass in the book. He's described as sort of a gym enthusiast and goes out of his way to protect people a number of times. Notable scenes involve him fighting off a raptor while unarmed and joining a drunk Muldoon on a high speed T-Rex chase while armed with a rocket launcher.&&He dies years later from dysentery I shit you not. &&The lawyer in the movie is actually a combination of two characters from book if I remember correctly.
Edit: a word&&It's crazy how different the movie and book are. Aside from a few core characters, almost everybody who lives in the movie dies in the book, and vice versa.&&Gennaro (yes, that's the lawyer's name) was a pretty cool character in the book and was nothing like what was portrayed in the movies. 

First of all, he's was a muscular dude. Let that sink in&&He's a god damn badass who works with Muldon to fight raptors WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER. the book is so good. Audible's version is great minus a few faults.&&_insert Palpatine here_

Ironic.&&Spoiler alert: Yes.&&In the book,  there is much more detail on the dinos. Compys are mostly scavengers, but they also have a very mild toxin they inject when biting prey. This makes the prey tired and weak,  and so they can overcome larger prey in numbers by biting things and darting away,  waiting for it to tire itself out. &&Oh no, Nedry still gets disemboweled like a motherfucker&&seriously, how lex didn't get the shit slapped out of her is beyond me. stupid kid doing something to risk everyone's life? fucking SLAP.&&Around 1/2 through the book by Michael Crichton is a scene where Nedry gets devoured. It is incredibly graphic, and is exactly what I would have expected from a hard ""R"" Jurassic Park&&For starters, B.D. Wong probably would've been disemboweled like he was in the book. Plus, on a production level, I can see early 90's Cameron making something on par with the Spielberg version. &&Me too.. At the same time I really appreciate Spielberg's version that I can show to my 8 year old with minimal ""oh shit don't watch this part!"" moments.&&If I had 'fuck you in the billions'. kind of money I'd love to grab like 5 top of the line directors, Speilberg, Cameron, Nolan, Guillermo and Peter Jackson for example and give them the same Blockbuster script, 250 million each and 2 years to each make their own movie of that script and see the results and compare the differences.

Would be amazing to see and film students would be studying the results forever.&&Imagine if instead of doing this new Jurassic world stuff they did a hard R remake of Jurassic Park with an appropriate great director?

Spielberg’s was. &&It really wasn't for kids at all. Really violent, scary, and gory. I'm still amazed at how many kids saw it, but then again, enough kids saw Robocop to warrant a cartoon series based on it.&&What about Athletic Girl kicking a raptor in the face?

That scene always has me laughing&&Raptors in the grass always gives me the chills to watch, very well done&&No strings attached and friends with benefits?&&It did literally bring about a whole boom of 3D. To say it had no impact because people don't quote it does everything beyond the dialogue a huge disservice.&&The problem with Avatar is that it's story was very generic and boring. The only reason the movie was successful was because of the groundbreaking special effects and 3D. So it's really more of a technical marvel then an entertainment marvel.&&But it's brought up 24/7 on this site even if it's just to say DAE NO CULTURAL VALUE anytime its mentioned. It had tons of cultural value when consider the impact it made on 3-d. The technology they created to create it etc. But you don't even have to dive that far deep to see it's impact. It's box office is the impact. So many people will remember that movie for the insane 3-d world it created. That is a lasting memory on a couple generations of movie goers, and then you get into the effects in the industry. There's a land in Disney world dedicated to it, and there are at least 2 sequels on the way. I don't see how any person who isn't just trying to get into the nO CUlTuRaL Value circle jerk can miss this. It's kind of hilarious to see it repeated ad nauseum&&Speak for yourself.

I was going for the helicopter approach when they see the island for the first time.

Also, I definitely recommend listening to the full 7-minute piece on YouTube or wherever. It's beautiful.&&The theme of motherhood is central in both movies. Sarah Connor transforms into a badass when she finds out she’s going to have a son that needs to learn how to fight to save humanity. In the extended version of Aliens, Ellen Ripley is a mother that learns that her daughter died while she was in hypersleep, and adopts Newt as a protector. The climax of Aliens is a battle between two queen mothers, both seeking revenge for their lost children. &&The fractal that is between chapters really kicked me towards science.

I put them all on my wall. I miss them.&&He went out there knowing they were there hunting someone else. I don't blame him for actually surviving.&&Grenade launchers are most effective against unprotected flesh and require less aiming than a conventional firearm.

So I guess yeah, they'd be pretty damn great at killing dinosaurs. And probably more reliable than trying to put a bullet in one.&&Hammond didn't want any weapons on the island. Muldoon had a locker with a rocket launcher and tranquilizers though.

And in the book, Nedry takes the jeep that Muldoon had put the rocket launcher into, causing him to have to track down how far Nedry got to find the jeep with the rockets in it&&Well, I definitely have to read this book now.

Edit: definitely&&Nedry gets disemboweled.&&And then the military bomb the entire island.&&They had to make the book more in line with the movie for The Lost World, hence Malcom coming back to life in the book. &&How in the world did he die of dysentery on a business trip? I don't care if it's in Mexico. Did he hike 5 miles into the desert to meet a client? 

&&Wasn't his character way more likable in the book? I read it last like 15 years ago, but I remember thinking he was basically another generally good guy main character alongside Grant.

&&He must have been a fan of playing Oregon Trail.&&This is the movie I want. &&And then they tell at him and treat him like a bitch when he doesn't want to go into the raptor nest. Like fuck you guys. I would like to point out, it's not as though they're firing the rocket launcher when the Rex is chasing them, they simply sedate it and it later falls asleep and bites it's own tongue, lol.&&He shit, I not.&&Yeah, he takes on all of the bad parts of Hammond. In the novel things are pretty much under control until Hammond starts manipulating people.

Ie. sure the storm happens and the fences go down but things are pretty contained. Grant is basically having his dream hiking vacation with the kids while the rest are safely in the bunker.

But when Hammond realises that the lysene contingency plan is going to kill all of his expensive dinosaur and set the park back years, he starts crying ""oh, why won't anyone think of the children, we have to get the park back up and running"". He basically manipulates people into leaving the bunker and rebooting the system.

And that leads to the raptors getting out and the real death and destruction starts.

Novel Hammond is a greedy son of a bitch that intentionally puts people in harms way to try and save his park. Movie Hammond is just disastrously naive. And they made him that way by shunting all his negative character traits to the lawyer.&&Seriously? [What the fuck does he want this time?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)&&""The dinosaur stared at him and then snapped its head in a single swift motion. Nedry felt something smack wetly against his chest. He looked down and saw a dripping glob of foam on his rain-soaked shirt. He touched it curiously, not comprehending. . . . It was spit. The dinosaur had spit on him.

It was creepy, he thought. He looked back at the dinosaur and saw the head snap again, and immediately felt another wet smack against his neck, just above the shirt collar. He wiped it away with his hand.

Jesus, it was disgusting. But the skin of his neck was already starting to tingle and burn. And his hand was tingling, too. It was almost like he had been touched with acid.

Nedry opened the car door, glancing back at the dinosaur to make sure it wasn't going to attack, and felt a sudden, excruciating pain in his eyes, stabbing like spikes into the back of his skull, and he squeezed his eyes shut and gasped with the intensity of it and threw up his hands to cover his eyes and felt the slippery foam trickling down both sides of his nose. Spit. The dinosaur had spit in his eyes.

Even as he realized it, the pain overwhelmed him, and he dropped to his knees, disoriented, wheezing. He collapsed onto his side, his cheek pressed to the wet ground, his breath coming in thin whistles through the constant, ever-screaming pain that caused flashing spots of light to appear behind his tightly shut eyelids.

The earth shook beneath him and Nedry knew the dinosaur was moving, he could hear its soft hooting cry, and despite the pain he forced his eyes open and still he saw nothing but flashing spots against black. Slowly the realization came to him. He was blind.

The hooting was louder as Nedry scrambled to his feet and staggered back against the side panel of the car, as a wave of nausea and dizziness swept over him. The dinosaur was close now, he could feel it coming close, he was dimly aware of its snorting breath.

But he couldn't see. He couldn't see anything, and his terror was extreme. He stretched out his hands, waving them wildly in the air to ward off the attack he knew was coming.

And then there was a new, searing pain, like a fiery knife in his belly, and Nedry stumbled, reaching blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery mass that was surprisingly warm, and with horror he suddenly knew he was holding his own intestines in his hands. The dinosaur had torn him open. His guts had fallen out.

Nedry fell to the ground and landed on something scaly and cold, it was the animal's foot, and then there was new pain on both sides of his head. The pain grew worse, and as he was lifted to his feet he knew the dinosaur had his head in its jaws, and the horror of that realization was followed by a final wish, that it would all be ended soon""&&I remember being in awe of that scene when I read the book back in sixth grade. All of us little boys were thrilled that a book could talk about someone holding their own warm intestines in their hands. &&I wrote a book report in the fourth grade about Crichton's Jurassic Park that ended up encouraging my fifth grade peer reviewer to read the book. Our teacher received phone calls from that student's parents because of the nightmares that scene gave her. &&Oh yeah, I've read the novel many times (as well as all of Crichton's other books, RIP). Adapting all the true horror elements from the novel into an R-rated film would have been amazing.

Of course, that will never happen now. But no one has the rights to ""dinosaur films"" so it makes me wonder, with the success of the JP series, why no other studio attempts to make a dinosaur movie. &&It's been a while since I read it, but doesn't Hammond get eaten in the end as well? &&I imagine that the feeling of James Cameron's JP would have been closer to the opening scene of JP, along with the Ellie creeping through the Compound to find the breakers with the Raptors, and the scenes with the mercenaries in the long grass in JP:LW. Those were very dark, Aliens like and would have probably been what the entire movie would be like.&&Chittering became one of my favorite words after reading that book. &&Yeah, but that wouldn't have made $1.6b+&&its easy to call it definitive when we grow up with spielberg's version. maybe if it was cameron's, the definitive would be scary, vicious, majestic creatures instead of large, wonderful, majestic creatures. what i'm trying to say is different directors' vision can define a concept very differently, regardless whether the definition is true or not. &&I think it would, but only because ""dinosaur movie"" isn't really a genre. Like, are there any dinosaur movies at all except for the Jurassic Park franchise? 

If Cameron had made it that would still be the only dinosaur movie most of us would be able to name.&&Jeff Goldblum's daughter who I guess is someone else's biological daughter but he got custody after the divorce?&&The Illusionist and The Prestige.&&FERNGULY IN SPACE MOTHERFUCKER

Only if we count wanting to try weird blue space cat sex. &&That's because it's dances with wolves... In space&&Sam Worthington is not a bad actor, but he's not doing the movie any favors in the memorable department either. He fits in too well that nothing about him stands out. &&So why wouldn't you want Cameron to do another amazing 3-D movie that has nothing to do with Avatar? If the technical aspects is what got you?&&> Jurassic Park is a perfectly example of how CGI should be done  

THIS has always been my point about CGI. I mean the only thing that REALLY sticks out for me watching JP now, on a 55"" screen is that you can see the ""jaggies"" in the CG at that resolution and scale.  

Even watching the Galli's jump on the log looks really good to this day.  

And yet in this day an age even Star Wars The LAst Jedit could not make 2/3rds of their CGI come close to looking real... Like some of it looks like ""Deleted Scene"" CGI.

The geneticist is fucking eaten alive by raptors. He tries to beat them away as they yank his intestines out of his body.&&Jurassic Park is one of my favorite novels.  So much is left out of the movie its almost like 2/3rds of the book is missing.  I could list lots of stuff but spoilers. 

The worst part (to me) is there's an entire subplot missing from the movie that is then tangentially referenced in the second movie,  but is still not really discussed.

I still love the movies but the books are just more complete,  and are better stories. &&The book is amazing. The author is one of the best sci-fi writers who ever lived, imo, I've read nearly all his books and they are all fantastic. &&The book The Lost World barely has anything to do with the movie. I hated that movie.&&To be fair, Crichton never explicitly says Malcolm dies, hence why he was allowed to bring him back without heavily ret-conning things *too* hard&&Maybe. He's in a Mexican mine at the beginning of the movie.&&Crichton was just trying to sync his sequel book with the film version of his first book a bit, and it's a bit of a nod to his toilet death in the film. &&Yeah book Gennaro was pretty cool and really looked out for the kids.&&While yes that is book Hammond, movie Gennaro is more in line with Ed Regis who runs away and gets killed by the T-Rex. &&I'd say he takes Ed Regis' spot more than novel Hammond. I don't think there is a novel Hammond in the film, to be honest. &&That was an intense, captivating read. To be honest, I kind of feel a bit queasy after reading that. I'm hooked though, I need to read this book.

Still, it'd be like that. &&I was wracking my brain to remember the scene until your last line here ha ha and then it all came back&&I remember exactly reading that for the first time, back in fifth grade. It was then that it dawned on me that a book could be 'violent' like a movie could. I was a big Crichton fan ever since.

Fast forward to today, and I just finished 'Pirate Latitudes' this morning.&&IIRC, that was the description for everyone who died via raptor/dilo, some thing something, intestines like warm spaghet, piling on the floor, and thems all dead&&Oh man that's sucks haha&&What if the guys behind Resident Evil did Dino Crisis&&[deleted]&&Yes, he does. Pretty sure compys get him like the Spanish guy with headphones in The Lost World movie.&&If I remember correctly, he got eaten alive by a flock of compys (procompsognathus) while he was hobbling around with a broken leg.&&Yea, he had the death that the Russian guy in Lost World had with the little green dinos....I think &&Yes if I remember right I think he gets torn apart by the little raptor guys like the ones in the lost world movie &&Bee Movie and Wicker Man (2006).&&> the relatability was nil.

I thought the idea that the tree/plant system was interlinked in a similar fashion to human neurons was quite interesting, and I thought they were gonna go down a literal, living Gaia type situation, but nothing really came of that bit :(

There was some interesting potential for the viewer to have sympathy for the planet itself, and not simply the creatures living on the planet, but yeah, I didn't really see them take it anywhere.&&The Lion Kong is just Hamlet with animals, are you trying to tell me The Lion King isn’t a good movie?&&I always saw it as Pocahontas in space.&&Except for the scene when they’re on their first outing in the park and see all the iguanadons and long neck boys, that did not hold up well at all, but it’s probably because of the hd TVs we have now. I bet it still looks pretty sick on vhs and crt.&&I inhale Crichton's books.  

Sphere is especially fantastic.&&Do ittt&&As an engineer, I really enjoyed Airframe. Hadn't heard anyone mention it&&You won't be able to put it down.  It's that good.

Well, hopefully I haven't hyped it up too much, enjoy!&&Stay frosty&&I guess she don't like the cornbread either.&&Clever warden.&&Hammond didn't want him to kill the T-rex because of its cost. At that point in the novel the shit that hit the fan hadn't hit a second fan yet.&&There's a turning point in the novel. When Nedry shuts down the fences, a lot of dinosaurs get out but the raptors are still locked up.

Since they can track all the dinosaur's general locations, it's pretty clear that the situation is tenable. Grant is guiding the kids through the park and the rest of the people are in the bunker.

As a precaution, Muldoon wants to put the rex down but since there's no immediate danger, Hammond convinces him to just tranq it.

Later on Hammond (who is considerably less friendly in the novel) Hammond worries about the lysene contingency plan. Essentially the dinosaurs slip into a coma and die if not medicated daily. He manipulates the people in the bunker to go out and reset the park (incidentally freeing the raptors in the process) by crying about the children being all alone out there.

When Muldoon realises the raptors are free and hunting people, he basically says fuck it and grabs the grenade launcher. No more trying to save Hammond's expensive investments.&&Besides what the other people are saying, a Rex is actually manageable in a ""realistic"" sense with a powerful tranq. It's not gonna sneak up on you, it's a huge target, it can't reach you in tight spaces, it's fairly stupid, etc.

Raptors are really damn fast, roughly human-size, smart as hell, stealthy as fuck, etc. They are so, so much worse.&&I'm pretty sure I heard that the dysentery thing is an intentional nod to the movie, since he dies on a toilet there.

Edit: I meant that in the second book (which was written after the first movie), it is mentioned that the lawyer dies of dysentery, which is a nod to the movie. I guess my explanation wasn't entirely clear and was kind of shitty.&&Isn't that when the kids who had befriended a baby raptor threw it at the adult raptor to get away? Baby imprinted on them in egg hatching scene. 

That was so messed up to me. I mean logical,  but all kinds of messed up. &&Doesn't Dr. Wu shoot some of the raptors with a rocket launcher?&&Jesus Christ. I want to see this version of Jurassic Park.&&I really need to educate myself on infectious diseases. I thought  dysentery was an old timey disease from the days of pirates or something. I didn't think you could even still get it, let alone die from it.&&Wu's death was he most shocking to me of all of them.  He is opens the door to try and let Ellie into the lodge and a raptor jumps down and slices him open.  She closes the door as she see's him trying to push the raptor head away as its eating his intestines.&&> The geneticist is fucking eaten alive by raptors. He tries to beat them away as they yank his intestines out of his body.

I read the book as a kid over 20 years ago and I still remember that part vividly.&&""They did not even permit the burial of Hammond or Ian Malcolm.  They simply waited.”
He died. It was only changed because he was such a popular character in the movie that he had to write him back in. 
[proof](https://m.imgur.com/UiNYeMS) &&In the way he died perhaps. Movie Genarro is the one with all the exploitative ideas. He came in looking for a safety report to reassure investors. He stopped caring by the time lunch was served.&&The book is phenomenal. One of the best pieces of science fiction I’ve ever read. When I read it a few years ago I had already watched the movie a hundred times as a kid so I knew what it was all about. Reading the book as an adult I wished I could’ve had my memory erased so I could experience it as if I had seen the book on the shelf, read the title for the first time and just started reading. I seem to remember it’s also a fairly easy read and not very long at all so I would say it would be well worth your time to read :)&&You're in for a treat. The book is so so so so good. &&The intro bit with the injured worker is so incredible. The only thing I wish would have been different about the movie was keeping faithful to the intro. It’s the perfect way to frame the shady things and questionable ethics happening at a weird remote resort project without showing anything. It’s a really gruesome intro but the way it sets up what’s going on is masterful. &&It's a great read. Top notch Crichton.&&I need to reread all of Crichten work again. Read them all as a teen but  I think I'd enjoy them even more now. To the ebooks!&&[deleted]&&How was Pirate Latitudes? It's been collecting dust on my shelf since I picked it up, this thread may have motivated me to dust it off.&&Sam Neil describes that very scene to a kid in the beginning of the movie, how the raptors would slice open your belly. &&Read that as dying by raptor dildo which would definitely suck. &&I'm sure there are exceptions but the book does seem like a bit much for 8-9 year olds.&&I'm pretty surprised there hasn't been a Turok movie with Dwayne Johnson as the lead. Turock, if you will. &&Malcolm actually dies in the book, too, but The Lost World basically ass-pulls a ""oh he wasn't dead, he just really really looked like it.""

...even though in the original book, they have a *goddamn funeral* for him.&&Don't forget, it wasn't actually a T Rex, it was his grandkids playing T Rex sounds over a loudspeaker. So technically it's their fault their grandpa died. Heavy...&&Not to be pedantic, but the Spanish guy with headphones (Carter) actually gets crushed by the T rex when they're all running away. Dieter (sp?) is the guy who is played by Peter Stormare who gets killed by the compys. &&[deleted]&&That makes sense. 

Sounds like I need to read it again - last time I read it was right after it was released (before the movie). I remember thinking it was an amazing book and it got me hooked on Crichton. It's been years since I've read any of his stuff; might be time to get back into it. &&Tbh when you gotta go, you gotta go.&&Yeah! They thought the raptors would be concerned about the baby but instead two of the fuckers tear it in half.&&[deleted]&&Muldoon blows one raptors leg off. Then other raptors eat it. &&I think that’s scurvy, me hearty!&&Its actually pretty easy to not die from it. Electrolytes and water or a decent iv will tode you over. The problem happens when you have no access to clean water or adequate electrolytes. Rice water is a good substitute. As in the water left over from cooking rice.&&Literally going to leave work, get the book, and sit down and read it tonight. Thanks for the recommendation! That little snippet was so god damn intense I want to read more!&&Oh man, I read that book like 20 years ago. After reading that passage, I very much want to read it again. &&It is good but I feel like Jurassic Park and Lost World kind of eclipse Crichtons other books which are also really good as well but usually get overlooked. Congo, Eaters of The Dead, Sphere, The Andromeda Strain, and The Great Train Robbery are all good reads too. &&I just love how the chapters are so short that you constantly feel like reading ""just one more chapter"". &&The *only* issue I had with this book is the scene where they try to sneak past the sleeping T-Rex and the little girl can't help but sneeze. Cliche doesn't even begin to describe that, really glad that scene didn't work its way into the screenplay. &&This is probably an entirely personal feeling, so I don't state it as if to imply I think the film should've been this way for the betterment of it to everyone watching.

That said though, I actually love the concept of the Jurassic Park movie completely omitting the first scene with the raptor, because when you do... and if you assume the person watching somehow doesn't know what this movie is about, then you have this incredible buildup to the reveal of - holy fuck - a living dinosaur. You get hints and bits, and it makes you *wonder* if that will maybe be what is going on... but you don't get the awe of the realization sinking in until the characters do with you.

I personally find that scenario of going into the film blind and being led up to that moment as being super cool, and the intro scene completely makes that impossible because, obviously, we see there's a living breathing dino/monster right out the gate. It also immediately portrays these creatures as dangerous, rather than letting the movie slowly build up to the ""will things go wrong / how will things go wrong?"" that it could without that scene.

In the end it may not make a better movie to do it that way, but it's personally how I think I'd prefer it be done/handled.&&Oh my I just remembered the whole bit about the locals having babies eaten or taken away by the “wildlife” in the middle of the night. That was some gruesome stuff&&My dad took me to see the movie in theatres. I was a dinosaur obsessed 7-year old. He'd already seen the movie to screen it and make sure I'd be okay. I loved 99% of the movie, but that opening scene gave me nightmares&&I believe when the book was written Deinonychus were considered to be Velociraptors and not their own distinct species yet, so the raptors in the book were correct based on that false assumption. And the movie was just using the name given by the book, even if it had been proven wrong by that point.&&I think it was a young dilophosaurus, if I remember from the book. Later in the book Grant and the kids encounter larger adult ones that wouldn't have fit in the car with Nedry.

And I forgive the frill because one of the main themes of the book and movie is that these capitalist scientists are recreating creatures we know so little about. Just educated guesses from fossils.&&It was a the same in the book because he still got spit in the face.&&I think, in the late 80s when the book was written, there was some debate about velociraptor. It was more a general name for that type of dinosaur, and later it was decided that ""velociraptor"" specifically was a small species. 

Or something like that. &&And Utahraptor was unknown when the movie was made; if you're inclined to it, you could make something spooky a nd mysterious out of that.&&No velociraptors were not chicken sized.  They were four to six foot long and 3 feet high depending on the species&&I loved it. I've been on a huge pirate history kick lately, listening to podcasts, reading, etc. I saw that book used, thought 'what the hell' and picked it up for a couple bucks. Read it within two days, couldn't put it down. The thing I liked most about it is that (while it's a work of fiction) it's very realistic. Crichton has always researched the living shit out of anything he's writing about, probably more than any other author I can think of, and I've always admired him for that. He really nails all the little details of Port Royal in the 1660's (just before Henry Morgan goes on his 22 month raid IRL) as well as the political climate in Europe that sets up the story. It was very cool to read a pirate adventure story set up with so much attention to historical detail, as opposed to something like Pirates of the Caribbean, which is set in some random time well after the Golden Age of Piracy, featuring characters that were all dead by that point (like Blackbeard).

Anyway, dust it off and give it a read, it's a fun time.&&7/10&&Fuck. Yes. I just want to see that cerebral bore in live action.&&This actually made me laugh out loud. And I would actually watch that.&&I'd watch that any day of the week. &&Jason Momoa dude.&&Yeah, but Hammond is more of a dick in the book so you don't feel as bad.  Definitely not the Sir Richard version of the character.  &&",2018-04-03 09:30:07
Incredibles 2 - New Official Trailer,47960,8bylwy,https://youtu.be/i5qOzqD9Rms,2936,1523620921.0,,"Saul Goodman bringing back the Supers.  I'm in.&&At least Frozone knows where his Supersuit is this time.

Edit: it to at&&The action looks so fun and fluid.

One nice little piece of continuity I noticed: They meet with the Bob Odenkirk character in their original outfits because no one is supposed to know they’re married. &&Oh this music. How I've missed you.&&That baby is powerful as hell.&&Do I see a portal-esque conservation of momentum thing with dash? 

Fancy...&&“Where you going ASAP? You better be back ASAP!”

Oh Honey, how I’ve missed you. &&Is the lip syncing/audio a little off in this trailer or is it just me?&&[deleted]&&That animation: wow 

Also Screenslaver looks like a cool villain. The cool mask, and the mind control through TVs (which is such a 50s/60s type concept I love it!)

Even more excited than before!&&Such a small detail but I love the sound effects of Dash running in the house. 

Also the score sounds INCREDIBLE &&Because of my rose-tinted glasses, I remember the first *Incredibles* looking as good as this new one.  But I just watched [the trailer,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbzbC9285I) and I now see that isn't the case.  Things like lighting, skin textures, and the rendering of Mr. Incredible's hair have improved significantly since 2004.

Still, for a computer-animated film from 14 years ago, it still holds up quite nicely.  It's like the only thing that can make me see the flaws in Pixar's work is Pixar's work from the future.&&At least Frozone's wife now knows not to move his damn super suit&&Find it jarring that the character Bob Odenkirk is voicing looks like Lee Mack&&Looks like someone is thinking with portals!&&This trailer made me realise I could honestly watch an entire movie about Edna Mode.&&The first Incredibles movie was one of the first movies my parents took me to see in theaters. I’m gonna invite them and we’re gonna do it again. &&The Screenslaver villain seems pretty cool. I bet it's Tony Rydinger. I have no evidence to support this but I just have a feeling &&They really created a cool world for these fun characters to play in.... color me STOKED!&&> ""And Jack Jack?""

> ""He's in excellent health""



Something about his delivery made me cackle&&It's amazing to see just how far the animation has progressed from the first film. Just look at the details on those characters. 

&&Is it just me or are the voices off? I know there’s a new actor for dash but him and Helen are the only ones that sound right. Am I weird?&&I’ve haven’t been this excited for a Pixar movie in years&&The music! The animation! The dialogue! This movie is going to be great&&Shadman's getting new content.&&""Why would they change maths?!"" :D&&The Incredibles is my favorite Pixar movie, and one of my all time favorite superhero movies. My excitement for this is on par with Infinity War. Which, thinking about it, is *insane*. There have been so many Marvel movies to build up to Infinity War, compared to just one other Incredibles movie. The Incredibles was just *that good*. &&God I hope the ""overwhelmed dad at home trope"" doesn't take too much of the movie.&&Uuuh, Violet gets new powers.&&""Suit up it might get weird"" i laughed at that line &&Been too long man, been too long. Awfully glad it's finally happening for real.&&I'm a little worried that it could just be a greatest hits of the first one. The scene with Edna, the role reversal of the parents, and the jokes with Frozone's wife. Hopefully they're showing those because it's the trailer and there are more original ideas in it. I'm optimistic, though. &&Welp.

I'll be there on opening weekend.

However [is there any chance that Screen Slaver is *not* the exec talking about needing to bring superheroes back?](#spoiler)&&Frozone's wife gonna get all the best lines. &&Glad they’re not just fighting that mole guy.&&Why does everyone have bags under their eyes?&&VIOLET CAN LAUNCH ENERGY DISKS!!!!!&&Op ass kid.

I wonder what his legit ability is.&&So Screenslaver is totally gonna end up being the guy who brought in Mrs. incredible, and justify his actions so ""the public would realize they need hero's again"" right?&&I'm hoping Bob Odenkirks character isn't Screenslaver, would feel too similar to the first. &&Portal 3 confirmed. &&I've had that math argument with my son. Thanks Common Core.&&I noticed Helen make some comment about having to break the law to make things better and give their kids a chance so....wild theory, maybe the new bosses start by setting up crimes for Elastigirl to stop, or Elastigirl helps set up the crimes.

I DON'T KNOW BUT I SURE AM EXCITED TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE MEANS&&ITS FINALLY HAPPENING&&Thank God they didn't name this movie ""Incredible Mom""... We all know what happened with [Mars Needs Moms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Needs_Moms)&&Calling it right now, the villain in this movie is the one who wants supers back, they have the same facial features and it makes the sequel a complete role reversal. ( manufacturing a villain to make heroes vs manufacturing a hero to get rid of all others.)&&I find Holly Hunters voice to be like slow, Southern fingernails running down the blackboard of my mind.&&At least he knows where his supersuit is this time&&I hope we finally get to see Frozone's wife in this.&&Elastigirl's ass is incredible 🍑&&Haha Bob Odenkirk’s character looks so much like him - will be fun seeing him Pixar-ified&&For a moment I thought Samuel L Jackson swore in that trailer when Frozone says, ""What the...?""

But it was simply my brain automatically adding 'fuck' to anything he says.&&“I don’t know how to do it that way! Why would they change math! Math is math!” As a parent I have had this exact experience! &&They really made the guy look like Bob Odenkirk too&&It's showtime, folks!&&Damn I'm so much more excited for this now, this trailer makes it seem like so much more than just a 'Elastigirl does mission, Bob does babysitting' that the others did.

Also, calling it now, I reckon Bob Odenkirk's character is going to be the 'real' villain.&&Guaranteed he’s the bad guy in the mask.&&I want Edna to make him a new fancy one too, and I really want the hysterical interactions with his wife about it. &&At least honey learned since the last time about the greater good. &&I'm so glad it looks like there's going to be a lot of action with Frozone in this one, he has the coolest power imo (no pun intended).&&Once again, his girl steals the show with one line.

""Where you goin' ASAP?  You better be back ASAP.""&&Frozone's wife is my favorite character and we don't even know what she looks like&&Pixar is getting pretty good at this animation thing.&&Lol imagine if Saul Goodman is their family lawyer and covers up for them when they get in trouble for destroying city property.&&But wait, weren’t there supers at their wedding though? &&I cant help but think he's sleazy, just from his voice. He probably lured the incredibles in with a cheesy, low budget commercial. He will never not be Saul goodman.&&> no one is supposed to know they’re married.

Seems like that cat would be out of the bag when the fam showed up in the middle of the city in an elastigirl hanglider wearing the same uniform to fight robots / moles.&&I’m really looking forward to Giacchino’s new tracks. The music is definitely one of the best parts of the original. It’s got such a unique vibe.&&Right in the nostalgia.&&The music style in the Incredibles is a pretty big part of why I love TF2 so much. Similar kind of style, absolutely love it.&&Trumpet players rejoice!&&Its got a nice old school feel to it, especially compared to live action superhero movies.&&He's in excellent health&&Teleportation, portal manipulation (which I assume is the baby's power), fire cloak/manipulation, Hulk-mode, shapeshifting (based on the last movie), laser eyes. What DOESN'T jack-jack have??&&Are Jack Jack’s diapers fireproof? Because that’s not a smell I would want to deal with.&&Bob: ""Please Nerf. PLEASE NERF!""&&Amusingly though he's way less powerful than the son of stretchy-smart-man and invisible-forcefield-woman: god-like-being-to-whom-the-fabric-of-reality-is-a-child's-plaything.&&We will watch his progress with great interest. &&Every hero needs a name right? He shall henceforth be named

Deus Ex.&&Dash tabs into the speedforce lmao&&In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out&&Based on the [character descriptions](https://ohmy.disney.com/news/2018/01/22/incredibles-2-cast/) we got a couple months ago, it could be the power of the new super doing that. Or, it could be Jack-Jack doing it, as seen at the beginning of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJDMWVZta3M) teaser (a bit different but maybe showing it's possible).&&https://thumbs.gfycat.com/VillainousWeeBarracuda-size_restricted.gif

I'm still tweaking it to try to line up the ends perfectly.&&I hope she stays offscreen for the entire movie to continue the gag.&&I'm still waiting for the new album to drop also&&I have a feeling Frozone & his wife's interactions are gonna be some of the best highlights of the movie.&&I'm the greatest good you're ever gonna get!&&“Honey, where’s my super suit?”&&His wife in the original had me laughing so much, I'm glad they've kept her in&&Yeah some scenes they definitely have taken lines from different scenes/shots and put them over others.&&[deleted]&&I noticed it only at the final scene with Frozone and his wife and with Bob talking to him. They definitely swapped audio for that.&&She was 35 for the first one and she's 48 now.  So you're not far off.&&The voice actress is 49.&&She does too! And she sounds different from the first movie...&&Could it be a bit intentional? In the first scenes it kinda looks like Vi is trying to take the *mom* role now that Helen is working outside the household.&&Fuck you, now I can't unhear that she's middle-aged.&&She kinda sounds like Krysten Ritter (aka Jessica Jones)&&His voice sounds like Craig T. Nelson.&&Edit: Not a Spoiler Warning but a...""Plausable Theory Warning"", I guess?

Calling it now:

Bob Odenkirk's character either is Screenslaver or is working for him.

The plan is to use Elastigirl's adventures to ""get Supers back into the spotlight"" which will get people to watch their TVs more and more to see her fighting and saving people from threats (that will probably be manufactured by Screenslaver).

Once Elastigirl has unwittingly maximized the number of people that are tuning in to watch her, Screenslaver will spring his hypnotic message.

Just like that one episode of Justice League where Joker broadcasts the League saving Las Vegas from his bombs, only to reveal a psychic girl was turning the viewers insane through the TV the whole time.&&I'm not sure how I feel about a Pixar movie that tickles my niche fetish. If he manages to get Helen...wow.&&As a motorcycle enthusiast Mrs.Incredible's downshift into 1st when taking off on the motorcycle is was finally sold me on Pixar's insane attention to detail. No one ever animates shifting gears on a motorcycle. They even included the little click the bike makes when shifting. I swear if they animate the gear shifts throughout action sequences too I'll lose my shit.&&> Also the score sounds INCREDIBLE 

(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞&&If you really look at Toy Story, it frequently looks like shit. But the story, music and voice acting just suck you in. Same with The Incredibles.&&Wow, so the original Incredibles trailer was shittily put together too.

Hopefully that means the new one will be good.&&The greatest-good protecting the greater-good. &&Excuse Me? Who cares about the suit when we all know that she's the greatest good he's ever gonna get?

&&But he also looks like Bob Odenkirk.&&You've just made me realise how hilarious and kind of out of place Lee Mack's voice would be in a Pixar movie, and now I want it.&&I would enjoy Bob Odenkirk on WILTY&&Speedy thing goes in; speedy thing comes out.&&[Last movie had Dash running so fast he could run on water](https://youtu.be/t5v2qBBD-gE?t=2m17s)

Wonder what other things they'll discover they can do. &&Edna Mode should be in every superhero movie. Tell me The Avengers wouldn't be even cooler if she designed all their suits.

(It's all owned by Disney, they could do it if they wanted to.)&&Last time someone said something like that we got the Minions movie..&&PIXAR: I AM HERE FOR AN EDNA MODE MOVIE THX&&Edna is in the trailer for literally 4 seconds...&&This is going to be the first movie I take my twin two year-olds to. It was one of the first movies my wife and I saw when we got married. &&They’ll ALL be eating Tony-loaf.&&I’m not gonna lie I was thinking the same thing. Maybe Screenslaver was an original villain from the Golden Age and Tony has adopted the mantle. Perhaps theres a whole subplot in which Bob focuses more on Dash’s homework and looking after JackJack, he doesn’t recognize that his daughter is dating a blooming villain.&&Everyone has aged over a decade, so they are bound to sound different.&&I noticed Craig T. Nelson’s voice seemed a bit higher/softer, but it could be the lines. He is 74. &&I was just thinking that Mr incredible sounded horribly off. After watching some of the first one, I think it's the same guy just more nasaly or not as deep a voice or something. &&I don't think I've been this excited for a movie in years.&&*Incredible*

(Edit: Common Core is something else and I had a misconception)&&That's so accurate, actually. It's exactly what my Dad said when I was in elementary school and he had to help me with the homeworks.&&to be fair none of the MCU movies have *the greatest good you're ever gonna get*&&I'm getting the feeling this is only a part of it. The fact the villain isn't even present for more than a second makes me think most of this is the first Act or so.&&From this trailer it seems like that's less of it imo, the previous promotional material made it look like that's all Bob was doing in it but it looks like he and Frozone are going to be much more central to the main plot. At least I hope so.&&My prediction:

Overwhelmed dad/superhero mom fighting street crime will probably be the first act. Second act will be introduction of villain, discovery of jack jack's powers with Edna, encounter with villain to show that he's more of a problem than originally thought. Third act will be everyone suiting up to band together and take out villain, and this is where jack jack's newfound powers will be instrumental to destruction of villain.

Setup, conflict, resolution.

At least that's what I think. Looks like there will also be some stuff with violet rejecting the superhero status, re: her putting the suit in the garbage disposal. &&I suppose if she can make force bubbles then, with a bit of motivation and practice, she can fling force blades or whatever the heck those were. Makes sense to me.&&I imagine if her powers work like Invisible Woman’s then her forcefields basically act as constructs.&&She's basically like Sue Storm/Invisible Woman in the Fantastic Four, who started out just making herself invisible, but was eventually able to make invisible constructs as well.&&*15 years too late*

Joking, of course... I’m super hyped for this!&&[deleted]&&He probably is, thats how these movies work.


&&almost 100% that is what is going to happen. They could [pull a big hero 6 with the villain not being who you think. But big hero 6 already did that.](#spoiler)&&They probably fight the Underminer in the first 5 minutes - he was in an earlier trailer.&&That was the plot to the videogame https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredibles:_Rise_of_the_Underminer

&&They've always been great at the story thing <cough, nosuchthingasthegooddino, cough>
&&I know you're kidding but that's pretty much already the role of Rick Dicker from the first one, who's going to be played by Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmantraut). 

I'd honestly love it if Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were in it somewhere too, they've both done a good amount of voice work before.&&I meant like the general public.

The ""New Math"" attempted to teach some of the more abstract concepts from modern algebra within a high school setting, as well as introduce different number base systems and stuff. 

Of course, the problem wasn't that ""they're changing math"", it was that they were teaching math that the parents hadn't learnt themselves, same for a lot of teachers (unfortunately). 

Re common core - I don't know enough about it, but I've read good things. And it seems that a similar ""I DIDN'T LEARN IT LIKE THAT JUST DO WHAT I DID"" thing is happening in a lot of places. 

I *have* seen videos such as the lady teachers testifying against common core in a local council meeting or something ( in america ), but I don't think that this is enough evidence against it. Perhaps the curriculum wasn't implemented very well there, I'm not sure ( I don't want to say that this lady, and those like her, don't have points). 

I think I recall reading Hung Wu talk positively about common core, as well as others (a chap called collin who writes dummies books and is active on reddit). 

So, I hope that people are able to refrain from being so reactive and appreciate that reforming maths education isn't a bad thing. Why some people get so emotionally attached to stuff like a long division algorithm they can't even explain or derive I've no idea. 

There are further steps necessary imo, such as a reduction in physics leaning topics and an increase in Statistics. Physics is relatively useless for most people but is still disproportionately used due to it's legacy (it was at the centre of many discoveries) and the curriculum that current curriculum's are based on. Much more beneficial to people and society would be having a foundation in statistics and logic. I really don't even remotely care if someone doesn't know how to re-write sin() in terms of cosine(). But I do think that it's important for someone to know whether a study makes any sense, or roughly what kind of sample size should be appropriate in studies they're presented with ( by newspapers etc) as facts. 

&&I think they are actually talking about New Math which was introduced into US educational curriculum in the 1960s. I think it's just another nod toward the mid-century vibe they try and invoke with the film.&&> The fact the villain isn't even present for more than a second makes me think most of this is the first Act or so

Spot on. Nearly all of this trailer's action is from the Underminer fight which should be the first few minutes of the movie. We got a couple shots of Elastigirl in action but it was very brief.&&The Frozone train tracks scene looks amazing. God, what a creative use of his powers.&&Those bits are probably all from near the beginning. Remember the Underminer at the end of the last one and how gigantic drill? I saw a lot of drills. &&> Looks like there will also be some stuff with violet rejecting the superhero status, re: her putting the suit in the garbage disposal. 

That seems like some sort of lashing out over the fact that her mom is constantly away on work. It kinda looked like it was her moms suit given how elastic it seemed to be.&&Yeah, a plot point of the first movie was that the kids weren’t allowed to explore their powers to their full potential, thus the scenes where the plane crashes because Violet doesn’t know how to make a force field big enough and Dash figures out he can run on water. 

It makes sense that now that they’re actually allowed to practice, they would develop much more robust abilities. &&This guy superheros.&&At one point in the first movie Violet is trying to project her forcefield around a campfire, implying her fields don't necessarily need to be localized around her.&&Well the Incredibles IS the best Fantastic 4 film ever made&&Violet OP plz Nerf.

I hope they don't go down that route, we've seen it quite a bit recently in other animated stuff (idk the douche from Frozen comes to mind) so it would be good to see them subvert that, we'll see I guess.&&He's either going to be the villain or will be accused of being the villain at the start of the third act but will turn out to be a red herring.&&Edna Mode is one of my favorite animated characters of all time. I love that eccentric woman!&&Shut it!&&Animation limitations is actually the reason their first movie was about toys.

OHHH&&Can they continue [the breakfast rap?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnZjoDN0UUA)&&That's a good point. If they showed up in the red suits, he might be like ""Oh, I saw those suits on the news. Also there were kids with superpowers wearing them too.""

Mind you, he still would have seen people shaped exactly like Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, and who had the same powers, but this is a universe where a tiny black mask covering just your eyes can conceal your identity, so I buy it.&&Yeah but that's because the supers were forcibly retired pretty much right after the Parrs got married, then they were relocated by the government and stayed out of the limelight. &&you married...ELSTAGIRL?! and got BESSAAYY&&> greater good

Why can’t we see Frozone’s wife?  Why can’t we have a WOC Superhero?  We have plenty of yt pepo superheroes in the film, both men and women, young and old.  We even have a Man Of Color: Frozone, the Incredibles’ sassy black sidekick and ice minstrel, coming to help his masters at their every beck and call.  But Frozone’s wife?  Not only does this proud WOC not get to join the team and develop her own super powers, she doesn’t even get seen on screen.  Why?  Is she too shapely for their little superhero team?  Does her naturally voluptuous figure somehow threaten the sexual appeal of twig-like yt woman Invisigirl?  Maybe it’s time for a fat black woman superhero.  Also, can we talk for a minute about how Frozone’s wife’s entire character is nothing more than a single gag and not even a funny one at that.  The audience LAUGHS at this beautiful woman’s pain as she just wants her husband, her man, to stay in with her and fulfill HER needs for once instead of going out and playing superhero with his yt friends.  The audience LAUGHS at her for trying to stand up for herself and express HER needs.  It’s disgusting.  I walked out of the theater literally shaking with anger and pain for this poor Woman Of Color.  Trapped in her home while her husband is out with another woman (a yt woman nonetheless and her entire yt family).  Listen, I am not asking for much.  My request is very simple.  Disney/Pixar need to kill off all the yt Incredibles and introduce a new family of beautiful humans with a 👏🏾 little 👏🏾 more 👏🏾 melanin 👏🏾 in their skin.  Also, ditch the very aggressively yt european name “The Incredibles” and change the last name to something more modern and ethnically sensitive for this new family: Something like the “Those Fantassyquess” or something.

&&its so obvious, I think they're pulling a fakeout and it won't be him after all.&&Incredibles, Frozen, Big Hero 6, Coco...

All of them contain a twist with the villain, whether it's their true identity or their motivations.

But it would be odd to repeat that story point twice for the Incredibles 2, and since this will be a sequel, there's no character that previously established that could embody the dual role of villain that has a connection to the Incredible's past.

My guess is that Odenkirk's character is looking to play both sides of the issue. To bring back both supers and villains either as entertainment for the masses or some form of control through chaos. It'll be revealed that he's Screenslaver, but it won't be used to the same effect as Syndrome or other villains like I mentioned above and instead be pretty straight forward. And that the subversion of exceptions will actually come from the Mr. Incredible/Elastigirl relationship instead.&&DAHLING&&So much packed into a tiny, insane, awesome, wise, and absolutely badass package. &&No luck catching them killers then?&&And the scene in Toy Story 2 with the toy cleaner (who was also based on Geri from Geri's game) was used to show how good CG animation could look at the time.&&they also couldnt animate humans for a short amount of time

that baby will steal your soul&&It's more of that computers are a shit ton faster than they were in ~1995. The fastest super computer at the time had around ~200Gflops of peformance. The fastest super computer today has about ~93Pflops. 1 petaflop is equal to 1000 teraflops. Which is equal to 1000 gigaflops.

One scene in a movie like this can take months to render. They will take shortcuts whenever they can. But if they can make it take the same amount of time and look nicer, they will do that instead.

Fun fact, Pixar's ~~animation~~ render software can downloaded for free.

He has ""low-level"" powers and omnipotent cosmic god-like powers that that fluctuate wildly. There's a cool and well supported fan theory that he [subconsciously controls everything in the Marvel Universe](http://zak-site.com/Great-American-Novel/ff_franklin.html). Every time something is rebooted or a character returns from the dead it's because Franklin Richards made it happen. Not even the other god-like characters in Marvel will fuck with him. Mephisto, who is basically Satan/Lucifer in the MU, is terrified of Franklin's powers. &&I hear that is a shitty power, all you have to do is take a cold shower and it doesn't even work all that well.&&This is a theory someone came up with, I don't know why it's being repeated like fact.&&Maybe it's the teleporting thing, I imagine if they haven't seen a super with that power it must be pretty wild.&&Or the hulk mode is his true power because he gets jacked&&> And Jack Jack is the jack of all trades

fucking why did this not dawn on me sooner. I feel dumb now.&&Violet’s force fields are violet colored, that’s true, but I think her defining characteristic in the first movie was being a “shrinking violet” — one eye hiding behind her own hair, being so shy she turned invisible when a boy looked at her, putting up force fields around herself (although by the end of the film it seems as if she was outgrowing that phase already.)&&No, somebody else made it up, and they believe everything they read on the internet.&&I read a fan theory that said that once.

Unlike Shad.&&IMO that's often a problem with teachers, in that , they're sometimes not that good at the subject and want it done how they've shown it etc etc. However, I do agree that having *one* fixed approach to doing a maths problem is fantastically stupid. The idea of a child being punished / marked poorly for answering something in a different way is ridiculous. 

There are some instances, where one is expected to show that they understand a particular method, where this is more understandable. For example, if someones evaluating a limit and just uses L'Hopitals when they were expected to show some kind of algebraic manipulation or whatever then I guess that's fair... Though this is murky. 

Bottom line is that I agree with you, this ""one way the right way"" mentality that some have is a problem with the delivery. Ack. You can read maths books through to the early 20th century and see the same old complaints about things. &&Dashpoint&&Or Ultra Violet waves?&&It’s mostly the hair, and clever little wardrobe decisions like having him wear semi-tight jeans and sneakers when not at work.  They do such a good job with it that I don’t even realize most of the time he’s 55.  And yet they somehow also make him believably brothers with a 70 year old Michael McKean.

EDIT: Thinking about this some more, this is a pretty good illustration of how Pixar is different. Any other animation studio would have foregrounded the wacky bear plot in their marketing, and minimized the personal growth plot. Even though I think Brave is one of Pixar’s lesser efforts, this is a great example of what’s important to them.&&""Superhernia""

John Krasinski Pushed to Cast a Deaf Actress for 'A Quiet Place',45760,8ai3m1,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/a-quiet-place-john-krasinski-pushed-cast-millicent-simmonds-1100644,2359,1523108495.0,,"""John Krasinki Pushed Deaf Actress""

*looks to camera*&&Saw it last night. It was fantastic. I read an interview with Krasinski in which he said he didn’t want the scares to come from“horror movie” elements, but rather from the fact that you care about the family so much that you don’t want anything bad to happen to them. I think he succeeded quite well.&&Haven't seen the film, but it struck me that knowing sign language was probably key for the survival of the family. But deafness would be fatal for the girl because she doesn't know if she's making noise. Is this addressed? Guess I better go see it.&&On the subject of extremely minor tidbits most of you won't care about either way: I'm a fluent ASL speaker (brother is deaf, I work as a professional interpreter). ASL, like any other language, has accents and regional dialects, and people who aren't fluent are easy to spot. Some people sign with the clarity and articulation of Sir Lawrence Olivier. Others sign like Borat.

John Krasinski signs with a relaxed style that suggests he's been doing it for a long time. If he picked those nuances just for the role, good for him. He really signs like it's natural and comfortable (another standout like this is Jessica Chastain in Take Shelter). I really respect how serious Krasinski is about that detail most of us wouldn't care about and won't notice.

On the other hand, watching Dwayne Johnson sign in the trailer for Rampage is like chewing tin foil. 

*(Edit) I want to just include this important point: I'm fluent in ASL and I know a lot about it, so I can make casual observations, comments, and explanations. But if you want to get in-depth with ASL and receive ""definitive"" answers, you need to go to a native speaker. In other words, a deaf person. It's one thing for a hearing person to bounce around a few comments and ""Did you know""s like I'm doing, but ASL belongs to the deaf and if you want the real deal that's where you have to turn.*

&&My favorite horror movie in years. No relying on gore or cheap scares, has incredible attention to detail, a great story, and doesn't overstay its welcome.

Now, please, **don't** make a sequel.

EDIT: Jump scares are not inherently cheap. Jump scares done poorly (e.g., using a zoomed in perspective and having something enter that, while shocking the audience, ignores what the character would sense in their immediate surroundings) are cheap.&&Jim has really aged well&&Deaf person here who uses American Sign Language on a daily basis (fluently). I was quite impressed by how well John krasinski and Emily blunt (also Noah jupe) used ASL. I can tell that they definitely spent a lot of time practicing and it was NOT half-assed at all. Probably the best use of deaf talent and ASL in a Hollywood movie as far as I know. It's made me incredibly proud to watch this movie, and not only that, but it actually made me sit on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. Very well done! &&I saw that last night. That movie was amazing &&Went and saw it last night and was really impressed. “One Fateful Night At Schrute Farms” gets a two thumbs up from me. &&If anyone knows something about conveying emotions and thoughts without words on film it's John Krasinski. &&*Tremors* meets *Mars Attacks*.

But scary.

And very well done.

This concludes my review of *A Quiet Place*.&&For anyone writing this off as ""pfft jumpscares.""

Don't. 

I absolutely despise movies that rely on jump scares alone, and while this movie does have jump scares, it doesn't RELY on them to be scary.

I caught myself multiple times white knuckle gripping the arms of my chair in the cinema because I was so tense watching it.

It is *amazing.*&&she was great in the film. I liked her in Wonderstruck as well. I know deaf characters often being played by hearing actors is a big complaint in the deaf community so it's great how he pushed to cast a deaf actress in the role. 

Not that I necessarily think the actors have to have the disability of the characters they play but it does add more authenticity to me. &&Total Big Tuna move.&&John Krasinski is becoming man crush number one. He's incredible and I'm actually really excited to see this movie.&&I can't emphasize enough how good this movie is, and how worth it is to see it in a theatre. &&I don't know if this is going to reach anyone due to 2000 comments being here.  I am a hearing CODA (Child of Deaf Adults), my mom is Deaf and my dad is an sign language interpreter.  I am going to demolish the language barrier between Deaf and Hearing by teaching sign language for free on snapchat at the username meowchickenfish.

I know reddit hates self-advertising, but I am sick and tired of people saying they want to learn sign language but they never do.  I have a $0 cost easy way to start picking up what I am doing like others have from around the world.

Like the movie Don't Breathe. That movie had me on edge almost the entire length of the movie.&&Can we talk about the atmosphere the movie created for the audience? I swear no sound was made from anyone.&&The title of this is pretty ambiguous.

I'm really glad it's gotten such a positive reception!&&This is seemingly a dumb question but is there actual dialogue in this movie at any point? I want to see it so badly but silent films, shows, etc just irk me for some reason. I couldn’t even watch tom and jerry as a child lol&&I don’t technically have a hearing problem, sometimes when there’s a lot of noises occurring at the same time I hear it as one jumble.&&This movie shook me so bad, I left my purse in the theater. I realized it in my Uber, 6 blocks away, and had to sprint back. I walked home to feel better. &&I think one of the coolest things John has said in his interviews about this is that sound is the main character of this film. It was amazing! Easily one of my favorite movies this year. Wish I could un-watch it just to get my first experience again! &&Saw it last night. It was amazing. And my theatre was packed like there was maybe 5 open seats. Everyone was completely silent. The people next to me jumped so hard at some of the jump scares lmao. The only other time I enjoyed the mass amount of people without them making a shit ton of noise was Star Wars : The Last Jedi.&&This was the most intensely terrifying film I have ever seen. It was amazing! &&I'm pretty sure Marlee Matlin has had all other deaf actresses ""eliminated"" to maintain her monopoly on that market segment.&&I read the title as he was pushed to cast the deaf girl.&&Wait, how old is she? I looked her up on Wikipedia, and it says if she was born in 2002 **or** 2003. Is there a story there?&&Moral of the movie: listen to your parents.

Moral of the movie 2: don't have unprotected sex after a monster apocalypse whereby you know the monsters are attracted to sounds. &&Well done, John. It was an awesome movie.&&It's weird how that headline can be read both to mean he advocated for the actress to be cast in the role, or that he was forced into it.&&He didn’t push her, but he let her fall in.

Great flick&&Well he picked the most adorable couple ever, himself and his wife &&They use her really well as well. There’s one scene where noise is made behind her but the peoples faces in front of her really give away the noise and it’s all from her perspective so you don’t hear anything. You just see the reactions. 

Go see this movie. &&It’s handled very well&&There is no way to answer this without giving major things away, so I recommend you just see it.&&Yeah but what about farting in your sleep? 

IS THIS ADDRESSED OR NOT?&&One of the tightest horror scripts I've seen.

Just go see it. In a theater. It's quite an experience. &&Go see it. It's amazing &&She also had a working implant earlier so she would fully understand the sounds that she would be making (thanks reddit for teaching me just how loud and uncomfortable it is to go to the bathrooms at Gallaudet and hear people that don't know they are making hefty grunting sounds on the toilets).&&Spoiler free explanation, It's addressed by her parents raising her all her life to be quiet as well as sound proofing everything they can, such as using sand to make pathways around the city for the family to walk on

There's more to it but I won't say. &&This isn't a plot detail, but a movie detail, they have painted marks in their house for where she can walk on the wood floors without making any creaking sounds. &&I just walked out of a theater. Loved the movie. Don't go to it if you're gassy, sneezy, coughy or any other of the evil movie dwarves... unless you're a fart ninja.&&It isn’t fully addressed, but it is not a concern. Her character is old enough to be responsible and fully understands the weight of their situation. The real issue is when she doesn’t hear something going on behind her. 

And yes, you better go see it. &&There's a scene where this is addressed. I really enjoyed this movie, I recommend it.&&Yea, the opening scene pretty much addresses this.&&I read that the actress actually taught the cast members ASL along with a professional teacher. Krasinski wanted his character to be fluent yet, short and articulate, showing that he's a survivor. Whereas Emily Blunt's character signed more compassionate and took her time, showing that she wants her kids to experience life and grow up rather than day by day survive

Not that the movie would go into that much detail, but I can imagine primate signing may be different. &&I just thought back to the Rampage trailer and I totally understand what you mean!

I'm kind of freaking out over how well that analogy works. &&This is fascinating&&Thoughts on the signing in John Wick? &&neither of us are deaf. my son and i learned ASL a few years ago. we don’t remember everything but it was a great learning experience for both of us.

i’m no longer at the company, but learning ASL has been helpful in my work as one of my customers was a deaf special needs adult center. communication with the staff and just signing “how are you” to everyone and learning more opened my eyes to this community.&&There will be a prequel that takes place in the first 89 days. I pretty much guarantee it.&&It's Paramount's first legit breakout hit in a while... it's going to get a sequel.&&A sequel isn't necessarily a bad idea. You could have it from a different families point of view and how they decide to deal with it in their own way.

He didn't litteraly say that there will be a sequel, but I think he would be open to it.

I haven't seen the movie yet though so I have no idea if I want a sequel haha. Looking forward to watching it :) &&There has to be a sequel!

But agreed. He’s aged well.&&Ouch.  Hearing somebody my age has aged well really stings.&&Pam also looks amazing in her new series. &&I know! I never thought of him as hot during the office. These days, well...yes please!&&Someone I replied to further up asked if this was a good movie to watch as a deaf person. Are you glad you saw it?

Edit: /u/evidentlyobvious&&I'm sure it would make them so proud to know that their efforts hadn't gone unnoticed. I saw some interviews about this movie (mainly bc John and Emily are just so adorable, ngl) and John mentioned in a few of them how happy he was that people seemed to be really getting and reacting positively to the movie's message and the whole point about it being about the family and the relationship between the parents and the children more than it was about the monster. Another thing along the same vein was he also felt like he 'succeeded' when people told him that they didn't expect to get as emotional as they did watching a horror movie. 

He seemed to really care about little things like that, so I'm sure he would also be really proud about this too!&&I am really considering going out to watch it today instead of waiting for cheap tickets tomorrow...

EDIT: You really don't think I know about Moviepass?&&I'm trying to imagine what the movie sounds like. Is there a lot of breathing and chewing sounds? That would kill me.&&Also, FYI, ah, I don't techinically have a hearing problem, but sometimes when there's a lot of noises occurring uh at the same time, I'll hear 'em as one big jumble.

EDIT: I just saw it and you're all right! It was awesome and tense, but not ""scary"". I don't feel like I'll have nightmares tonight!&&She was incredible.  I think the authenticity we see is that an actual deaf person has had to use emotions to convey meaning their entire life.  

It's a big risk to make a child actor with little experience the emotional heart of the movie, but it really worked here.  &&> I know deaf characters often being played by hearing actors is a big complaint in the deaf community

The main reason for this (other than the fact that there are a lot of great deaf actors who are ready to be hired) is because the hearing actors do ludicrous things that don't make any sense as a deaf character. The best example I can remember is Rob Lowe playing a deaf man in the miniseries The Stand way back when, and the premise is he doesn't use sign language because he lipreads perfectly... except half the time other characters are talking *he's not even looking at them*. For a deaf person or someone who understands deafness, this is maddening and insulting.&&Sign language has been getting great visibility from Hollywood lately, with the Shape of Water and now this. And then there's Rampage...&&There’s enough hearing impaired actors and actresses to fill those kinds of roles. I agree, it’s not always necessary, but they’ll have a better understanding than a hearing person playing a character that’s impaired. &&She has a very interesting face. It works very well since Krasinski apparently loves closeups. &&How jumpy of a movie is it if you do not mind me asking?

It was intense in some areas and really beautiful by the end. The chemistry between the parents is perfect which makes sense since they are married in real life. The kids are great actors too! The whole thing is very well written. &&Go into it with the right expectations. Yes there are spooky monsters in the forest, but the movie isn't about the spooky monsters, it's about the family having to deal with the spooky monsters.

As long as you go in knowing it's more about relationships in a spooky world moreso than the spooky world itself, it's pretty dang good&&Just watched it. I highly rate it. Just keep in mind though that depending on the audience (if they're rowdy or quiet) can make or break the experience. &&Most of the dialogue in the film is actually told through the characters using ASL to speak with each other!!&&That's how I read it. &&Directed, starred, and wrote it. &&One of my favorite parts of going to the movies is eating a whole thing of popcorn by myself. I was so worried about making too much noise crunching that i didn't even finish half of it. Its rare that a movie can have that kind of an impact on an audience &&I definitely thought it meant he was being forced to, until I read the article.&&Look at FoxNews getting all catty. People change their minds all the time, no need to paint Emily Blunt as a shrieking jealousy monster. She probably saw how much that movie could benefit from a stronger actress such as herself, and she seems to be right since it's now at 97% RT rating. Actors will usually get replaced several times before a shoot, no need to create drama where there isn't any.&&He wanted her but was afraid to ask. Eventually she offered and he was relieved. Yes the wife character was replaced, but she was second choice to Emily to begin with. &&Saw it last night, it was really good!&&I saw her talk about it on a talk show and it seemed more like a joking thing. Like no contracts were made, he just was considering one actress then changed his mind&&re: your edit, consider the source.&&I also saw it last night. I was white knuckling my seat the entire time. So much tension, from the opening scene to the end of the movie! Omg it was so good!&&I see what you did there.&&There's some. They speak to convey some plot points but that about it. Subtitles for all sign language btw.&&I was being super quiet for about an hour after I left the theater. Didn't even realize it until I got into bed.&&People keep asking her what year was she born but she never listens. &&It's a killer new dance move.&&Guys, Michael... can't handle this.&&I keep clicking it. &&Right!?

Got to third comment on this post and am just going to stop reading and add it to my list.

I really like John K as an actor, was great in 13 hrs, and hope that he continues his success in breaking away from Jim.

&&yeah but the real monster was [that motherfucking nail](#spoiler)&&Do you see the monsters though?&&There was just the one with the brother scaring the sister at the end that I thought was stupid. And a few other things that just don't make sense. Good movie overall but so many basic things not making sense killed me. You have to keep totally quiet, but you still have pictures hanging up everywhere? Why not live under the waterfall? Common sense.&&please PLEASE go see it during matinee or something. The movie is completely ruined by the unavoidable background noise of people in the theater rustling food bags and shit.&&I saw the movie last night and that's the only time I can remember her deafness being shown as a danger other than in the corn field. 

Also my my biggest problem with the movie is how being quiet is such a big deal where a kitchen timer ticking in a different room is a problem, but not the squeaks of a wooden house or [a baby making gurgling sounds.](/spoiler).&&Yeah the attention to detail was great in this regard, especially when she's walking in the house.&&I upvoted this before I realized it wasn’t a sign language pun&&Yeah, it's definitely a part of the story. 

And yes, go see the movie. It's fantastic. Totally unique horror flick that IMO will definitely become a classic. &&Okay, As you wish.&&They spend at least 1/2 a hour on how they trained there bodies to silence fart. Stinky but quite.&&It’s a horror film. Very little sleeping. Plus, biological functions (like peeing, since trickling is noisy) are normally undetected by the beings. It’s mostly synthetic sounds or loud noises (like falling and shouting) that triggers them. There’s even a chart with the wavelengths they detect. It’s a well thought-out premise.&&Holy shit—97% with 175 reviews counted. I was praying this movie would be good. I’m so happy for John Krasinski.&&So it's worth the watch? I've been seeing so many advertisements for it and I wasn't sure if it was being over hyped or not. It's nice to see John Krasinski starting to break out of the Jim Halpert mold he's been stuck in. &&i want to but this movie looks like jumpscare central

E: I saw it, was great&&I'm curious though, was her implant working? Everyone else turned around and stared in horror when the first noise happened. I assumed that was the moment she realized her implants weren't working at all.&&[deleted]&&that is so fucking cool.  &&r/moviedetails &&Oh yeah, that's all really evident in the ""you stay"" and mother's follow-up. Thanks for this bit of trivia.&&That actually came across as a someone who doesn't know ASL&&Fluent, but stiff. It's not painful to watch, but she's obviously not a native signer. It also wasn't pure ASL, grammatically (which, for the era in which the story took place, made sense as ASL wasn't so widespread at the time). I'd give it an A for accurate, clear communication but a C+ for style and natural articulation.&&[Sorry, not sorry.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/db98c18cff3553250d869a0e7f4cbf90/tenor.gif?itemid=5222352)&&Right there with you. Read in an animorphs book the idea of chewing aluminum foil with cavities 12 years ago and its never left me&&Haven't seen that one. I keep hearing that I should, though!&&Oh yes, it is possible. Two ASL movies to illustrate this point come to mind: “Wrong Game” and “Lake Windfall”. Yeah there’s native signing involved, but they have cringe-inducing acting. &&your question presumes that Wiseau is a native English speaker.

from what I've heard and read, he is not.&&Actually, it is yes. As you can imagine, the grammar is far simpler (often non-existent as you don't usually string words together with primates - note I said ""*usually*"" and not ""*never*""). The signs also tend to be taken from SEE (Signed Exact English) and not ASL. It's definitely a different thing. But even so, Dwayne Johnson is very difficult to watch.&&In terms of his sign language, he comes off a lot like a non-native speaker with a translation dictionary. ""I... am like... your... country. It... very... happy. No, wait... it... very... *friendly*. Yes!""

But I want to also say that I'm not an expert in speaking sign language to primates. While I am not at all convinced Dwayne Johnson comes off as ""natural"" or ""comfortable"" when he signs, it's not my area of expertise.&&I'm really sorry to say it, but I don't remember the signing. I saw John Wick on a laptop screen surrounded by a bunch of loudmouths so I wasn't paying close attention.&&Absolutely. You may not have a reason to go all the way to the top of the ladder (like a professional interpreter might) but that doesn't mean learning *some* has no value. There's a big difference between ""A little"" and ""Nothing"" when it comes to bridging gaps between people.&&That could actually be kind of cool though, I was super curious how the world got to this point and where these things came from, as well as how many there are.

That may ruin some of the mystique of the movie though so I understand why some people may not want that.&&Luckily, John Krasinski (doesn't seem) to be a moron. I feel like someone else would have to get the okay to direct it if there was going to be any expansion.

With that said, a prequel or sequel could be done well. But I don't think it's necessary. &&If their reaction to the success of *Paranormal Activity* is any indicator, we can expect multiple sequels.  This is where QC always loses out to the bean counters in a big studio.  They will run the numbers on previous similar franchises and see that the actual quality of sequels makes no difference concerning ticket sales.  They will come out way ahead regardless of how bad the sequel(s) are.&&20-30s you change, 30s-40s are your static years, 40-50s is when some people fall apart, unless you somehow smoked and pickled yourself, then you can survive to 70. 


Then again working with people in their early 20s means you can see it more.  &&Well, if you wanna bring up the 50s, look at Steve Carell. Dude's 55, and as a completely straight dude I can shamelessly recognize that that man is a silver fucking fox. I don't know what he does, but he looks incredible. &&I'm 35. 38 still seems ancient.&&I'm 39. What the fuck happened to my life?&&I'm 38. I don't feel ancient until I remember I'm 38. &&""I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...""&&He has Count Choculitis. &&well, good news is he can look in a mirror now. &&Right there with you brudda&&Good movie but several times the camera was focused on the actors face and not their signs. A little frustrating for trying to follow their signs and not the captions.&&Honestly the less busy the theater the better. Since its such a quiet movie I'd recommend the matinee. &&[deleted]&&It’s not completely silent, there’s music in most scenes. Some scenes are entirely quiet though &&You can hear pretty much everything the audience is doing, which was pretty annoying for the first ten minutes or so. But the movie itself doesn’t really have annoying sounds like that. The sound work is all really well done!&&There's very little actual dialogue. Mostly sign language. What dialogue there is is very meaningful. Very well done&&I saw it in a packed theater and it didn't bother me at all. You could kind of hear the audience hold their breaths together during the tense scenes and it kind of added to it, imo. &&Definitely not a movie I'd go see at a place that serves food. There are plenty of extremely tense, very quiet moments. Hearing someone chow down on nachos or a cheeseburger would be a huge bummer. 

Go see it at the latest showing you can. At my theater the 10pm-ish showings usually aren't very crowded. &&https://media1.tenor.com/images/1562c20597347e8b7dae6aec6f53cb2f/tenor.gif?itemid=5646342&&[removed]&&""See more JimFace GIFs""


Don't mind if I do&&[deleted]&&I just watched 13 Hours the other day and it was weird seeing him in an action role but he really nailed it. Especially the few dramatic moments where he could express a little more. I fucking love John Krasinski.

Also The Hollars which is much sillier but has great moments

Edit: just saw A Quiet Place. It's amazing. Emily and John are amazing. Deaf girl is amazing. Hope yall enjoy it&&Same with Ben Affleck. Grew a beard, boom. Oscar. &&Nobody should’ve seen Black Bolt.&&He better fuckin' be Reed Richards with his wife as Mrs. Storm or I'M gonna be sayin words.&&Smash that like button!&&And dont forget to SMASH that notification button to be part of the notification squaaaad&&Tensed everything so hard at the scene with the uh, indoor pool. &&You may say they.....""nailed"" it. &&Every time there was a shot of characters going downstairs after the ‘nail’ scene everyone would cringe it was amazing &&I’ve never been so anxious over a shot of a single nail.&&It is pretty scary as you are watching it, but not super super scary, also personally I wasn't scared after, if that makes sense?

With something like The Babadook, I legit had trouble sleeping that night, with AQP, no problem.&&It’s more of an intense suspense than out right horror but it is phenomenal &&It's like a fun scary&&As someone who jumps at every little sound in horror movies and goes home paranoid, I dont know what makes this a horror movie. Probably about as scary as Cabin in the Woods. Theres a ton of quiet scenes, but they never use them for a real jumpscare. It's also a PG13 movie so theres not really a bunch of gore.

PA had me scared for a week so you should he fine&&She was great. She conveyed the frustration of the situation really well. &&I really loved how they sort of muted the sound when it was her point of view, like they made the audience hard of hearing as well. &&Half my family is deaf and nobody speaks sign language, but don't expect them to be able to ""hear"" you when you're turned away. One of the kids goes to a normal school, and at one point he hadn't done his homework because the teacher had turned away when he'd told the kids about the homework. Response of the teacher ""he should tell me when he hasn't heard something!"" *Headdesk*&&The Silent child won an Oscar too for short films, also cast a young deaf girl who is amazing in it. &&Also, Deaf actors are rarely cast to play hearing characters, so whenever the opportunity is there...&&I'll try to provide clarity, the differing opinions on the jump scares stems from the fact that they technically exist, but aren't abused the way they normally are.  The jump moments in this movie are used as the pay off and release of the extreme tension, not as random spooks. No random loud music or anything like that, just the moments of white knuckled waiting for something to happen and then something does, which causes you to jump the same way waiting on a punchline of a joke makes you laugh.  &&You've been provided the correct answer (It's a movie that not only relies on jump scares, but also the tension building up to those scares) and then a range of answers from people that really like the movie and don't want to admit it has jump scares because they perceive that as a negative for some reason.&&Yeah it’s not really a jumpy movie. What makes it so tense and suspenseful is the silence during the movie that any noise gets you.&&Yes!
The thing is, I’m not sure how many people would even mention it as “out of place” because we’re so used to it!&&Don't you mean Silent Butt deadly?&&Holy shit I forgot they were actually married

The one scene they are holding each other with such care it makes sense now&&So you're saying i should take my toddler.... /s&&Better than how I read it, which was ""John Krasinksi pushed to death"".

I think I need more coffee&&Yes, but did you hear it?&&Michael: $300 for a fish!? I could get that for a 10 cent worm.  

Jim: :\

&&Had some kid in the audience being noisy last night. He sure was pretty quiet by the end though ;)&&In my showing someone's text message notification went off, and someone in the back said, ""Monster, ATTACK!""&&Why do people keep saying 'Big Tuna' in reference to this movie?&&I haven't seen this movie but this comment has motivated me to seek it out&&Don't know if anyone else noticed this, but in the opening scene where they are searching through the abandoned shop the only thing that's still fully stocked is the crisps(/chips). Was a nice little detail&&Cckrrrckckkc ppuap. Hwawwwwgghh crunch crunch. 

I tried &&They were sun chips too. In the original bag.&&ayyyy&&Yes you see the monsters a ton and it works&&I saw it opening night and people definitely kept the rustling under control in my full theater.&&The movie was so quiet that I heard music from other movies in other theaters. I thought that it was a part of the movie at first and that somebody was playing music in the distance and was about to get wrecked.&&Alamo Drafthouse was not fucking around keeping the noise in check. It was nice.&&My assumption is that they tested out a waterfall, they’ve heard houses squeak when the adjusted. It’s the noises that are out of the ordinary for them that they react to&&The timer wasn't in a different room, I believe it was the same room set on a metal pipe&&Kitchen Timer was in the same room, and was set specifically as a diversion so she could escape. 

You see paint on the floor so the girl knows where she can step without floorboard squeaks. Her father didn't want her in the basement because he wanted to hide the severity of the truth from her, not because he was afraid of the floorboards. &&I think something like the kitchen timer would only really come into effect when the monster was in the room with it and very intently listening. I doubt it would have just heard it if it was mulling about outside, so I think that adds a little more consistently in what they're able to hear.&&The alien didn't come to the house *because* the ticking. It was already there, she just knew it'd set up for her distraction. If you noticed, ever since she set the timer, they had the ticking slllooooowwwwllllyyy creep into being more and more audible up til it went off. I felt like I was watching Dunkirk.

But the ticking wasn't the problem, it was meant to be the solution.  The alien was already well on its way if not already in there.&&Fyi the movie uses her deafness numerous times starting in the first scene. At first I was under the impression it was just shoddy audio editing, but they clearly change the audio balance intentionally when she has closeups to bring you closer to her character&&For having such amazing hearing they sure did struggle to hear heart beats. &&And the fact the creature was like ten feet away from the ticking timer. Proximity must have something to do on that one.&&You really have to let some of that go unless you want it to hold you back from enjoying the entire movie. There's a lot of comparisons you can make between x and y and why does that make too much noise versus something else ect. &&I thought it was brilliant. Just the whole system. &&My favorite detail is when in the opening supermarket scene the left behind items were all things in plastic bags like potato chips which would make sounds.&&What twisted fuck nails a nail from underneath a step to poke their wife before they leave for the waterfall?&&but it was.&&r/horror recommend The Silence and Bird Box if you like the monsters in A Quiet Place. Both books use a different take on sight, deafness, and sound as a means of survival.&&Bye bye boys! Have fun storming the castle!&&If you pull your butt cheeks apart it doesn’t make any noise.  Did you guys not figure this out when you were younger?? Pshhh farting plebs I tell you&&And now we have our sequel.

Still, they were taught. 3 months of daily learning to survive is good enough for me to believe it.

Plus as you see in the movie, they still occasionally make mistakes and arnt perfect.

Edit. You know what? I have more to say. 

When AoS cliffhangered in a space setting Inhumans hadn’t come out yet and I had hoped it would spin directly off from AoS. 

Instead we got a giant turd sandwich that somehow managed to be *worse* than Iron Fist—which I thought would be difficult but they somehow made look easy.

Oh dear&&The fact that she's also a good actor probably helps too.&&Quality comparison, well said. Saw the film yesterday and 100% agree. &&Really great comparison. Loud noise made me jump but in a world like that loud noise would make me jump. &&I think a lot of people would mention it actually. It would have been too fourth-wall-breaking for me and would kind of mess the film up tonally. Sure, it’s funny.

Did it move me emotionally?  Hell yes.  

Did it scare me?  Not really.  &&It's not even really jump scare. Just more like an on the edge of your seat suspense film, I really liked it. &&And all of them were necessary to the plot. Not a single useless jumpscare.&&I'm glad you think so. :)

My niece is deaf. When she was six, she appeared in a movie with Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain called ""Take Shelter."" It's actually a really great movie. Jessica Chastain's signing was really solid and she still chats with my sister in law from time to time.

So anyhow I'm 48 years old and my biggest claim to fame is the accomplishments of my six year old niece, but whatever.&&Looking very much forward to it.&&Actually, my brother and I talk about movies a lot. Sometimes (not often, but sometimes) I'll say ""Something you might not have caught was the way the music did X, Y, Z there, which suggested something different than what you were seeing."" Or similar.

But, you'd be surprised how captioning for the hearing impaired will describe sound effects and music. It's not quite the same as actually hearing it, but when you see [suspenseful music] in the captions, it helps the deaf audience to have a similar experience to the hearing audience.&&> how they figured out they are armored

Bullets bouncing off of them might have been a clue&&This is just my opinion, but people in their 30s who have taken care of themselves are way better looking than people in their 20s. A little bit of age is sexy. This applies to men and women. &&I’m 32, 33 must be deaths door.

Group of country boys behind me were actually dipping/spitting into a damn popcorn bucket (could hear it all...yuck), and tapping their goddamn boot heels.

Then some guy five rows down had his phone in his lap the whole time and didn't believe in screen dimmers. And the best? Every freaking chair needed some WD-40.

I'm going to have to re-watch the film later, because I know I missed a few things, and it was easily one of my worst movie going experiences to date. &&No it's not like that at all, but that's a super legit fear that somehow never crossed my mind. The trailer is a very accurate depiction of the vibe&&Mine definitely got silent after about ten or fifteen minutes, but there was a lot of popcorn bag crinkling and other random sounds for the first bit. It got way better after that though.&&you got lucky.  idk wtf is wrong with people but so many people kept getting up and leaving the theater and coming back in for whatever reason within the first 10 minutes of the movie.&&Exactly how I feel. I get annoyed by audience noises in the theater and get way too distracted to enjoy the movie, and that’s when it has sound. This one will be rented immediately and watched at home.

There's even a scene where they show she's not allowed to go downstairs because she might make the stairs creek, complete with her very carefully jumping from board to board.&&Honestly, the movie had a lot of faults in regards to the Monsters and their reaction to noise but aside from that it was a good movie. It's a good point that you brought up that never even ticked in my brain. You would think they might have marked quiet spots for escape reason or something. You would also think they would have gone through more trouble sound proofing things but the faults with characters and their plans are what make the monsters stronger and scary I guess.&&Exactly, it was super strange to me they they didn't go live next to that waterfall&&Same, deaf as fuck with competing sounds but hear fine when it's even a quiet single sound&&Those are the stakes - she doesn’t need to know how little her parents know. &&My face during that whole sequence was just frozen shock and horror&&you just triggered my very baked teenage memories of trying to open and munch on sun chips quietly in the middle of the night with my parents upstairs.&&Is it one of those movies where she's unaware that she's in danger, and lots of nothing happens until the third act? I hated The Strangers, because shit was happening in the background that the characters didn't know about, and therefore didn't know to be afraid.&&That's only you, mate. Sorry&&Shit got wrecked too hard and too fast for people to probably figure it out.

I was hoping that there'd be something more unique. Still a good film though.&&We don't know that they didn't. The film follows a family that is basically stranded with no communication from society.  For all we know San Diego is actively destroying them and reclaiming land. &&[There's others living nearby, or at least, there were.

I can be mentally young and not sink into the ""I'm an old man"" pit but my left knee and my back give the limitations.  &&well, i’m 22 and the fact you refer to the glory days, so to speak, as being 24 that makes me feel better. i’m already starting to feel like life’s left me behind, but that probably has something to do with my unemployment and lack of education. &&I wish him luck on his journey&&Fun fact: WD-40 stands for water displacer and it used to remove solvents and degreasing, the lubricating properties come from the dissolving components and doesn't last. &&There was a fucking baby in mine. Making noise through the entire movie. I literally need to see it again it did grip me at the end(I ended up crying) but I feel like I was distracted all through the first half. &&People that think it's acceptable to have a bright phone screen on during a movie so that they can check their fucking messages in real time ACTUALLY deserve to be beheaded.

You're not important. Turn your fucking phone off. &&The first time I heard of the movie concept I thought of eating in silence next to my noisy husband for every meal and realized in that situation I would fling myself from the top of the highest structure or let the monsters come get me.&&I hate the sound of eating popcorn.

Oh what could have been.&&She was so good as the Angel of Verdun.&&Realistically I watch the episode about once every 2 weeks lol&&Fun fact, there is no beef in nacho beef. Its just kids. &&My big question is where did the pointy thing (trying to not spoil) come from? &&I haven't seen the movie, but I've seen the trailer and read a plot overview. I imagine the land next to the river would require a lot of effort to prepare for farming, most of which would be very loud like chopping down trees or tilling acres of new land, plus they'd have to somehow silently or very quietly build a house.&&What were they going to do? Saw and hammer away and make a cabin by hand? Unless there's some house that was shown there that I'm forgetting about.&&Lol in a quiet place, I understand almost every. Once we get into a noisier place fuck I'm deaf. I really should think about hearing aids. 

edit I made an appointment for the ent yesterday.  I havnt been to the doctor in over a year. We will see where I am at. Also hopefully deal with my chronic vertigo. &&Interesting, I read it differently - I think she's well aware of the severity, I think it was more about the fact that he was worried that she might screw around somehow and set off a noise putting them in danger. I don't think he fully trusts her after what happened with her brother, and that was largely why their relationship had deteriorated.&&Kind of. The movie starts out that way with the dude in the background being a creep. Then he’s basically outside all night and nothing happens for a while. Also, super cheesy ending IMO.&&[If the newspapers were still around to publish stories saying ""It's Sound!"", the militaries of the world were almost certainly still around.](#spoiler)&&Dang, i didn't even notice when they lit the fire at the end that there were no other fires that time. &&I think he knows she’s a stronger actor than him and gave her room to shine in the script and the direction.&&I just thought he was Jim, like not really acting just kind of being himself.

And that guy is super cool. I'm not that cool. :)&&With Take Shelter, the director Jeff Nichols, Michael Shannon, and Jessica Chastain were all *very* kind and sweet with my niece. When my brother first said they'd been approached to put her in a movie, I actually warned him off of it. I kept imagining all the terrible stories you hear about how children are treated in Hollywood and I was really against it. It turned out to be a very special experience and really positive for her. In fact, the one thing it ruined for me is Michael Shannon: I can't see him as a villain in any movie or TV show. I can't believe the performance because I know how kind and warm he was to that six year old girl for the entire duration of Take Shelter's filming.&&Well, I don't want to brag but I played an integral role in reading my brother's text messages while they were shooting in Ohio and I was in Ottawa. So yeah I guess it's fair to say they couldn't have done it without me. :)

Good movie though, right?&&I never met her, but according to my sister-in-law both she and Michael Shannon are the two most thoughtful, humble, lovely people you’ll ever meet.&&[Sign School](https://www.signschool.com/) is a good place to get started for hobbyists. You know... if you just wanna see some signs in motion or learn a few words. Have fun with it!

This is a very important point to bear in mind, however: If you want to learn ASL, you can't learn it just by learning the vocabulary. There's a sentence structure. There's grammar. Signs are contextual and conceptual, not word-based (by that I mean: There's a different sign for ""run"" depending on whether or not it's your nose running, a clock running, running a race, running a campaign, etc). 

Picking up a few signs for fun is totally okay and you should do it if you feel the inclination. But be aware that you can't really learn it properly unless you start meeting and talking with deaf people who speak it natively. There's no way around that.

Edit: I hope that doesn't come off as discouraging. Go hit Sign School and have some fun. :)&&Oh yeah. Having it explained to you is no replacement. But it’s better than nothing. &&Fun fact: WD stands for water displacement, 40 represents the amount of attempts it took the creators to get it to function correctly. In an alternate reality the mixture is called WD-39 or WD-41. Can you believe it?&&That doesn’t seem very fun :(&&For anyone wondering if this is actually true..

Yes it stands for ""Water Displacement 40th Formula"" but the rest is false. 

From the Wiki:

> The long-term active ingredient is a non-volatile viscous oil which remains on the surface to which it is applied, giving lubrication and protection from moisture. This oil is diluted with a volatile hydrocarbon to make a low viscosity fluid which can be aerosolized to penetrate crevices. The volatile hydrocarbon then evaporates, leaving behind the oil.&&The cinema I go to most of the time recently introduced nachos, they're next to their popcorn in the snack shop.

I saw Girl On The Train before I saw Edge of Tomorrow, and in GOTT, she's so homely and unattractive. She's just depressing looking and her character has this pathetic sadness about her. She's a mess. And that's exactly what her character is supposed to be like. Then I saw Edge of Tomorrow and all of a sudden she's this sexy badass who can kick an alien's head off or blast it off at a thousand yards, and she totally sells the role. It's crazy. Her range is crazy. &&Made by kids for kids&&Are you referring to when the laundry bag pulled it up straight? &&True, but they didn't really address how loud farming is anyway.

But 1, it should be down, not up, and there weren't any that were in their ""proper place"" on any of the other painted spots. &&That's a good point, but I imagine farming can be accomplished, albeit pretty inefficiently, while also remaining quiet, especially if the family (presumably) acquired a farm that was already operational. The only thing I can think of that would necessarily make a lot of noise would be tilling, but if the soil was already tilled before the invasion and doesn't get too compacted, they may not even have to do that. Everything else I can think of, harvesting, sowing, watering, etc., can be done quietly if it needs to be.

Fortunately they don't need to provide for more than a single family and they have an entire farm, so they can probably harvest and store what they need for the whole year.&&I'm figuring that they just didn't light their fires since the fireworks might've freaked them out or something.

In nearly every role he performed in, there is always a substantive delay before I realize that the character is portrayed by Gary Oldman. &&I completely agree with you.  This is why I hold a very unpopular personal opinion that Denzel washington is a wildly overrated actor.  No matter what role he's in, he's always just denzel washington.  As opposed to someone like tom Hanks, who you actually find yourself invested in the character they're playing, not the actor.&&He'll get there fast and then he'll take it slow &&I certainly learn enough from Reddit that I feel grateful for the chance to give a minuscule amount in return.

I absolutely love The Sandlot. Such a wonderful movie and the best quotes.

Edit: words&&This, the Goonies, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, and early Jackie Chan films were my childhood.&&The Sandlot is one of the best movies....

PERIOD.&&Not many sports films are about winning. Actually if you break it down The Sandlot is hardly about baseball. It's more like 25% baseball, 25% friendship, and 50% sensless screaming. &&You just described Feild of Dreams as well my friend. &&The Sandlot is one of the best coming of age movies, especially for kids born in the 90s.

Teaches you:
To face your fears, because they might not be fearsome at all

To take chances while you can

To make friends wherever and whenever you can - - because some of them might end up being your best friends in life&&Even though it's set I believe in the 60's, kids who grew up in the 70's, 80's and 90's can relate. I'm 33 and the best times of my life were spending all day in the summer hanging with friends. Running around the neighborhood and just enjoying being a kid. This movie captures that nostalgia perfectly.&&Plot twist: The Sandlot is literally all about winning. Winning games, winning the girl, winning smack talk contests, winning friends, winning the ball back, winning a different awesome ball from James Earl Jones, winning a beast doggo, winning everything in general, and right before the end credits that show all of the actors who won by playing in this classic there is a list of all of the characters life wins, and in one case a disappearance (could also be considered a win for some). 



&&I was always jealous of that 4th of July block party they had. &&Speaking of, I bumped into [this winner](https://deadspin.com/the-sandlot-is-full-of-little-shitheads-and-terrible-ba-1824265872) the other day.

They beat the shit outta the rich kids team, squints gets the lifeguard, benny beats the beast in the pickle, and at the end of the movie benny steals home to win the game for the dodgers... The only time the kids in the sandlot lose, is when they go to the fair with the chew.. They all get sick. Other than that, its a non stop win fest.  &&I so wanted the erector contraption. I asked for one for christmas, and took it out the box, put about 2 pieces together, got frustrated that I couldnt find the right pieces, said screw it, threw what I had assembled along with the box, and forgot that it existed. &&I recorded a podcast with the director (mostly about his work on Beethoven 3 & 4 but we talk about The Sandlot quite a bit).

The Colossus of clout!

THE COLOSSUS OF CLOUT!?

BAAAABE RUTH!

THE GREAT BAMBIIIIINNOOOO!!&&I'm sorry, but 'The Sandlot' is *not* one of the best baseball movies.

It is one of *the* best movies.&&I read that in his voice &&It's not just one of the best baseball movies. It's a huge piece of Americana.  I feel sorry for any American who cannot relate to all of the joys of an American childhood that are shown to us in the Sandlot.  It's just such a picture perfect representation of what life truly was like for a lot of us growing up.  As ""feel good"" as it might be, it's true.  And that's what makes it so amazing. It summarized the American dream of playing the game and growing up.  

Edit:  A lot of people took this as thinking I'm old and want to preach the golden years of the 50's or 70's whenever.  I'm 25.  Grew up in rural California.  I played little league. Went to the carnival.  Watched the fireworks.  No, none of it was a s picturesque as the film, but the film encompasses a very ""American"" way of life for a lot of kids.  Of passing time during the summer and getting in trouble.  The kids weren't playing ball all the time.  It's just one of the things they do.  Squints on Wendy is ""sexist"" in today's world apparently.  No, none of us probably did what he did, but all of us tried to do something at one point or another, and again, the sandlot just puts it on screen perfectly. &&> They never kept score

Forget Squints making out with Wendy Peffercorn or the size of the Beast - this was the only part of the movie that wasn't realistic. 

I used to be a little boy who loved baseball and played it all the time with my friends. We didn't just keep score, we argued over everything, especially over the allowed running behavior of ghosties.

Edit: Good points, fellas. Now that I think about it, we kept score, but we didn't care who won. &&[deleted]&&The feels.&&This was my friends and me with hockey. We'd wake up super early on a weekend, push the shopping cart full of goalie pads and super 88 tape down to the schoolyard, and get a game going that lasted until the street lights went on and we couldn't see the puck in the dark. Great fucking memories. &&Your killing me smalls!!!&&Henry Aaron?  I don't know why, but can I have this, kid?&&The Colossus of Clout!&&The Great Bambi&&The Sultan of Swat!&&It was like salt in an open wound. Even my mom, a grown up girl, knew who Babe Ruth was.&&First? Did you read the part at the end right before the credits? Squints did way better than first.&&When I was a kid, my friends and I used to look forward to every summer together in a way that I have never been able to since I have gotten older and have become a guy making his way through his twenties. Looking back on my childhood, it seems like we were always together and were always spending our time at the township pool, playing in our backyards, riding our bikes to get ice cream, playing video games, and finding a way to extend our time together for as long as possible until our moms called us home for dinner or when it started to get dark outside. I never thought that those days would end and I never wanted them to. Even now, I feel like those were the happiest days of my life. Well, we all know that nothing lasts forever and that we all have to grow up sometime. I guess I just wasn't looking forward to it as much as my friends were when we were 14. 

Every summer, nearly every person where I live makes their way to the beach for as long as they can for vacation. My friends and I always looked forward to these times because we loved swimming in the ocean and playing whiffle ball on the sand, going down to the arcades and blowing our money on dozens of games, and of course we loved going on as many amusement park rides as possible on the boardwalk while stuffing our faces with cotton candy and ice cream until we practically hurled from it all. It was the summer before high school and by that August when we were all at the beach for a few days, I felt like I was having the best summer of my life. June and July had been so much fun and I made so many lasting and unforgettable memories with my friends by the time that August rolled around and we all headed to the beach with our families for what was usually the ""last hurrah"" of our summer vacation. 

For some reason, my friends told me that they didn't want to play basketball at the park one night like we always used to do and instead they wanted to go up to the boardwalk. I was confused because for years we had always played hoops whenever we could and went to the boardwalk to go on the rides and to play video games. I figured that we would be partaking in the latter activities until my friend Joe said ""Oh yeah, wear khaki shorts and a polo."" I wasn't sure why I needed to get ""dressed up"" to play arcade games and go on rides but I said ""Alright, whatever"" and showed up that night to meet my friends on the boardwalk with the nicest clothes that I could wear that I had bought from PacSun that summer. 

I got to the boardwalk and saw my friends standing around, looking like they were all dressed for a date or something. We all then started walking along the boards and I tagged along, unsure of where we were going. We walked for a few minutes until my friends spotted a group of teenage girls and guys our age who were all posted up along the railings and on benches looking out near the ocean. My friends stopped walking and did the same and started sizing up the guys and ogling the girls wearing their flip-flops, shorts, and spaghetti strap tops. I just sat there, not saying a word, while my friends started talking about which girls they wanted to talk to, who they wanted to ""get with"", and what they were going to say to ""get to first base"" with the girls. None of them really knew what to do so we ended up sitting on that bench for twenty minutes until we saw that group of guys and girls start to walk away from us down the boards. All of a sudden, two drunk blonde girls with cigarettes and red Solo cups loudly announced their presence to us by stumbling up the boards from behind us and yelling unintelligible things at us. They must have been in high school, probably around 16 or so by the looks of it. My friends didn't miss a beat and raced up to them to start talking to them but the girls weren't interested in talking. They immediately started sloppily making out with all five of my friends while I stood off in the distance and watched it all unfold, unable to move. Their sloppy kissing only lasted about thirty seconds but that was all my buddies needed. By the time the girls stumbled away from them my friends were celebrating like they had just hit the lottery. I didn't feel so lucky or so happy. 

As we walked back to our beach houses, hooting and hollering about making out with those girls, my friend Bobby noticed that I was lagging behind the rest of the group and wasn't saying anything. He dropped back from the other guys and said to me ""It's alright man, you'll get some next time"" and then returned to my group of friends ahead of me. Bobby thought that I was upset and quiet because I didn't get to hook up with those drunk girls or with those other girls that we ogled for about twenty minutes on the boards that night. I wasn't upset about not hooking up. I was upset because in that moment, on that night, I realized that the part of my childhood that made me so happy and that meant more than anything to me was gone. Where my friends were now thinking about girls and were going through the teenage experience of thinking about them sexually and romantically nearly 24/7, I was still thinking and dreaming about days at the pool, riding bikes around town, playing whiffle ball in our backyards, and of days that resembled more of the life lived in *The Sandlot* before Squints put the moves on a certain Wendy Peffercorn. While I was stuck thinking about all of that, my friends had grown up right before my eyes and had left behind that part of our friendship and were longingly and excitingly eyeing up the next phase of our lives as teenagers leaving behind ""kid stuff"" and heading to high school.

Looking back on it now, I guess I just wasn't ready for things to be over so fast. Time flies when you're having fun and boy did it fly for me in those days and years that I spent with my friends as a kid. As it flew by, I guess I missed the part where we all grew up that little bit more. That walk back from the boardwalk that night is one I'll never forget. It's rare that you can remember and locate a place and time in your life where everything seemed to change in the blink of an eye. I still miss the times we had together as middle school boys. I'll never forget them. I'll never forget the night I lost my childhood innocence with my best friends.

*""I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 14. Jesus, does anyone?""*&&According to a recent kinja article, it's about ""sexually assaulting a lifeguard""&&My first kiss was during this movie. 11 year old me didn't know what to do. &&Yea, it would pretty rare to make a movie where the main character wanted to just 'go the distance' in a competition anymore.  I guess the most recent one I can think of is that Eddie the Eagle movie.&&Yeah, Rocky literally loses but is still the winner of the movie because he didn't get knocked out. &&Similar to Field of Dreams. It’s about baseball, but not really, but also definitely about baseball. &&What about Rudy? Its not really about competition, or winning/being the best; the movie is about perseverance and hard work. Despite nearly disqualifying disadvantages, Rudy is able to compete at the highest level. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves an underdog story!!&&That’s because Rocky isn’t a sports movie per se. It’s a movie about a person who happens to be a boxer. &&I'm confused. 

Do people not watch sports movies?

Most of them aren't about winning or even competing. 

* Field of dreams - love the game

* Rudy - don't give up just because others say you can't

* Friday night lights - just because your town revolves around football doesn't make you a failure if you come up short

* The rookie - quitting once doesn't close the door for ever

* Cool runnings - being an Olympian means more than just being a winner

* Moneyball - fuck this one isnt even about baseball 

* Invincible - see the rookie

* blue chips - the good intention to win at all costs isn't worth it

* Million dollar baby - independence is precious

* Raging bull - the violence at home reflects the violence in the ring

* The wrestler - wrestling is a shitty business

* Rush - I actually don't know what rush is ""about"" but it sure as fuck ain't winning. 

* The fighter - disfunctional home life limits people's potential

* Coach Carter - there's more to life than basketball

* Rocky 1, 2, Balboa and creed - don't stop fighting till you gave it your all

* The Foxcatcher - be wary of people overly invested in someone else's career out of self interest. 

* Any Given Sunday - see blue chips 

* The world's fastest Indian - chase your dreams 

* Trouble with the curve - I dislike the premise of Moneyball

* The Damned United - just because your right doesn't mean people will listen to you

* Eddie the eagle - being an Olympian is about doing your best

* For love of the game - baseball is great but so is everything else

The point of a sports movies is to use the sport as a tool to move the plot forward in order to tell a story about life. Very few good sports movies are about winning. Even the ones where they win in the end are rarely about winning. More often than not it's about why they won. &&This is too precious.

I think I’m gonna barf.&&Squintz definitely won Wendy Peffercorn’s heart. &&The trophy was the friends they made along the way.&&they got some sweet memorabilia from james earl jones, allegedly signed by babe ruth.

SO... about 3 years ago I was chatting with my dad and stepmom. Somehow the topic of smores came up and my dad said, ""what are smores?""

My mouth dropped, stepmom and I are flabbergasted. Then I suddenly realized I had a once in a lifetime opportunity and blurted out, ""You're killin me, Smalls!""

I had to explain to my 60-someodd year old dad what a smores was. He had no idea those were a real thing and thought it was a hollywood thing.

I'll never be in a more relevant situation than that for that quote ever again.&&It's also a dog movie.

TRIPLE DOG DARE YOU to change my mind.&&It's also kind of about the coming of age for baseball&&It's not about coming of age

It's about Wendy Peffercorn.

Ver&&Oh man hes in deep shit! &&Benny would've played ball all day, all night, rain, shine, tidal wave, whatever. Baseball was the only thing he cared about. But of all the things we ever did besides baseball, going to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine, which we constantly lied about, we figured going to the pool was the next best thing to being there.&&Little pervert!&&I thought it was about building cool contraptions with erector sets?&&You’re *killing me* smalls&&Your house looks like it’s in the perfect spot for a broken window&&You should get a dog, and met a baseball legend, then blind yourself&&This is cool as hell.  :)  &&Not to sound creepy but I am always happy to see kids playing outside doing something. I suppose it's because I fear that kids are home on their computer all day. When I was a kid I would get home from school, throw my backpack on the floor and run outside.&&That’s beautiful &&Hope in humanity restored &&I lived in a cul-de-sac when I was 10.  There were quite a few kids on it. I vividly remember one Spring Break where we all played some form of baseball all day for the whole week.  One of my favorite memories&&The sad thing is that I dont think kids play outside nearly as much anymore. Idk... Maybe Im just starting to get old enough that I miss my childhood. Atleast the good parts. &&I know you're probably a fellow fan sharing my misery, but it still stings.&&Or Hardball with Keanu Reeves.&&The champs get a trophy but they all get beers, seems like a win in my book.&&you booger eating moron.&&I remember my friend having the witch of a next door neighbour that was shrouded in myth. And the ball going over there, us staking it out for 2 hours before somebody finally thinking, ""fuck it"", and jumping over to retrieve it, usually with said witch running out, yelling at us. It was always such a big deal when we were young.&&What about Sandlot: Heading Home featuring the return of Squints&&If it ain't about Bertram getting lost in the 60s I don't wanna see it.&&So bad you can't even do a verb to it. &&I enjoyed it as a kid but it was definitely a bit cheesy and not nearly as good as the original.&&sssssssssssssshhhhhhhhhh... we dont speak of that evil&&The only reason I watched Sandlot 2 was because of the girl. Growing up I had a huge crush on her.&&I remember watching that movie and, right as the chase scene started, I said out loud to my friend, ""they better not have an under-shot of the dog leaping the fence."" They did, and I was hurt.

If you pitched me that movie and asked for my money to make it, I'd laugh you out of the room.

^^^^^I'm ^^^^^just ^^^^^kidding, ^^^^^don't ^^^^^kill ^^^^^me.&&Most importantly, he won a ball with Babe Ruth and *the entire team's* autographs on it. Like... even the one real loss turned into a huge win. &&In that sense what movie isn't at least somewhat about winning?&&Ugh that hurt to read.&&How can you hate life so much hat you write an article like this?&&Wow. So I consider myself to be a feminist, I’m a pretty big Tom boy that greatly enjoys sports and think gender roles are dumb and want fair treatment and less stereotypes and all that. This article however is just ridiculous. She mentions at one point that the movie is set in the 60s and filmed in the 90s, but seems to forget that fact for the rest of the article. She has to understand that even in the 90s, feminism and equality were no where close to where they are today. Expecting modern day political correctness from a film such as this is totally ridiculous.

That said, she’s totally free to have any opinion on the film that she wants and it’s perfectly acceptable that she was offended by some things in the movie, but some of the things she said there were just beyond stupid. No clue how this article got the green light.&&How is that even long enough to be published. On top of that, it's just complete nonsense. &&That hurts to read and I’m kind of sad you linked it and she receives ad revenue for that shit.

It was one of those moments where I was like, no. This needs to be fixed. I immediately ordered pizza and found both of these On Demand, and we watched them together. 

I don’t think he really got it, but at least he understands a few memes finally. &&[deleted]&&You shouldn't feel sorry for someone who didn't experience your life. Nostalgia is powerful but it doesn't mean that your way was the correct way to grow up.

There are probably countless better experiences and sets of circumstances and environments for humans to live through and remember.

I love the Sandlot and I had a very similar childhood. It is magical in my memories. But I also realize future generations will have very different magical childhoods. And I'm open to many of them being better than mine.&&I think it’s the lost ideal of the nation that’s caused so much strife in common life. There was a time that child hood, and especially the American dream manifested itself in culture. This idea has largely disappeared in the last 20 years. No longer do we live in the simple terms of baseballs with our buddies, but the constant scrutiny of the internet era.&&It definitely represented the middle class suburban life.&&>  I feel sorry for any American who cannot relate to all of the joys of an American childhood that are shown to us in the Sandlot

America is really big and diverse. I get that the Sandlot tells a charming story about what childhood was like for a lot of people, and that's cool. And maybe it was just a poor choice of words, but I don't think it's right or appropriate to say you feel sorry for anyone who didn't grow up that way. Some people grew up in different environments, and maybe they cherish that, and that's ok.&&Ghost runners obviously advance as many bases as the hitter! Down with those who say they only move when forced!!&&My buddy works with this guy who lives out in the country and built a field of dreams in his backyard. And every Saturday night in the summer he invites people over and they get drunk and play a double header.  And not only do they keep score they track batting averages, strike outs and everything and at the end of the summer prints up baseball cards with goofy pictures of his buddies and the stats on the back.  

I only got invited once but it was pretty fun.  &&The size of the beast was a cool effect. It was meant to be what the guys imagined, in their minds the beast was that big and fierce. At the end when the dog is running after Benny you can see his real size. &&Nah man, they were 9 kids just having fun, there’s no way they kept score.&&We all lived in the neighborhood for a couple more years, mostly through junior high school and every summer was great.  But none of them ever came close to that first one.  When one guy would move away, we never replaced him on the team with anyone else.  We just kept the game going like he was still there.

Man if that's not Sorkin writing, I don't know what is.&&Yeah, one of my greatest wishes in childhood was to have a group of friends, best friends who did everything together. But I was a depressed child who moved a lot so I never got to be friends with anyone, really. I've always wanted to belong to a group. &&I did. I miss them a lot as an adult. We each went separate ways after high school.&&Let’s be besties. Hi. My favorite color is yellow, I love the Red Sox, and I have a fat corgi. My older brother is a really good cook and he has a podcast about NASCAR, which I know absolutely zero about, but I listen anyway because he’s my big brother. I love weeping willow trees and right now, I’m sitting in the busted leather chair in the middle bedroom at my house listening to the rain fall outside.  It’s 7:42am.

Amazing!&&Well now I wanna kill myself&&For me that moment was when I was 16 and the friends who lived behind the house I grew up in moved across town. I known them for most of my life and thought they really liked me but as I helped them move the whole time I couldn't help noticing the distance between us. I think it had always been there-I've always been a weird kid-but at that moment I realized most of my friendship with them had been one sided. I was just that chubby kind of annoying kid from next door.

 From that point on I never really felt like I had any real friends. I didn't meet anyone I felt I truly connected with until 2014.

Reading what you wrote really struck a nerve with me. I never really admit it, but I am so scared of growing up and the future. I miss the days of being a kid so very much. I miss all my old friends, playing outside every day, all those laughs we used to have together. Those were honestly the best of times. Now I'm 25 and I have my job and my daughter. I have bills and responsibilities now. How I miss the days where the thing I had to worry about the most was getting my homework done. Now I'm just overloaded with stress and anxiety and it's hard to cope with sometimes. When did my life become like this? It feels as though my childhood flew by and was gone in an instant. It's so crazy to think about it now. I'm terrified and I'm trying to just take everything a day at a time. Reading all these comments, and yours especially, is like a hard punch in the gut. I miss it all so much. I wish I could go back. Sorry for the long rant. I really needed to get that off my chest. &&Hollywood needs to put out more emotional sports tearjerkers.&&What about Creed? &&Cool Runnings and Eddie the Eagle&&Rocky was the winner because he reached his goal, which would've been impossible for him at the beginning of the movie, and that's lasting 12 rounds with Creed.&&Bingo. That movie is why, though I love the Sandlot, it cannot be favorite baseball movie. Because if you grew up playing baseball and loving it, it’s in your bones and when you reach an age when you don’t do it anymore, or cannot, or it’s been soured by overzealous parents / coaches, it’s almost like a part of you is missing. &&Except the real Rudy was a piece of shit.

Also he was offside.&&Cool Runnings is probably a better example&&Rudy was despised by his teammates and is now a convicted felon. God bless!&&Also, Remember the Titans&&Was thinking the same thing. I don't remember how many times I watched that movie with my dad and my brother. Never was a big football guy but it never mattered. Rudy had everything to do with the man himself and his personal trials that lead him to the field. It's still my standard for sports movies so many years later. &&And the sandlot isn’t a sports movie per se. it’s a movie about some kids who happen to play baseball.

Of course they’re both sports movies, sport is integral to both of their plots&&Also Mystery Alaska&&>I dislike the premise of Moneyball

Fuck you got me with this one.  Too bad that movie was very mediocre and Moneyball, even though it was based on a non-fiction book that didn't really have a plot, was very good.

Also, throw in Bull Durham, the Natural, Eight Men Out, Mr. Baseball, 42, Mr. 3000, and Summer Catch.  Most baseball movies aren't about winning.&&You're killin' me Smalls!&&*TEQUILA!*&&Big Chief!

Legit thought it was a fake movie &&I like to pretend it never happened.

Life is better that way.&&Man, I was a kid when they released the original, and I fucking loved dinosaurs even before that. I can remember the first one in vivid, terrifying, tragic, glorious detail. I remember the tracking shots of characters running through the foreground and background, over the unforgiving landscape, through the goddamn bones of other dinos. I remember the genuine peril that Littlefoot and co. were in for almost the whole movie, peppered with just enough levity and adorable character designs to keep me from bowing out. And the wonderful payoff at the end.

And the others they pumped out on home video for a decade, and which were installed in every after school daycare VHS shelf like an ankle biter's Criterion Collection... one of them had a baby T-Rex. And there was a comet or something. And one had a girl Littlefoot. That's all I got.&&It made it believable to real baseball fans. And real baseball fans and comedy fans are the ones who watch it 25 times. Bull Durham too. The realism in other places lets you ignore (mostly) Tim Robbins' pitching motion&&Major League 2 stopped at the ALCS. Major League stopped before that&&Unrelated but there's always one thing that bothered me about Varsity Blues:

In the very last game of the season, all is on the line for the District Championship. Our heroes, West Canaan High, come from behind and win it. 

Mox, the backup quarterback who really just want to go to Brown, saves the day and they win. In the closing narration Mox says ""After that, I went to college and never played football again.

But hold on, you just won the District Championship. That means you get to play for the State Championship. Mox is the backup which means there is no other quarterback. By not playing he basically denies his fellow teammates the glory of winning State.

Mox is a fucking asshole.&&Same with Rookie of the year right? I don’t remember too well but I didn’t think they were playing the Yankees in the World Series. &&And Tin Cup&&The Matrix is also not about baseball...arguably a great movie. &&And A League of Their Own&&SHE DIDN'T LIKE FIELD OF DREAMS?&&Was my first thought when I saw this thread. My two favorite baseball movies. They have absolutely nothing to do with an actual game of baseball. Just people who have a really interesting story, which happens to deal a lot with the idea of baseball.&&The ""I believe in..."" monologue is great too. I don't think I've ever been that passionate about something to someone. You can see susan sarandon melt&&Bull Durham is the actual best baseball movie. Sandlot is *probably* second, then some combo of Major League, Field of Dreams, and fucking Angels in the Outfield. Maybe Rookie of the Year. &&Forrr        evvv         verrrr&&I love that movie.  But sometimes I actively avoid it if I see it is on because I just know I'm going to get choked up and teary eyed at the end of it.  There is something so powerful about the simple act of a father and son just having a catch.  I love that ending scene...it gets me every damn time. &&Just like Shoeless Joe&&I think it's because it, unlike many other sports movies, doesn't market us a moment. But instead makes connections with why we love the game as a whole. 

I think Roger Ebert said it best when he said (paraphrasing) ""Field of Dreams isn't a sports movie. It's a religious movie. And the religion it preaches is baseball.""

It's so perfect it gets me crying every time. That end with the dad. Terence Mann's speech about the game... All great.&&I would have no issue with a movie like this being made today because I think it's a pretty accurate depiction of what goes on. Young boys aren't debating the merits of feminism. They are being boys. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes it's ugly. But it's just who they are. I don't want to see some ridiculous movie with a bunch of young teenage boys acting like social justice warriors tip toeing across the landscape trying to avoid being offensive. Just my two cents.

Jesus, does anyone?”&&There are some movies, that you have to be the right age when you watch to truly appreciate and it’s always a bummer to meet someone past that age, who hasn’t seen them. They’ll still probably enjoy the movie, but it just doesn’t have the same meaning. &&those are definitely movies that lose a lot if you are not a kid when you see them. however goonies is even worse than those when it comes to trying to show it to adults that haven't seen it before. don't even bother.

edit: I recently rewatched the 90s ""trilogy"" of nick cage action movies (the rock, con air, face off).

They are all cool in their own way, but face off and con air are just so god damn bad and cheesy and just bad, but the rock is all right, even though it is a bit bad. the rock holds up, the other two not so much, but they are still fun, dumb, things.&&I recently did the same with my best friend!  The same 2 movies!  We're both 30, and I just learned that he hasn't seen either movie.  So we watched them both... same reaction.  He enjoyed them enough, but he didn't ""get it.""  Kinda seems like you have to watch them as a child to get the full effect, even though Stand By Me is a pretty adult movie.  He's also a big nerd, so maybe his childhood was just too different from what's portrayed in the movies. &&You’re killing me Smalls!&&Nope.

3. Dennis Quaid

Worst: 

1. Kenny Powers 

2. Tim Robbins

3. the guy that played Eddie Harris in Major League&&Sorry what, I started imagining whip cream bikinis&&And For Love of The Game&&[deleted]&&/r/himym is leaking&&It truly is beautiful. I think just about every American man wishes he could go back and play catch with his dad one more time. It's the most beautiful thing.

Even if you aren't into baseball, you probably have a memory of playing catch with your dad. And even if you don't, it's about what it represents. Life tore those two apart, but at the end of the day... Ray realizes that he is his dad's boy. And that's his *Dad*.... Not just his father. His *Dad*. 

The innocence of the game. The simplicity of ""I don't want to play against you. I don't want to win or lose. I just want to waste time with you"" is beautiful. I think I'm gonna cry, man.

""Hey Dad... Wanna have a catch?"" ""I'd like that."" gets me every time.&&The Jet stole home! The Jet stole home!&&When I was a kid and first started to like girls, I conceptualized Benny to be the guy who I should try to be like if I wanted a girlfriend. No idea why, nor do I know why I'm sharing this. I just thought that kid must be like exactly what girls wanted to be with so I tried being like Benny Rodriguez.

Unfortunately, I eventually realized that I was simply too ugly to be like Benny. A realization of myself that has carried with me for  nearly 30 years now. Man I wish I was beautiful like Benny&&He put some Asian guy in the hospital about 2 years ago. Asian dude was handing out candy and for some ridiculous reason Benny the jet and his crew accused Asian dude of handing out laced candy during Halloween. They followed him for a bit and then choked him out and put him in the hospital. The attack resulted in the guy getting brain damage.

Benny the jet was able to remain working as a firefighter and was given a slap on the wrist.&&_b-b-b-Benny and the jets_&&FOR-E-VER&&You're killin me Smalls!&&I must be doing it wrong.

Ray Liotta is the voice I heard.&&“They NEVER kept SCORE. AFFLACK”&&I would literally rewatch every movie that had a narrator if Gilbert Gottfried redid the narration for all such movies.

>We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold... Suddenly, there was a terrible roar all around us, and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, and a voice was screaming:&&Gives me chills every time I hear it&&Aaaand crown thy hood. Yes he did!&&Not as good as the spread from Hook that the Lost Boys had. Another favorite of mine that also summarized the freedom, innocence and the fun of childhood. &&That's one of my all time favorite movie scenes. Possibly #1 even. No other movie scene has made me feel as responsibility free and relaxed as that. The scene is like a vacation from reality. && I have been to the Great Wall of China. I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt. I've even witnessed a grown man satisfy a camel. But never in all my years as a sportscaster have I witnessed something as wholesome, as American, as what we witnessed there.&&I prefer my friends now to the friends I had when I was 12.&&Depends on the person I guess. Most of my best friends now are the same friends I had when I was twelve. We all stayed in contact with each other and almost all ended up in roughly the same professional field. I talk to them and hang out with them at some point pretty much every day.&&That sentiment did nothing for me. I don’t recall having any good friends when I was 12, and my oldest friendship now dates back to college. &&Jesus had 12 friends.&&This is more true than most people can even understand.&&Exactly this. I've tried to watch the goonies a couple times  and I've never been able to get into it. I missed my chance and it's just a cultural touchpoint that I've resigned myself to being on the outside of. Nostalgia goggles are an amazing thing though.&&Yep, Goonies was one of the few movies I missed growing up in the 80s/90s, watched it has an adult and couldn’t even get through it.  Yet I have so much love and nostalgia for everything else mentioned. &&I absolutely grew up on sandlot. One of my all time favorite movies. But I never saw stand by me until this year. It was like watching the sandlot for the first time all over again. Shit made me gitty. I loved it even never have seeing it as a kid. &&Yeah, after those ones fell flat, I didn’t even try with Radio Flyer. That one’s such a weirdly brutal movie, that it just seemed best to let that one stay off his radar. &&THEY SHOULDN'T SCORE FROM SECOND IF THE DOUBLE WAS A HIGH FLY BALL THAT HAD A CHANCE AT BEING CAUGHT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED RUNNING. Ahh good times that inevitably devolved in to whiffle-bat themed violence&&Yes. Hank Aaron was the first to break Babe Ruth’s home run record.&&Yes. Hank Aaron broke babe Ruth’s career home run record in 1975. 39 years after babe set it. That record stood until Barry bonds broke it in 2007.

Movie was made while Aaron held the record in the early 90s. Movie was set in the 60s when Aaron was in his prime. &&I just read something about the pool scene.  Movie was shot in Utah and they shot that scene on a cold day.  When I went back and watched the movie it’s pretty obvious they’re all freezing when they’re in the pool.

If two people love fucking each other that much, they absolutely tried anal. Jury is out on whether or not they did it repeatedly, or if Wendy was even a fan, but I don't think anyone could convince me that a couple who loved to fuck as much as those two **never** tried it.&&Por que no los dos?&&but please do not let this exposition distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Cardinal Ximénez off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table&&Thank you, even if it feels like such a small impact I appreciate that. I couldn't just force him to change his ways, that's for him to decide and I must accept that. It's very hard unfortunately.&&The last time I did that he was falling into an alcoholic stupor and my fiance doesn't want me around that kind of influence.

&&I got my first job when I was 14. I was a little twerp, the youngest employee by at least 2-3 years and not very bright or great at my job. after I messed something up one day, one of them said the line “you’re killing me Smalls”

And that’s how I became known as “Smalls” to everyone at the whole company until I left 4 years later. Most people didn’t even know my real name. &&Same with “you play ball like a girl!”.... if they said that in a kids movie today the entire movie industry would shut down.&&F-O-R-E-V-E-R&&9.

I've never held it against Eddie Harris because he's supposed to be an old junk baller.

Like look at RA Dickey and tell me you can't cut Eddie some slack.  He almost took it the distance when it counted most.&&""That's good advice!""&&Agreed. As a Chicano, it was really good for me as a kid to see characters like Benny. The same actor also played Luis Mendoza, the super fast guy in Mighty Ducks. Those movies made me proud of my heritage, and made me think I could be as cool as him. 

And to your point about being too ugly; fuck that man. Don’t say that kind of shit about yourself. Get a fresh cut, get some new clothes, ask someone on a date. Confidence and beauty comes from within. &&I wish I was taller, I wish I was a baller, I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her, I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat and a six four Impala&&So come dance this silence down through the mornin'

It's so bad.&&CALiiFORNYa&&Nah it’s perfect, you have a ragtag bunch of misfits that played casually in their schools computer lab, but the administration wants to sell off the computers and build a new football field. So the kids have to win the Big Tournament to save the computer lab. They enlist the help of one of the kid’s uncle who used to be big in the arcade circuit. 

One kid has issues with his family not approving of his hobby, one kid gets bullied and probably ends up getting an arm broken right before the Important Match, and one kid is super poor so he doesn’t have a computer to practice on at home. 

Coach helps them all solve their problem and grow up, and as they start to win matches the town starts to rally behind them even if they don’t fully understand it. They lose in the finals to the Super Talented Korean team, but they get enough donations to save the lab. And coach probably gets a job at the school teaching computer science. &&So does Rocky &&You were the Jerry/Gary/Larry/Terry.&&Entire studios would crumble.&&“YOU PLAY BALL LIKE A GIRL!”&&Helicopter strangers is the bigger issue.

I lived in a rough area during a rough time. I lost many childhood friends to drug overdoses, prison, suicide, and general street violence of various sorts. Somehow, a small handful of us managed to make it thru to midlife. The sad part is that we seem to stay away from getting together because its more painful to see that its only 3 or 4 of us left as opposed to the 12 or 15 tight friends we had growing up. Its not a great time reminiscing when 75% of the stories are about the friends we cant be with. So we drift apart and stay that way and technology now makes it so much easier to stay in touch while keeping our distance. I will never have friends like those kids again, but i dont think i ever want to. Ill enjoy the friendships i have for what they are but they will never be the same as those in my childhood. &&good lord look at him shiver.

However, I could totally see that film turning into a universe like Cloverfield. I hated the first Cloverfield, but the others got better IMO. I think the directing was spot on throughout the movie.

I'll check back in with you guys when we watch it a year or so from now&&A lot of them buy insane shit and need to keep churning out the money to pay for it.  The smart ones just live a semi normal life except for the ability to never work again and can always go out for dinner every night.  Hell if you are smart you can stretch 1 mil at least 10 years and still live it up a ton.  If you are real smart you can be patient and never work again with that money.&&A lot of actors will get booked by a studio to do 3 films and end up being contractually obligated to be in a few shit movies. &&I understand this though, it is a job for them at the end of the day. Have you ever taken a job/paycheck that you weren't 100% keen on? 

I've got no problem with actors doing some fluffy project for the paycheck, can't blame them for earning as much money as they can &&He's well-known but it's not quite an A-list celebrity so he is in that point of his career where it makes the most sense to do these kind of movies. He is definitely a very good actor, seems to have a good head on his shoulders and overall seems like a very nice guy so I wish him the best of luck in the future.&&The Office residuals are probably making him more than enough money, so he can feel comfortable enough to pick and choose his own projects.&&Wouldn't be surprised by this either, especially considering the post I saw yesterday saying the writers of A Quiet Place almost tied it into the Cloverfield anthology. I'd love to see some of the ideas they cut from AQP.&&So A Quiet Place is Alien and This new movie is Aliens where they are just killing tons of shit&&I don't think so. The synopsis reads thus.

> The project will adapt a short story by Cecil Castellucci titled We Have Always Lived on Mars that centers on a woman who is among a handful of descendants of a Martian colony long-abandoned by Earth following a cataclysm. The woman one day finds she can breathe the air on Mars, upending her world and that of her fellow colonists.

I mean yea, it could be made into that but I think if it were a sequel to A Quiet Place, they would be more blatant about it. Why hide it.&&Sequel in a prequel way, or sequel in the ""Zathura-as-a-sequel-to-Jumanji"" way?&&His next film is just going to be shot for shot the same thing as A Quiet Place but every minute the image will slowly and slightly shift to the left so that by the time the film is over the screen is near the copier.&&Krasinaissance&&*Half smile smirk*&&I saw a comment on another thread that pointed out that half of Jim's comedy was facial expressions and then Krasinski goes and stars in a movie where he can almost never do anything but communicate via facial expressions. 

This movie was made for him. &&It's pronounced ""kernel,"" it's the highest rank in the military. &&You went to Cornell? &&Ever heard of it?&&I bet you’re sick of Tuna, probably have it every night&&My guess is that A list actors rarely do these films (no prestige, little pay), and studios rarely look for them (they usually pay scale or near scale for nobodies). 

Talent costs a lot.  

The MO of the horror film business is low risk high returns. Making film like Crimson Peak for $60 million makes it a bomb at $110 million, but making Oujia for $4 million and making $110 million makes it a huge success.

The ironic part is that what makes horror and thriller films good is the ease with which the audience can identify with the main characters — ie good actors make you really empathize with them, making you feel like you’re there with them.

IMO it’s why Signs was even scarier. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix shitting their pants really sold it.

If A Quiet Place starred....like...Joel Kinnaman and Ruby Rose, it would be awful. &&[removed]&&Gender neutral sacks of money &&If it sells well we'll see more like it.

Publishers only want to fund what sold well yesterday.&&I was lucky. Full theater was dead quiet during the quiet scenes. Once music started playing people started to dig in.&&I think this guy is going to be a very respectable director, and I really look forward to seeing anything he makes.  It was just so pleasant to actually see something truly different for a change.  &&[deleted]&&I always grab a monster bag of popcorn when I go to the theater, as I dont go too often these days.  Every quiet scene, I stopped dead.  Mouth full, hand in the bag, I didnt dare move as I didnt want to spoil anyones time (I hate when mine is spoiled by the same thing).

Then BAM, action scene and I destroy the corn as fast as I possibly can.  I know my window is short.&&It's a great balance of tension and classic monster chase action. Jaws meets The Road. I loved it.&&The theater I was in decided to play it right next to their other screen showing Ready Player One.  So I was there watching this movie with beautifully subtle sound design while KING FUCKING KONG and the T-rex are rattling the walls.&&Exact same thing happened to me last night.

I would imagine sound is very muffled. Would make it hard to hunt.&&Brb making a horror movie with puppies&&Absolutely. It also was real good at giving tension right from the opening scene, and all that tension makes horror movies (movies in general really) great. The concept itself lays foundation for so much.&&I can't remember the last time cried watching a movie, and I actually felt a tear well up in my eye at that part.&&Not as much as it tore him up...&&If your wife doesn’t mind, why not watch it by yourself?

I was just thinking about these exact same reasons. &&People think I'm nuts when I say if you have a million saved up by around age 30 you could make that work so you could retire right then and there. You would have to invest super smart and live a rather frugal lifestyle (and get lucky/live healthy) but it is forsure possible. 

Edit: grammar&&Why become rich and famous if you don't even have two castles?&&Like how Leno never spent any of his Late Night money. Only spent money from stand up gigs and let the TV gigs stack up piles of cash. &&I’m sure his wife being Emily Blunt also helps out. &&He has those sweet The Office residual checks.&&Not TV actors like Krasinski, whose show is syndicated. He’s going to be paid more than 99% of Hollywood in his lifetime. &&Indeed. If I had successful actor kinda money I'd have a nice home in a nice place, paid for, and not much else. Then I'd probably proceed to do as little as possible for the rest of my glorious, useless days.&&I always remember my BIL telling me if he won $1m from the lotto he would just put it in the back and keep working. Pay off all his bills and just he financially stable as the fuck. &&Well, if you have a a couple million, you can make some safe investments and live entirely off what you get from those your entire life.&&You remember the ice bucket challenge? Him and Emily Blunt did it out the front of their house and they definitely seemed to be living modestly. Considering both of them are A-listers, it was refreshing to see them living on a normal-looking street, in a normal-looking house.

With both their salaries, living like that means you're set for life. He can afford to take large risks.&&I literally said ""I'm shocked they didn't just rope this into the Cloververse,"" as we walked out of the theater today.

There are some jump scares but the tension really comes from the avoidance of noise. &&I was holding off a coughing fit that I could feel building up for the whole movie. When Emily Blunt screamed, I let er rip. It felt so good, and I was amazed I held it off before and after that scene.&&Saw it tonight.  Big theater, and only 6 other people in the cinema.

The silence was impressive.&&The whole movie was pretty quiet for me except my girlfriend inappropriately started cracking up when they showed the baby crib with the top to it and the gas mask

Definitely saving that trick for the future.&&I was EXTREMELY unlucky haha.  I saw it in a big open theater.  Not only could I hear every sound people made but it was directly next store to the single loudest Bollywood musical I have ever heard.  I walked out of my theater for a minute to see if the other theater was packed.  There were 2 Indian people in the way back...&&The rattling AC was on for the first half of the movie and it was raining so we though the movie had white noise to make viewers more comfortable and we all thought it was a dumb idea

Then it turned off and then it stopped raining, right after Emily Blunt changed the lights, and we realised the movie had just gotten real&&But her friend is nowhere to be seen; now she walks through a sunken dream&&Station to Station is a perfect song. &&I prefer Lazarus to Blackstar I think...&&Gonna have to be a strong no on that from me! Don't get me wrong I still love Hunky Dory to death but is it really better than the likes of Low or Station to Station? It has a few weak songs \(Fill Your Heart and Kooks specifically\) where the other two are pretty much perfect in my eyes.&&Is there life on Mars?&&I wish the US version had found an audience, but I'm glad they were able to finish their plot, weird as it was.&&Did you watch the sequel UK show Ashes to Ashes?&&I watched that ending when I was like 12 and thought it was the most brilliant piece of TV I'd ever seen.  Looking back on it, it really felt lime a cop out.  Although I'm not sure what else they could have done&&What happened is they got cancelled so they had to come up with an ending quick&&Luckily, the original British version managed to pretty much achieve that so all isn't lost&&I feel like this is a big difference between US and UK shows. 

UK shows plan a couple seasons and their beginning, middle, and ends.

US shows have a pilot and a concept for their first season and they just make it up as they go as long as they are still making money. Even after they ""end"", sometimes they make another season because money, and we end up with saved by the Bell the new class, and scrubs new class or whatever it was called, etc.

&&They rarely do. &&Season 1 honestly is skippable, they were trying to clone be British one and it just didn't work. But the show comes into its own in Season 2, instead of replicating the British show in America, they re-made the show for American audiences. The writing and performances from season 2 and onward are just way way better.&&Yet another Phillip K Dick adaptation.

Who saw that coming. &&Technically yes but I don't think they ever give that much of an identity to the car in Life On Mars, so the Quattro gets more of an association with Gene&&Ah, yes you're right - I was close, but no cigar... &&One more reason Ashes to Ashes was better.&&Big if truna?&&Big if Haircut&&Ummm...maybe this isn't the right subreddit but... Is there life on Mars?&&Police brutality? Lots of it!&&Well, for point one, she's a kid. She probably didn't think about those batteries at all, after John's character moved them onto the counter and out of the way. The second one, I agree with. I thought that scene was going to be the one where they figure it all out. &&The first time her hearing aid warded the monster off she didnt even see it happen.  It was behind her and she had no clue it was there in the first place.&&well the first monster she didnt even see, she just heard the loud noise. Also the second time she had her eyes closed because the sound was so incredibly loud and high pitched (i think)&&You think you'd immediately put together the cause and effect of the first sound you've ever heard in your life?&&I don't know, having the mother yank the laundry but not checking why got me pretty good. What about the old man crying out of grief but also to fuck over Lee and his child? It was good but I don't really understand the second coming praise it's getting.&&[deleted]&&For the first monster she wasn't even aware it was there. She was facing the other way and was, you know, deaf.

Then in the silo it happens again and by the time she is in the basement she figures it out.

I'd just pay off debt.  Buy a few rental properties outright and keep working.  Maybe cut back to part time if I could afford it.&&They seem to be acting like it was only considered briefly to be written into the Cloververse, but they have to be downplaying it. I feel like the original writers definitely wrote this to sell to Paramount, but didn't do it possibly when Krasinski stepped in.

It fits the formula too well. A sci-fi/horror film where the focus is on humans dealing with a monster of mostly unknown origins. Hell, this fits more into the Cloververse style than Paradox does.&&""MICHAEL!""&&God I love Andy&&Yeah I am **not** a horror fan because I am a big wuss, I even went to watch A Quiet Place staright after work so it would still be light when I got out!

But some redittors convinced me that it wasn't *really* a horror movie and perhaps if it were marketed more as a thriller it would do better. because that's how I felt it was.

In my opinion it's as much a 'horror' movie as something like I Am Legend or Alien, Life etc. The tension comes from the plot and sound not stupid jump scares and over the top horror creepyness&&That's hilarious on a meta level. Almost like you were playing along.&&i appreciate you. someone was coughing a crazy amount in my theater and you cant really get mad at that it just sucked&&We need ushers that attack people who make too much noise.&&Same here. Your ears are just straining for any sound.  Fun movie experience. &&I got so mad at my bf for laughing at the same exact part. As soon as they covered the top of the box he started laughing quietly and then when I looked at him he full on erupted in laughter and had to leave. I’ve never been so horrified because everyone was looking at us. &&When did you walk out? That movie was tense for all 90 minutes &&>next store&&My theater was okay. But they forgot to shut the door to the theater! So I got up during the first scene as stealthily as possible and closed the door. I don't want to hear lobby noise for fuck's sake.&&To the room with the clearest view,

And she sits in front of the silver screen&&[deleted]&&[sick guitar solo]&&*Maaaaaaaaaaaaaars&&I was also glad that it wasn’t a 1:1 rehash of the UK version. &&Some people give shit to the US one, only because it's ""a remake of a UK show not as deep as the UK show"" so people says. But if you take it on its own, it was a very pleasant show. Interesting visuals and cast, with an array of social issues being treated in a different way than in the UK show despite some being based around the same plot. 

And, yeah, a feel good ending for the US one, but sometimes that's all you want in your day, to dream a little. I would have liked to see more, but at least they closed it neatly. 

If you have not seen it however, you should check out the first pilot they tried out for the US version. The tone was very different and sorta over the top cop-show dramatic, and it took place in LA instead. I'm glad they took the time to change it all.&&Yeah, it came and went too quickly.

Another great show that sadly got cancelled after 1 season was FlashForward.  No idea what season 2 would have brought though, since season 1 ended basically with the same kind of event season 1 began with.&&That was a good show too. It wasn't as great as its predecessor, but Keeley Hawes knocked it out of the park.&&I did. It wasn't as good - the Simm/Glenister chemistry wasn't there - but it wasn't bad either.

The revelation at the end of the series [that they were in some sort of police officer's purgatory](#spoiler) was interesting as well.&&I'm pretty sure it actually was a cop out. Like they didn't know if they would make it before the ending was written, found out, and had to get the show wrapped up in a hurry. &&If you dunno what else they could have done, there’s always the UK original and its sequel show. &&Sounds like The Office.
&&You what mate?&&[deleted]&&Sorry man, kid or not, I feel like you should know the less risk for making noise, the better. You could tell he was a hyper, not very well behaved kid, and that's from 3 minutes of seeing him, his sister (and parents) DEFINITELY should've known not to give him any toys.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&She pulled with so much force. You don’t do that and expect the result to be quiet. Something like that happens you take your time to fix the situation quietly. Then notice what was causing the problem in the first place and deal with it. This really screwed up the movie for me. Also, how did he not notice the water running when he left the basement? He surely would have heard that. It was just an ok movie. 
&&Well from working on a farm in my youth,it's entirely possible and probable to die from falling into a grain silo. A boy I worked with did just that. &&I have issues too. Like what the hell was going on? These alien/monsters showed up I guess and just killed pretty much everyone? What about the military? If a shotgun blast to the face killed it in its weakened state, I’d imagine stronger weapons would have some effect. Hell they had giant ears/holes in their heads. 

Also, I don’t know if it was poor set design or what, but why weren’t all the floors in the house (including the stairs) covered with carpeting or clothes or something. They go through all the trouble with the sand, but don’t sound proof the house at all? 

And the biggest one to me is WHY MAKE A BABY. That’s fucking insane in a world where you need to be quiet. 

Still enjoyed the movie, but don’t really feel it’s deserving of so much overwhelming praise. &&The power was the big one for me. That and the fact they can hear noises from miles away but can't hear someone breathing in the same room as them?&&[deleted]&&How the fuck did the plant all the corn? They had to plant it that year because volunteer corn is shit that isn't fit for cows and gardening isn't really all that quiet.

How did they make it through the winter? You know they had to go out and make wood at some point.&&Oh that's funny. Michael!&&Nah, Dwight really loved hip-hop.&&What the fuck am I doing on reddit then? I'll be back in an hour!&&Live Free or Quiet Hard &&The Quiet Place Reloaded

And Emily didn't get into the film until after reading the script and insisted to John that she needed to be the person to play the mother.

He made a lot of sacrifices for money so me and my sisters could be comfortable and go to college. Now we've all graduated, and my mom's salary can support the two of them, so really he just needs to earn enough so they can retire on time.

&&The concept is Sam Tyler is a detective from 2008 who inexplicably travels back to the 1970s after an accident. The show deals with the culture shock of different approaches from the different times, and a few anachronisms leading you to question what is really going on, and whether or not Sam is going mad.

In the original British version, the ending is slightly vague with the insinuation that the 70s is a purgatory of sorts. Sam wakes up from his coma, and is back home. He resents the modern world, and commits suicide to return.

In the American version it is revealed at the end that Sam is an astronaut on the way to Mars, and both 2008 and 1973 are computer simulations to entertain her on her journey.

I got chastised for being on my cell phone BEFORE THE PREVIEWS STARTED!,41931,88urzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/88urzc/i_got_chastised_for_being_on_my_cell_phone_before/,4060,1522623436.0,"Look... I get that complaining about other movie goers has become a legitimate hobby for many cinephiles, but shit has gone too far. 



Earlier today I went to see the film ""The Death of Stalin"". Side note: it's really good, but it's also exactly the kind of movie that packs in pretentious dipshits. Anyway, I was in my seat, on my phone (browsing the reddit app actually) -- NOT DURING THE OPENING CREDITS -- NOT EVEN DURING THE PREVIEWS -- but during AMC's bullshit ""First Look"" segment, in which Maria Menounos takes you on a journey to discover 'what's hot in Hollywood'. I assume everyone knows what I'm talking about. It's basically 30 minutes of glorified commercials interlaced with actual commercials. 



The couple behind me started talking about how much they hated people who used their cell phone during movies. However, I could only decipher every other sentence and didn't think it was possible that they were passive-aggressively talking about me. But then the guy started clearing his throat in that suggestive way. 



""No..."" I thought, ""there's no way he's angry at me for flipping through my phone during the 'behind the scenes look' at some stupid pre-teen movie both of us will never see."" 



When the ""First Look"" segment ended, I did what you're supposed to do... I turned my phone on silent and put it in my pocket. Keep in mind, this was before the green placard even showed up to announce the first preview. The dude behind me starts clapping. CLAPPING! 



I'm sure he read some post online about some annoying person ruining the movie and the whole audience started clapping to collectively shame them. I'm sure he said to himself ""oh man, next time someone's on their phone in a movie theater, that's what I'm going to do!"" 



At this point, I did something completely counterintuitive to my Minnesotan upbringing -- I turned around and said ""Oh, I'm sorry... did I ruin the commercials for you?"" I got no response and turned back around. Shortly thereafter, while the theater showed that clip asking the audience to silence their cell phones, saying 'Please, don't ruin the movie for others' -- I waited for silence and said ""Also, please, don't ruin the M&M commercials for others"". Admittedly, that move was classic Minnesotan. 



So that's my story. That couple can choke on their sense of entitlement. I'm an extremely polite person when I'm not telling people to choke on things. I care about others enjoyment. But for the love of christ... this 'movie etiquette' movement has overstepped its bounds if I can't check my text messages 20 minutes before the movie starts. 









EDIT: I'm kinda surprised there's as much downvoting as there is with this post. I wrote it during peak anger, but I assure you that I'm actually open to hearing other perspectives. I just can't for the life even invent a reason why phone use pre-previews would cause any harm to someone's moviegoing experience. Is it a Minority Report thing?  Are you trying to prevent future crimes? It just seems to me that people are making up these 'rules' as they go along. Why is phone use considered distracting, but their audible conversation wasn't? To me, it looks a lot like r/gatekeeping -- a need to arbitrarily place oneself above others. ","A few years ago my husband and I went to go see the Lion King when it was doing a special showing. Well, the movie starts and there is no sound. That goes on for like ten minutes, before I turn to my husband and ask ""should we go tell someone"". SOMEONE SHUSHED ME. There was like maybe five other people in the theater, so it wasn't hard to distinguish who did it. I turned around, stared at her like the idiot she was (she was avoiding eye contact so I couldn't stare into her soul) and said ""really?"". Eventually the sound came on, I was still annoyed cause we missed the circle of life :( EDIT: I got a bunch of replies asking why nobody got up sooner, especially for such an important scene in one of the greatest movies of all time. I can't speak for everyone, but for me it was mostly due to an assumption that they knew there was a problem and were trying to fix it, they would restart the movie when it was fixed, and I really didn't want to get up and talk to anyone.  So yeah, mistakes were made that day. The sound came on almost immediately after I really'd shush girl. I don't remember how long exactly, but I remember it was while I was still trying to figure out why someone would shush someone in a movie with no goddamn sound.&&I pulled my phone out during the ""Silence Your Cell Phones"" reminder, specifically to silence my phone, it is a reminder after all. Asshole behind me immediately kicks my seat and yells at me. To this day I wish I had the balls to say ""no shit,  that's what the reminder is for"". &&When I went to see Hostiles I was in a similar situation when I quietly asked the person next to me if they wanted any popcorn during the commercials before the trailers. Some guy walked into my field of view, flipped me off with both hands, then returned to his seat a few rows back. I sat there for a minute wondering what I did wrong and by then the guy had already yelled at another group. I think he ended up moving to the first row so he could be as far away as possible from other people. &&I went to a 9am showing of Split & only one other person was there. Which I thought would be great because less people usually makes things better. But about 15 minutes into the actual movie, homie's phone rings. Dude answers it & proceeds to talk very loudly for the next 20 or 30 minutes. I'm rarely confrontational, but finally I turned around & very loudly said ""Dude! Seriously? You pay theatre prices just so you can talk on your phone? Shut up or leave."" I spent the rest of the movie certain I was gonna get my ass kicked at credit roll, but he did shut up & didn't hurt me.&&Holy cow this is weird. The same thing happened to me at death of Stalin. The guy was even five seats over in my row and got up to give me shit while the lights were on before previews. I had no idea how to respond. Maybe it is something about that movie. &&Until the graphic telling you to silence your phone rolls, you're in the clear. That guy was a douche. &&>AMC's bullshit ""First Look"" segment, in which Maria Menounos takes you on a journey to discover 'what's hot in Hollywood'

The fact that you remember anything after she appears is amazing&&> I turned around and said ""Oh, I'm sorry... did I ruin the commercials for you?""

EDIT: Can I get a dollar every time someone responds with ""And everyone clapped!"" or ""r/thathappened""? It would help me out.&&I feel like anything before the previews is fair game. You’ve got the lights on, people trying to find their seats, so on. Once the previews start, different story.

Those people behind you were douches. &&Semi-related but my new pet peeve is someone taking my seat when I have pre-selected seats. Like 90% of theaters here have had this for years and somehow I am a huge asshole for telling someone they are in the wrong seat.

I went to the theater with my brother once and this lady was in one of my seats so I tell her. She gets up and moves one seat down and I have to tell her yet again...that she is a seat I had reserved. She gives me the dirtiest look and moves like 6 seats down. Like 3 min before the movie starts some other couple has to tell her the same thing. &&I honestly don't give a shit what you do as long as you don't do it during the actual movie. &&I went to see a movie once with my brother and little cousin, we went through all the commercials and everything and it got to the ""please silence your cell phones,"" before the movie starts. The screen just goes black and the lights were already off, so we were just sitting in darkness. After about 5 minutes, I whispered to my brother ""should I tell someone?"" And I got shushed from somewhere behind me. I kinda just waited another 10 minutes before a group decided to finally tell someone with me, the theater manager comes in with an announcement saying he's getting it fixed asap. We got upgraded to 3D for free as well as free popcorn for everyone. I still don't know who it was that shush me, but the movie literally wasn't even on..&&I feel you. Some fool berated my group of friends for not sitting down fast enough even though the lights were on and the screen was showing still images, deodorant ads and whatnot.

That would have easily warranted a ""Are you fuckin' right, cunt?"".&&I took my parents to see Coco back in the fall and a kid behind us tipped her popcorn all over my mom and I. The movie hadn't started yet, so I went to find an employee to see if they could clean up our seats a bit (don't get me started on the kid's parents not giving two shits). When the employee came, she told my father and brother (sitting on my other side) to turn their phones off--the theater wasn't darkened, no previews were playing...wtf? We were sitting in front of a terror and covered in his popcorn and you're going to chastise two grown men for being on their phones before a movie has started? Generally the most frustrating movie-going experience I've had--so bad I haven't gone back to the theater, even though it is 2 blocks from my house.&&My dad wears hearing aids and he controls them with an app on his phone, movies are too loud to keep them on so he turns them off shortly before the previews start. Some asshole behind us got after him once, and my dad doesn't like confrontation so he just stopped with only one of them off and meekly mumbled an apology. Guy made a snide comment to what I assume was his girlfriend, so I turned around, explained the situation and then told my dad to finish turning his hearing aids off. He threatened to complain to the staff, so I threatened to explain to the staff how he was treating my dad. No one is rude to my dad when I'm around. People can be major assholes. &&Were it me i would have just said ""i'm sorry but, would you mind keeping it down?

Also, kudos for the response. Well done.&&I really wish you were the one in my theatre last night at Ready Player One. Instead I had a teenager looking at his phone constantly throughout the movie. He was down a row and over a bit so I couldn’t really do much without making a big scene. But why look at the weather in the middle of the movie? Or Messenger? Ironic that the message of the movie could have taught him a thing or two haha.&&Am I the only one who feels bad about all the sodas people are spilling on purpose and candy/popcorn people are throwing at other people that someone has to clean up? &&Fucking hell me too, just yesterday. During the adverts, while I was on my phone (of course), some cunt came down the isle and said ""is that screen going off at anytime?""

Anyway, Ready Player One is a very enjoyable movie.&&Alamo Drafthouse is very strict about their phone policy, but they also only start the ""Quiet Zone"" period at the end of their pre-show, right as trailers are starting.&&If the lights are on, fair game. Once they go off, turn your phone off.

Yeah, those people were assholes and I hope they read this and realize they are.&&This happened to me once. I can't remember which movie but the movie got interrupted with technical difficulties. The house lights came on and I checked my phone, saw I had a text I should reply to given the opportunity. The house lights went off without warning and I promptly put my phone away. And I mean promptly. Well it wasn't quick enough and the person behind me kicked my seat obnoxiously several times.

Anyway, as with any other art house movie the theatre was with awkward and uncomfortable seating, and it was during a Film Fest, so it was packed as well. The movie starts and people are still making some noise trying to get into their seats, kinda distracting but then again not really their fault in this case. 

An old fuck, apparently a movie critic, had the nerve to COMPLAIN about people making noises, and then didn't stop talking with his friend next to him how UNCULTURED movie-goers were, 10 minutes into the film, after *repeatedly* being told by people to shut the fuck up.

Later in the movie he had the nerve to proclaim how people *shouldn't* be laughing at certain scenes, because those weren't funny, they were *sad*, you see. He did it loud enough to he heard, but quiet enough to claim he didn't meant to be heard.

It was as if one of those hyperbolized hipster caricatures you see in online comics came to life and aged up significantly. Boy, did I want to confront him after the credits. What a jerk.&&If the theater didn’t intend for you to use your cell phone during “the 30”, why would it be littered with instructions directing you to various websites and such on the spot?

People being on their phone is encouraged before the movie now but the amount of people who fucking check their phones during a movie is ridiculous. One of my co-workers live posted all of ""It"" to snapchat on the night it came out. Then bragged about how her boyfriend threatened the guy who told her to shut it off. 

I've been threatened for asking people to turn off their phones before as well.

There were a handful of jump scares that got us and the group of adults behind us--which meant there was some screaming, some gasps, some quiet ""what the hells"" etc.

At the end of the film some guy comes storming up to us snarling that we ruined the whole film and to think of others and this was supposed to be a nice time out with his family!! No one responded, and he stomped off in a huff, followed by an apologetic looking wife and two kids who were definitely too young to have seen the film. 

I thought it was hilarious, but some people in my group were really upset by it. Your responses were golden though haha! &&Me and my friends are season pass users; so we go like 5 or 6 times a month, and I personally have no issue with people being on there phones right up until the point where the film certification pops up, but I think phones at that point should be turned off not just silent.

Main reason is many people are still inclined to check their phone if its on, nothing more immediately distracting in a dark cinema when a bright phone screen surfaces out of a pocket.&&While lights are still up you can do with your phone whatever you want. If that bothers others, they should stay at home and watch NEtflix.&&Yeah, fuck that shit. Until the lights go down, it's all good.

I think you were in the right. &&As long as the lights are on, I will quietly be on my phone if I wish. At least for me, it's really only distracting when there's a bright ass screen in a dark room. Speaking of bright lights, the damn exit sign was totally in my face during the last movie (not very many bright scenes) we went to see. I wish they would dim those just a bit.&&I read your edit on the surprise for the number of downvotes... and I might just point out something that older people like me that are quickly reading your post (more accurately title) might misread.

>I got chastised for being on my cell phone BEFORE THE PREVIEWS STARTED!

'On the phone' equates to 'talking on the phone' cause old brain.  I know you go on to qualify it, but maybe some of those votes could be attributed to seeing your title and that's all the more they needed to read for a quick downvote (cause Reddit)...

I actually don't know what else you could attribute to 20% of disagreeing with your post.  I don't know if I've ever been to a movie where people aren't browsing on their phones prior to official trailers.  

I know you can't change titles...  but maybe knowing this is a possible reason for at least some of those votes will help you sleep better.  :)&&[deleted]&&What really happened here : dude is on a date with his girl and they have nothing to talk about. She decides to mention some dumb shit about phones at the movies and the guy tries to act tough cuz his girl is around.&&You were right.  Fuck those entitled whiners.  How is a cell phone interfering with their commercials with the lights on? 

&&I imagine that some of the reactions we're reading about here are from people who may have in the past had to tolerate cell users who didn't shut off their phones when the movie started.  Perhaps their comments were preemptive, in their minds.&&So I'm one of those people that will call out someone for being on their phone. I won't hesitate either. That having been said, previews and commercials are free game and i'll even give the benefit of the doubt for the first couple minutes as I know you can't just drop a conversation sometimes, but after that all bets are off. If you want to be on your phone for the whole movie though, I only ask 3 things. Volume off completely, screen as dim as possible, sit in the back corner. I'll also call out conversations as well. I enjoy the theater for the experience, otherwise I would just watch the movie at home.&&Yep.  Sounds like people.  I remember going to watch a movie with some friends as a teen and getting yelled at for talking during the time before the previews.  Some guy threatened to call the usher, and someone else chimed in to yell at us.  I don’t know if the man never had the “joy” of commercials at his house, but no one else cared.&&I upvoted!! For anyone that downvotes why is it ok for someone to speak about and then clap at someone else in public in an obviously aggressive manner. I salute you sir/madam for standing up for yourself :)&&These are the rules:

1. During commercials, anything goes

2. During previews, be respectful and aware of the fact that others may be watching, but quiet comments are okay. A very quick phone check is okay if the house lights have not yet dimmed

3. Once the movie starts (including fanfare and opening credits) no talking or phones&&Agree 100%. 

I watched Michigan vs. Loyola yesterday during the “commercials” before RP1. Thankfully no one treated me that way, I might not have as polite as you were. &&The rule has always been you put away distractions when the lights go dark.&&I'm a manager at a cinema and the other day a dude threatened physical violence upon another patron because he was on his phone during the previews. I had security go stand in the theater lol... like how mad can you get? It was in a Christian film too&&If the lights are on do what you want. If they aren't don't.&&As far as I'm concerned if the lights are still on and you don't have your phone glaringly bright, or making sounds when you tap, then it shouldn't be an issue.&&Damn...tbh, those two couple behind you ARE an idiot and DID overstep their bound with that shit...

You PAID to watch the movie, not a bunch of commericals or adveristments NOR the damned trailers that just going to hit TV later (for those that actually watch tv, the rest just find out in /trailer).&&Yeah, before the movie starts anything goes as far as I'm concerned. In fact I prefer that people talk and laugh and look at brightly colored phone screens during the commercials, trailers and PSAs. They can then get it out of their system and let me enjoy the movie in peace once it starts.&&I figure if the lights are still up, it's fair game for conversation, phones, whatever. I'm personally not fussed about people fooling with their phones right up until the main feature starts.

This guy was clearly a self-righteous douche and your comeback was great. &&Yeah, I would have just turned around and said, “Yeah, almost as bad as talking during a movie eh?”. 

If that received a likely response of, “the movie isn’t playing yet, asswipe”.  Well, then a shit eating grin would be in order. &&It’s a legitimate problem, cinephile or not. I never give a shit when it’s previews. However on Saturday I was at unsane and a girl to the left of me kept checking Instagram every 5 mins with er phone on full brightness.

Before that at the last Jedi a couple of months ago, someone took a phone call.

Then two weeks before that at The Post, a guy spent the last 20 mins of the movie reading Facebook. 

Couple of months before that at haindmaiden at a really posh London cinema, my gf asked a woman who’d been on her phone repeatedly and kept flashing it in our direction to stop going on her phone and got called a ‘c**t’. 

If you’re that bored, for the love of God please GTFO. God forbid I should expect to be able to watch the movie I paid for without some a**hole who feels their right to indulge a phone addiction overrides my right to watch a movie undistracted by said phone addiction.

I also blame cinemas for not enforcing the rules. There should be a staff member in every screening whos job it is to suppress this behavior.&&You can be on your phone all you fucking want before the screen that tells you to put your phone away and to silence it. Im paying money for the Movie, not the fucking commercials. &&People are dicks.  This is a big part of why I don’t often go to movies.  If I think it is good I’ll save the money and buy it digitally a few months later.&&All the stories in here about rude people on the theaters is brining back memories from my experience seeing Justice League.  
  
I went to see Justice League soon after it came out, so it was still fairly busy. I showed up about 20 minutes early, browsed my phone and listened to music during the Maria Menounos pre-preview commercials. By the time previews started and my phone went away, two loud obnoxious people sat behind me. They loudly ""whispered"", if you can even call it that,  through all the previews. I was thinking ""oh great, I'm stuck in front of two teenage girls."" I was starting to get worried, but thought I'd wait and hope they were considerate enough to shut up when the actual movie started.... nope. They continued talking through the entire movie, ignoring plenty of shushes from me throughout.  
  
Credits roll around, and they still haven't stopped talking. I'm fairly annoyed at this point, not only because of the talking, but because one of them was completely unable to recognise characters and would constantly ask who people were, sometimes multiple times in the same scene. But the moment in their conversation that made me lose my shit was when (spoiler) shows up during the post credit scene and the really dumb girl says ""OH MY GOD, IT'S DEADPOOL! I TOLD YOU HE'D BE IN THIS"". That sentence, for whatever reason, motivated me to turn around and curse these teens out, except they weren't teens, but a mother and her 12ish year old son.
  
The conversation went like this:  
  
Me: Can you please shut the fuck up for 30 seconds? You've been talking the whole movie!  
  
Woman: Excuse me? You a child, and you show me respect!  
  
M: Oh, like the respect you showed to everyone else in the fucking theater when you couldn't be quiet?  
  
W: You think you can cuss at me?  You a child who needs to respect adults. You parents failed at raising you.  
  
M: Ma'am, I'm an adult too but my parents did fine raising me. They at least taught me to be respectful at the movies and be quiet, unlike you.  
  
W: I'm going to get the manager!  
  
M: Don't worry about it, stay here and keep talking, I'll go get him.  
  
We both leave to get the manager. In the hallway to the lobby, it continues.  
  
W: I can't believe it! I spent good, hard earned money on these tickets only to be cursed at by a no-respect child!   
  
M: I paid $9 dollars for my ticket too, as did everyone else in the theater. We all paid to see the movie, not get your fucking commentary with it!
  
Manager hears problem.  
  
Manager: Is there a problem here?

Me: Yeah, this woman wouldn't stop talking through the movie.   
  
Woman (in background through the entire conversation): He needs respect! He is a child, and he cussed at me!

Manager: How bad was her talking?  
  
Me: Full volume through the entire film, with at the most, 15 seconds of silence between her talking.  
  
Manager: Did you swear at her?  
  
Me: Yeah, and I probably shouldn't have, but I'm a bit pissed after 2 hours of her commentary. 
  
Woman: He admitted it! Ban him! I want a full refund!  
  
Manager: Hold on, I'll deal with you in a moment. (To me) Sorry about all this.

I shake his hand and leave, all while she's still complaining.  
  
I went back to that theater to see The Last Jedi a couple weeks later, and the manager recognised me, gave me a discount on the ticket, and told me how that woman freaked out at him after I left, so he banned her. 
  
Holy shit, this became a really long story, I'm sorry.  
  
TL;DR: Saw Justice League, and ended up in a swear filled fight with a loud mother. She asked the manager to ban me, but got banned herself. 
&&Don't they tell you before the real shit starts happening the whole ""Please silence your cell phones now""  
Fuck those guys. 
Glad you enjoyed the movie though 😄&&With 10 minutes without sound, people should get a partial refund IMO&&[deleted]&&That's straight out of Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

*The big deal, sir, is that a grown man shushed me and my friend here!*&&You should have told a manager. You might have gotten free tickets or $x off of concessions.&&> really?

My favorite no-brain comeback, next to ""no u""&&That is quite possibly the worst movie ever to lose the sound for in the first ten minutes. You missed the massive 'DOOF' sound on the title drop at the end of Circle of Life, which is one of cinema's all-time most satisfying sounds. Dammit I'm angry on your behalf just thinking about it.&&How did ot go on that long? Had it happen once durring star wars anh and that was fixed and restarted in less then a minute or so&&ugh , hate having that ""wish i woulda said.."" feeling... but you were caught off guard and not at all ready to be hostile. And then the moments passed and you've got the rest of your day to write a retort in your mind&&I had this happen this fucker kicked my chair i walked right out go a manager and he and his GF were removed from the movie. fuck that guy&&An engineer in town from India went to opening of the last jedi with me and answered a fucking Skype video call during the movie... I was horrified. No one did anything though so I learned over and whispered to tell them not to. &&Or shine the flashlight in his eye ""by accident, I swear.""&&Yeah no, I would first have to restrain myself from yelling back at the guy and then go and get the manager, that is beyond unacceptable, he kicked your seat, was this a large 3 year old who went to his first movie with extremely negligent parents. Act like a normal human being dude. &&Which is why I don't go to the movies any more. I have ticket and snack money, but I don't have bail and lawyer money. &&The French have an apposite phrase for this situation: “Esprit d’escalier”, which roughly translates as “staircase wit”. The idea is that it is only when climbing up the stairs to retire for the evening that you think of the perfect witty retort.&&Wow, he fucking kicked your seat?? The nerve of some people. Immediate escalation, nothing verbal first? Take solace in knowing that if this person keeps doing that he will one day kicked the wrong person's chair.&&First row? perfect for throwing popcorn at him. &&[deleted]&&Some people shouldn't be allowed in public. Clearly this is a person who missed a developmental stage or 2 in their life.&&When I finally saw the first Avengers movie, the hype was already over and the theater was nearly empty. It was just me and a friend, a random guy with his girlfriend sitting behind us, and a group of 4 black guys sitting in front of us, and I swear to God one of them looked just like Snoop dog (this is important to the story, I swear...).

One of the guys in front of me would not shut the fuck up. I didn't want to be confrontational, but I did.. I was basically teetering on the edge of ""do I snap and say something? Maybe he'll just shut up on his own...""

Eventually, after close to 40 minutes of him talking on and off I told myself that the next time he said something I'd tell him to shut the fuck up. And sure enough, it happened. Not 30 seconds later he speaks again. Some unrelated babble about bullshit nobody cares about. This was it, my moment to shine, I took a deep breath ready to snap and I hear the guy behind me yell in what I can only describe as a *you just pissed off your drill sergeant* voice: ""**EY. SNOOP DOGG. SHUTYOURFUCKINMOUTH.**""

That guy was the hero of the night. I kept my mouth shut and laughed about it. 12/10, been waiting for my chance to use it ever since.&&*I think he ended up moving to the first row...*

Oh he just don’t love himself.&&He was the real hostile. &&The only thing you did wrong was waiting 20-30 minutes to tell him to shut up. I would have said that after 20-30 seconds.

&&> I spent the rest of the movie certain I was gonna get my ass kicked at credit roll, but he did shut up & didn't hurt me.

That's the thing - I feel like there are certain situations where someone is behaving *so* bizarrely that I'm actually afraid to confront them because their lack of social awareness indicates a high chance that they are a violent psychopath! &&It's possible he didn't realize he was alone in the theater. Doesn't make it too much better, but it's a bit more understanding&&My dad and I went to see The Dark Knight and a couple in their 30s was sitting in front of us. The lady had a shawl around her shoulders that she used to ""cover"" her phone every time she turned it on to check it, but the shawl was so thin that you could still see the screen clearly. She did this throughout the film, and every time made my dad a little more angrier. Finally he said something and the dude turned around, ready to fight. Nothing ended up happening, but it was still kinda scary. &&This is why I added that snarky bit about 'pretentiousness' at the beginning of my post. I don't think it was coincidence that both of our stories happened before this particular movie. I think some art-house/indie cinema fans take themselves way too seriously and start drift into 'gatekeeping' territory with their supposed ownership over the film going experience. It becomes an identity thing.. a way to distinguish their appreciation of celluloid from the herds of Marvel movie-goers. Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of independent film and enjoy art that challenges my expectations. I'm not knocking cinephiles, just the pretentious dipshits. &&Commie bastards everywhere&&Apparently it's a touchy subject but I don't mind anyone being on their phone during trailers, graphic or not.

After trailers though, turn off your fucking phone.&&[deleted]&&I just can't handle her fakeass everlasting smile. It's like she's got fishhooks pulling her lips into a smile

&&Her [laugh](https://youtu.be/EHIurkbvOA8) is... kinda scary.&&I love that she always plugs her website at the end, too. As if anyone is going to use it.&&He totally forgot the movie though.&&I can't stand that lady. She talks super loud all the time! Just talk normal! &&I wish I had the balls to say things like that at the theater lol.

Until then, I will live vicariously through OP.&&One time I was at a classical concert and I was bobbing my head with the music. The guy behind me said, ""are you going to bob your head the whole concert?"" and I turned around and said, ""I'm sorry, is my head getting in the way of your ears?""

Like, damn, guy.&&One of my most humiliating experiences happened in a movie theater before the previews. I went to go see The Force Awakens with my dad and was updating him on my life and how my daughter got into a school for kids with autism that I’ve been hoping she would be able to get into for years. I was in a really great mood and excited that I got to see this movie with him since he’s had melanoma and I appreciate all the time we get to spend together. He goes to the bathroom so he doesn’t miss the previews and this older woman in front of me turns around and says in a snotty, condescending voice, “I’m so glad that you’re having a great time, but could you calm down before the movie starts?” and rolls her eyes. It felt like the wind was taken out of me and I immediately became self-conscious and embarrassed. Even more so because growing up I was always the quiet one in my huge family, but I knew I could always talk to my dad when we were together. 

My dad comes back and the previews start, but I was mortified for the rest of the film. All the anxiety I hadn’t felt in years about being annoying in social situations came back and I wanted nothing more than to melt into the seat. It sucked.&&Yup. For me it’s when the lights are dimmed. Before that the lines are up so there’s no glare to complain about.  &&[deleted]&&On the other hand, how you gonna just sit there and ignore the glorious radiance of Maria Menounos?&&My rule of thumb is that if they haven't played the bit asking you not to be on your phone yet, then you're still good to be on your phone. Unless it skips that and goes straight to the trailers, obviously. 

If you're watching a movie on a military base, silencing and putting your phone away at the very start of the National Anthem is also a perfectly viable option. &&I may be in the minority here, but I don’t care if anyone talks or plays on their phone during the previews. I’m paying to watch a movie, not 20 minutes of commercials for other movies. 

&&[deleted]&&We are getting a new Alamo pretty near me and I am stoked.&&Oh man, a group of us went to see Jurassic World so we buy our seats together. End up getting like 10 in a row. Go in and find this woman and her kid right in the middle. 

So I politely tell her we have these seats. She is instantly pissed as says she's already there. So I'm thinking maybe she has the wrong aisle so I'm trying to figure it out but she's honestly not hearing it. 

Eventually we sit as much as we can except for 2 of us standing there as she's yelling ""wait for my girlfriend to come back!"" Because she thinks we're taking her third seat now. I'm like ""uh these are reserved just look at your ticket"" but again she's not listening. So I say should I get security then and she says yes lol. As I'm about to go get them she grabs her daughter and finally moves.

It was so weird and I still don't know why she just didn't look at her tickets instead of arguing. 


edit: typo&&I actually look forward to that!

Confrontation where I'm invariably in the right? Sign me up!&&This shit happens all the time at baseball games. Every single time I go, there’s someone already in my seats and I politely tell them to move. They always get so pissed and I can’t comprehend it&&I had assigned seats for the first time ever at Black Panther.  I bought them online so I was aware they'd be assigned but if I bought them at the theatre I may not have even noticed seat numbers on the tickets.  Saw a lady and her son go through several seats in that same fashion, being told to move over and over. They ended up way down in front row. You'd think she would get a clue to check their tickets the first time they were told about the assigned seats.&&Last time this happened for me, they guy in the wrong reserved seat was a student of a person in my group. He also tried the “move one seat over” thing, which was also a seat for our group. When he moved rows, he ended up in yet another wrong seat that belonged to a teacher from the high school.

It was a fun day for us. &&Serious question: why would you get to the theatre 30+ minutes before the movie if your seats are reserved? Isn't that one of the major perks of that feature?&&She probably snuck into the theatre. &&I love it when someone takes my seat. I get a strange satisfaction kicking someone out of my seat. 

I enjoy it even more if they get annoyed at me to kicking them out. &&For Christmas a couple of years ago I gave my husband tickets to see Star Wars, for 12/26. Pre-selected seats and all that. (It was a big deal because we couldn't ever seem to get shit scheduled so he could have a night out)

He and his buddy showed up early, got their snacks and were all settled to watch the previews. The seats were great, back of the theater, middle of the row. 

At the end of the last preview, a woman and her troupe of family members come into the theater, obnoxious and loud. Head right to where my husband and friend are sitting and demand that they move. My husband said, ""No. These are our seats. Here's my ticket to prove it. Now go away."" He showed her his ticket - and she pulls hers out. Same seat number. *Wrong day*. She's pitching a fit and has to be physically escorted by an employee because at that point she's disrupting everyone's experience. 

The employees got a round of applause, and every person in that theater got their tickets comped because the employee fucked up and let her in on the wrong day. &&Reverse of this is when you sit in your assigned seats and someone tells you to move cause you're in ""their seat"". 

Happened to me at Logan. I just looked at her and said ""Nope, I paid for these seats""&&*furiously masturbates and moans loudly during a preview for a children’s movie*&&3d is a fucking DOWNGRADE&&I would demand a refund if they downgraded us to 3D.&&Nah man it’s just so artistic. They shot the film in complete darkness with no sound just to give you that full immersion.&&People suck sometimes.&&Protip for when people ask if you wanna fight about it, just say yes. They back off almost every single time&&The only time I've ever lost my cool in a theater was when a group of high school kids were commenting so loud I couldn't hear the film during the midnight screening of Paranormal Activity 3. I stood up and told them to shut the fuck up or leave the theater. I apologized to the people around me, but was met with thank you's instead. Fortunately after one more joke about my outburst, the kids ended up not talking for the rest of the movie. I don't like that I did it, but at the time I'd felt like I wasted my money, because I had to listen to some kid make jokes during what is a very quiet movie. I should probably plan to see a very early showing of The Quiet Place come to think of it.&&Hey hey hey.  Those are real people, not actors.  You gotta respect their opinions.&&Same. I make sure I've handled any texts and emails before the previews start then turn my phone off.&&Why is this a concept lost on most? In a dark car, in a dark bar, at a concert, if it's dark turn your screen down. &&Before the movie starts, the theater isn’t in the dark. We’re talking about pre-previews, when the lights are turned fully on.&&I played pokemon go so much I got in the habit of my phone always being on lowest brightness for battery conservation.&&Better yet, install a blue light filter. You can crank it up so the phone is barely visible by anyone but you. &&Amen&&Minnesota is pretty much Canada. &&Bad establishments don't deserve your custom.&&This is one of those comebacks you think of sometime after like halfway through the movie, during the car ride home or in the shower ten years later &&Oh man, that would've been delicious.&&""Wahhhhhhhh"" was essentially the whole plot of the movie so you didn't really miss out.&&That's terrible! 

I mean, that you saw Twilight. Have you recovered?&&[deleted]&&Throw small candy at him.&&Throw candy - I went to a movie a while back and there was a group of teenage boys talking loudly throughout the entire movie. I finally got fed up and started whipping my sour patch kids at them as hard as I could. First shot, I hit one in the head with an audible ""thunk"". He turned and looked at me furiously and I told him to shut up, they were ruining the movie. He whined to me it wasn't him, it was his friends. I told him to shut them up then. Not another peep after that. &&Yeah real life's great when the girl you love is sitting in your lap, but for now it's back to the Oasis!&&Who the hell are all these people? &&Some theaters have lights off during pre- previews. I don't expect anyone to stay off their phones during pre previews. &&Ugh that guy is such an entitled old bag of shit. The dude was texting so the old guy yells at him. Old guy keeps drawing it out and eventually the texting dude responds by *throwing popcorn at him*. Old guy pulls his gun without hesitation and shoots him dead. &&Some of those ads now have QR codes in them.&&I hate ads more then anything. I dont have cable anymore because ads. Then anytime i do happen to be watching cable i always change the channel when it goes to commercials. So i can never finish anything. I do my best to ignore them&&I hate going to the theater because of the people around me. When I do go it’s at noon a few weeks after release. Even then I can guarantee, in a half empty theater, the one asshat will sit next to me. Talking to themselves, talking to their friends, or talking, texting, playing on their phone. My wife laughs about it with friends because it happens every single time. 

So many people are just oblivious to the fact that they’re not the only people in this world. I’ve read a lot of replies in this thread that confirms it. 
&&Yes, I think you're right. But then... why the clapping? My running theory is that the guy was trying to impress his girlfriend by feigning outrage and took it too far. &&Audience reaction is like half the fun of watching a horror movie in a theater.  Especially the cheesy PG-13 ones with lots of jump scares, who takes those seriously in the first place?
&&Interesting. That could be it. &&Even if he was talking it would be OK.  Everyone talks through the ads anyway. It doesn't matter if it's on the phone or with the person sitting next to them.&&You read my goddamn mind. We even predicted that they were on their 1st or 2nd date. &&AMC’s rule is to silence/put away your phone when they play the video telling you to right before the movie. I was chastised once so I asked an AMC manager. &&Who wrote this 'rule'? I'm with OP, those people behind him/her sucked. &&And if that happens to be before the previews start, during 'movie trivia' or commercials, I would politely recommend that you amend those rules. &&After 15, they should legally be allowed to leave with a full refund. &&I've always felt that if the movie isn't 100% perfect you should get another ticket to see a movie free, the fact they charge a small fortune, specially if you're paying for the whole family which for me is £60+ that's the least they can do.&&[deleted]&&Not just no sound,  NO CIRCLE OF LIFE&&Yeah when I was a projectionist, I couldn't hear the sound in the theater when starting films (unless it was extra bassy), so if no one said anything I would assume it was working. &&Cause no one wants to get up to go let staff know, only for the sound to finally kick on and then they just missed part of the movie. &&Everyone just assumes someone else will do it. Society is full of pansies with zero initiative&&We got free tickets because the lights didn't go out until like 15 minutes into the movie&&[removed]&&Rest of the day? I spend every shower of the next ten years thinking of rerorts. &&The Jerk Store called and they're running out of you!&&The french call it the spirit of the stairway. So named because someone insults you at a party and you leave, only to come up with the perfect comeback on the stairs as you leave; hence spirit of the stairway. &&I was downtown a couple of weeks ago and some kids were fighting / fake fighting in a mall. Tbh it didn't look that serious as a fight but it's rude, a mall is not the place for that, and most importantly it looked like six kids were ganging up on one or two. You can tell if a kid is enjoying something or if they are upset, and one kid definitely was upset. I've seen enough bullying to know when I see it.

So I looked at it for a while from afar and was wondering if should be stopped, and it really looked like it should. Other adults just walked past and didn't care at all - I'm guessing because the kids were immigrants.

Such indifference pissed me off because adults should stop little kids from doing stupid shit like that, their kids or not, yet no one was doing anything. And bullying or not, it was super rowdy and loud and not of proper manners. So I stormed off before my gf even realized what I was doing.

When I got there I said something along the lines ""Hey! Stop it! This isn't a place for fighting"". Which was silly, no place is a place for fighting, especially when it looked like bullying. One kid, who I knew was the main bully in the situation, explained very confrontionally that they were just playing, to which I replied ""if you are gonna continue fighting you can fuck off"". To little 12 year old kids.

I felt and still feel bad for handling it like that. I was supposed to be the adult and in control of the situation, but I was legit mad about no one stopping the bullying so I cursed at little kids instead of thinking about what I should say.

Not that related but kinda. Should have said something very different. I handled it so bad I cringe every time. Extra cringe because I'm a student teacher and generally good with kids. The shame.

&&Well I had sex with your wife.&&willing to miss a few minutes of a movie so some dick misses the entire thing. thats some great self sacrifice right there&&I feel like if I tried this they wouldn't do anything short of offering a refund and I'd have to walk back into the room, take a seat, and continue watching the movie like an idiot. &&I used to go to the cinema a lot when I was younger (3-4 times a week I guess) and I got into he habit of reporting people immediately when they started acting up. Got so many people kicked out. One set of people walked in halfway through a movie, obviously they’d just finished watching something else. Started talking, laughing, throwing stuff around, so I just went out and told somebody. When the manager came in they ran for it and he chased them out. Would have loved to see what happened after that, we were on the top floor of the cinema and to get out they’d have had to run down three escalators. &&Think it’s an Indian thing because my cinema experience in Mumbai years ago consisted of almost the ENTIRE audience being on their phones at some point during the film&&Lol, I wouldn't dream of doing a video call on cellular data at any point. That would use up so much data.&&True story. I went to a Bollywood movie here in the US once. In the middle of a dance number, a guy sitting in the last seat of the 3rd row, starts using his laptop. His LAPTOP!  At this point, I am really furious since it’s been a couple minutes and no one has said anything. I walk right over to him and tell him in a polite manner that he needs to put it away or go outside. Surprisingly, he complied. But not before telling me that he was finishing up his office work, and it was ok to do since it was a dance sequence. Lol&&That's an escalation that'll go somewhere you won't want to.&&Popcorn is shit for throwing, get M&Ms instead. Way more aerodynamic.&&Dunno what movie I was in but a group of 3-4 young girls wouldn't shut up so I whipped a milkdud at the back of one of their heads and they stopped shortly after.

I felt bad for wasting the milkdud.&&[deleted]&&Oh God. I took my dad (he's the only maintenance guy at the hotel he works at) to see Murder in the Orient Express after it had been in theatres for a while, and reminded him to mute his phone. He laughed, said no one ever calls him, plus it was a weekday, so slow at his hotel, and didn't mute it.

Sure enough, 45 minutes, he gets a call from work and he *takes the time to explain he's at a movie instead of hanging up.* 

Boy, did I tease him for that one. But you know what? He muted his phone the next time I took him to a movie!&&Yeah, if you have that much hatred for humanity just watch movies at home.  It's weird to me when people choose to go to public events and then act as if dealing with other people is intolerable. &&1) did the snoop dog guy shutup after that? Or retort or what?

2) was it really snoop dog&&I was at the theater with my husband and a bunch of frat boy types were sitting by us being loud and obnoxious (during the movie).  My husband was sitting next to them, but I reached over my husband and said as politely as possible ""excuse me, but are you even old enough to see this movie"".  One of the frat boy types scoffs and says ""uh yeah"", to which point I said, ""well then act like it"".  They shut the fuck up.  I'm not one to shy away from confrontation, so this is not like it wasn't like something I would do, but I still couldn't believe I had the balls to do that and got them to shut up.  This was well over 10 years ago and I still remember it vividly because it was one of those times when I said the right thing at the right time.&&Like I said, very nonconfrontational. I'm also a woman who was quite underweight at the time with most of my typical sass & confidence absent. &&yes, it's a fair expectation that someone who lacks a basic level of respect for other humans will continue to lack that respect when confronted by them, especially in a situation where everyone is disarmed by law/rules such as a theater&&He looked right at me when he walked up the stairs to his seat. Although it wouldn't be the first time I was essentially invisible.&&That explains his pants down around his ankles.&&You're talking about the kind of people who would proudly declare they are a cinephile and that you simply couldn't understand movies in depth the same way they do.  I get yeah.   Those kind of people show up in every niche.  It's very important to them that the world knows all about it.  &&I have often thought about this concept, but I didn't know the specific name name for it. &&Bad experience with Death of Stalin, also... I loved the movie though. Even then, I feel like any moviegoer can just go and
enjoy this movie, it's not like it's an extreme art film that requires a 10 hour analysis after viewing.

Alright, so I go to the theater and the woman who's next to me has all her belongings on my seat. I politely say, ""Excuse us,"" and she disappointingly takes all her stuff off- it was a full showing, like what do you expect, lady? During the movie, she got mad at me because I was eating candy... It was about as loud as popcorn and I was only eating it in loud parts and not during quieter scenes. First she shushes me, then later she starts aggressively tapping me and asks me, ""Are you done!?"" I didn't even look at her, just kept looking at the screen and said, ""I'm trying to watch the movie."" 

Even when I was done with the candy, I pretended to eat more just to piss her off. &&Same - I get there early because I enjoy the trailers so much, but they’re fast, loud, and I can watch them on YouTube later at home. I don’t care about phones unless it’s the actual movie, in which case go fuck yourself if your phone isn’t silent and put away.&&Is say if the theatre has gone dark, then the phone is off-limits. Anything before that is fine. You can’t possibly disturb anyone that badly with a phone before it’s even dark. &&Trailers are iffy.

&&I think you just explained half of society &&I always hear Maria My-New-Nose, when she says her name. &&I actually like Maria Menounos, she seems like a really cool person. You should check her out on Eric Andre! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDPltmixhWA&&I assume you haven't heard her laugh.&&I think even if I did have the balls to something like that, I’d feel uncomfortable for the whole movie!&&Me too. I still remember that news story about a retired cop shooting the people in front of him. Overreact and entitled much?&&Maybe you should go catch Death of Stalin, it clearly makes people more ballsy when dealing with jackasses.&&Sir, your bobbing is getting in the way of me viewing the amazing fingering that Piccolo #2 is using. Please stop!&&My dad & I went to see Aerosmith one time and Joan Jett was the opening act. There was a young lady beside me who had clearly been enamoured by the Runaways movie, and she got up and danced the whole time. My dad and I smiled because I grew up listening to their music because, well, my dad is cool! The guy behind him, about 10 years younger than my sixty-something dad, however, was not, and passive-aggressively complained about people ruining concerts for others (dude, really? You’re not at the opera, you’re in row 5 of the stands right next to the stage!) The jackass went so far as to drag security over, who told him they’re weren’t about to ruin a teenage girl’s fun. So when Aerosmith hit the stage, my dad turned around in his seat, looked pointedly at this douche, and stood up (dad is also 6 feet tall.) And just stood there and smiled. Douche actually left. :-)&&On behalf of the universe, that lady was rude and you didn't deserve it. *hug*&&[removed]&&Fuck her. You didn't do anything wrong.&&Should have told her she should move down a couple of rows because she was blocking the screen sitting on that high horse. &&Wow. This made me so angry to read. For every person like you who seems to have suffered from anxiety I wish you one dickbag friend like me to sit beside in movie theaters because I would have had no issue asking her to do me a solid and die in a fire ""before the movie"" and then ever so slightly tapping my foot on the back of her seat every minute or so. 

One movie ruining asshole deserves another. 

Anyway sorry some magnificent cunt ruined your time with your dad, as someone who recently had a time limit put on my time with mine I found this quite triggering for lack of a better word. &&Going to take a wild guess that she's the kind of person who just doesn't like when others are happy. It's absolutely ridiculous that she thinks she has the right to tell another adult to calm down when that adult is doing nothing wrong. She was being an asshole for no other reason than the fact that she was miserable.  
As long as the lights are on, chat away as much as you'd like. &&I know you wouldn't say it, but I think the reply was ""I feel a little gassy too!""&&> “I’m so glad that you’re having a great time, but could you calm down before the movie starts?” and rolls her eyes.

""Bitch shut the fuck up, turn the fuck around, and mind your own fucking business.""  

I'm sorry that neither you nor someone else nearby responded appropriately.
&&You did nothing wrong. I hope you have many more movies with your dad, and you have just as much happy news to share with him. How is the school working out for your daughter?&&She's obviously a miserable person who wants everyone to be as unhappy as she is.&&Last time I was at my century theater for Black Panther, they didn't dim the lights until the introduction about the Wakandans came on (though that movie did start abruptly, I was surprised it wasn't dim for trailers).&&Ugh, that sounds terrible.  i hope this isn't my dark movie future too.  I actually love the previews and _loathe_ the ads.  didn't just pay $36 dollars for two tickets to watch M&M commercials&&My local Hoyts slowly increased up to a 20 minute preroll over the last few years but the last few movies I've been to have had less ads and about the same amount of previews so has only been 10-15 minutes for some reason. I don't expect it to last long though!

I tend to stay on my phone right until the lights go off and the movie starts. I never get my phone out during the film though and get very annoyed at those who do!&&First time I saw one of those I thought she was CGI or something.  She's really got the 'uncanny valley' thing going on to a disturbing degree.&&As someone who used to work at a movie theater, the First Look with Maria Menonous can go fuck itself&&Shoulders that could cut diamond&&She's only on screen for like a minute at most, so easily?&&Wait what? Is that a thing? The national anthem before a movie? 

That’s... odd.&&I've been to movies on base numerous times and I never understood the national anthem before movies. &&Well, it's debatable. I think some people see previews as part of the cinematic experience. IMO once the lights are dimmed you should switch off your phone and keep conversation as quiet as possible. Then during the movie just don't talk.&&You mean you *don't* want to watch the Sherlock Gnomes trailer for the 14th time in 3 weeks?&&[deleted]&&Because she was hoping you'd be a pushover and just let her sit in the stolen seats&&She didn't look because she knew she was wrong. She was hoping you'd relent and she'd just keep the better seats.&&I had this happen while seeing Jurassic World as well! 
I went in with a few friends and found man and woman with their daughter sitting in our nice middle of the theater seats. I started off polite, saying ""I think you might be in the wrong seats"" while showing them our tickets to prove we had reserved them.

Man decides to take this opportunity to tell me that ""Everyone in the theater steals seats, why don't you just go find some other open ones?"" while gesturing to the edges of the theater where a few crap seats remained empty.

When I declined his offer and asked if he would prefer I get security to move him, he just smiled and said ""Yeah, sure, get them."" As though he somehow thought this might work out in his favor. I was kinda shocked, but proceeded to do just that.

Security promptly came back with me and asked for his ticket, which he conveniently didn't have. Yelling ensued and then he, his wife, and his child were escorted out of the theater. 

To this day I still wonder why he was fine with me getting security. What did he think was going to happen?&&It's like some asshat sitting in your seat on an airplane. Not only are they in the wrong, but they have to hold up EVETYONE trying to get on the plane so they're hated by 30+ strangers immediately.&&That reminds of that Cedric the entertainer joke...
""Black people don't ""hope"", we wish. White people say ""I hope no one is in my seat"" black people wish. ""I WISH a motherfucker would be in my seat! We love confrontation""

Eh, I probably butchered it.&&Was at a NYE concert and some dude was in my seats. Informed him, he looks right up at me and says ""sorry man that's how it works go find another seat"".

Went and got a member of the staff and when we got down there he acted like I was the douche saying"" really man, youre gonna be that guy""? I said ""sorry bud, that's actually how this works""

I will not tolerate the ""rules don't apply to me"" crowd, especially when my ticket cost twice as much as your nosebleeds did.&&It's so bizarre and a good way to get kicked out entirely. I get grabbing a better seat that looks empty, but once the owner shows up just try again.&&When you buy them at the theater, they make you choose on a screen exactly which of the open seats you want.&&Came to say the same. Fuck 3D&&Yeah Jesus. I’m british and even I would complain about it being now in 3D. 
&&I saw Ready Player One in 3D and it looked fantastic. Not every movie has poor 3D but I know sometimes it can be really bad. It's a shame because when done right it really can enhance the experience.&&Yeah no they suck all the time.

&&People suck.

FTFY&&Every so often you'll take a beating but it's worth it.&&My friend was bartending and agreed to fight a drunk guy who got mad when he came in andmy friend refused to serve him. My friend opens the back door and says, ""after you"". He let the guy out and closed the door then locked it. &&Dude, that reminds me of this time that my sisters had flown in late and we stopped at a place in town that one of my sister's wanted to check out.  Turns out it was a hipster mac&cheese place with lots of entitled college aged peeps.  Anyways, we go to pull in and these kids just fly in and cut off my wife while she's trying to park.  She finds another spot, and we walk in.  The kids that cut us off place an order and then fumble around doing god knows what. I place my order and let my wife and sisters figure it out while I look for a seat.  All the tables are taken, but one group of kids looks like they are leaving. I help pre buss the table and sit down.  Someone comes and cleans the table and my sisters and wife sit down.  Those kids that cut us off come over and say, ""excuse me, we were here first, so this is our table.""  Now, I'm very tired, annoyed, and 6'5"", so I just look the guy in the face and say, ""Sure, (sigh)... I can fight ya for it if you want.""  They stormed off in a huff as my sisters bust out laughing.  People aren't so threatening if you just call their bluff.&&Of all the terrible tips I've heard on reddit, 'verbally agree to fight strangers in public' might be the worst.&&I've never had this happen but it would be tempting to be like ""Well, go out to the parking lot and I'll meet you there in a couple minutes."" See if they actually leave the theater.&&Pro-Protip act crazy, they usually won't engage either. It's what Hey Arnold would do.&&This is precisely the opposite of the advice I saw the last time I visited /r/WatchPeopleDie 
&&Most people are more bark then bite, they talk shit but when it comes down to it they just want to make a scene to fulfill that fantasy in their head where they are the some mundane superhero no-one wanted around to begin with&&Working at a theatre basically removed my fear of confrontation during a movie. It was once my job to tell people to shut up and put their feet down, so it's a lot easier now.&&>I should probably plan to see a very early showing of The Quiet Place come to think of it.

I yelled- STFU or leave please. Got 2-3 YEAHS! from other movie goers.  Thankfully they left. &&I always try to go to early shows and never on discount Tuesday.  I like to enjoy the film I just payed a lot of money to enjoy. I couldn’t do the late nights because of such things and opening weekends are out unless I expect it to be a crappier or not popular film.  On the flip side if it’s got a huge cult following then I know the theatre will be silently enjoying.  Like Star Wars I’ll go to when they open as none have ever been a sound or phone issue. &&God, those commercials are _the worst_.&&Hey it's me Mahk, I don't shake hands.&&I feel like your average phone-owner does not know 90% of what their phone is capable of.

I’m not a regular moviegoer but I would guess I’ve been maybe 150 times in my life (and writing that out sounds high) and I can’t recall anybody saying or doing anything confrontational in a theater.

I might be blacking out something from middle school when me and my shithead friends were usually up to no good, in which case we obviously deserved to be yelled at. &&Clapping is because he's an asshole.&&And he can't say shit when you confront him lmao&&Made an ass of yourself to impress your girlfriend?

Before that, whatever.&&I was at a movie at regal a few years back. Previews ended and it was a black screen for maybe 5 minutes. Lights dimmed. Everything. I looked at my SO and said ""uhh I guess I'll go out and tell someone"" I go out and tell them ""hey the movie we are in is blank btw can someone come fix this please?"" 

They profusely apologized gave us 2 free movie tickets and gave us a concession cert for like $10 or something. For only 5 minutes or so of being delayed.

And that's why I will always go to a regal movie theater.&&If the sound doesn't start 20 minutes in, we're legally allowed to dub the movie on the fly.&&After 20, you should get stock in the company.&&I heard if the movie kills itself, you get a 4.0 GPA&&How is this a new meme lol&&It’s so arbitrary to give any time limit with this, I agree. Some films’ most important plot points are set out in 5 mins, some within 30. You have paid to watch the film, you have blocked out time in your day. Unless they can provide the service they promised in the timeslot allocated, they should enable customers to watch the/a film at a time of their choice (within reason I.e. subject to showtimes). I know some people would abuse this but a lot of people would genuinely appreciate knowing that if 5 mins of audio lost or a lesser issue is ‘good enough’ to get a voucher. If people sit through the entire thing though, imho, that’s on them and maybe concessions or discount vouchers would be appropriate subject to the seriousness of the issue.&&Shush! I'm trying to read these comments!&&It's an actual sociopsychological phenomenon called diffusion of responsibility.&&Yep. I was in a sold out showing one time and I had to squeeze past like 8-10 people in my row to get out and go tell someone the sound had gone out, somehow I was the only person out of 300+ to get up and do it. 

I give it maybe 30 seconds just to see if it's going to come back on, but the chances are the staff don't know, and can't fix it until someone tells them. &&[deleted]&&But when the exact same situation happens again... we are so ready for it!&&I spent five minutes yesterday thinking about some snarky remark someone made after a class in college.

Can someone explain why this would be cool anywhere?

Edit: Learning some interesting stuff and would be happy to hear more experiences from similar situations. So far some of the speculated reasons include air conditioned spaces, just the particular crowd, culture, something to kill time doing and not really there for the content, among others. Thanks for the insights!&&>That's an escalation that'll go somewhere you may or may not want to.

There's quite a few times in public scenarios things don't end up going where I specifically want them to. Maybe that was op's point as well. 
&&If you keep shining the light in their eyes, they won't be able to do shit except for flail. &&Yeah but that's about $1 a throw&&I was in a movie a couple years back, and some guy at the front kept using his phone. After a while this one dude a couple rows up from me (but still towards the back) balls up the wrapper from his burger, and hurls it as hard as feeling can. He did a half stand/squat thing to do it. Fucker flies through the air in a weird curve, and bams this inconsiderate piece of shit right in the back of the head. Must have been 15 rows, and he thew something that was more akin to a sail than a ball. It was the height of human athletic achievement.&&I spilled a drink on a guy who kept kicking the seat in front of him and wouldnt even let people pass him to sit. He'd tell them to go around. 

I was sitting behind him, to the left. The girl who's seat he was kicking asked him to stop and he tried to hit on her. During the movie.  My hand slipped and I dropped the large (very full) ice cold soda on him.  It was dark so he didn't know who did it. He Tried to throw his weight around and got kicked out. 

I left shortly after because the movie sucked and the place smelled like spilt root beer. &&If you suck on em for a minute, milk duds will stick in peoples hair real good when you throw em. &&I remember my family and I went to see a movie in a crowded theater, and a girl setting next to my dad accidentally knocked over all his popcorn when she had to get up to use the restroom. She apologized profusely but my dad just laughed it off and said it was fine, but she seemed really weirded out for the rest of the movie as my dad ate the pile of spilled popcorn out of his lap. &&[deleted]&&I did this as well. Two old guys in front of us. One of them kept checking his phone and it was at full brightness. The first couple of times I did nothing. Then whenever he did it again I would throw popcorn at him. He got pretty mad. When the movie was over he got up and did that move where you thrust your crotch forward and frame it with your hands. I hadn't seen that move in ages. 

He was like 60-70. &&Maybe it was their plan to get free popcorn during a movie.&&I took my dad to see Dunkirk - first time he'd been to the cimema since he took me to see the special edition of Empire Strikes Back. The screen was packed out, it was the ones on opening night, and he kept ""whispering"" to me throughout the film. Especially during tense, quiet moments. Problem is, he's been a gigging musician for forty years, and his hearing's not great, and whispering isn't his forte. 

I nearly died of embarrassment.&&**thinks of when Oriental murder express came out**
So you've taken your dad to at least two more movies than I've seen since deathpool&&People are intolerable (I may be biased, I have general anxiety disorder)... but the adult thing to do is to not be a prick. If you can’t afford common decency, you shouldn’t go out in public.&&Having worked at a music venue that hosted Snoop several times I can confidently say that he doesn't travel with any less than 25 people. No way he's seeing a movie with only 3.&&1) Yes.

2) No, I'm Canadian, so I doubt it.&&Understandable. It would be nice if they had a silent button on seats you can press to bring a staff member into the theater for stuff like that for people who are non confrontational such as yourself.&&Note to self,  stop assuming redditors are 6ft + beardered males.&&Yeah basing your identity in the consumption and method of consumption of other peoples work is just pathetic. It’s fine I guess but you can’t be a dick about it. &&I go to the theater like 3-5 times a week, can't stand watching the same trailers so often, so I either browse my phone for a few minutes  or do my best to show up as late as possible so I only get the end of trailers.

I've never had OP's experience.&&And all of reddit&&Damnit, now I will too!&&Huh.  I think Maria Menudo and all of a sudden I'm hungry for some menudo.  :(&&I know nothing about her except, shes a huge wrestling fan.  I love her for that alone.  ^She's ^^also ^^^really ^^^^hot&&What the hell was that!?&&[deleted]&&Because then you’d have your back to the enemy the rest of the movie! &&You've got to honestly mean what you say and know that you're not picking a fight - you're standing up for yourself by pointing out how ridiculous their behaviour is and that you don't appreciate it.

If I did that I could comfortably ignore them the whole movie - people are stupid and make poor decisions but that also doesn't mean you have to suffer them.

On the other hand if I was having a slap fest with someone over something really stupid (maybe they shoved me or perhaps there was some other ego driven arguement) and I snapped at them I wouldn't feel comfortable because there's no closure - you're just continuing a fight that isn't over.&&Who the fuck takes a gun to the cinema?!&&Overreact and entitled does not even begin to describe the level of bottom-feeding degenerate scum that is that [piece of shit ](https://youtu.be/AqCEVe0JVQY) individual. It was during the fucking previews too. &&Is that a Namekian fetish of sorts?&&He's gotten even better since he fused with Kami.&&Thank you!

At the time I thought I was a confident young adult that had grown out of being self-conscious and would have told someone like that to fuck off, but in that moment I felt like such a kid. I think everyone needs a dickbag friend to stick up for them!&&While I do have anxiety, my tolerance for bullshit is quickly dwindling, despite being only 22. If I'm having anxiety and someone decided to be a self entitled dick, I have no issues with telling them to fuck off&&[deleted]&&It’s been wonderful for her! This is her last year there and it was everything I hoped it would be and more. She went from not talking at all at 4 years old and now she almost 6 and talks all the time. She’s difficult to understand, but I always know when she says, “I love you” and it makes my heart melt every time because I thought I would never hear her say it. &&I think that has to do with the extremely fake rapport she tries to build with the audience. It's like lady...nobody really gives a damn about anything happening on screen before the previews begin.&&> She's only on screen for like a minute at most  

That's more than enough time for me

&&On military bases, yeah. And the audience has to stand for it (that's specifically a rule on bases whenever it's played, not specific to movies).

No idea where that got started. &&It’s a military base thing.  It becomes so ingrained that when I moved back to the US in my late teens and went to a regular movie theater, the lights dimmed, and I sighed and stood up.

Cringe.&&They do in Thailand. And you have to stand up. It's really weird...&&Anywhere they can squeeze it in. &&Yeah, i dont mind some side chatter during the previews. I know i've been known to talk with friends during those in a 'i definitely want to see that one' kind of way.&&How many times does someone need to see the Rampage trailer?&&i get nausea from deadpool 2's same stupid toy trailer.

i've been to the movies every week since january.

it gets ***really*** old. i can recite it by heart&&I swear it is like sharks getting a taste for human blood. Once a shitty person gets a taste of success with whining their way into what they want, it becomes their obsession.&&People seem to be feel more and more entitled these days...I really wish I knew why this is the case. In movie theaters, at public events, even on the road. I had someone run a stop sign the other day, and I almost hit them...they had the nerve to flick me off...then when I told them about the stop sign, they said that I should be a better ""defensive driver"" then.&&And it probably worked for her before and after that :/&&Oh. Yeah, that makes sense actually. 

I guess this is one instance where I should've assumed malice over stupidity.&&The only time I had someone sitting in my seat on a plane was really odd. I boarded, only to find a girl, roughly 12, in my seat. I gave her the ""uhhh, you're in my seat?"" comment. 

Next thing I know, her parents stroll over to me. And I had that ""oh, here we go,"" moment. As they walked over to me telling me that she was in the right seat, the flight attendant came over to see what was going on. 

It was in that moment that I saw the girl's boarding pass. 

My seat number. But also? My *name*. I laughed, and said to the flight attendant ""I can say for certain that this is me, and that she is certainly not me."" Nobody was sure how this girl had gotten a copy of my boarding pass. There was another spot for her on the plane, so there wasn't an actual problem. But... yeah, if someone is in your seat on a flight? Verify their boarding pass, for sure. &&https://youtu.be/o5osw5u9Uq4

Honestly, I thought you told it better &&Related question: is there a reasonable explanation for attending a ""reserved seat"" theater and not buying your seats from the comfort of your home a few days before the show?  Buying them from the cashier a few minutes before showtime seems to be a way to guarantee yourself that you'll be getting the worst seats in the house.&&Depends on the movie. Tron Legacy was beautiful&&yeah.

I have a big friend who attracts a lot of unwanted attention (I guess people like fighting big guys?). Anyways, his go to is to make the situation as extremely uncomfortable as possible. 

He’ll bark back something about being in the mood to suck dick, get ass pounded, or swallow loads. The more he screams it, the quicker the fighter backs down.

I don't really go to the later showings anymore, and tend to enjoy the showings on Sunday now. However the most enjoyable and focused audience I've encountered has been at the Angelika Film Center in Dallas, Texas.

I WASNT TOLD TO SAY THATTTTTTTT&&Real Person: Yup that's a car alright.
*Comercial ends*&&My friend showed me something on his phone after the movie was over and I swear it toasted my corneas&&I see this happen all the time on iPhones because people still don’t understand how to pull up the control center and access the brightness controls.

This obviously happens the most with older generations. I’ve explained the control center at least a hundred times to my mom and she still insists on going through all the Settings menus to turn off Bluetooth or change Brightness &&Pretty much yeh. Android has built in or twilight app and windows 10 has built in night mode or f.lux app. Others are available though
&&Correct&&Movie starts, turn off everything. Trailers start, don't be obnoxious (brightness down). Ads, who gives a shit it's the same crap you see on TV at home.

Trailers is big for me because I sometimes make a note to look into a movie I hadn't heard of, or check IMDB. I tend to watch in nearly empty theaters though, and brightness is all the way down.&&I was at a regal theater when a movie started with high pitched keening and scratching sounds at 90+ db. People had their hands over their ears. I basically ran down an employee going the other direction down the long theater hall. People had started to leave the theater because of the noise by the time we got back.

They came in and restarted the movie.  They offered me nothing.

And that's why I don't have any movie theater loyalty.&&I worked at a Regal Movie Theater over this last summer, and I will say that it’s a lot easier to get your money back than you’d think. Like, I worked the day that The Emoji Movie came out and this couple in their mid-twenties walked in all joyously to the first show of the day. Within the first 15 minutes, they walked out looking about as defeated as you can imagine, and asked (politely, might I add) to get their money back. My manager immediately refunded them, and they walked out of the theater seeming a bit less distraught, but only a bit.&&The doubling-down and endorsement of the brand name makes this seem really astroturfy. So I'd like to make the case for not using regal on the basis that most theaters don't have this blank movie shit happen in the first place. &&Used to work at a Regal: box, concession, etc. We gave away a lot of those free tickets (the red ones) for anything remotely inconveniencing, because seats are free and customers aren't. Even so, we got a lot of bullshit complaints - we totally would have given those to you though, no question.&&Not sure how easy a copy is to find these days but the movie Hercules Returns is the Pinnacle of dubbing&&It's the reason when you encounter someone that needs first aid or other emergency the advice is to point directly at someone and tell them to call 911.   Because if you just say ""someone call 911"" no one will. &&Was going to say that, but figured someone else would get to it...&&But when the exact same situation happens again... we are ~~so~~ still absolutely not ready for it!&&Cinema is an easy way to enjoy air-conditioning in hot countries.&&Same happens in China, maybe it's a common thing in densely populated areas. Films like transformers are hugely popular and you rarely see a phone but a drama film or something that requires an attention span of more than 3 seconds? Say hello to enough phones brighter than the actual screen. &&While it doesn't speak for everyone, some people do just go to the movies to kill time while at the mall or something.

Personal experience, I remember going to see a movie here in the Philippines (can't remember what it was admittedly) that had reserved seating in the theater. I go to my seat, and there's already a guy sitting there. I ask him to move, and he does so, but then I notice through the film out of the corner of my eye that he was just asleep for the whole thing. Pretty sure he was just there to enjoy the soft chairs and air conditioning in a dark room.&&I've read that for Indian ""bollywood"" and similar style movies they don't really care about the movie and that it's more about the dance numbers, so it may be that the rest of the movie isn't important enough to keep your phone put away for. Iirc the ads/billboards for the movie all talk about the dance scenes more than anything.&&Cheaper to throw change&&What you’ve witnessed my friend, was the peak of human evolution: http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-23061016

The amount of guys that are insecure and try to fight is dumb. I’m not going to walk up to a 7’6” dude and try to fight him. The absolute worst was a guy with little mans syndrome that I used to hang out with. He started getting mouthy and I decided I shouldn’t be obligated to talk him down because it had been going for a long time where he’d say something about how he could kick my ass or something to that effect. He started in and I just stood there. I was getting pissed and then he shoved me and I just lost it. I grabbed the sides of his head and I head butted him pretty good. That was the end of it. He later told me that after I head butted him he realized I could fuck him up pretty good and he gave up. &&Yeah, I had a large man threaten me once because I told him to put his feet down, which was my job. I'm about 5 feet tall, so this large guy (both horizontally and vertically) was threatening a rather petite person just because they were doing their job and preventing him from breaking the seat in front of him.

But I find that the truly confrontational people are less common (most of them will back down if you bring in a manager, or tell them you'll call police/kick them out), and even if you do come across them, there's usually some form of security, or even police if security isn't available depending on the severity of the threat, that you can call to deal with them. It may disrupt the movie further, but hopefully it teaches them a lesson. That's what happened with the guy who threatened me, he got escorted out and never came back. 

I also got a lot more confrontation when I was an employee. When I wasn't an employee, and was just another person who was pissed off, they seemed less willing to start a fight. Maybe because they couldn't use their entitlement as a shield. Though that's just my personal experiences of course.&&I have a couple larger theaters near my office. I'll find showings at like 5pm on a Wednesday and go see those. I can show up 10 minutes after showtime, catch the end of the trailers, and bam, movie!

Me and my girlfriend took my little sister to the zoo during the summer and afterwards she wanted to go watch the Alice in Wonderland movie.

That seems like a weirdly specific law.&&Welp, Fox is gonna call Christopher Plummer right now to replace TJ Miller in Deadpool 2. &&Erik isa ded.  He died.  He want me have his house and piped piper stock.

Edit: heh officially my most upvoted comment now.&&What...did he say he was making another movie?

Edit: Thank you so fucking much for the gold! The fact that someone liked it that much...I got the feels. I know I'm high right now, but that got me right here (I'm pointing intensely at my chest). Thank you sincerely, stranger. &&TJ Miller seems like a guy who you think would be cool to hang out with but he’d end up peeing in your Cheerios.

Edit: whoa, my top comment is about somebody pissing in a bowl of cereal. Sweet.&&[Per the DOJ](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/new-york-man-charged-calling-false-bomb-threat-amtrak-train):

>The complaint alleges that an investigator contacted MILLER, who was in New York, by phone.  On the call, MILLER said the woman, who he described this time as having red hair and a red scarf, was carrying a “black bag carry on suitcase with a handle.”  He said she kept checking her bag without taking anything out; kept asking the First Class attendant what the next stop was, and seemed to want to get off the train and leave her bag behind.  The officer detected slurring in MILLER’s voice and asked if he had consumed alcohol that day.  MILLER replied that he had consumed “one glass of red wine.”  Asked if he suffered from mental illness, MILLER replied “no, absolutely not. This is the first time I’ve ever made a call like this before. I am worried for everyone on that train. Someone has to check that lady out.”

>The complaint further alleges that investigators determined that MILLER had actually been traveling on Amtrak Train 2258, not 2256.  When Amtrak Train 2258 arrived into Green’s Farms Station shortly thereafter, it was stopped, inspected, and eventually found not to contain any explosive devices or materials.

> ...

>The complaint alleges that investigators identified and interviewed the subject female and determined that that she was not carrying any explosives, was not checking a “carry on suitcase with a handle,” was not “checking her bag without taking anything out,” and would have been largely out of MILLER’s view unless he repeatedly stood up to observe her over or around the intervening seat row, or rows.  The complaint further alleges that MILLER, motivated by a grudge against the subject female, called 911 to relay false information about a suspected bomb on the train, and continued to convey false information to investigators while the public safety response was ongoing.

what an asshole&&He's just been determined to destroy his career lately. WTF is up with TJ?&&Well according to my Chinese source, his mom said he is not her baby, so that’s gotta mess with a dude. &&Looks like he just

I've posted this before, but I always like telling my TJ Miller story.
>I worked with him on the set of a movie back in 2007 and he was the nicest, most down-to-earth guy there. He was always inviting me to go smoke in his trailer, though I don't think I ever took him up on the offer.

>I was a PA, so basically a glorified gopher, and part of my job was to bring people coffee and one time he brought me a coffee, pretending I was some real important dude. I threw it on the ground and yelled ""I SAID TWO CREAMS, ONE SUGAR!"" and we had a good laugh about it.

Miller was arrested on Monday night at LaGuardia Airport in New York after allegedly calling in a false bomb threat earlier last month, according to the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

> Miller was charged with “intentionally conveying to law enforcement false information about an explosive device on a train traveling to Connecticut.” He appeared today before U.S. District Judge Jeffrey A. Meyer in New Haven and was released on a $100,000 bond. The charge carries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years.

He had a surgery that got it under control, but based on his descriptions of the ""bits"" he governs his life by (he does things like hire an armed bodyguard, pimp out a Ford Focus, etc. just cause he thinks it's funny) indicate to me that he's still prone to erratic behavior, so this comes as no surprise.&&I'm just going to assume that it went down exactly like the HooliCon scene in last year's Silicon Valley. &&This Deadpool 2 guerrilla marketing is amazing! &&I fully expect Deadpool 3 to have the following conversation:

>According to a press release from authorities, the actor allegedly called 911 on March 18 in New Jersey, and reported that he was on an Amtrak Train traveling from Washington, D.C., toward New York City’s Penn Station, and that a female passenger “has a bomb in her bag.” A bomb squad found no evidence of any explosive devices on the train.

>The officer who spoke to the comedian — who changed kept changing his description of the woman — suspected that Miller was under the influence of alcohol. Miller told the officer, “This is the first time I’ve ever made a call like this before. I am worried for everyone on that train. Someone has to check that lady out.”

>Investigators found that the “Emoji Movie” star had actually been traveling on a different train than the one reported. Inspectors examined the second train and again found no explosive materials. An Amtrak attendant said Miller had been removed from the train in New York because he was intoxicated. “The attendant also advised that Miller had been involved in hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the First Class car,” according to a press release. 

>The complaint alleges that Miller, motivated by a grudge against the subject female, called 911 to relay false information about a bomb on the train.

>This matter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, Connecticut State Police, Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police Department, Amtrak Police Department, and Westport Police Department.

>Miller’s reps could not immediately be reached for comment.

>Miller made headlines late last year after allegations resurfaced about him sexually assaulting a woman when he was in college. He strongly denied the accusation.

A bomb squad found no evidence of any explosive devices on the train.*

*""The officer who spoke to the comic . . . suspected that Miller was under the influence of alcohol.* . . . 

*""Investigators found that Miller had actually been traveling on different Amtrak train than the one reported. Inspectors examined a second train and again found no explosive materials. An Amtrak attendant said Miller had been removed from the train in New York because he was intoxicated. 'The attendant also advised that Miller had been involved in hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the First Class car,' the attendant said, according to a press release.*

*""The complaint alleges that Miller was motivated by a grudge against the subject female, called 911 to relay false information about a suspected bomb on the train.""*

I think that he was allegedly intoxicated, got into a dispute with the reported bomber before being removed from the train, and provided proved false information to law enforcement is also significant here. Which is all too bad because I generally like the guy.


Edit: Added ""allegedly"" &&Except that isn’t the entire article.... 

The article goes on to explain he was intoxicated and they believe it was a ploy to get back at another female passenger he had a grudge with. &&Man, fuck this guy.

But basically the more we understand how the brain works the better we are at explaining peoples behavior from a biophysical perspective.   If you can point to a tumor in someone’s brain and say it drove them mad, removing it will make them ok again, you have a pretty solid legal argument.  But as we increase our understating how much more refined will our ability be to locate the source of undesirable actions, and at what point do we get to say that  such a source is an inherent quality of that person or, alternatively ,that the person is responsible despite the fact that we can point to the mechanism that drove them to action.  &&Good to know... thanks for the heads up.&&Emoji Movie cursed all of us.&&Got pretty harsh at the end there lol&&You're lucky I'm *not* dear old TJ, otherwise the sight of an emoji is bound to make me volatile. &&He had a brain bleed during the Yogi Bear movie, so the crazy was first.&&Good point.

And now this... &&[deleted]&&Wait so is he like actually gone from Silicon Valley? I kinda always assumed he was gonna come back this season

Edit: a word&&Haha, I have a friend like this. Awesome at parties and a great guy to go grab a beer with, but just the worst at any other social event. Tries to turn almost everything into a rager. &&this seems like the best description of ""that guy"" ever, and he seems like he is ""that guy""&&That sounds literally like something he would say on that Cashing in podcast he does. &&....did somebody do this to you? &&I had a jar of jelly beans on my desk and a woman who sits near me said “I put one of those in my mouth and I’m not telling which one.” So I kept eye contact with her and dumped them all out into the trash right then and there. &&His entire personality and career screams ""I'm a massive tool"".

I like Silicon Valley, and enjoyed his character on it, but his character was a massive tool and the whole point of him was to laugh at how massive a tool he was.&&I saw him last year too and he improvised the first 30 minutes of the show, and did contextual things about the city I live in.  It was damn funny.  Did seem like he came out shot out of a cannon on some sort of upper, or he was just on point.  Sad to hear he’s such a fuck up.&&*[cinches belt]*&&She gave the Emoji movie two stars on IMDB. One star would have been understandable but two just felt passive-aggressive. &&That’s my question too. I wonder if this is somehow related to the sexual assault allegations against him.

Edit:  sources say he got in an altercation with this woman in a different train.  So potentially, he did this to a random stranger that pissed him off for a minute. &&The original article states this:

>An Amtrak attendant said Miller had been removed from the train in New York because he was intoxicated. “The attendant also advised that Miller had been involved in hostile exchanges with a woman who was sitting in a different row from him in the First Class car,” according to a press release.  
The complaint alleges that Miller, motivated by a grudge against the woman, called 911 to relay false information about a bomb on the train.

So he was involved in an earlier altercation with her. Something tells me he was drunkenly harassing other people on the train, (he’s supposedly a pretty well-known alcoholic and is infamous for being a gigantic asshole,) and she stood up to him when he got to her.

Also worth noting that the dude apparently had a large chunk of his brain removed due to a tumor, a while back. Supposedly it was in the prefrontal cortex, which regulates impulse control and largely affects your personality. So it’s entirely possible that the dude has no impulse control, and his manic behavior is a result of that. It shouldn’t shield him from the repercussions of his actions, but it’s worth noting at least.&&Oh shit you're right. I totally forgot about that. He talked about on Justin Roiland's podcast.

Have an upvote.&&As soon as I read the title of the post, this is where my mind went. I am not saying he isn't a petty asshole, because it could also be that, but there is record of him having issues.&&Wait, seriously? What happened to him? Someone else in this thread said TJ had had a “brain bleed,” too. I binge watched all of Silicon Valley for the first time like three weeks ago and started looking up the cast and everything, eventually finding out TJ left the show and was actually kind of an erratic dick to people, but I never heard about this injury

EDIT: Jesus, he’d been living with a congenital brain aneurysm??!&&Wait, what? Did he have neurosurgery or something?&&Hold on, I’ll ask him.&&Ayup.&&sad part is I actually enjoyed his performance in ready player one. Pretty dry sarcastic humor and he delivered it well. Also heavily expanded that character as the book version was just a complete throw away.

too bad he's going completely nuts.&&Sexual assault accusations. Then he got arrested for assaulting an Uber driver. Then the Silicon Valley guys said they wrote him out of the show because he was totally unpredictable, would be drunk and high all the time, and would fall asleep on set.

And now this.

edit: Yes, we all know he had brain surgery for a condition that may or may not cause erratic behavior. Please stop explaining it over and over again and PMing me about it.&&Wow. This is way worse than that time America thought cartoon billboards were advertising a bombing threat.&&I don’t think /u/DrScientist812 knows what “literally” means.&&Every few months I like Miller less and less.

&&What a prick...&&Yeah, this is pretty serious.

He spoke about in a [podcast](http://sickboypodcast.com/blog/2017/11/5/tj-miller-seizures-and-brain-surgery) a few months ago that he had surgery when he was a kid, so he is literally missing a piece of his brain.

Apparently it makes him suffer a lot of manic episodes. I suspect this may be related to that. 

Hopefully he can get the help he needs.&&i think he lost a part of the right side of his fontal or prefrontal lobe due to congenital defect which governs judgment and decision making. the left frontal or prefrontal lobe is the opposite, it will be pro idea while the right will refuse to hold your beer. people who have had strokes on their right side will deny having a stroke even if parts of the left side of their body aren’t working as a result. My friends uncle had a stoke a month ago and temporarily lost his right side and was acting inappropriately to his niece when she came to visit. Sometimes the brain adapts other parts of itself for functions they weren’t designed for when a part that evolved to do that breaks down, but it might not work as well as the original part. &&I didnt know being a huge prick was a neurological issue...&&No sex, just nudes and just pictures. Most pictures were of whoever he was sleeping with at the time but he shows up in a couple. &&She just looks at the bank account. &&Distance is her friend &&it has a naked female in it&&There is also another layer too. Like say someone murdered 2 people, and afterward they found out that he has a tumor which messes up his impulse control/increases aggression. 

But did the tumor make him murder those people? There are almost definitely other people walking around with similar tumors who don't murder people. 

It's similar to a lot of other things. Like a kid who was abused as a child might be more likely to abuse their child. You can sympathize with them, but it doesn't absolve them of responsibility for abuse of their child&&Mentioning it as his only credit in the article too. Oof. &&[deleted]&&There was a Yogi Bear movie?&&I think of that stand up he did about it every time I hear about him acting crazy and it makes me wonder if there is something still off with his brain. &&Wow, now I feel bad for the poor guy&&See the thing is, I don’t think you’re supposed to swallow those blood pellets.

I didn't have a ticket to his show because it sold out right before I got to the box office, but he was standing there. I got a quick picture with him and told him my cousin was on a couple episodes of silicon valley. He apparently remembered my cousin because they had a scene together and he told me to wait in the bar area and he'd check to see if he could get me in right before the show started. Like 25 minutes later I was sitting there alone thinking I wouldn't have any luck, or that he forgot, but he walked up behind me and knocked on the bar next to me and asked if I still wanted to come in because someone with a ticket didn't show up. He snuck me in a side exit then went backstage. I told my cousin about it and he thanked him on the set a while later and TJ apparently seemed pretty high and was like ""oh yeah I totally remember that!""

Then he made the call.&&Does his assholery know no bounds? &&Damn, I didn't know that about his brain and, honestly, I think it should be worth a little more than just noting. That's a pretty damn good excuse. My sister had part of her brain removed bc it was causing her seizures, and it was the part that regulates your emotions. She is an absolute, total raging bitch most of the time. She's always been a bitch to me, bc I'm her little sister, but nothing like this. One time she was physically shaking and tearing up from screaming at me so loud for a simple mixup about who was going to sleep where on vacation. She made our mom climb the stairs to the second floor when she had just had hip replacement surgery, just bc she was unwilling to switch out of the downstairs room, and then she cut the vacation short by about 4 days and left the very next morning because of it. It was completely irrational and insane. Also, she loses her shit on her two grown ass sons pretty regularly now- when before, she very rarely scolded her sweet boys. She is totally fucking off the rails most of the time nowadays, and I contribute at least 75-80% of it to her brain surgery.&&I could see him definitely needing help, but why does he have a grudge against her? It sounded like he wanted to get her, specifically, in trouble. &&He had a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, which is a malformed blood vessel in the brain that goes directly from an artery to a vein (instead of detouring through smaller capillaries and letting oxygen flow out and then get picked back up and carried away). 

So certain sections of your brain can get less oxygen, clots can form, and the malformed vessels can rupture and bleed out, killing you. 

Depending on the size and severity of the malformation, surgeons can go in and remove the malformed vessels.

He didn't have the crowd, he lost us about half way through. Some people left.  At the end he came out and thanked us all for being good sports.  The lights were on, people were walking out and that's when he's like ""also, thank you for putting up with me. You guys are a great audience"".  People looked around like ""meh"".

It was 15 minutes of cringe....&&I saw him a couple years ago and his wife’s entire act was singing what I think I remember as Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believing” but every line was replaced with the opening line “just a small town girl.” The joke wasn’t funny to begin with but she kept on going for the entire song repeating that one line over and over again.

Edit: The song was actually “Don’t You Want Me Baby” with the same concept applied. Arguably even worse.&&Was he doing some stupid shit with a bottle of water at the start? I gave up after a few minutes of him drinking it like a dying fish. &&His Netflix special was basically guy acts crazy and spills water all over him for an hour &&I usually like his stuff but I watched that on a plane and just hoped to god it would get better. It did not &&Jerry seems like a good neighbor. He’s clean, keeps to himself, and hates the pop-in.

The show is genius cause he's the comedian, but not the funny guy in the show. &&I-Rok in RPO&&I'm googling it now, let me know if you want a link&&Even worse, at least a developing brain can heal somewhat and rewire itself. &&I recently discovered This Is Not Happening and it is fucking awesome. Some of the stories are obviously not true, but some are.

Mania + alcohol is always a terrible combination. &&It's kind of sad realizing he's suffering from mental illness and everyone here is being incredibly shitty. Reddit was on his dick like three months ago and now he's apparently the shittiest comedian ever, an alcoholic, and a belligerent asshole. People are shitty.

Edit: guys I'm not responding to every comment saying ""it's still bad!"" Like thats some revelation. Thats been addressed multiple times, literally no one has said it's not a bad thing, and I have no idea how anyone is getting that from this post.&&Watched that video recreation of his accident in Psych class. Quite a few people almost lost their lunch from it.&&Yeah he got a railroad stake blown through his head if i remember correctly?

Was he a dick after that happened or something?&&I too, took intro to psych in high school.&&While acquired sociopathy is often used to describe patients with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex, it isn't quite accurate. They usually are still aware what they did was wrong and may have remorse. They just lack all impulse and emotional control. My neuropsych professor works with these patients and was adamant that they should stop calling it sociopathy. &&""whoever he was with *at the time*""&&With Ready Player One and the Deadpool franchise I’d say he’s doing fine.

I don’t know what to think of her opening act, I want to say that her whole bit is like an Andy Kaufman joke, where they both think it’s funny to make the audience sit through (and cringe at) a mediocre performance. But maybe I’m giving them too much credit, who knows.

I did find her performance of “Don’t you want me” funny though. She sang it as if she had forgotten the lyrics, so she just sang “I was working as a waitress at a cocktail bar” for the entire song.&&Miller strikes me as the kind of comedian who desperately wants to kill when he goes on stage, but the moment that he feels the slightest thing has not gone perfectly he panics.

His own insecurities compel him to burn the performance to the ground with non sequitors, absurdism, and outright hostility towards the audience instead of continuing to try and being seen to fall. 

I think he has to convince himself that it was never intended as ""comedy"" at all but instead was actually some kind of antihumor performance art a la Andy Kaufman.

more than a prick&&This isn’t entirely true. Gage went on to handle horse teams in South America for quite sometime without any problem and there are quite literally hundreds of contemporary reports on him adapting well after the accident. His case was very curious to everyone at the time and he was famous because of it.

The prevailing theory is that the disfigurement caused traumatic stress and physical trauma but as time passed, the wounds healed and his mood swings eventually regulated about a year later and then were totally gone after. Nobody knows why but the accounts speak of him as a normal man. &&Unfortunately so.

The one thing I didn't like about his act was that he kept referencing how much time he had left. I kept waiting for the joke when he would check his watch and mumble to himself about how much time he had left until he could go have fun on the town but the joke never came. He did this several times and it really halted the momentum of the show for me.&&Honestly, I'm reading all this feedback and need to offer a counterpoint. I saw the same tour, and it was fantastic. Everything landed, even the contentious material with his wife (she did a repetitive stretched-out version of *Don't You Want Me* that went from funny, to unfunny, then circled back again) and he had some wacky crowd work bits that ended in him talking to an audience member's mother on their cellphone.

Seems clear TJ has a lot of shit going on right now, but his show did take a shitload of energy and demonstrated a lot of craft. When he said his problems on the SV set were due to going too hard on tour, based on the show I saw, I thought he could have been making sense. &&Based solely off your username...

Exceptional work.&&My friend and I still do that awkward hand motion 💁🏻‍♀️ And say “in the Kapua suite” &&""Aloha Bitches""&&[Always loved this gem from the deleted scenes](https://youtu.be/aIEzBD6Pbus)&&The only thing I remember about this movie is when I was working as a film projectionist years ago, we got a fax one day telling us to immediately remove the trailer from whatever we had it on, turns out that if the trailer played even slightly out of frame you’d see the guys dong on screen&&I dont really believe in age or numbers ya know..i dont.. but If you had to put a number on it I guess Id beeee fortyyyy four?&&“Do you want a magazine or something?” LOL. When Jonah Hill (Matthew) is showing Peter to his table &&It's getting kind of hard to believe
things are going to get better&&""I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt""

Classic. &&I was given tickets to a preview night of this movie, and I hadn't seen a single preview for it and I don't think I've enjoyed going to see a movie more since. There were no expectations, I hadn't seen all the funny bits in the preview and didn't even know who was in it. I highly recommend trying to avoid previews for comedies, it just makes them that much better. &&“I wish I wasn’t wearing this fucking shirt.”&&Weed! You got any?&&Either I missed it in the comments or no one else quoted this part..
“WHAT LIKE A FROG!?”&&I'm sold... Now seems like a good time to watch it again.&&I love this movie. My wife and I just happened to re-watch it this past weekend.   
 
I'll admit part of my love involves my attraction to the two female leads - particularly Mila Kunis - but even beyond that it's just such a funny, well-written film. &&I'm not crying, you're crying.&&This will probably go unseen and it's also probably common knowledge to the fam here, but just in case for those who don't know... Segal wrote this as a catharsis after his breakup with Linda Cardellini (they met and started dating during Freaks and Geeks). His inability to escape his ex being ""everywhere"" and unavoidable (she was going strong on E.R. at the time) was a misery that most of us don't have to endure as our ""normal people"" exes just fade into memories.&&Ah Jesus this thread of quotes was exactly what I needed today&&That moment when your adolescent self thinks you finally saw Mila Kunis' boobs after drooling over her for a decade on that 70's show, only to later find out it's a sham and they used a body double.&&Sarah Marshall:
Telling me now isn't really the same thing as telling me.

Aldous Snow:
Well look, I haven't told you I have genital herpes because it's not inflamed at the moment.

And 5 Year Engagement is really good as well. If you like FSM, I Love You Man, you'll like 5 Year Engagement. 

&&Ahhhh I love this movie!! It's the quintessential romantic comedy, and endlessly re-watchable. I'm still waiting on that full Dracula musical though.&&I love this goofy ass movie. The scene where [he’s talking/shouting at himself while playing the piano](https://youtu.be/pB_1t-Vn6Vs) is like, up there with Jake Peralta screaming while playing the guitar in terms of hilarity for me. “Go see the psychiatrist - I HATE THE PSYCHIATRIST - GO SEE HIM ANYWAY” fuck I’m laughing just thinking about it. &&Watch the yoga scene in the extended edition! I'm doing a hand stand mutha fucka!!!&&I literally woke up this morning and thought, in regards to sleep, ""If I put clothes on, that means it's over.""&&Go back in your room Peter, go back to your room Peter&&Plus mila got the hot butt &&I liked this movie and the carry over of Aldous Snow into Get Him to the Greek, another fantastic comedy.&&You sound like you’re from London &&""Oh take my eyes but not the shirt!"" and ""It just went from 6 to midnight"" are daily drivers.  Movies so good.&&Paul Rudd is fucking hilarious in this movie so many timeless quotes&&My favorite scene is when the[ movie flips the perspective and shows just how shitty Peter was as a boyfriend.](https://youtu.be/n80w2JnyUsY) It's hilarious but also gives a lot of depth to Kristen Bell's character.&&*Still* my favorite Apatow flick.&&I would say it's one of, if not the best, romantic comedies.&&My cats name is kunu&&I'd love to sell you some weed Jeremy except I'm at my fucking job.&&""I'm actually still eating, thanks.""

""Oh ok, I'll just go fuck myself.""

""What?""

""What?""&&But then Jonah Hill plays another character in the same universe in Get Him to the Greek and I'm all confused&&“ just went from 6 to midnight”&&When my wife asks me to get cranberry juice at the store I always say ""Do you want cranberry JUICE or juice COCKTAIL, because I could probably scrounge up either.""&&[deleted]&&Fuck yes dude hahaha Jonah Hill absolutely smashed that role. Obviously Paul Rudd was hilarious as well &&[The blooper reel for this movie remains one of my favorites solely because of Jonah Hill's inability to pick up a glass.](https://youtu.be/z3CpJUQyg-Y?t=3m37s)&&I love when Jonah goes to remove a dinner plate from a table and the guy is like “oh I’m not finished yet.” And then Jonah response “oh, I’ll just go fuck myself.”&&""How was your vegetable medley?""


""It's mundane.""


""It is mundane I know, it's great.""&&i just went from 6 oclock to midnight&&This was the movie that made me familiar with Russell brand. 

These days, though, I wish he would come up with a new character.&&OOOH IM ALDOUS SNOW BOOSHIT BOOSHIT BOOSHIT BOOSHIT NO DRINKS FOR ME THANKS BOOSHIT BOOSHIT BOOSHIT 

Easily one of my favorite lines from the movie. &&I was flipping around and came upon this movie, and this was the first line I heard and also the first I'd ever seen russel brand.  I thought it such a peculiar way to describe a shoe and equally hilarious.   It's one of those movies that if if comes on I just watch it, like Goodfellas or Tremors.

Edit:  Watching it right now.  ""What about the code of the ocean?""  Lmao.  Going to put that one in my back pocket for the perfect time. &&“Not like an evil version” gets me every time&&all of his lines in this movie were really well done. It was a pretty unique sense of humor. &&It's like a holiday with Hitler, well maybe not Hitler but at least goebbles or something. &&This and him crying while singing the Muppets theme song are the best parts &&Throughout the movie you can see like seven different weddings in the backgrounds lmao&&I love how cliche it is. And yes, my wedding reception was at Turtle Bay Resort (where the movie was mostly filmed).&&I was literally on my honeymoon in Hawaii, where I had just gotten married, when I saw this movie for the first time... The timing could not have been more perfect. &&I’m getting married in October and my fiancée semi-jokingly asked if we should get married in Hawaii, to which I replied, “Oh, wedding in Hawaii — REAL ORIGINAL!”

She didn’t get the reference, so that means we should break up, right?&&🎶*And if I meet Van Helsing, I swear to God I will slay him...*🎶&&I need this musical to happen for real though guys...&&If I die before it's really made I will have lived a life for nothing&&Die...die...die...&&I’m off to find the mythical clitoris!&&Let me just say that if God was a city planner, he would not put a playground next to a sewage system.&&Does it feel good for you, because it's hurting me.&&If God were a city planner he wouldn’t put a playground next to a sewage system. &&That red head was cute as fuck.&&We are just smashing them together and it is NOT..HAPPENING...&&He's always Kenneth to me.  So pure.  So immortal.&&lol i reference the surf lesson scene all the time with ""do less"" 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKIpCPS-oZc

people look just as confused as Jason Segal every time.&&I Love You, Man was really heartwarming, I'd really love to see them make more films like that as they're so great together. That movie got me listening to Rush a lot more oddly enough. &&can't say i've ever seen a movie with jason segel that i didn't like....&&I love that movie! I'm gonna watch it laters on the menjai! &&I Love You, Man and Hank Mardukas are my two favorite comedies.&&Against all odds I think I've actually improved it&&That whole scene is gold.&&Oh man such an underrated line hahaha&&""I quit wearing a watch when I came out here.""

""Wow, that's so cool!""

""Yea. No, like, my cell phone has a clock on it so I don't really need it.""&&[deleted]&&Favorite rom-com. So many great lines. ^Guess^i'll^go^fuck^myself^than&&Whenever I do something stupid I'll sing Peter you suck, Peter you suck, Peter you don't do anything of value&&I say ""When life gives you lemons, just say 'fuck the lemons' and bail."" At least once a week. &&Rudd is a national treasure. Honestly this little line and his whole role in Wet Hot American Summer are classic. 


You taste like burger. &&Me too! It really is one of my favourite quotes. [Paul Rudd](https://youtu.be/tv1urfDXs-o) is one of my favourite actors.&&Hahahokay monster man &&He had no clue what the role was supposed to be, in Segals words, more of a Hugh Grant type of guy. But when Russel brand auditioned they rewrote the role to be basically Brand irl&&His default state is a normal person after a line of coke, lol.

Hilarious.  &&What I find amazing about this clip is that Brand basically seduces the scene partner (script supervisor?) in real time.  He’s playing a character, sort of, but by the end she’s legit ready to go anywhere with him.  Makes you see how he landed Katy Perry.&&I'm like 75% sure Russell Brand is playing himself in this movie.&&""I like her hair. I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes.""&&“Stop crying. You sound like a giant baby.”
“You look like a giant baby.”&&""Cuz I dismissed him, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. IN HIS LIFE.""

Missed the best part of the quote, dude!&&“We can’t have sex.”
“Why?”
“Because of our religion.”
“Ohh because of God and everything!”&&""you wore sweatpants everyday for a week straight""

"" Oh, if they were Sean Jean sweatpants it would be no problem, but because they were Costco brand, it's the worst thing I could do. ""&&[Ooooo, I'm Aldus Snow. Boooshit, boooshit, boooshit, booshit.](https://youtu.be/fG3dfwEkGos)&&Bill Hader’s “I will EQUALIZE YOU!” always cracks me up. &&I always laugh so hard at his fight with Brian. 

“Do you really want to have this conversation?”

“.... yes.”&&Don't do *anything*&&Jonah Hill passionately singing along really makes that scene.&&The fucking dance while he sang, I couldn’t handle it. &&I sing this to my boyfriend all the time. He really loves it. &&[deleted]&&I say it all the time and forgot where I got it from. &&Not us right buddy. Not us. &&“Off to find the mythical clitoris.....”&&This is my husband's favorite line.&&It does a good job of portraying things in a way where no one is entirely to blame or completely innocent either. &&Fuck, you're cool. It's so hard to say because, like, I hate you in so many ways.&&*thucka* *thucka* *thucka*&&The sound in that scene was way too perfect. They must have gone out of their way to capture it.&&I got a suh-prise fuh youuuu&&My husband does this every time I see him walking from the shower to our bedroom.&&My wife and I use ""I can see your HOO HAH"" a lot. &&OH THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS WEATHER! &&I still use ""are those sad tissues...or happy tissues?"" as often as possible. &&Even the throwaway lines are memorable for some reason. ""Oh yeah, you're that guy from Kaiser Permanente."" Like on paper that shouldn't be funny, but thinking about how Paul Rudd says it so earnestly always makes me laugh.&&""Well i was going to, but then i didn't, and i just kept on living my life""

nice burn for the back pocket
&&YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE FROM LON DON!&&“Peter, what are you doing here?”

“I came here to murder you.”&&""What's the state fish of Hawaii?"" ""The Humuhumunukunukuapua'a. Yeah, bitch!""&&That guy was such a small role but had some of the best lines and delivery. &&My wife and I went to Hawaii for our honeymoon. We went snorkeling almost every day and every. Single. Time we saw one, wed let out a muffled ""humuhumunukunukapuaa, yea bitch!"" through the mouthpieces. 

Went on a hunt for a Christmas ornament with one painted on it as our ""this was our honeymoon"" souvenir &&WAIT this whole time I thought it meant that the mood of the restaurant went to midnight, is this actually an erection joke??  &&Fucking love Paul Rudd in this, that’s one of my favorite lines...I love that whole surfing scene.

Rudd: “No no you’re doing too much, do less”
Rudd:” You’re doing too much, do less” 
Rudd: “No, do less. That’s too much. Do less”
Peter———does nothing 
Rudd: “ well you gotta do more than that”

Lolol&&Almost every time I get cereal out of one of those things I think of that line&&And the best worst movie to watch single and alone. You end up like the lady on the floor above me crying hysterically.&&“Kunu! Call the front desk!”
“Alright, Monster Man.” *proceeds to just stand there*&&Donnas hot like a chick that plays softball is hot. She’s a handsome woman. &&This movie made me realize that I'm in love with Mila Kunis and my wife totally supports it.&&500 Days of Summer is really good at this too. Starts off from the guy's perspective as he goes through a breakup that wrecks him, but it gradually fills in the bits and pieces that reveal they just weren't good together in the first place.&&I even went to therapy&&ohh he's Aldous Snow Bullshit bullshit bullshit &&[deleted]&&He stole every scene he was in. What perfect casting. &&“Sodomize intolerance”&&Whenever I leave work and have to go somewhere in work clothes I still always say ""I wish I wasn't wearing this fucking shirt"". &&Fair enough why don’t you try unbuttoning it&&Well I would love to sell you some weed, Jeremy, but I'm at my fucking job right now. Obviously, because you called me at work.&&No? Well let’s go surfing!&&I once saw him beat up a guy with a starfish....that guy was me.&&Yes! That part kills me every time. 
“I don’t know, Peter, just get off the fucking rock!!” 
Always makes me laugh. &&I think it’s on Netflix right now anyway&&You look like a giant baby.&&Same. Why hasn’t Jason Segal come out with the Dracula Musical for real? It would kill. &&IM NOT GO-ING&&Did you like that? Did you like what you saw?&&I'm literally staying at the turtle Bay resort right now because of that movie.&&And you know that, because you called me at work.&&""I just went from six to midnight""&&He says mahalo.&&I say “oh ok, I ‘ll just go fuck myself” at work all the time when I say something to customers and they ignore me.&&I noticed this last time I watched this movie. I'm surprised it's not talked about more.&&I thought they were the same character. Johan hills character just realized he wasn't that good at music but still loved the industry and worked his way up to meeting aldos snow again.&&Also the black bartender. He plays Diddys assistant in GHTTG&&“Take my eyes but not the shirt!”&&“I saw it from farther away!”&&YOU SOUND LOIKE YAH FRAM LANDAN!&&“Oh the weather outside is weather” is probably one of my favorite little jingles that no one seems to understand.&&I wonder if the carpet matches her pubes?&&Pi....pyopi&&Do less. No. Do less. &&Inside of you.

INSIIIIIIIIDE of YOUUUUUUU&&Character?&&Wasn't Russell the same character in Get him to the Greek as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall?

Like it was a universe character?&&I've watched some of his documentaries he's been in and listen to his podcasts. He seems like a really nice guy who is concerned about things that matter. Really cool&&Fucking Tremors. I'll never not throw that on.&&And Fifth Element. Every. Single. Time.&&Get Him to the Greek is underrated.&&I suspect a fair amount of ad-libbing &&When he plays the Seinfeld style music over Crime Scene I lose it. 

""Maybe something dark and ominous... Like losing your penis is a bad thing.""&&“Yeah, y'know, I hear it too, it sounds like she's having a tough time, I think its coming from the floor above me.”

“You’re on the top floor.”

“I’ll try to keep it down.”&&[deleted]&&I've spent a few hours at the resort in the movie, I'd bet most of those weddings in the background were real. &&Is she cool with you eating an entire box of cereal in a big bowl and wearing the same sweatpants for 5 days in a row? Our choices in life, echo in eternity u/jpav35&&*🎶* ***AH HA HA HA!*** *🎶*&&Fun fact:  it's actually full puppet musical Segel wrote years ago.  It's just never been performed to my knowledge, and it doesn't sound like Segel has plans to:  ""I feel like it's much better in short form where you're allowed to think it's good.""

That's what you gotta do. That's what it's about. If you can involve the anus in that, then that's absolute perfection.&&all those bar scenes with the guy talk is hilarious&&This is my favorite quote. And I love every quote.&&I like her hair.

Now you’re just boogie boarding.”&&""Hey look man, If you get attacked by a shark, are you just gonna give up on surfing?""

""Probably, yeah.""

""Alright, let's go back to the shore and get some tacos.""

&&I was in Haleʻiwa a few years ago, and my instructor was just like this guy. But not so white. I asked what happens when I get up. His response: we'll figure it out.&&When Paul Rudd says “fuck” when he realizes how old he is I crack the fuck up. He delivers that line so perfectly. &&When life gives you lemons you say fuck that and bail &&Yeah ""do less"" is solid gold. &&Ah, this still happens all the time.

I say this to myself when I golf. &&I gotta get some fuckin friends.&&I Love You, Man is one of those movies where a bromance is just really a bromance.&&I Love You, Man is probably my choice for best Rom Com of the 2000s.

""You don't need to be putting your P in a V right now""

""No, I need to B my L on someone's Ts""&&I have the YouTube clip bookmarked and play it any time I'm stuck on something at work. &&Everytime I go to a job interview, I play this song on my phone in the car before going in (and Adam Sandler's ""Somebody Kill Me Please"" from the Wedding Singer) to release nervous tension and get myself relaxed!

I've had great success so far!&&My coworker literally compared me to that song within 10 minutes of meeting me and now idk what to do with myself&&Anytime I make something look good or finish a project, I'll stand back and say ""That's a good looking dick, Peter."" 

I've got my wife saying it too. We use it to complement each other now.&&Are those happy tissues or sad tissues?&&My favorite is ""what are you doing here?"" ""I came here to murder you.""&&""You know...since I've moved down here, I don't even own a watch.""

""Man, that's really cool.""

""My cell phone has a clock so I don't need it""&&Same. Paul Rudd is the best part of that movie, IMO. “YOU SOUND LIKE YOU’RE FROM LONDON!!”&&You're telling me you don't want to hack yourself off a slice of this long, greasy dick?&&It's important that I tell everyone I met Paul in Vegas and then bumped into him at the airport on the way home.  It was like 4 in the morning and any time he was recognized he went out of his way to be gracious and pleasant and treat everyone like they were special.  I love when people I think are cool... are cool.  He also totally owns a candy shop in town.  &&Oh my god that's Paul rudd. How did I never notice this before??&&He really deserved that Antman role. He can do anything. Comedy, drama, be a creepy weirdo in Halloween 6. He even got to be a happy ending for a Friends main character. He's earned his super hero status.&&Paul Rudd is dope af so cool he's a superhero. He's good in Fundamentals of Caring.&&I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role&&You might say that the role was...  
  
( •_•)>⌐■-■  
  
rebranded  
  
(⌐■_■)&&Considering he uses the line “communing with nature” in the actual movie, I can definitely believe that&&I remember reading that the role was supposed to be a really low brow British comedian played by Charlie Hunnam. When Brand walked in for the audition they completely changed the script.&&> line of coke.

It's called a Jeffrey&&I can’t fathom how quick witted and fast talking he was in his coke using days. &&Reminds me of this interview where the anchors are acting like condescending dicks to him but by the end he’s completely changed the balance of power (and basically seduced the lady in blue)
https://youtu.be/ynUjo99Gzbk&&You can bump that up to 100%. The only difference is his name.&&Are those happy tissues, or sad tissues?&&That one stayed with me after everything else.  I still call Kamekona that when he shows up in Hawaii Five-O&&'ee's a mayjah, mayjah influence on me now!&&“That’s not gonna be a problem because God should be present *in the bedroom*&&Ok, you gotta do something. You can't just lay there. Looks like you're boogie boarding. &&Last time I watched it I noticed he pulls his hand out of his pants and says, ""it just went from six to midnight."" Seen it a dozen times and that's the first time I got that joke.&&It's catchy as hell&&Yeah I like that Sarah Marshall actually had dimensions. So often the ex is just evil or shallow.  &&i heard him talking to terry gross about prepping for full-frontal nudity. he said something about censors prohibiting a full hard-on, but he didn’t want to look too small/flaccid. so to find the right balance, he thought about the hottest girl he went to high school with, and then about the fact that she’d never, ever date him.

[the full interview ](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113833274) &&Its definitely the real deal.  Jason Segal has a pretty big hog.&&Mine too. And then he complains that he's hurt himself and needs me to ""fix"" it.&&Really mad I had to scroll this far to see this line. My wife and I also use it all the time. 

Mila Minis is amazing as usual. &&the wife and I quote the weird ""hi"" girl he bangs all the time. 

Almost has become our ""wanna do it"" sign lol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB1xexE9qhg&&Because the characters are so well written. Kunu is high as fuck and gives no shits about his customers but knows that being friendly keeps his job secure, and Rudd just nails that.&&That's one of the best jokes if you live in Hawaii. Kaiser makes a great punchline.&&No joke, about a week after my divorce I was riding the bus through downtown. It was where I used to live, but I was passing through after a work event.

My ex-wife gets on the bus and, surprised to see me in that part of town, asked ""what are you doing here?""

In front of the assembled bus passengers, I reflexively said, ""I came here to murder you.""

I then couldn't help but burst out laughing. It wasn't my stop, but I got the fuck out at the next one.&&I almost choked first time I saw that scene. &&‘I bet you think strippers like you, too.’&&That whole bar scene is so good, the comic relief in general is amazing. He even helps Segels character look on the bright side instead of pouting on a Hawaiin vacation&&Plus he loves puppets.  I love puppets. I love lamb chop. I love Fraggle rock. I love Elmo. Sesame Street Bert and Ernie... fucks my shit up &&are those sad tissues or happy tissues? &&she sounds like she's having a really hard time&&Idk, it kinda motivates me if I'm single, which i am. It's a reason to go checkout an event at a bar or something...you know, since I can't just go to Hawaii cuz i'm sad. &&Booshit booshit booshit &&Booshit, booshit, booshit, booshit&&That's what I liked the most. So many movies will make the new boyfriend some crazy territorial asshole, but Aldous Snow was how a normal person would be in that situation.&&Which is amazing, because they wrote it with Charlie Hunnam in mind as an actor instead of musician.&&Did she see me?

Yeah.

Is she coming over?

Yup.&&“Try unbuttoning it”
*expectant look*&&Button it back up&&Thank you!

When he looks back and replies “...totally!” I die every single time &&Jason did an interview once that said Apatow strongly advised him not to release the full version because allegedly the rest of it was, for lack of better words, not good. I’d probably still love it, though&&Jealous. &&HAHAH HEY MAHALO!&&I can sell you some weed when I’m done working &&You say that to your customers?&&That’s skinny Jonah Hill but he put on weight for the role&&My head canon is it’s his twin. They grew up together listening to Aldous Snow and developed the same obsession, but express it in... different ways. &&My wife uses this for her go-to comment whenever I suggest something she doesn't want to do.  &&Designed by Sir Tommy Bahama&&I've got it, bless you.&&Oh the weather outside is.. weather 🎶 &&What does kunu mean?

Oh it just means Chuck in Hawaiian.&&Same! Oh man. His character is one of my favs. It’s this line and “when life gives you lemons, I say fuck the lemons and bail”&&I mean when there's a tiger in a movie we don't get angry that it's always playing a tiger. Oh that tiger was so formulaic.  Just a tiger.. I wish they would cast a tiger as a lion.&&On the Russell Brand radio show his co-host Matt Morgan used to rip it out of him when he was filming Forgetting Sarah Marshall.

Good on him for leaving a good bit alone &&The “the weather outside is so weather” line is always mentioned, but this is his best line in the movie&&No, I'm pretty sure I'm hot. &&She's also got a major role in Accepted.&&Don't do anything. Don't try to surf, don't do it. The less you do, the more you do.&&It’s my personal mantra. &&Laters on the menchee&&That's so true Jobin  &&Romcom?

There’s only one cure for that.&&[deleted]&&Oh no, the shirt! Take my eyes but not the shirt.


..I wish I wasnt wearing this fucking shirt.&&My favorite part.&&Die, I can’t. &&At the muppet ssshhoowww tooonighight 😭&&In theatres when the movie first came out

Woman, early 30's (to man next to her, presumably husband, who is chuckling): ""What does that mean""

Man: ""He's talking about cumming on someone's boobs""

Woman: ""Oh my god, why would anyone want to do that! Gross""

He showed up and made himself at least as important as Segal’s character to the resulting film. &&It’s been a few years but I remember Jason segal interviewing on npr and saying Hugh grant and that he was supposed to be a soft spoken author (like basically the polar opposite of brand). Memory could be wrong. I’ll try and see if I can find that interview

Edit:
> That was originally written to be a young British author, like I pictured like a Hugh Grant type.

[link to interview transcript ](https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102232289) &&Stroke the furry wall. &&Before I watch this, is this the ""Why are you wearing a wedding ring if it don't mean nothing?"" interview? I've never seen a seduction carried out as punishment before or since, it was spectacular. &&You have to stimulate the clitoris and penetrate deeply simultaneously.&&Pop up!&&For the first 2 3rds she seems likes like the evil ex. Then there's a scene where you get to see things from her point of view and how she had been trying to get the relationship to work. &&Oh shit. Now I'm thinking about his dick. &&That’s the same actress that stained Jonah Hill’s pants in Superbad.&&""I have a gag... Do you wanna gag me?""

""Kinda... Now.""&&She's an Apatow regular. She was on Undeclared and has bit roles in a bunch of his movies.&&Every movie/show I have seen her in involves her being some sort of sexual deviant. Californication, undeclared, superbad, get him to the greek, 40 year old virgin, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. &&I’ve always wanted to use that on an ex boyfriend. My ex boyfriend for some reason thinks I do voodoo and made a voodoo doll of him. I think if I said that he might have a heart attack. &&Did she at least get the reference?&&That wasn't a date. She's in customer service, dude! She took you out for charity!&&""Why won't anyone go snorkeling with me?""&&Excuse me. No, I haven't had anything to drink today. Maybe the problem is that you broke my heart into a million pieces and so my cock doesn't want to be around you anymore! Okay? **EVER!** Because you know what I just realized?

#**You're the goddamn devil!**&&You're on the top floor. &&No drinks for me, thanks!&&""These tattoos? That one's Hindu, that one's Nordic, that's just gibberish, they are completely different ideologies, it doesnt make you a 'citizen of the world' it makes you full of shit!""&&I wouldn't call him normal, but he wasn't really the asshole that he would have been in any other movie. &&Wow that actually would have been pretty good too, I never knew that. &&“I came here to murder you.” 🤷🏻‍♂️&&Oh excuse me, I'm not done with that yet.

^^^^MaybeI'llJustGoFuckMyself

Excuse me?

Mahalo!&&You don't need to weep&&Under my breath or where just my coworkers can hear me lol&&They wanted to cast a Jonah Hill type&&Quick update for everybody:



http://www.isjonahhillfat.com/&&Snow is just too much of a drunk and forgetful to realize. &&LOL I constantly sing that line.&&Is that something he said? Cuz i just read it in his voice&&Damn animals method acting harder than Day-Lewis.&&Even though Jonah Hill was not. &&Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look, you might miss it.

Easily John Hughes’s best movie.&&You’re catching shit on TV right as they start? What is this sorcery. &&🎶 [day bow bow](https://youtu.be/q7i0V26wWiM?t=4s) 🎶&&I want to go to there. &&Wait, is that the sewer guy from Parks and Rec?&&I realize that&&Oh, quoting ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"".

What you need to do is B your L in a V to make a B A B Y.&&What? 

Weed&&I’m not going&&Love that you covered both scenes with shirt quotes&&“I wish I wasn’t wearing this fucking shirt” is probably my favorite movie quote of all time. Just that exact sentiment it delivers of “my ex is about to see me, I’m flustered, I wish I looked better” , it does absolutely perfectly.  I use it all the time whenever I’m ill prepared for a situation I’m in. &&I do so admire sir Tommy Bahama ...&&I love the reaction of the old guy with the same shirt. For whatever reason, it kills me everytime I see it.&&Mila Kunis just yelling ""DRACULA MUSICAL!"" off camera is hilarious.&&That poor dude...&&this is also hilarious given there's a scene later when he's making his stepbrothers clueless wife give head to the webcam and the husband catches on&&I somehow ended up going to see X-Men the last stand with my friend Joe and his girlfriend. This was after the movie had been out for a few days and we were in a theater with maybe 20 people. I'm sitting a row in front of the couple, ya know, to be respectful.

We're a ways into the movie and Colossus shows up for a split second. My friend Joe, who's this huge bearded redneck from Tennessee says in a whispered but awed voice, ""It's colossus!""

The *entire* theater starts laughing. It was so out of the blue but so genuine that it made it hilarious for some reason. Joe even laughed about it. Joe has an infectious laugh, as do I, and at this point everyone is stuck in this laughter loop. I think it went on for a solid 5 minutes before we were all quiet again. I had tears in my eyes by the time it was over.

Why was it so funny? I guess we were all miserable from watching X-Men the last stand and needed that moment of catharsis to reaffirm our life decisions. I am honestly chuckling a little bit thinking about it. It was stupid but fantastic.&&In case someone is still unclear-  
B - blow,     
L - load,  
T - teet&&Of course not.  That's why he put two playgrounds right across the street from eachother.&&""No! *No*!

My wife and I got a puggle thanks to Anwar Sadat. 

&&This movie came out right after my quasi famous girlfriend broke up with me and it really resonated with me for that whole grieving process.&&Kinda like Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in Hot Fuzz/The World's End.&&Pop up, do less &&I named my cat pepiopi because of this very scene. &&Pyopi, you look like you got some pain behind those eyes. &&AH FEEEL TEHHRIBOOOW&&Oh no drinks for me thanks!&&Just do it anyway, man. &&Im in CT and have a British friend, and people use this line on him pretty often when we’re out at night.. it’s always funny, and he gets it.&&Oh y...you mean a journal? &&Me too!

I'll try to keep it down. &&yeah well i fucked the ‘ousekeeper&&""Fuck, you're cool, man.""&&I love the surfing and lobby scenes where Segel's character can't help but converse and kind of get along with Aldus, and you can tell it bugs him.   
&&You say “bitch” though?&&Boy did they nail that&&hahaha holy crap it reads exactly like something he would say&&It's actually a Christopher Walken quote. &&That was such a strange choice, they could have easily made Jonah Hill have the same character given his obsession with Aldous Snow in both films. His character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall was even clearly into making music and such, and in Get Him to the Greek he worked in the music industry. It would have been enough with a one minute exposition scene explaining how he went from an aspiring musician working as a waiter in hawaii to working at a music label in los angeles. &&You know that guy too? That fucking guy. Made this flick Sixteen Candles. Not bad, there's tits in it, but no bush. But Ebert over here don't give a shit about that kinda thing. 'Cause he's all in love with this John Hughes guy. Goes out and like rents every one of his movies. Fucking Breakfast Club; all these stupid kids actually show up for detention. Fucking Weird Science where this babe wants to take her gear off and get down, but oh no she don't cause it's a PG movie. And then Pretty in Pink, which I can't watch with this tubby bitch anymore because every time we get to the part where the redhead hooks up with her dream guy, he starts sobbin' like a little bitch with a skinned knee and shit. And nothing is worse then watching a fuckin' fat man weep.&&Imagine if the movie was 3 hours long. would really drive that message home&&Sewage Joe!

It is literally a movie set in the same universe. &&You're better off, bud. &&Are those sad tissues or happy tissues?&&I love how they go their own ways on good terms. It's Sarah that was the asshole. &&Because depending on their past, both characters could have ended up in each others' shoes.  This is a common tactic in theatre plays to get the audience to notice the similarity of characters and do a little introspection about how the past of some individuals could have led them down radically different paths.&&Who smokes the blunts?&&When I took surfing lessons that honestly was exactly like it was.

I can't.&&If I know Sarah, I just ruined her day&&Ha. That’s one of my all time favorites too. “Bratislava, Bratislava...oh, here’s a fun fact!

Idk why they didn't say something like that, it would have been a funny little callback that actually explains the clear oddness of that situation.

""Oh man my twin brother is fuckin obsessed with you dude, he's a weird drug dealer that lives in Hawaii""
""Oh I met that fellow I believe, strange man. He stole my underwear I think""&&Because he wasn't malicious in any way. At worst, a misguided buffoon. He was just doing his deal and unfortunately Peter got hurt by it, but not because Aldous was out to get him. &&Lemme get a nickel bag.&&Ok but that is legitimately a good song and now it's in my head.&&The single “HA” after decapitated is my favorite joke in the entire movie.  &&DRACULA MUSICAL! &&Fuckin Kurt.

**ITS A GUNDAM!!!**&&They'll buy international rights to Dune?
;D&&Netflix: look at Dresden Files and iron Druid chronicles &&On the one hand,as a scifi fan this is great.

On the other hand,I want mature shows like Transparent and The Handmaid's Tale(not Netflix) which push the envelope for the medium.

I want them to be the next HBO and not the next SyFy

edit: To clarify I am not using SyFy as an example of bad TV but as an example of a channel focused on 1 genre.My favorite show right now is SyFy's Expanse.&&Now pick up Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe and do it right!&&Get the rights to HYPERION please. It’s about time that book series had a good adaptation.&&Awesome Bring on the sci-fi &&I'd rather they focus on making good shows and movies but whatever. &&They should start with The Wheel of Time&&Please bring back Space: Above and Beyond&&Netflix really needs to lock down the rights to distribute The Expanse in the US. &&Definitely well deserved, we need more original sci-fi shows and movies &&Good, because SyFy can't seem to make a good show/movie to save its life.

I'm also holding out hope that they buy the rights to Eureka and make a new season. Hell I'd settle for a new season of Dead Like Me, that erases the mistake that is the Dead Like Me movie lol. &&Start by acquiring the rights to Babylon 5. Then reboot it with all new characters. Too awesome of a universe to not revisit. &&I just want a series where they go into the future and it isn’t all doom and gloom apocalyptic war zone. Like the first part of back to the future 2&&Pick up Dirk Gently ya dogs, that show was going places.&&Berserk please&&I really hope to get some high production value, harder than my hard-on for hard scifi scifi.&&Will they finally make good ones?&&Yes! More shows like Altered Carbon pls &&Pick up Dark Matter Netflix!!!!&&12 year old me feels vindicated right now. Years of being considered weird for liking sf and now it's mainstream. &&I'm calling it now, within the next year there will be a Dungeons and Dragons Netflix original movie or TV show announced.

1) DnD is having a massive renaissance and the minds at Wizards are striking while the iron is hot on all fronts.

2) Netflix recently picked up the rights to make Pat Rothfuss' books.  Pat is hugely connected in the DnD world and a life long player.

3) Netflix has is running shows with Joe Manganiello right now and promoting him across their media.  Joe is also a life long DnD player, a live play podcast actor in an Official DnD podcast, and was recently hired as an associate writer for the next DnD module to come out.

4) DnD has a horrible past when it comes to movies and media making it a toxic IP for most mainstream studios, but it is the perfect combination of current hot topic (in no small part thanks to Netflix's own Stranger Things) and favorite of the Netflix demographic.  So it is a prime candidate for an IP for Netflix to grasp hold of.

I'm so sure of this I bet its already happening and I'm just behind on the news.

Not sure if it’s a generational thing but I used to hate sci-fi and fantasy as a kid. Thought they were kind of “dumb” to obsess over such a fake universe. Now I can’t get enough sci-if and fantasy. It might be an escapism thing. I’ve gotten older, life’s responsibilities have pushed down on me and sci-fi/fantasy are a welcome escape to a different world/life. Could also be a nostalgia thing. My generation wants the 80s/90s back and sci-fi/fantasy let’s you relive that. Thoughts?&&Is it finally time for Elfquest?&&Maybe they can bring back Legend of the Seeker. It wasn’t the best show on tv but I sure was enjoying it before Game of Thrones came along. &&It's time..

It's the perfect kind of content for on demand so it plays to Netflix's strengths.

I hope they also do more arrested development style comedies with long running story lines and tons of layered running gags. Also a good format for on demand.&&The article says that 'main focus' means 29% of its upcoming original content will be sci-fi and fantasy, they're still going to make other stuff alongside it.&&Season 3 set in space. Problem solved.&&Mindhunters is sci-fi. His girlfriend was a robot.&&And stand-up comedies.&&They still excel at things like Mindhunters. It just seems that big budget sci-fi shows that don't require live+ viewings, which are sort of antithetical to live audiences, show them the biggest subscriber growth. Stranger Things, the Marvel shows, Altered Carbon, Lost In Space, even Star Trek in the international markets, have shown to be huge risks with fantastic reward for them. Even shows like Sense8, which have disappointing viewership, get a lot of think pieces and buzz, which helps with specific demographics, and may be important to ""finish off"" rather than straight up cancel, as they then have a full story available on their service forever, rather than three seasons and an unresolvable cliffhanger. Which really shows the difference in what Netflix's goals are. They want content, period, that is satisfying and keeps people coming back to Netflix, where Networks want eyeballs NOW, and what those eyeballs might want in two weeks, three months, may be totally different.&&> But Mindhunters tho...

Every network eventually descends into two things.

Netflix? Murdershows and Sci-Fi.

Well, they've already got Stranger Things, Dark, Black Mirror, etc. I think its safe to say they aren't going the route of SyFy.&&Syfy has some good stuff right now, after a decade of mediocrity. I'm loving the Expanse, a solar-system scale story with mystery and political elements.

They still haven't recovered in my eyes, but at least they're trying to fix their brand.&&Should be animated tbh.  There’s no way Stormlight would work in live action; too much CGI needed.&&I think they rights have already been bought. They‘ll probably make ond shitty movie and then deem it non-profitable.&&Oh god, that would be a dream. But they would need to focus on specific series, each at a time, plus the amount of CGI would be reeeally expensive.&&Please please please.&&Hyperion is almost impossible to do right.&&YES!!!! &&Hell yes!&&I'm here for the fantasy&&It's just a clickbait article, they'll make the same stuff they always do targeting every demographic. The ""geek"" audience is where the money's at right now so they make sure to remind people every so often that they make sci-fi, fantasy, superheros, anime ect.&&They have a ton of good shows. I think their movie selection could use a little bit more of a focus for now to bring it up to the levels of Narcos, The Crown, Stranger Things, Mindhunter, Black Mirror, Master of None, Kimmy Schmidt, Dark, Ozark, Making a Murderer, Wild Wild Country, American Vandal, Bojack Horseman, Iron Fist, etc.&&Don't be crazy.&&There are neither starts nor ends to the wheel of time. But it would be a start...&&Mistborn when&&Looks like [Amazon](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/01/wheel-of-time-and-dark-tower-tv-series-in-the-works-at-amazon) is doing that one.&&My money is still on Amazon picking that one up. &&The wheel weaves as the wheel wills...&&I hope it's going to be Netflix, because I refuse to subscribe to Amazon for just one series.&&Or Stormlight. &&Wizard of Earthsea. &&If they could just get the streaming rights to the original I'd be so happy.&&Amazon has them for now.&&Now we just need people to watch them.&&This seems like a weird move to me.

Disney has moved heavier into a sci-fi direction with Marvel AND have Marvelized Star Wars too (whether it counts as fantasy or sci-fi it's one of the two) and once they get the Disney streaming seevice going some of that stuff may disappear.

Then you have Amazon making a MASSIVE investment in Lord of the Rings, which is the biggest fantasy property there is.

And then there's GoT and all of the spinoffs that will happen that will always be exclusive to HBO.

Seems weird to move into a realm with a lot of competition. Especially when some of their sci-fi work has been pretty miserable (Titan anyone?).
&&The Expanse says hi &&Battlestar Galactica. Also, Krypton is pretty good so far. &&and when they do they kill it  &&They make good show they just can't follow through with production and cut all the good stuff after 1-2 seasons.&&Nothing will ever compare to Battlestar Galactica&&Wasn't Defiance Syfy? Because Defiance was easily one of my favourite sci fi shows of the last ten years&&Lol. ""They never do any good shows, except when they do""&&That's what I've been saying for the past few years. Almost all sci-fi series nowadays are just dramas in a sci-fi setting.&&screw that, I now want an all out romantic comedy in spaccceeeee&&The article said 29% will be scifi and fantasy. There'll still be 71% for everything else. So enough variety.&&I just finished another Farscape rewatch a couple of months ago. No matter how many times I rewatch it, it never feels stale. &&Farscape was the first show that came to mind. I loved that show for some reason&&It would be so hard to recapture the magic farscape has.  It was wrong in all the right ways.  And the characters had so much chemistry.  &&I think at this point, they might just have to reboot Farscape if they bought it.&&I love Babylon 5 but I don't think there is a good way to bring it back.

First of all, the station was a giant part of the series. Quite frankly, there is no point doing anything in the universe if it doesn't involve the station.

From that point, your options are either a reboot or continuation. A continuation doesn't feel right because there is no way to raise the stakes without cheapening the original. Especially with how it ended. And a reboot doesn't work for me because either it tells a story I've already watched, or it changes enough that I ask myself why it isn't just an original show.&&This was my first thought. The original is a great story let down by shockingly low budgets and occasional bad acting / bad writing.

With a good budget & good head writer it could make a GoT level Sci-Fi series.&&THIS.

All I want is a series similar to 'what life is like on earth while star trek is happening out in the universe.'

Not necessarily star trek related. But the idea of a peaceful super-advanced human civ and what day to day life might be like.&&The first season was so much better than the second one! Still liked the second but it goofed out a little. I'd definitely watch season three though. &&It was a Netflix/BBCAmerica co-production so I think they already had their chance to do so :(&&Yeah seriously, that setup for future seasons at the end of S02 was pretty solid. &&Who would play Guts? I'm trying to think of a good fit...&&I really think the quality has been improving over the last few years &&If you can handle subtitles, 3% is a pretty good sci-fi drama and season 2 has just been released this week.

If they can keep that quality, I'm hooked for a season 2.&&just don't end like altered carbon...&&I just hope the next season will be based on the second book.&&Amazon has the rights I think. &&I think the last attempt at bringing Eragon to the screen showed us why big budgets don't automatically improve quality!&&Ash vs. Evil Dredd?&&Any future Evil Dead will be sans Bruce Campbell &&Why not make something new?

Not that I don't enjoy the Star Wars movies, Star Trek reboot, endless reboots of Batman etc etc, but I'd really like to see some original concepts out there. We don't have to keep revisiting the past.&&agreed, sci-fi is so hit or miss. For every great show or film you have ten that are not very good. They will still have their hard core fans but a lot of poorly made, poorly acted, and terribly written.&&It's been really good lately. Lost in Space, Altered Carbon, Black Mirror, and more. I would actually argue that Netflix is good at shows/movies that are generally ""bad"". 


For example, an ""okay"" horror movie is usually considered great by comparison because most horrors suck. Netflix Scifi and Horror are pretty damn good because other studios and filmmakers don't respect these genres and they half-ass them. &&Well....the brand new Lost in Space series they just released definitely conjures up some of the larger themes from ME:A, you should check it out if you havent already.&&I'll hug you, i liked andromeda too&&Is that a thing that's happening? I assumed that ending murdered the show, and possibly a part of my soul.&&Hopefully never. &&Netflix should buy Syfy's writers. Whoever makes the decisions on which shows to fund and which to cancel should be shown the door. &&So like they did when they made Stranger Things, Kimmy Schmidt, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, etc already?&&This news just made my day&&And they have The Three Body Problem too. There's going to be some tough competition for Netflix.&&Sweet. Here is hoping they give it the budget it deserves.&&MY BODY IS READY FOR THIS&&Holy fucking no fucking way!!! My favourite books from my favourite author... I always thought they would be almost impossible to make into a film or TV show but who knows now... A series could work great!&&And they will completely and utterly miss the point that the Culture is an *anarcho-communist* utopia.&&For people that won't watch it but want to know, I guess.

Small audience.&&Because you spoil a big movie it causes a commotion and gets people talking about your site.

I'm honestly still surprised that IGN still exists because most people these days just go to Youtube, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, or Metacritic for news and reviews.&&As if they give a fuck about how good their content is after you've already clicked on the link.&&Because IGN is a terrible site.  They're desperate for articles about anything to fill a quota or something.  Usually after a movie or game reveal, they'll have an article up 5 minutes later saying ""everything we know about xyz"" and the article is usually empty.  Also Jessica Chobot.  She sucked so much she had to move to nerdist.&&IGN is trying to be coy about it, but by saying certain things, even if it doesn't directly spoil anything, just by saying it it implies speculations are correct. Giving specific examples is tough without spoiling so I won't. &&Is it really worth putting up with Kimbo for celebrity interviews?&&While we can't make spoiler 'laws' online, we can definitely tell literally all our friends to never use IGN ever.&&Isn't Sapkowski also having somewhat of a direct role in making the show?&&My only concern is the budget. Some Netflix shows look all right, but I felt Defenders looked extremely cheap. The show doesn't really call for extensive CGI, but it will need a decent budget for the world to look real.&&Link?&&AFAIC it was never said it will be filmed in Poland. But Eastern Europe. Of course some of it will be filmed in Poland IMO but Eastern Europe means more than Poland, though. And there are many places to film in Eastern Europe. Heck, even Eragon was filmed in Slovakia.&&Thats probably why it lasted like 15 years worth of seasons and spinoffs.&&How about farscape! Bring back the Jim Henson puppet aliens.&&As was a little gem of a space western named Firefly.

*edit: letter*&&Yeah, as long as you wanted every unique space world to look like a different part of Vancouver&&Indeed

edit: Off topic, but I just googled to see what Chris Judge was up to nowadays. I had no idea he voiced Kratos in the new God of War game.&&Did someone call my name?&&Shal'kek nem'ron Jaffa&&JAFFA KREE&&> when Dark Matter got cancelled

I'm still bitter about that. Maybe Netflix will pick it up for at least one last season to properly wrap it up. &&My guess was always that instead of fixing his stasis pod, he figured out a way to beat that race of aliens and woke everyone up. 

I think they recently started comics that continue the story.&&And they built such a perfect excuse into the show if they can't get everyone back for a continuation. Just say they can't wake everyone up or some of the pods are stuck.&&Dark Matter was based on an outline for Season 3 of SGU.&&There's a comic that continues on where the show left off. &&I was so mad when it got cancelled. If I was Bill Gates rich, I would have paid for more episodes. There are very serious Stargate questions that need to be answered and adventures to be had :(&&Oh yeah, SG1 and Atlantis are both great. You'll get sucked right in!&&Better, in my opinion. It finds its footing very quickly and the quality is consistently high. Even their stinkers are largely passable or inoffensively forgettable, whereas Trek's shitty episodes really stick in the mind.&&I can say with 100% confidence, you would like stargate. &&Stargate is a fantastic light-hearted Sci-Fi show. Characters are all really fantastic and memorable, and it never felt bogged down by being too dark or intense. Similar setup to Star Trek in that it's a sort of serial adventure. There are overarching storylines but 70% of the episodes are self-contained. The last few seasons (and most of Stargate: Atlantis) changed a bit because they moved away from ""Lets go to X planet using the Stargate and see what's up!"" formula, but they're just as entertaining and have a bit more gravitas.&&First season of SGU was meh.

2nd season it found its groove by the last 5 episodes then it got cancelled.&&It was super low budget and was just a way to gauge interest. I wouldn't read too much into it and think that's what we'd get with a legitimate reboot. &&If they cancel The Expanse, I'm done with Syfy. Took me years to give them another shot when they announced the expanse. I swear, if they cancel  a great series early again after horrible if any marketing at all when this can be their flagship series, I'm done with them.&&If they cancel The Expanse, I will rage. Then I will grovel at Netflix's feet to pick it up and provide the show with the platform it deserves.&&I need a season 3 of Dirk Gently...&&Watch out! You're walking up on a pocket of Dark Matter!&&If they'd quit making lifetime drama movies I'd be okay with that&&Space serial killer chasing?

Legit. &&“0h, Holden!”&&This couldn't be more accurate.&&Murder shows and sci-fi? I'm ok with this&&Netflix has really surprised me by partnering so naturally with Japanese studios for its original anime and drama lineup. Absolutely unheard of. At this point, if anyone was going to do it, it would be them. &&Or just make another animated series but with audiences beyond Japanese manchildren in mind. &&He who controls the rights controls the spice&&Denis Villeneuve, Canadian director. Has done some amazing films. &&Dune as a movie is just a terrible idea. It's the wrong medium.


Consider all the similarities in writing between A Song of Ice and Fire and the Dune series. Huge cast of characters, many locations, perspective changes chapter to chapter, etc. Hell one of the best things they share is very in depth world building with many factions that have their own schemes and motivations. That kind of thing is not meant for movies, which will make it shallow.


Dune clearly deserves to be made into a 8-10 episode per season, 45-60 min per episode show, a la Game of Thrones.

 Movies are way too rushed for the level of exposition in Dune. It's not an action-scifi, it's a more philosophical-scifi bent, any movie will just make it feel rushed and will undoubtedly put too much emphasis on the fights instead of character development. &&I would prefer a series&&Rereading Dead Beat now and it would be fun to see Dresden riding Sue down miracle mile.&&That'd be sweet and they probably will do that to compete with Amazon's LOTR but only if it's just 1 or 2 shows and not every 2nd show being scifi/fantasy.&&The Red Mars trilogy could be the next GoT with enough funding and the right people. I think there's been a few attempts that failed early in the process, maybe at AMC. Netflix or HBO could pull it off&&And yet they kill Sense8 because it's too expensive? &&Came for these. It's a shame that The Expanse is such an underrated show, well at least where I come from.&&Sure is...every ep from new season is the fastest 45 minutes of my life&&I am on episode 6 and I still don't feel it, but there are some amazing shows that took a season or two to get going.

At this point it's still just a rumor/speculation. since deadline posted it with no sources.

Everything he has tried to do in that universe since then has fallen flat, and more strikingly so with each attempt: season five, the movies (with the exception of In The Beginning, which was really part of his main story), Crusade, Legends of the Rangers, The Lost Tales - he's had so many chances and he's never succeeded in recapturing the original magic.

I loved B5 and I love that universe. But, whilst I'd undoubtedly devour any new sequels or prequels, I know already that they would not hold a candle to the original show and story.

Perhaps a reboot to introduce that story to a new generation might be a better option.

I could see a movie made from something like the Butlerian Jihad with Erasmus and Serena being the focal point. Even then it would be 2 hours long, a horror movie, and people would walk finish the movie very fucking upset.

This sub is obsessed with plots. At the basis of it, almost all movies can be broken down in to a few stories. 

Storytelling isnt about what you say, its about how you tell it. Pacing, how it looks, how the dialogue flows, the acting and chemistry all of that comes in to play. 

If I read somewhere that there is a bad guy who wants to do bad things and then the good guys end up beating him at the end, I would hardly lose my shit for knowing that. 
&&I also usually read the plot synopsis before i see things because i like to find out what happens... its not a crime last i checked.

Every other moment he was on screen he may as well have been CG - which is a compliment on my part.&&Lost In Space has great effects but unfortunately kind of sucks as a show&&Yeah I just wish they would spend some of that budget on decent writing.&&Agreed. Altered Carbon was absolutely beautiful!&&[deleted]&&Except they halved the number of seasons for each one.

SG1 10 seasons
Stargate Atlantis 5 seasons
Stargate Universe 2.5 seasons
&&cuz they messed with the format too much on that one&&There is so many weird and interesting ideas in that show. Like scorpius being the only surviving crossbreeding of a two legged dragon species and the species that have zero ability to handle any kind of heat. Also sentient ships that are physically tied to their pilots and will die if the pilot is removed(except for that one time a new pilot was transplanted and it caused the pilot an eternity of pain).&&The characters were diverse and all lovable in their own ways. Each character had a great backstory and you could see that it was leading up to something awesome that was unfortunately destroyed by the serenity movie but hey at least they made it to wrap up the story. The music fit so well. The parallels to post Civil war America may have been a bit of a trope but it worked well for the show.  

As far as sci-fi goes, I have to say it was far better than other space series that lasted a lot longer.&&That was gold. Also him talking about how he hates gods in general was so Teal'c.&&> CeeLo Green as Tea...

&&Also cast has to move on. Melissa O'Neil (Two) is going to be in Nathan Fillion's new show.

But if there's ever new Stargate from the old crew, you can expect Dark Matter actors to show up (just as there were a bunch of Stargate actors on it). Even if the producers involved didn't love those actors, a lot of those actors pop up in all the shows produced in Canada.&&For those that don’t get it:

They hit it out of the fucking park.&&Magicians was pretty dope&&Do I smell a sci-fi lifetime drama on the horizon?&&""It was self-defense.""&&It's a fictional re-telling of the first criminalist in America. The first to develop theories on serial killers. I haven't watched all of the 1st season yet but it's pretty dang good. It's set in a time frame where Ted Bundy was still active just as they're starting to create profiles and theories about serial killers.

If you're interested in crime, it's absolutely a must watch.&&The rights must flow.&&But the Brian Herbert novels are terrible and not canon for most Dune fans.&&Interesting point, but the ""best"" version of Lord of the rings movies were like 3 hrs long or some shit. That'd stretching it in terms of length. 


Plus a big difference is that LotR is a lot of adventuring, while Dune is a lot more ""people monologing"" or philosophical tangents that take place entirely in a characters head. &&> MUTE and Altered Carbon are no where near the quality of HBO's stuff

While I agree, I personally really enjoyed Altered Carbon. It wasn't perfect but the visuals, atmosphere, and action were all pretty top notch.&&Altered Carbon was really a pretty faithful adaption of the source material&&Amazon had a couple hopefuls starting out. Man in the High Castle was/is one of my favorite shows. It easily could have been a GoT rival if they had put the right investment into it. Now it's just kind of in that Stranger Things category of really good, but not Game of Thrones level good.&&It was getting a lot watches though I think, just not as much they wanted for $8M per episode. &&Stranger Things hits the horror/suspense genre, is nostalgic, and has cute kids.  Hits a lot of points shows like The Expanse can't.  That is why Stranger Things is so popular.  I love The Expanse tho.&&I dunno what they did with th pacing but it wasnt this fast earlier.

Even the latest ep which is just talking and no action flew by.
There is not an ounce of fat on this show.&&Suggestions?&&What fantasy titles would you recommend?  &&Noooo to Fallout. Just nooooooooooooo.&&Probably just rambled off some shows. Iron fist is honestly terrible though. The fight scenes were so spectacularly terrible . &&(*straightens skirt, folds arms under breasts*)&&**SNIFFS**&&yeah. Probably should let Sanderson finish it before adapting it. he should be done in oh, 20 years. &&Don't forget The Expanse I personally was really surprised with how good it was.&&Another one is 12 Monkeys. As long as you can separate it from the movie and not overthink some of the time travel stuff, it's a pretty damn riveting show.&&aww...you reminded me how the Dresden Files was so short lived. :(

I loved the books, and thought the series was great (for as long as it lasted)&&Dark matter is entertaining but it has a very late 90s early 2000s scifi show feel. Lots of obvious sets and cgi.&&Wait, wait, wait did I just read that right. A fucking *Wheel of Time* series? What's the budget for it?&&And only okay at all of them.&&Number 5 will surprise you (by how obvious it was) !

E:back to school to learn numbers&&If you look closely in this scene, you'll notice this callback to the first Iron Man movie! (Arrow points at Iron Man)&&DID YOU KNOW that Thanos was in it?&&Okay I get the dislike of these types of things, but the ones that Mr Sunday Movies does are hilarious. I can't remember any of his videos that play that format straight.&&I have several friends like that. They don't like Marvel films but the films are are so popular that they want to be in the loop for general conversations about pop culture.&&If he's anything like me it's probably because I've seen most marvel movies since iron man and get less interested each time. The only reason i'm gonna see this one in theaters is because I have movie pass, otherwise I just might never get around to it andlook up spoilers out of curiosity. &&Thanks! 

That's pretty much it, I get satisfaction on ""how"" it was told, rather then ""what"" is told. &&Everything is all the same, time is a flat circle, might as well kill yourself now&&> Storytelling isnt about what you say, its about how you tell it.

Now you're going too far back the other direction. Plot isn't meaningless either, it's just not *necessarily* the end-all, be-all.&&Because knowing the plot is different for me then experiencing the plot.  &&[deleted]&&Written game guides are so much better than all the crap YouTube walkthroughs. &&I hope it stays around for ages more to come. Finding detailed guides for old games is a true archival service.
&&It didn't bother me either, but that's probably because I didn't know who he was. &&Same. It was pretty short, he had like...two lines and sang a tiny bit. I def had a 'is that Ed Sheeran? Is Ed about to get murdered by Arya Stark?' moment but idk, it was a pretty harmless cameo and overall I loved the scene so...*shrug*&&I though it was neat, really humanizes the lannister footmen.

Also Ed Sheran is a great singer and doesn't look at all like a famous, if that makes any sense. He looks like ""Thr guy that seems like Ed sheeran"" lol. &&I didn't know who he was until afterwords and it didn't stick out to me.

If you know who he was it could have pulled you out, particularly if you don't like him but famous people have been showing up in the background of scenes forever, like Colbert in the Hobbit.&&At least just tell us what was gonna happen!&&I think a large reason it got interesting right before it was cancelled was due to them tying up loose ends. 

I think it's biggest issue was it wasn't very stargate-y. They weren't often exploring planets like sg-1 or Atlantis, but we're scrambling around to survive. It felt more like battlestar galactica. Then the earth drama felt clunky and unneeded most of the time. 

It was a decent show but it had issues, though u think sg-1 and Atlantis did at first. Once they found their stride both shows became incredible. Universe didn't have a big chance to do that along with feeling only tangentially connected to stargate lore&&Following the pattern means infinite Stargate though!&&That's true, but they also cancelled it right when it was finally getting good.&&And Christina Hendricks, mmmmmhmm. &&Easily one of my favorite episodes.&&Well played. &&> Melissa O'Neil

She's also in iZombie this season.

But yeah, every show needs Anthony Lemke&&Holy shit. Actually looks his age now (in a good way)&&I think they auctioned off all the sets and props a few years ago.&&Best thing syfy has made in years. It's fucking amazing and has a real budget &&Numbers aren't great for The Expanse, but they should be. My goodness what a fantastic show. &&It's worth it. Syfy hasn't marketed or advertised the show much but it could easily have been a blockbuster if it was on HBO or another premium channel.&&I agree. As much as I love the movie I actually prefer the show now. &&*Lost in Space* is essentially this.&&""the victim was clearly just trying to rescue Mrs.Ripley from the hostile invasive entity known as Jones.""&&I hope it gets renewed simply because a lot of shows have so-so first seasons and pick up as they find their footing. I just fear that the budget is too big to justify it. They should have gone a smaller and ramped up like GOT as the fan base grew.&&It's cool it just needs a plot&&I agree. It's not Emmy winning, but it was fun and cool as hell.&&That is ridiculously expensive.&&But probably not enough to justify costing as much as Game of Thrones does. &&Altered Carbon is going to go the same way I think. It has a hard core fan base...but that base is small, and they bragged that they spent more than some seasons of GOT. I was very much not a fan and felt the acting and writing were very poor. 

But like I said it has hard core fans...but a small group of dedicated fans does not justify a 100 million dollar budget.&&Exactly. It wasn't as good and didn't do as well as it should've with that budget.&&It's all the space travel going on. Since ships are moving so fast, 20 minutes show time is actually 1 hour couch time. Relativity sucks man&&To be fair, most fantasy stuff out there is cheesy (which I fully embrace). But I ended up really liking the Shannara Chronicles. It looked like it was going to be laughably bad but it turned out to be pretty good. Second season was meh, but still entertaining. 

I also LOVE The Magicians. It gets better and better every season--the latest one has been the best. 

The movie Stardust was great too. I saw the movie before finding out its a Neil Gaiman novel so I actually borrowed that from the library recently. &&The only one of the Netflix Marvel shows I couldn't get in to&&Honestly the thing that bothered me the most was when everyone was like who are you Danny rand would say, 'I'm Danny rand I'm the immortal iron fist'.  Every Time. In absolutely cringe worthy situations. Every five minutes. Like Netflix I didn't forget what the fuck I was watching can we move on? 

  'I'm Danny rand I'm the immortal iron fist', ok Danny that's cool are you going to try and make the episode interesting today? 'I'm Danny rand I'm the immortal iron fist.'  Oh ok I wasn't sure.  'I'm sure, I'm Danny rand the immortal iron fist'. That's nice I'm gonna go to sleep now and hope when I wake up in a few episodes you're over this. 'Ok, I'm Danny rand the immortal iron fist.' I wish I had forgotten that Danny.&&and with that sentence the bloody dice started rumbling in my head again&&At least he'll actually finish it. :)&&Alcon Entertainment makes The Expanse though. SyFy has the US distribution rights, Netflix in some other countries etc.&&Yup, its been in the works for awhile, im not aware of the budget&&""The biggest reveal in Infinity War according to our staff writers!""

""Captain America was there""&&I like Marvel films but just dont have the time or money to go see it. Plus, it's a comic book movie. I know the name of the game is ""killing"" characters forever and then bringing them back and then doing it again to another character until it's time to gender or race swap.

Then you do it again.&&I was right with you until i saw it. I probably had the lowest expectations of anyone in my group. However i was blown away. It's not your typical marvel movie, i gotta say. &&It's probably the least Marvel-y movie out of all the Marvel movies.  There's still some stuff in there, a lot of goofy humor, but a lot of the...plot and the structure...I guess you would say goes in a way you wouldn't expect it to you.  &&I am surprised this fad hasn’t died out yet.  Like they did some of these type of movies in the 90s but it wasn’t like this were they just pump out similar movies one after another and people still see them.  Other than visuals, i can barely remember the plot of any of them except GoG, the first iron man and CA, and Antman.  I find it so weird that this is still going...&&A lot of crazy shit can happen in a movie, but it won’t mean a thing if it isn’t a well told story. &&Honestly it brought back some serious nostalgia from me that was actually the first forum I ever signed up for about 18 years ago. That’s a long life for a website.&&me too, 'who?'

ed sheeran, ok&&Same. I mean he looked familiar but my mind just assumed it was some actor I probably saw somewhere before. Then I saw the shitstorm and googled Ed Sheeran and was like oh, okay. Why is this a big deal?&&If I didn't know there was going to be a cameo, I wouldn't have known either. It did fit in fine with the story. If it had been a non-star, it wouldn't have even gotten a comment.&&I knew who he was when I saw him, since my wife loves listening to him.  I thought it was a pretty cool cameo, fit well.  I fanboyed hard when I saw Sigur Ros and heard their exit music too, but oddly no one complained about that. &&I know who he is, im not a fan but it didnt bother me either. I really dont know why people got so riled up over a tiny cameo.&&my issue is the rest of the series takes itself way too seriously at this point. the massive production quality is a real thorn in the side imo, because the rest of the show (writing mainly, acting, etc) isn't up to par with the budget. 

so when you have a scene like this that SHOULD be fine, it really forces me out of the show when surrounded by all this huffy puffy ""we're the best show on tv"" shit lol
&&Happy to!

Ok, not me, but Joseph Mallozzi, one of the show's executive producers (and co-creator of the whole thing) posted in /r/Stargate discussing [what might have been](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/4l6hgt/stargateuniverse_what_might_have_been/).

Been a bit since I read it, but as I recall, things were not set in stone before the cancellation, so he explores some of the possible outcomes they'd laid out.&&And Nathan Fillion, mmmmmhmm. 

&&IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACKSWING!&&Time loops are always fun!&&Yeah the budget concerns worry me too. The whole time I was watching it all I could think was ""I hope this doesn't turn into another Marco Polo""&&The show was beautiful with the real locations they shot at, but they could still have made a beautiful show without spending all of that money just to say that they were actually ""on location"".&&Considering there wasn't really much GFX and the budget was almost entirely for carting cast & crew around the world I don't blame them. 

I did like the show though, very interesting concept.. just a shame they couldn't figure out / agree on the costs.&&I liked the story and thought the acting was fine but it was written poorly. They dropped you into this big vibrant world which clearly has lots of cool lore and explained almost nothing. Also many of the characters motivations made no sense (when they even explained their motivations.) &&I love me some feel-good mary-sue-ish fantasy, so that's no problem&&The Magicians is good, but I forgot just how dark the books were. Whew.&&Death is as light as a feather, duty as heavy as a mountain&&Jordan sure went back to the same well a lot didn’t he&&Thats how basically all TV shows work... a studio makes them and a network picks them up. Sometimes a studio is owned by the network, but thats often not the case even for ""original"" shows. Stargate and co were original series at both Showtime and SciFi/Syfy but were made by MGM which was not a part of Comcast or Vivendi. Sometimes a studio owned by a network sells to a competitor network. eg. ABC studios made scrubs for NBC.&&Yeah, where I live The Expanse is on Netflix so I was pretty confused about these replies for a minute&&The fun in comic book movies is basically saying to yourself ""Okay how on earth are these actors/directors going to get me emotionally invested in a movie about aliens/super technology/magic""


The formula crashes and burns plenty of times, probably 80% of the time. But when it works, it's an emotionally satisfying feeling. I think even moreso now, because there are few other types movies are casting the same actors for the same characters over a long period of time.&&Honestly, this is the best one they've ever done. I think many of the latest ones have been meh, but this was insanely impressive.&&Why do you say it's not a typical Marvel movie? I thought it was almost exactly as I expected it to be, not that there's anything wrong with that at all!

Edit: Beware of Infinity War spoilers below!&&It's basically the Empire Strikes Back of the series.&&just normie shit lol.&&Exactly. The show moved from being written by an author to being written by television executives, and it tries to live up to its legacy with CGI and special effects. 

Edit: And it turns out this comment will be my last submission on reddit from this account. Thank you everyone for the past three years, and I can't wait to see what adventures we'll have together :)&&And Jewel Staite? Mmhmm.&&Time loops are always fun! &&Yeah, I actually watched the series first and it got pretty dark too. The books are more nihilistic so I actually like the tv series better. Which, as a bibliophile, pains me to admit. &&That one is sad though. I don't know, I find the others incredibly repetitive and silly, but this one feels true and sad.&&lol yea he did. so good tho&&Except there are some real originals. For example, while Dark Matter had better numbers than Killjoys, SyFy ditched the former since Killjoys is a SyFy original.&&Yup, the scope and emotional twists in the film was pretty damn intense.&&Thanos made that movie. Best marvel villian by far. Although there haven't been exceptionally good ones I can think of. Ultron was a snoozefest. &&[deleted]&&And Summer Glau, mmmmmhmm.&&Yes I believe I mentioned that when I said ""sometimes a studio is owned by the network"" and that does indeed make the show less likely to be cancelled, because the network owns the distribution rights on the international scale and can therefore derive profit on more than just domestic showings.

Anyways we're debating television structuring on a movie subreddit which just makes me a sad panda. &&Everything will be undone in the next one, not exactly disney having balls lol &&Pretty sure she has a curse. Great actress, but a show killer.&&",2018-04-29 02:11:37

Fun little bit of information. Wes Studi who played the sphinx said that Mystery Men was one of his favorite movies to film. 

I was in a short film with Wes Studi (And I'm friends with his personal assistant) and one night he was hanging out at our house drinking. Out of all the movies he's been in I decided to ask about Mystery Men. 

He loved that he was not typecast as a native American and said that the entire time on set everyone was cracking jokes and having a great time.&&Shatterstar gave me a Ben Stiller vibe for some reason. &&Had to scroll way too far to find this. My first thought.&&Thanos actually hates deadpool in a comic series and is partially responsible for making deadpool actually immortal because thanos loves death(like an actual character), but death has a major hardon for deadpool. &&It's Kel from Mystery Men!&&I'll bet that's Deadpool's.&&He was in one of the tv spots too as a harness in the helicopter so you're definitely right&&So's Wolverine&&So this is what it feels like. &&I still remember laghing my ass off at the first trailer.

Based on these comments, he seems like the most exciting part of this trailer. Why was he not revealed until now??

He could turn out to be the villain, the one who saves the day, or simply an average Joe who dies quickly/manages to survive somehow. I can't even decide what I want his role to be but I sure hope the studio realizes how great this momentary mystery is!&&SCARY TERRY!&&Was a bit disappointed we only saw a flash of Crews and he didn't have any lines in the trailer.

I hope they just retcon Deadpool 1&2 into the MCU afterwards and go from there&&I liked the socio-political angle of the original X-Men movies. A world that easily accepts as normal mutant humans with superpowers is both less interesting and less reasonable than one which grapples with the many consequences of their existence.

&&> Best line on the ~~movie~~ trailer, don't need to see more

&&My guess is the kid will be a very bad guy in the future and Cable wants him dead before hand. And Deadpool wants to save the kid for reasons.

That fits both characters archs.

Cable created the X-Force in the comics.

Also there seems to be 2 teams. Something tells me his first team will be an ultimate failure and he goes ask for help at X-Mansion again.&&if you freeze the trailer you can see he also has a comically giant codpiece:

One of my favourite Dc references from marvel is this one:

https://i.imgur.com/JivXHSn.png&&Back in the day, the DC and Marvel comics were actual comics in their competitors universe. So batman was a comic superhero in marvel and someone like captain america was a comic in DC. Was pretty neat. &&Not just Deadpool, but it's a running gag in Marvel that DC comics exist, and in DC, marvel comics exist. On the Flash TV show, Cisco references marvel constantly &&...and that's why Marvel moved Infinity War up one week&&That's the 4th wall breaking i like, not a straight up ""pans to the camera and says something dorectly"" but little quips that the audience will notice. &&If Marvel ever works Deadpool into MCU (and Thanos still lives) there is going to be one hell of a scene where Deadpool is REALLY confused. &&ATST ATST ATST ATST...&&Well the end fight in the 1st Deadpool was on a Helicarrier from Winter Soldier 

So I just see it as an MCU movie even if Ryan Reynolds and Kevin don't actually come out and say it.  We all see the wink wink nudge nudge game they are playing. &&""Did no one tell him how to use a parachute?""&&Oh I Don't have a problem with comedy in any of the movies.

He has been training for a while &&I think the main thing is a lot of people have started taking the main MCU movies seriously like the mainstream action flicks they've built themselves into, where Deadpool never even tried or pretended to be anything other than Deadpool in all his glory.&&The actor also spoke out pretty critically against the show after it started to review poorly, so I doubt whether he'd be invited back anyways.&&It actually makes it way harder because instead of shooting a bunch of takes and using different shots for different jokes they have to reanimate the face for every line.

I looked it up and forgot that he put on a parachute to go join Tony's and Thor's fight! But I think OP might've been talking about how whenever they jump from a plane or some other form of high altitude, we never see them deploy and land. Unless he didn't, in which case, ignore me. I'm an idiot.&&Wait, he had a parachute?

&&Peter is the opposite of Domino.&&Or alternatively it would be great if they pull a Hot Tub Time Machine where they keep acting like hes about to die but narrowly avoids it lol.&&There's the problem. He wore khakis and not the red pants for that, rookie mistake.&&*Fuck him?*&&There's probably lots of alternate voice-over versions made especially for the trailer which were never intended for the actual cinema version (either that or they were trying out a few different lines and recycled the discards for the trailer). I remember Ant-Man did some of that.

&&In my mind he'd just actually be playing Ron Swanson. Think of all the 4th wall shenanigans!&&I’m leaning towards Peter dying almost immediately in a very gruesome manner.&&I think he’s either going to save the day, or get killed, or become instrumental to the plot, or be a completely anecdotal character with no significance to he plot, or be revealed he has super powers, or be revealed that he really is completely ordinary.&&Wade realizes they are against impossible odds. Looks at the rest of his squad and says ""For Peter"" and then charges head first into gunfire. &&Oh yeah, I'm with you there. I'm glad he has that show in the UK but he needs to be seen way more.&&His book is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions.  Highly recommend it - but it was written before his son's passing.&&Thanos said rock you out&&Sort of.

Okay, so Death is obsessed with Deadpool because Deadpool can't die, so they can't ever be together and Death ain't exactly used to having something be unobtainable. 

Thanos is obsessed with Death because he likes getting his dick wet by fucking mythical beings.

Thanos is pissed that Death isn't obsessed with him so he decides to give Death a bunch of gifts by... well killing a bunch of shit. &&Well, Death likes him too. So I'm not sure why you're blaming DP here...&&Ryan is waaaaay hotter than Chris.....

No, Wait...Yeah, Wait.....No.....Wait....

#FUCK!!!&&It gets better, Deadpool doesn't want to be with Death. So Thanos is being mega cock blocked. &&Deadpool isn't necessarily as into death as she is into him. He's crazy and he likes her, but I don't think they ever have a relationship. 

But Thanos is totally into Death, and she's into Deadpool. So to win her affection and attention he tries to kill half the universe so more people are dead than are currently alive (as population growth has made Death sad since right now more people are alive than have ever died). And he also curses Deadpool with eternal life to prevent Deadpool from meeting with Death. &&yeah and she's kinda hot.&&Apparently, yeah. And she's in a love triangle with some kind of near-omnipotent titan and a mercenary with cancer, a skin condition and a wacky red and black costume/fourth wall schtick, go figure.

Comics are weird dude ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯&&Yep. One of many diety level embodiments.

Edit: leaving it. Haha&&He's not even climbing! He uses a grappling hook!&&Ehrlich Bachman is fat pig.&&Yes&&Could be the case.

I mean I’ve never met the guy so I’m not sure how he was before or after any kind of brain damage. But what I do know is that a serious TBI can be life changing. One thing I’ve seen personally (though not in myself, I’ve never had a serious TBI) is that some victims can often have anger issues later on, problems with substance abuse, complete personality changes, or personality disorders. 

Shit sucks, and it’s kinda crazy when you think about how much a person change when their noggin gets knocked a little too hard or something happens to cause any kind of brain damage.&&But Terry also loves a professional work environment!&&And Terry certainly loves yogurt.&&Holy shit, I just got that!&&Holding out for a 'HEYYYYY YOUUUUU GUYYYSSS!!!' from Deadpool.&&I never seen a man eat so many chicken wings!&&I would advise not getting killed by him. His sword [is the stupidest weapon in all of comics](http://www.marveldirectory.com/pictures/individuals/s_1d/shatterstar.jpg), so you won't die with much dignity.

(Seriously, what 14 year old thought that was a good idea?)&&It's a helicarrier https://imgur.com/J4wFQkK&&Thing is, he also originally auditioned for the role of Danny himself. Later on he spoke out on social media about how it was whitewashing and how the character deserved to be played by an asian-heritage actor, even though Iron Fist is originally white in the comics. I agree that there’s no way they’ll get him to return after that debacle.&&I am hoping he disappears and reappear’s at the end of the movie like the dude that went to bathroom in the movie summer school.&&I mean I hear he has dastardly good looks and charms. How else could he steal Gita's affections.&&I actually really like that. It lets us get more overall jokes, and helps make it so a lot of the punch lines aren’t already known before seeing the movie. &&the first Deadpool movie did it too with TJ Miller's different reactions to Deadpool's face after the transformation, there's a bunch of different ones that never made it into the actual film.&&Yea - you can even sort of tell when some of the trailer lines sound like redubbed alternates - the ""you're so dark you sure you aren't from the DC universe,"" really seemed put in just for the trailer.&&They change the ""And that's why the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants is pure pornography"" to ""And that's why the manbun is the millennial mullet"" in one of the trailers as well.&&Comics are fucking weird man. I love them but shit gets really weird.&&It's honestly debatable at times. The guy usually has good intentions with whatever he does, but he's a bit detached from how people really operate. He has this mindset of ""If people see how good things can be, they'll work to make them that way!"" which really never pans out, at least not entirely.

Keep in mind that Lady Death usually never speaks, so it's unknown if she's actually speaking to deadpool and is into him or if DP is just making it all up with his headvoices.&&> Thanos is obsessed with Death because he likes getting his dick wet by fucking mythical beings.



I believe Thanos is infatuated with death because his brother Eros with his love powers accidentally pushed him in that direction when he tried to make Thanos feel better about a dead pet. 

I don't remember the source for this. &&It's honestly a little more complex than that. When Deadpool initially got his powers during the weapon X program, they were convinced he was a failure so they sent him to a blacksite to be experimented on further. He was able to see death, and they started a weird relationship, causing him to volunteer for the stuff that should kill any norrmal human being. Eventually one of the experiments kills him and his healing factor triggers, bringing him back to life and out of his lover's tender embrace. In return, Death, the jilted lover spurns him, which makes him unable to die...&&TIL Marvel universe's death has a harem.&&Beauty might not last forever but that impeccable charm will.&&He does, well did, for much of the time. Wanting to be with her is actually part of his origin. I've always believed Deaths attraction to Deadpool is equal parts wanting what she can't have and the feeling of being needed, no one has ever waned her, needed her as much, for as long as Deadpool did back then.&&His superpower is a grappling hook.

Han: ""Well what do you know?"" 

I think that's the most Han Solo Alden has been from what we've seen so far. I like him. Don't care if he doesn't sound like Ford, I can see the subtle mannerisms coming through. &&He said push it, instead of punch it. I feel like we should be talking about that.&&I still have no idea if this is going to be very good, but it at least looks like it'll be a pretty fun watch.&&This... doesn't look half bad.

Still got some cliche dialogue but I'm really digging the aesthetic of the film. Very dark and gritty to make it feel like the era of the Empire.

20 bucks says the love interest is the one who betrays him.

That train scene is going to be the highlight of the film, for sure.

**EDIT:** >!I want my 20 bucks now.!<&&So it's basically a heist film set in the Star Wars universe.. should be fun!&&*Lets focus on the film people.*&&I love Glover, but I think it'd be better if Lando spoke the way he did in the original trilogy.&&Ok, so what was that sound Chewey made after revealing his age?
&&I still can't get over the Toy Story font they're using for the title cards.&&Love me a good train heist&&Honestly, nothing in that trailer really grabbed me.  It's not like the Force Awakens trailer where just seeing the Falcon was enough to get the entire world oh-shit-hyped.

I don't know.  The film looks competent?  But who the hell knows. &&I like the new droid, another cool character after K2SO &&Chewie with more to do in this trailer than the last two movies.&&Let's talk about Rampart.&&I still can’t see Han in this but... I’m still mildly looking forward to it. &&Is it a requirement now to have a snarky robot in every Star Wars film? Could we have not gone one movie without one?&&idk something about Ehrenreich still seems off to me, Lando looks and sounds great tho &&Does anyone else think the 'SOLO' animation at the end of these trailers looks... awful? Like, it looks like the Toy Story logo to me and not in a good way. &&Yeah... idk about this. This is the first Star Wars movie I don't feel hyped for. Not as big of a fan as I used to be.&&Lando Calrissian played by Donald Glover is about as convincing as Han Solo played by Michael Cera&&I’m trying to keep an open mind with this movie, I really am. But holy crap, Alden Ehrenreich is just *not* selling me on this role at all. &&Fucking spoilers man, I haven't seen Justice League yet.

Edit: Some of you guys are really missing the punchline here...&&That train actually just goes in a thirty mile circuit around the mountain. If you've got a side kick who needs to fall to an ambiguous fate you need to book the train up to a year in advance and you only get a thirty minute slot. &&It was Nathan Drake actually. &&Snowpiercer&&Went straight to the comments to see if anyone else was thinking the exact same thing.  Its like a Marvel movie but with Starwars DLC characters.&&Who the hell is bucky?&&Nah he's with me until the end of the line&&SOLO A STAR WARS STORY 2 THE WINTER WOOKIE&&Yeah, pretty sure Chewie just **killed** a guy in the *trailer*.  Jesus...&&The guy whose head is now inside his chest cavity?&&and omg that cliff hanger at the end. I have to know whether Chewie makes it or not&&Best part of the trailer.

Had to make a gif for that. &&Yeah, I found that pretty jarring.

""Holy shit, Chewie just broke that dude's neck.""&&Will Lumpy finally make his return to canon?&&Right. Does anyone know what they are trying to steal? Could the whole train heist be getting Chewie's family back? It would make for a great reason why Chewie stays with his pet Han&&Where Lumpy at???&&I demand Bea Arthur. &&[deleted]&&Malla is now canon&&I bet this movie is Donald Glover's audition for a Lando spinoff film.&&He nails everything but the voice, it just doesn't sound like Lando.&&I'm missing Billy Dee Williams already&&Plot twist: he died and Han got a new one afterwards.&&This reminds me--

My uncle saw Empire before my dad did and told my father, ""The wookie dies.""

When my dad went to see it a few days later he expected Chewie to die at any minute.  That never happened, for obvious reasons.  When the end credits rolled he thought, ""How are they going to kill him now?""&&Don't worry, it's not a moon.&&I'm worried about that rock. I think it got him.&&Nah, he dies and his son Chewie Jr. takes over. He prefers to just go by ""Chewie"" though.&&Plus points for involving actual hanging, and an actual cliff.&&Rumor has it that he does.&&He gets killed by a rock but not that one....&&Soooooooy un perdedor&&So glad I wasn't the only one who thought of this.&&He was a young ~175 when he was pals with Yoda on Kashyyyk&&When this movie takes place. He is 230+ during The Last Jedi &&Wait how are years even measured in a galaxy far, far away? &&WWE contract incoming.&&BAH GAWD HE IS BROKEN IN HALF&&I have a feeling that Chewie's backstory is going to be the saddest part of the film. Being a Wookie in the times of the Empire seems like it must've  been hard.&&I mean he had a family in the old canon.

Who could forget that little shit Lumpy?&&Life Day is coming back. &&She likes to watch cooking shows &&Imagine if this is R rated..&&They'll be coarse and rough and irritating, and get everywhere.&&Whatever it is, I bet it will involve quoting the prequels. &&""This film will make a fine addition to my collection""

""Are we blind, deploy the memers!""&&They're just about out of material, so this should be a welcome breath of fresh air.&&He is altering the line.  Pray he does not alter it further.&&In Rogue One, K2SO is interrupted before he actually finishes the line.  Inverting it here somehow feels right to me.&&""Push it Chewie!"" 

Seems like that's gonna be a potential running joke. &&It's a really good design, just a great shape. There are no bad angles from which to film a Star Destroyer.&&I came out of Rogue One sounding like some sort of Star Destroyer fetishist. Glad to see others giving Star Destroyers the healthy, natural respect and admiration they deserve.&&I'm glad he's getting actual good work now instead of doing shit movies like Mordecai. Age of Ultron really set him on a better pathway.

But then again, he's married to Jennifer Connelly, so life can't be that bad for him.&&Dryden Vos and fuck yeah he does. Those energy fisticuff-knifes tho&&I am pretty sure he is cast in the role that Michael K. Williams was supposed to portray but had to drop when the reshoots were scheduled. Was originally supposed to be a fully CGI character, so I would love to see concept art of what the big bad was originally supposed to look like. &&Depends what you consider over the top. We absolutely will get things like how Han won the Falcon, and the dice obviously come from the game he won. That’s all fine to me. I just don’t want “Han shooting first” and a ton of meta stuff like that.&&Does Woody Harrelson kiss the gun Han will use from them on? Because it looked like that to me. &&I'd guess that's one of the positives of Ron Howard coming on board. All the previous Disney era Star Wars directors (not including the Rogue One reshoots) grew up with Star Wars and loved it as kids. Ron Howard has a very difference perspective on the movies - and George Lucas who he worked with on American Graffiti - and is probably a lot less of a fanboy. I'd be willing to bet the Lord and Miller version would have had a lot more references considering their previous movies.&&Every time I see it I start singing “solo, I’m Han Solo solo” in my head&&# AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT DAMN IT&&That's the thing throwing me off the most. Not a fan, hopefully it will change before show time. &&Well he does look great. &&I saw a spoiler that [he does. Apparently so does Han who has a child and goes on to have a long happy life.](#spoiler)&&As long as it's written well, he should be fine.

Must suck getting so much flak about your acting skills before the movie even comes out.&&I mean,he's Young Solo,not the same Han Solo played by Harrison Ford.
IMO he sounds and acts like someone who will be Han Solo one day,like McVoy made his Young Xavier a character believable enough to be Stewart Xavier in the future. &&Yeah, same with the “you look great” and the “I’ve got a good feeling about this.”  I honestly have a good feeling about this.  Could it be awful, yes, but I’m still hyped.&&I feel like his delivery was surprisingly very Han Solo. I mean, he sounds nothing like him, but the way he said it was all there. Feeling a lot better about this movie&&I don't know why, but that really bugged me during the trailer.&&I said the very same thing when the Rogue One trailer came out. Then, just like the rebels, I was blown away at the end of the film.&&It reminded me of the train level from Shadows of the Empire 64.&&Evil Emilia Clarke would be great... and add a new layer to why Han doesn't trust seemingly ""noble causes"". Then when he discovers just how genuinely devoted Leia is to the Rebels it would actually make him love her more (though he'd never admit it).&&If the worse thing that can be said about the movie is 'cliche', I'll be relieved.&&I mean its Ron Howard so I'm not expecting it to be terrible. It looks like they played it pretty safe. Still I have to wonder what the Lord and Miller cut was like. &&> Still got some cliche dialogue

Wouldn't be a Star Wars movie without some cheesy dialogue.&&And pretty much guaranteed no force users will be interesting &&The trailer almost makes it look like an origin story for the Millennium Falcon.&&Wasn't that the same description used for *Rogue One*? &&>film people

Who are they?&&Can someone explain why this comment got gold&&""Give or take""??&&""Get off my lawn""&&Shadows of the Empire train level.&&It's hard for the Falcon to be hype when it's essentially been the hype vehicle for every Disney SW film except Rogue One. &&They need to slow down with movie releases. Star Wars just isn't supposed to be a yearly thing. &&Honestly I'm going to be dissatisfied in all star wars movies from now on that don't have a human shaped Droid who is a sarcastic assole.&&Every time it talked I thought it was Phasma???&&I was thinking that people were talking a lot about CGI Leia and Tarkin, but Star Wars' latest droids like this dude and K2SO have been entirely CG and totally lifelike and amazing. They really deserve props for that.&&What do you mean ""now""? Name a Star Wars movie without one.&&He's just not quite as charismatic as Harrison ford. But you can forgive a little, because... like... Harrison Ford was one of the most charismatic leading men in cinema history.&&I think Ehrenreich just has a higher hill to climb. Ford is one of the most iconic actors. Donald Glover doesn't look or sound anything like Billy Dee Williams, yet everyone is giving universal praise for him. That's because Billy Dee Williams is not on the same status level as Ford, so Glover doesn't have to meet anyone's expectations for portraying Lando. &&His delivery of every line sounds kinda flat. There’s not much flavor in him so far. &&Same, I just feel like the movies aren't what they used to be. And I know, I know rose-tinted glasses and all. The new movies just don't feel the same.
&&Star Wars just doesn't feel special anymore. It used to feel special when the movies were spaced out and in a set trilogy. Now, they're releasing one every year, trilogy or not. &&This is what happens when companies decide to annualize their properties.&&Well I mean he's someone who isn't Harrison Ford trying to *be* Harrison Ford. The whole premise was flawed from the start. Why they chose this story instead of picking from the million other ripe story lines in the Star Wars universe is beyond me.

That said, I'm still looking forward to this. I think Chewie might end up being the glue that holds this movie together.&&This is probably the hardest role to take on for any actor. So many people have Ford in mind, and no one is going to be able to replicate his charisma, voice, mannerisms, etc. I think we'll all enjoy the movie more if we go in not expecting a Ford impression, but if he legitimately puts in a good performance. &&I guess we will wait till the movie.

It's because we are so used to ford&&He's also way too short to be Han (which I know he can't control, but the casting team messed that up).&&[Boom, you looking for this?](https://scontent.fsnc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30415055_2219988164684410_7522425502549395630_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=d0b76bf3b0fb8c1b0db4a66369ffc866&oe=5B2B52C6)&&/ever&&""worst ambiguous sidekick death train ever""

⭐⭐🚫🚫🚫

When the time came for the train to lurch sideways and my trusted sidekick to dramatically fall into the void, it became apparent that the staff didn't take their job seriously. The troopers they had on Train Battle duty barely even pretended to shoot at us, missing us by 8-16 feet. They often doubled up on passengers due to a lack of staff to adequately operate all of the stations. And I haven't even mentioned the ambiguity of the fall. I could easily see my sidekick smash onto a rock, leaving no room for assumptions about his fate.

 Unacceptable!

However, I must grant a star, as the basil chicken platter was lovely. My compliments to the chef.

I recently rewatched all the Star Wars movies and the on screen examples of Wookiee doesn’t really show the ferocious badass nature that they get credit for, other than references to ripping peoples arms off we don’t really ever see a Wookie destroy anyone hand to hand&&( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&Cheers, I didn't feel like watching the whole trailer again to see what everyone's freaking out about&&[deleted]&&Lumpy is Snoke. &&He already made his return to canon in the new books.

Seriously.&&Actually shes been canon for awhile. She and Lumpy are both referenced (and I think there is even a chapter from Lumpy's POV) in the Aftermath trilogy&&Honestly I would be 200x more excited if it was a Lando spinoff. If I end up watching this (which I will because I'm a fucking sheep), Don Glover is like 80% of the reason why.&&I'm hoping both Donald and Alden knock it out of the park, because I want those two supporting Sebastian Stan in a post-RotJ Luke film. &&Fun fact: Don Glover was in his 20's before he realised his name could also read as: DonG lover. I remember him remarking on it in an interview. &&I can't unsee him as Troy. When he's sitting at the table i 100% believe there are notches. &&>Lando spinoff film

This could be really cool. It would have a lot more room to get creative and unique than most spinoffs, since Lando doesn't have a ton of expectations and backstory already attached to him. Whoever developed this would have a lot of freedom to try cool ideas free from the restrictive expectations imposed on the Solo film. &&sounds like Troy pretending to be Lando&&Yep instantly threw me off. I hope it's not that bad for the entire movie cuz it's going to be annoying for me. Shit like this is why I think the only safe bet for a Star Wars spinoff is the Obi Wan spinoff because you have someone ready to play the character who's already established as said character and not just some new actor portraying a younger version of the character. &&“WE ARE CHEWIE.”&&“This is actually Chewie 2, but we don’t ever call him that in front of the kids.”&&Plot twist: Han dies, so Chewie gets a new pet and it's the Han played by Harrison Ford. &&Chewie's brother names Louie and chewie told him everything about han and their gang, so no need for introductions and they should just call him Chewie in honor of his dead brother.&&Probably drop a moon on him, or something.&&[deleted]&&Someone told my brother the same thing before he saw TFA. He kept expecting Chewie to die and his jaw hit the floor when he saw who actually died lol&&I was watching Overwatch twitch streams the day before I was going to see The Last Jedi and someone spoiled it by saying that Kylo died.

I went the whole movie thinking he was going to die.

I’m fine with finding out about the origins of things but I don’t want too much in terms of just references to lines he said in the other movies.&&A few small references would be fine, but yeah not too much cheese please.&&That DID look a lot like his trusty DL-44&&Can we just talk about Rampart please&&I'd like to be able to watch the original trilogy without thinking ""Woody Harrelson kissed that"" every time Han whips out his piece.

Oh well, haha.&&> Ron Howard has a very difference perspective on the movies - and George Lucas who he worked with on American Graffiti - and is probably a lot less of a fanboy.

In one of the many Star Wars documentaries (sorry, not sure which one) he talks about seeing the first one in a theatre with his wife and how he was blown away from the opening scene. 

When the movie ended he and his wife walked out of the theatre and without really saying a word to each other got in line to go to the next showing.&&That's a really good point. I remember Gareth Edwards describing working on Rogue One as ""playing with toys"" or something along those lines. 

What is selling me on this movie so far is just how different and unique it looks compared to other Star Wars movies. It actually looks engaging, and not just a copy/paste of things we've already seen. Which is funny, because it seemed like a pretty unnecessary origin story for a character from the original trilogy, yet it looks like it has more originality than any of the other new movies so far.&&[i'm riding solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcxOUvybtCE)&&I await the countless YouTube re-edits that replace the real soundtrack with music from Star Wars Kinect. &&[Oh my goooooooooood](https://youtu.be/tmrWeliK4fk) &&Better than I would at 190 years old.&&Idk don’t trust leaks. &&Lando is also rumored to survive. But take that with a grain of salt. &&Really? An inside source reported that Han dies, and Emilia Clarke's character marries Chewbacca. A lot of mystery surrounding this film&&I suppose that's just part of the risk of taking over such an iconic character, not only does your performance have to be good on its own merits, it has to do right by the established character.

Still not sold on his voice or Glover's yet, but I'm interested to see where they take it. The actual dialogue and mannerisms seem appropriate.&&Lawrence Kasdan has been involved with 3/4 movies that feature Han Solo. This makes it 4/5. I think from the writing aspect of the character it’ll be okay.&&It is written by the guys who came up with ~90% of all the Han dialogue in the Episodic films, so it should be well written. &&>Must suck getting so much flak about your acting skills before the movie even comes out.

Man, that was a stressful game.&&[deleted]&&Agreed. This could really just be a cliche heist film in space and I'm all for it, because the Star Wars universe can easily make such a generic template feel fresh.&&Considering they never finished filming the movie, no such cut would exist.&&Ron Howard is my favorite director who has consistently been bombing at the box office. I feel bad for the dude, but glad that Hollywood still has faith in his directing skills, because most of his films are great.&&They might pull a unique way of integrating the Force like Chirrut, but considering Han's utter lack of faith in the Force in the OT this would have to be very minimal, likely from one of the villains rather than one of the crew.&&They're dead.

I HATE THEM!&&[Because of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/)&&This gives me hope for a KotOR movie. HK-47 warms my meatbag central power core.&&I'm going to be dissatisfied that all Star Wars movies have the same sarcastic asshole droid character because it will make the movies feel like they're being made to template. I'm charmed by them like everyone, but there's a lot of different droids you could have. &&What about a sarcastic porg?&&I'm glad to see someone else thought the same thing.&&Yeah the dude has big shoes to fill and honestly I don't think he will totally pull it off.

I won't count it against him or the movie though, the OT was insanely lucky with its casting.&&Even in his first movie, the charisma was already there.
&&That's why I'm not a fan of another actor portraying Han. It'll be impossible not to compare him to Harrison. &&Even River Phoenix had trouble playing a younger Harrison Ford.&&I was really looking forward to seeing footage of Glover finally speaking as Lando. Not gonna lie, I'm kind of disappointed to say I was underwhelmed. I'm sure the tiny bit we've seen in this trailer isn't indicative of his entire performance though; he's pulled through every other time. &&Or because Glover is kind of a fan favorite and has plenty of performances that people like

But he does look like Lando. Idk why people say he doesn’t. Look up a picture of them side by side. &&Exactly. Was about to say the same thing. As portrayed by Ford, Han Solo has such a greater hold on our perception of the character than Billy Dee Williams could ever do for Lando. 

Basing it solely on screen time which has a good impact on...well, impact, IMDB nicely just told me that in the OT, Han Solo gets roughly 4x the screen time of Lando. And that doesn't even speak to the talent of the actor, the writing or delivery of the lines, or the editorial or story-based weight placed on the character's scenes, etc...

So yeah, it's really easy to see an already appreciated performer as doing a great job as a fairly under-represented character while likewise not having any goodwill for an unknown actor to translate into the portrayal of a widely known and beloved character.

TLDR: Poor Alden Ehrenreich never had a chance...

Edit: Link for screen time via IMDB, again, only looking at the OT: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls027631145/&&Would that it twere so simple&&Yeah I almost want him to ham it up a bit and really go for it. Maybe he will though, we’ve not seen much. &&Seems too stiff for a harrison ford character&&I'm with you. Almost 40 and I was super excited about TFA and after watching it, I was able to enjoy it but I was wanting something totally new and I was predicting major plot points just by how much it was mirroring ANH. I forced myself past all that and accepted it into my Star Wars heart. Then TLJ came in and erased any doubt that these aren't going to be movies that I had hoped for. Not only that but to me they are souring old characters... namely Luke. I HATE Rian's interpretation and I think Hamill was 100% correct in his early criticism. Then the plot holes and cartoony decisions just ruined all hope from me. 

For that reason, and the fact that I thought a Han Solo movie was the dumbest fucking idea they could have thought of, I am not looking forward to it. It's the first time in my life I haven't been off the walls about an upcoming Star Wars movie. Usually by now I would be excited and have my midnight screening tickets ready but as it is I'm not sure I'm even going to see it in theaters. &&What blows my mind about it, is that Harrison Ford was Han Solo in The Force Awakens.  It isn't like he died in the end of the original trilogy and we kind of lost track of what the character really had going for him.  We had a very recent reminder of who Harrison Ford's version of Han Solo is.

They could have waited until the trilogy ended and made this movie and it wouldn't feel so weird to see someone else play Han Solo, because Han Solo wouldn't be as fresh in everyones mind.&&I agree. Can't wait for the sequel *I'll be Bacca: A Chewy Story*&&I think even Ehrenreich was thinking too hard about Ford in this role. You can see it in his expressions. Whoever was the director or acting coach really should've tried to bring as much of his individuality as possible instead of replicating a character that you'll never be able to match. &&> This is probably the hardest role to take on for any actor.

Some actor once had to play a young version of Brando's Don Corleone. Bob something. I wonder what happened to him?&&It's also not like Ford hasn't played the role since ROTJ or something, he just played it a little over 2 years ago. &&Ford was always going to be impossible to replicate.

I wouldn't want to be the actor that has to try to step into his shoes.&&Aren't you a little short for a ~~stormtrooper~~ Han Solo?&&Damn these memes are quick. &&Justice League had its moments. 

All 2 of them. &&Uncharted 2 is one of the best games all time. God I miss having a PlayStation. Got an Xbox one cause of friends, kinda regret it.&&I love the menu/main theme. It just screams ""adventure!""

Da da daaaaa daaaaa daaaaaaaaaaaaa da daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

DAAAAAAAAAAA DAAA DAAA DAAA DAAA DAAA DAAAAA DAAAAA DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&&After reading your comment I just realized how much I want a Chewbacca dlc for some Mortal Kombat game.&&In all honesty it probably isn't. He's 190. &&I killed a guy with a trident.&&now there are two of them!

btw this is a prequel so this is legal&&Let's do it for Landfill!&&So Solo is just like Beerfest?&&Exactly like Boba Fett. Who does nothing and then gets kicked to death.&&https://i.imgur.com/8q8UkFE.png&&He's a lumpier character than we've ever had in any of the other films before.  &&Darth Lumpawaroo&&Yeah, Chewy's family were canon even under George Lucas, which I always thought was funny given how much he hated how the Holiday Special turned out.&&I'd say there's a 90% chance we get a Lando spinoff film eventually.

Donald Glover is just so damn liked/marketable/popular.&&Fuuuuuuuuck I want that now too. &&That wouldn't really make any sense though? 

Prequels are one thing, but having Luke be played by Mark Hamill in the OT, to Sebastian Stan in a spin-off, back to Mark Hamill in the new trilogy...that's a little silly. Same goes for Alden and Donald, especially with them all looking significantly younger than OT Han and Lando. By the time they get to be the ages of Harrison and Billy in RotJ, they probably won't even look like them at all. &&The chances of that getting through his whole school life untouched are next to 0.&&Well, he did grow up very repressed in a Jehova's Witness family. Also, he's a comedian, so he could have been doing a bit. A lot of comedians try out new bits on late night shows.&&I think he reserved it as an alternate twitter handle: https://twitter.com/donglover&&Troy and Solo in the morning.&&To be fair, Ewan was cast to play a newer, younger Guinness. He just had three movies to make a mark as the definitive Kenobi.&&I am Chewie!&&Damnit Iris. &&Is that an EU reference?&&Fake spoilers are fun sometimes.&&It seemed so obvious that it was coming though.&&Christmas Special and the Prequels: The Most Ambitious Crossover Event in History??&&So why don't you kill meeee!&&This one gets my upvote, because it has more y's. &&That was a solid clone wars arc&&Actually yes.&&Yeah that doesn't sound right...&&He was 180 at the start of the Clone Wars.  22 years before the Death Star was destroyed.  So assuming he's 190 in this movie, that takes place 12 years before the original Star Wars.&&nah he was 181 in ep 3. That puts this 9 years after ep 3. Making Solo  19. Seems perfectly fine to me

source:http://www.yodasdatapad.com/ages.html&&How many is that in dog years?&&Well how long is a day on Coruscant? Hell, how long is a day anywhere? How the hell do they all keep to their schedules as they're going from planet to planet?&&That's why Chewie swore a life debt to Han
&&Yeah Han was an officer (maybe a pilot?) And he saved Chewie&&Not just legends. Thrawn in current canon uncovered the Empire using Wookiee slaves for the Death Star construction. He was *visibly* repulsed by it, but accepted that he is in no position to do anything about it, and it's just ""how the Empire does things"".&&https://imgur.com/4wVsJuv&&So a perfect family basically.&&I just watched the Holiday Special recently (because youtube suggested it) without knowing how shit it is... Man, that was really bad, and not in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way, except maybe the grandpa watching VR porn thing. &&He is actually, from the second Aftermath book&&The sacred texts!&&This is where the fun begins
&&Is that legal?&&Yippie!&&Ironic &&*Airhorns*&&""I've got a really good feeling about this.""&&I think that was one of the better parts of TFA, Han and Chewie had great character development without relying on the original trilogy too much. Moments like ""Chewie, we're home"" were great, but they weren't the bulk of their scenes. Hopefully this movie is able to introduce a younger Han that has an interesting story to tell, without relying too much on what we already know comes later.&&Fair point. I didn't mean to imply he wasn't a fan, what I was really trying to say is that Star Wars isn't a formative experience for him because he was already a director when it came out. For directors like JJ Abrams, Star Wars is probably a big part of why they became a director in the first place and that love will bleed through into his movies, Howard has a very different perspective.&&Really shows what bang-up job Chris Pine did stepping into Kirk's shoes. He brought a really balanced portrayal of William Shatner's Kirk with some of his own flair. 

Hope Alden pulls this off.&&It's not their voice, but their deliveries that matter.&&Mark Hammill does a great Harrison Ford impersonation. Should've cast him instead.&&Since he's the one who wrote Empire, he's the one who wrote his history with Lando, basically the first one who wrote Han as having a ""backstory"". That, and he probably has thought about it for decades now. It'll be okay.&&Solo takes place between 11-14 years before ANH.&&Awsome music, PTSD level &&One of the clearest memories from this game was the terror of being chased by a wampa then learning that you could lure it to kill all the snowtroopers.&&Perhaps the archives are incomplete?&&Dailies though. There's a reason KK was able to be concerned.&&Something like this could certainly fall into the “simple tricks and nonsense” category of the Solo belief system. &&[deleted]&&Canderous and HK for life on Dark Side runs.&&He probably had to feel so much pressure trying to 'replace' Harrison Ford. 

I couldn't handle that.&&I mean... he was damn good.&&And it was forgivable for River since he was portraying a teen Ford, so he was able to get away with some things since we don't know what Ford was like at that age. Alden Ehrenreich has to play Ford at an age when we actually have a real reference to compare to.  &&He did a pretty damn good job, actually.&&Yeah honestly, reading people bashing Ehrenreich while praising Glover's portrayal based on that one line, I was like, ""really....?"" I think we're all biased since Glover is more popular and we know what we can expect from him. Let's give Ehrenreich a chance.  &&Professor Professorson?&&I think you hit it on the head. They could easily have pulled out some other story rather than doing Solo right now. He'll, he died in VII, if they'd just waited til after IX I think it'd have been easier to pull off.&&[deleted]&&All Disney had to do was watch those YouTube vids of the dude who does Harrison ford impressions and they would have been fine. ^/s&&They should have just cast someone who can play a character like Han. Donald Glover doesn't sound like Lando but I see some of the coolest parts of Lando in him.&&That's the meme that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.&&1. When Flash is running and a certain someone was able to turn and look at him

What's #2?&&Steppenwolf's attack on Themyscira and the one where they try to fight Superman, right?&&Uncharted 4 had a great ending to the ""Drake"" part of the story. I haven't played the one with Chloe as the main character, but I've heard it's good.&&Nate's theme is my favorite piece of video game music &&He decapitates his foes in the Lego games &&I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that.

Lay low for a while.&&Where did you get a hand grenade?  &&Whats a zj?&&One time Landfill farted an entire plum.&&He's got the Eye of The Jew!&&Boba Fett gave Vader lip and Vader took it. That's why he's a bad ass &&At least Boba Fett has the biggest badass in the galaxy single him out and angrily say NO DISINTIGRATIONS.

He also was the only one to track Han Solo.&&https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FrZ-xeAlJ_c/maxresdefault.jpg&&https://i.imgur.com/BCHpmkn.gif&&Snoke's true identity: a shaved Lumpy.&&To be fair, if done right, the Holiday Special is [a hell of a story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Holiday_Special).  There's Chewie, hero of the Rebellion.  He's headed back to Kashyyyk, where his family and friends are preparing to celebrate Life Day. Imperials toss the house, looking for evidence of the family's involvement in the Rebellion.

Imagine it recut, or even redone using the Star Wars Rebels assets.&&I' say there's a 40% chance this turns out to be Glover's Lando movie instead of Ehrenreich's Solo movie&&But he's no Lando suave. I still don't feel any *sexiness* there. &&Feels crazy to think not that many years ago I was watching Derrick Comedy videos wondering when this kid would get a shot,  and now it's like ""they will probably be making another Star Wars movie for him""

Talk about a meteoric rise&&I want Teddy Perkins and Benny to show up and take down the sith &&*Nights*&&Punch it, Chewie!&&Yes, that is how Chewie died in the EU.  &&After the final episode of last season's GoT I texted my friend saying [Sansa dies in the episode](#spoiler). He cursed me to no end for spoiling it and proceeded to watch the episode expecting her to die. He later told me the fake spoiler made it so much better for him. So yeah fake spoilers are fun more often than not I guess.&&Yeah, they telegraphed the living shit out of it. &&Get crazy with the cheez whiz&&Double barrel buckshot!&&What episodes did that happen in?&&looks like they finally heard /r/prequelmemes and are giving em what they want. i will be watching this movies career with great interest&&Especially since this took place before Rebels, which is 15 years after Chewbacca saw Yoda for the last time.&&9 cats.&&>Well how long is a day on Coruscant? 

I very glad you asked! Because the wiki page clearly says:

>60 seconds = 1 minute[5]

>60 minutes = 1 hour[5]

>24 hours = 1 day[5]

>5 days = 1 week[5]

>7 weeks = 35 days = 1 month[5]

>10 months + 3 festival weeks + 3 holidays = 368 days = 1 year[5]

Obviously it is meant to closely correspond to our calendar.&&And then you make him kill Mission.

Wait... &&Oh yeah, the part about Han being in the Empire at one point- I was never sure if that was canon, head canon, noncanon or retconned.&&Grandpa Lou Pickles had some dirty secrets.&&Holy fuck, 8-year-old me had no idea. 😫&&Holy shit&&really? i dont remember that&&Yippeeee!&&Game time started.&&So it's treason then.&&Some version of that line is in every Star Wars movie though. Just cuz they put that line in doesn't mean there will be a ton of other cheesy references.&&Howard also turned down directing Star Wars in the past &&He didn’t really even try to mimic Shatner until the last minutes of the first movie. I had no problem with Pine as Kirk or Quinto as Spock, but I was blown away at how amazing Karl Urban was as McCoy. I was the odd girl out who’s favorite was McCoy and I was really worried about the movie until I saw and heard Urban as Bones. It was the scene where he first meets Kirk and says “Space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness and silence!” That was so sweet. 

I have hopes that this Han Solo movie will have that moment where you stop seeing the actor and just see the characters acted. &&Exactly. Martin Freeman didn't *sound* like the established Bilbo, and that was faaaar from being the issue with The Hobbit movies.&&I've always thought that the dude who voices the Joker should be in more live-action stuff. Star Wars would be *perfect* for him!&&Oh, Harrison Ford does a wicked Han Solo impersonation, they should've cast him!&&That's what I would like to see too, somebody claiming to be able to use the force but he turns out to be a fraud &&It's Canderous. Or Mandalore. Take your pick.&&""...Everybody's lost but me.""
&&I think one of Billy Dees most signature aspects is his deep, and honestly beuatiful voice. Donald simply does not have that.&&Everyone on the internet is a casting director.&&The credits&&In all honesty, I really like the scene where Barry's dad is telling him to give up on him.  It was the one spot in the film where the characters felt like real people I should give a shit about.&&I loved the scene towards the end where Barry is totally happy to have saved that family and then Superman one-ups him by carrying away an entire apartment building. That was some Silver Age shit right there. &&Gals smile&&Superman staring down the Flash was badass the rest of the movie left no impression on me...&&You mean the flash v superman ""fight"" it's definitely a high point&&3 scences, it also had that flashback where you see the gods and a green lantern :D Yup, 3 cool scenes. &&Best final act of all the Uncharted games is in Lost Legacy. Really great game. 

4>2>LL>3>1

Fucking hard to rank though because I do love them all&&I loved Uncharted 4, but Lost Legacy might actually be a little bit better.  Great story, great characters, and some of the best action of any Uncharted game.

Naughty Dog doesn't know how to make bad video games.&&Not just decapitates - if I'm remembering the animation correctly he tears both their arms off, they look at the holes where there were arms, and then explode. **From the pain**

Yes, but this one is obviously a play on that fact. Every single other time the line is ""I've got a bad feeling about this.""

I kinda liked the reference though. It's sort of like in Casino Royale when Bond was asked ""shaken or stirred,"" and he responded, ""Do I look like I give a damn?!""&&Urban killed that role and continues to. He did his research that’s for sure. &&I would like to join the McCoy-is-best group please. My dad and I used to get up early to watch the show when I was a kid and McCoy always made me laugh more than anyone else. &&I love McCoy and I think Karl Urban does such a wonderful job! You can really tell he respects the character; he wasn't sure if he was coming back for Beyond because he wanted them to be truer to McCoy (and I think Justin Lin did a great job with that).

I think I remember Leonard Nimoy giving an interview where he states that upon seeing Urban's first moments as McCoy, he burst into tears because it was so much like his friend.&&""You just sat a man down at a high stakes poker game with no cards and told him to bluff!"" - Karl Urban as McCoy. He's the best thing about those movies, hands down.&&Karl Urban is pretty much the most underestimated actor in any given movie. I sincerely hope he keeps getting the roles that he loves and let him be seen so more people can appreciate what he's putting into his work.&&Hell, Martin Freeman as Bilbo was one of the best things about those movies. &&Yes but Bilbo or the actor who played him are hardly Harrison Ford level status where everyone and their mother can hear his voice in their head. &&Or have it in the same sense of a magician, just some kind of trick that is not super practical but you can win a bet on&&Doesn't even have to be deep, in my opinion. He just needs the smooth, chill cadence that Williams has/had. In the trailer it doesn't even look like he's trying for it, though.&&How is the feeling of knowing that you just lost 2 hours to a movie where nothing cool happens except for Ezra Miller a good moment?&&I couldn't give a shit bc I've seen that in the Flash show too many times. &&You know what? You're right. That was fucking hilarious and extremely true to character&&Question. Why would he bother fighting people in real time when he could just finish them off in half a second. &&Flash running by Superman, who turns to look at him.  And Flash's ""Oh shit"" look.

&&I suggest a new strategy: let the wookie win&&Savage &&""I'm sorry, did you just say the thing turned inside out, and then it exploded?""  
""Hold please!""&&*big guy&&That's true, Vader got backtalk from his coworkers kind of often. Boba's ballsy but that still doesn't cancel out that he had one of the dumbest deaths in the series.&&I like thinking he allowed backtalk-to a point-because of how mouthy he was during the Clone Wars.

It makes Naughty Nurses 2 look like Crotch Capers 3!&&Now this is memeing!&&yeah I didn't mind the one in the trailer at all&&I also like that if you count the subversion in Rogue One (K2 goes to say it and only gets a few words out before he's told to shut up) it seems like the trend is to have the real line in the saga movies, and subvert it in the standalones, which is hilarious&&He did the same thing for Dredd. Heck he even was solid against the Rock in the Doom movie. &&Source: https://trekmovie.com/2017/08/06/stlv17-karl-urban-waiting-on-paramount-decision-for-star-trek-4-ok-if-beyond-is-his-last-trek/&&Martin Freeman nailed that performance. His delivery and mannerisms were perfect.&&The Hobbit is a lot of fun when it focuses on Bilbo and his adventure. It is why I think the first movie is the strongest (although it is still way too long), and the Smaug section in the second is also great. The third movie is just a big battle that has no stakes or involvement from Bilbo, which is why it is largely boring, and he is so irrelevant and removed to most of the happenings in the second that it is a real slog until the third act when Smaug shows up. Freeman deserved better than the movies he got, he was the perfect Bilbo.&&That's not saying much.

Though he did do a phenomenal job.&&Cause it’s over and you get to go home and forget the movie&&Eventually in the comics they realise this, and Superman stops facing physical challenges and they move over to more emotional/moral dilemmas. &&[deleted]&&I got the impression he only got that fast in response to a threat.

Edit: I seem to remember reading that one of Superman's writers said he's always as strong as he needs to be and that's how I view his power levels.&&~~*indignant beep*~~

*Atari noises*&&In legends he didn't die, but that's a different story. 😐&&Oh damn. I never thought of that. I wonder if Anakin knows his backstory?&&Never tell me the odds.&&It's made with bits of real panther, so you know it's good&&That doesn’t make sense.&&Sooooooooy&&Yo, bring it on down&&Season 4 E7-E22 is perfect.

I just can't bring myself into hurting innocent people albeit fake ones in a video game&&Yep&&I was about to make this point.

I think all SW movies will continue some trends (bad feeling in core movies, call back in side movies), 3PO and R2 in every movie, etc, and there isn't anything wrong with them. Just like Stan Lee in MCU.&&The best little thing about Dredd is that he refused to remove the helmet because the helmet is too essential to the character.&&Urban is actually a huge geek and fan of the stuff he acts in. &&I feel like the only one who fricken *loved* Doom. The characters were fun, the plot was solid, the action was great (especially the FPS scene). So what if it wasn't exactly like the video game? If i wanted to watch the video game for 2 hours, I'd play the video game. Getting real sick of the ""it wasn't just like the video game, therefore it sucked"" argument. Same way with Super Mario Bros - another fun, well-made film imo.

(not ranting at you btw, just in general lol)&&And let's not forget his fantastic turn as Eomer. &&Martin Freeman is a good actor, though.  As much as i liked Alden in Hail, Caesar, that was more of a caricature than a character.

First Poster for Pixar's Short Film 'Bao',38807,8c0d58,https://i.redd.it/yf18b35bapr01.jpg,686,1523635914.0,,"Will premiere in front of Incredibles 2. It's about a Chinese mom that makes a pork dumpling that comes to life.

> In March, Pixar announced its next short film would be called Bao, focusing on an “empty-nesting Chinese mom” who makes an adorable pork dumpling that comes to life, Pinocchio-style. Bao’s director Domee Shi — who’s the first-ever woman to direct a Pixar short film — told Entertainment Weekly last month that the movie represents a “magical, modern-day fairy tale, kind of like a Chinese Gingerbread Man story” that follows the complexities of a mother-child relationship (even if that child happens to be an edible object imbued by magic). Shi’s own mother, a Chinese-Canadian immigrant, served as a consultant on the film, ensuring the animated dumpling-making scenes were accurate to her own folding style.

Edit: Here's a clip they released: https://twitter.com/DisneyPixar/status/984540235861131265&&Thought I was in r/berserk for a second&&""Sir, The Incredibles didn't market too well with Chinese audiences-""

&&Darn too bad I won’t be getting another 30 minute frozen short based on its most Annoying character &&I didn't even know that Pixar made posters for their short films.&&Reminds me of the cutesy artwork for the board game [Sushi Go](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/opengraph/img/w9V5ygcwZt86_X9dnLTKL4Zd-u4=/fit-in/1200x630/pic1900075.jpg).&&I wouldn't be surprised if Pixar's created a short based on the life of a trash can. It'll have such adorable eyes and it'll be about how it feeds from trash. Then one moment... BOOM. It receives trash that isn't really trash. Its actually another man's treasure.... a homeless person's treasure. The trash can realizes it and pursues the man to bring him the treasure. The man finds this adorable little trash can and is grateful for the unused jacket the trash can gave him.&&A man who never eats pork buns is never a whole man.&&Pachimari?&&Didn't know they were making a movie on Puck!&&Whats Puck doin here.&&Thought that was puck at first&&Is that Puck?&&Can someone tell me the name of a short I saw a few years ago, about a guy who worked a soul crushing job but found balance in surfing?&&Love me some Bao!

But in English, dumpling refers to anything with dough and a filling (just checked wikipedia, apparently dough without filling can be called dumplings too). So I think Chinese speakers tend to associate dumplings with jiaozi, and buns with baozi. But it's not really a direct translation.

From time to time i would receive Moutai as a gift, but I always felt it was incredibly overrated. It was a hundred times more expensive than the worst, but only twice as good, imho. 
But the best...WuLongYe without a doubt. It's the only BaiJiu I could describe as smooth. Just thinking of it brings me back to the twilight of my youth.

It's a shame too, because it would have fit very well.&&I don't know if you know about it, but you should check out the Disney short 'Paperman' that was played before Wreck-It Ralph.

However recently there has been an even greater shift as Hollywood is trying to pretend that every film released is a great charitable service rather than just trying to make money.

Not because they shouldn't have something special, but because that means we are in a much better place equality-wise. &&Hypebole ftw guys

1) Hollywood isn't one person. It's not even the totality of American filmmaking, referring to it as behaving one way then behaving another is ridiculous. As Aaron Sorkin said, it's hard to find two people in LA in the same room who agree with one another. So ""After years of racism and sexism..."" is blaming one person for something someone else did.

So ""Hollywood"" doing one thing then later doing another is just ""Some People did X,"" then ""Other People did Y."" There is no homogeneous coordinated effort to what you're complaining about.

2) Most artists want to feel like they're working on something good, doing good. Most actors are liberal. Once you spend a few decades investigating the human condition, you start empathizing with evil and you get much softer on crime, you empathize with the plight of immigrants, you're more tolerant toward social outcasts like gay people, transgender, etc. You are actively choosing to watch a liberal industry, so complaining that it's liberal is an oxymoron.

Remember Silicon Valley, that episode where everyone kept saying they were changing the world through various GUI improvements? Same shit. Nearly every industry that makes something wants to think that they're spending their time doing something worthwhile. And sometimes - they are.

3) Pop Culture, which includes movies, influences the world. We literally saw the #metoo movement take off with movies. It didn't start with Roger Ailes, or Bill O'Reilly, or Bill Clinton or Donald Trump- it started with movies. Film, TV, and literature are influential. It's undeniable. Hell, movies are so great that even though you know they're all liberal and want to make you all nicer people who don't hate immigrants and follow your dreams of being poets or whatever - you'll still digest their product. You even, for some random ass reason, even watched promotional material for *A Wrinkle In Time*. 919 views on that video. More people have seen this thread than watched that crap.

4) When a studio greenlights a movie, the people who greenlighted usually aren't the people in the promo videos you're watching on youtube. It's, again, another case of Some People doing one thing, and Other People doing another, and you blaming everyone involved. Oprah wanted to do a nice movie. She's pretty selective. The Studio said, ""I think we can make money off of this, so let's do it."" Oprah is still allowed to believe in the project beyond ""oooh money!""&&Annihilation didn't and nobody watched it...&&This thread is an orgy for cynics &&That's just part of it though, I mean Hollywood is also made of up individuals who have pushed and fought, and campaigned for us to get to the point where Hollywood would give minorities and women a chance that was never given in the past. Does it suck that Hollywood pats itself on the back? Yeah but that's beside the point, the point is we've made it to the point where black actors and women can actually take a platform that was never given to them before. This is what industrial progress looks like and not just in Hollywood. &&It's simply modern marketing, and there's no need to be upset about it.

Hollywood movies need to appeal to the largest amount of people possible, so they market to different groups in different ways. Thanks to the massive amount of group analytics, marketers can target different groups in different ways, with the same goal of getting as many people as possible into the theater.

People who watch Oprah are going to generally be of a certain mindset, so the movie is marketed through her to enforce that mindset.

In other media, like a sci-fi blog, diversity in A Wrinkle in Time is downplayed, with the focus being on the sci fi elements or special effects.

20 years ago, everyone would get the same advertisement, but it just doesn't work that way anymore. Marketing is very sophisticated now, much more than the simple example I gave.

Really? Executive salaries? Golden parachutes?  Lets fix the greed problems if the sociopathic ""captains of industry"" before we start complaining about (((librul hollywood)))&&Thank you for saying what I was thinking. I am a person of colour and I absolutely hate when people use that as a toy to badger people different from me over the head for sociopathic money driven reasons.

The whole professional special interest  advocate that sows division to make personal profit  just really disgusts me generally.


I loved black panther but I hated there was a number of people harassing publications for giving it negative reviews and of course the racism moniker is hard to lift once it's appended. 


I would love more moana and coco type movies but that doesn't mean cinderella or some classic European  tales should be thrown to the side for that. 

I just think if it's a good movie that speaks to a community and has universal themes then the market will find it. 


But what these Hollywood leach industries do is to weaponise division for profit. Just like with ghostbusters. If you hated the new one that somehow was a commentary on if you were a feminist or not or how you voted in the election. And companies capitalised on miconstruding genuine criticism as just hate speech so the outrage vote the other way for people who didn't look too into the story, would go up 

&&You can't have it both ways. You can't attack movies for lack of representation and then when they listen to you and try and fix it, you can't then moan about how it's a desperate cash grab.&&It just comes across like marketing. It tries to encourage people to go to the films because it will in some way mean greater equality or fix societies problems.

It won't.

It just feels like a disgusting third party ad campaign. It drums up some 'Men hate this new films because women."" and inside is just a mention of a comment made on the youtube video but the message is clear

**If you don't go see this movie made by rich people, starring rich people for the purposes of enriching those people then you are sexist. It's \#CurrentYear**

The perfect example is how films like ghostbusters receive so much praise and attention for the female cast and get many a mention but films like Annihilation as barely talked about despite having a much stronger message.

 &&Yeah! Time to circlejerk, trade conspiracy theories, and welcome brigades from right wing trolls! Super job OP&&But...but they’re finally getting roles. Who cares if Hollywood is patting themselves on the back or not?

Just let Hollywood be smug, and support the movies you want to see more of.&&Jesus fuck, you complain about X. They fix X. You whine that. Wtf!&&I never read the books but I can say that A Wrinkle in Time is a fucking horrible movie. Legitimately one of the worst movies I've ever seen.&&I, for one, don't care about who is the actor unless they fill the role well.&&I assure you, Wrinkle in Time was not a great movie. This new hollywood strategy is really hurting the quality of movies because instead of creating well developed characters they just plop in a minority actor/actress and the masses find that satisfactory. It’s great when movies have well developed minority characters like Moonlight or Get Out, but so often these days producers think (most of the time correctly) that they can make money by substituting character development for skin tone or gender. It really needs to stop&&I watched “A Wrinkle in Time”. Definitely one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen, painful from start to finish. Maybe enjoyable for young kids&&They aren’t mutually exclusive. Some people write books for money but those books have a profound impact on society. Some doctors make a lot of money helping people.

&&Speaking as part of a minority group I have to say I understand where you are coming from. I wish we could see the day when actors are given roles based on merit and suitability as a matter of course. Where a diverse cast is just seen as a cast; where we can assume that  everyone suitable for the role was given a fair consideration - regardless of skin colour, gender, age, weight etc. But since that has so not been the case, and since there are many examples where stereotypes are the default, at this time we *must* highlight and celebrate movies that are successfully showing a diverse view of the world. It's so much more interesting to experience anyway. &&Hollywood is fake leftist. They’re capitalist shitholes just as much as anyone on Wall Street, yet people amazingly see them as liberal heroes for what they say rather than what they do.

WHAT A SHOCKING REVELATION!&&Does anyone just watch a movie to enjoy themselves anymore? 
Why do people have to go over everything with a fine tooth comb? 

&&You aren't wrong.

But I can play devil's advocate (or maybe I'm just becoming more progressive/liberal as I get older... uh oh). They are definitely smug and self congratulatory about it. Their way of going about it is nauseating, but that doesn't mean their goal or the results of their actions are bad.

> Disney did not spend $103 million on this film to better mankind. They did it for profit. 

Is that really true, though? I mean, it does better mankind, in a way. Yes, we shouldn't care that this movie is basically an exercise in casting minorities and enforcing diversity. That would be ideal. But we do happen to live in a world where that doesn't happen that often, at least not until recently. I think I often assume this too. That the underlying argument is ""this didn't happen because so many people are racist"" (and that probably is often the underlying argument). But they can be wrong in the reason behind a valid observation. There are not very many females that get to direct big budget movies. There are even fewer females that are in a racial/ethnic minority. Maybe it's because everybody is conspiring against them (it's not so simple) or maybe it's because there just aren't that many trying and it just hasn't happened much yet (it's not so simple). Whatever the reason is, when it does happen, there's no way it is a bad thing and a lot of reasons to consider it a good thing. So when it happens, why should it not get pointed out?

It's not necessarily ""we're saving minorities from evil white people"", it's more like they are are paving the way to a certain future. They are making a big budget movie that relies pretty heavily on actors that are minorities, which by definition make up a smaller portion of the audience they hope to captivate, which by definition is a risk.

And more generally, why would somebody making a movie not celebrate it period? What do you expect? They need to market it.

With that being said, the way Black Panther (which I want to see but haven't seen yet) was approached annoyed me quite a bit too, but for a slightly different reason. A lot of the reaction to it was almost people literally saying ""Aw, that's cute, they have their own superhero movies now. Oh, Blade came out 20 years ago? We mean one that can be taken seriously. Don't even mention Blankman...""

I think the same could apply to A Wrinkle in Time. But, even if some people are being patronizing, that doesn't make the result a bad thing. If a general audience that doesn't have a dominating representation in the movie still enjoys the movie then it was probably done right, which is a good thing, right?&&[deleted]&&I do not believe this post made it to the top of this sub organically. &&What an obnoxious post  &&[deleted]&&Welcome to late stage capitalism, where corporations appropriate social justice issues for profit. Really isn't a new thing, and TBH I'd argue that the problem has been far more prevalent for years in the advertising industry. I worked in advertising in NYC for years. People think they're saving the world and doing great work for the LGBTQ community by wrapping BK Whoppers in rainbow colored paper (just one silly example).   
  
OP, your frustration is quite misguided. Sure, companies are actively trying to take advantage of these things. But the consumers who eat this shit up are truly to blame. Hollywood isn't ""suddenly self righteous"". They are just aware of the current business environment they're operating in, and are doing everything they can to capitalize.  
  
That's what businesses do. Unfortunately. People need to wake the fuck up, stop being ""good consumers"", and support businesses/celebrities/artists/etc that are actually decent fucking human beings.  
  
&&And the ""fans"" are eating it up. Claiming every movie starring a woman or a minority to be the greatest movie ever! even when its just an average movie.&&And...what? You're just mad about this because you see it. There's literally no other longstanding industry as visible as Hollywood filmmaking.  You don't see when major companies in other sectors add a token to their board of directors and pat themselves on the back with press releases and write-ups in industry-specific magazines.

Social progress is part and parcel with spinning anything and everything, good or bad, favorably to make more money. It's a feature of capitalism, not a bug. That's reality.&&It's called virtue signaling and it is annoying.. counterproductive... and anyone who does it is pretty self serving.&&I'm going to sound bitter as fuck but I don't care. I hate Disney. Marvel movies are repetitive drivel that has infected the entire western film making landscape. Remakes and reboots were already on the rage but the concept of a ""cinematic universe"" really put the nail in the coffin for creativity and new ideas in Hollywood. Does anyone remember the 20-50 million dollar movie? How many great movies from the 70s-90s made for an equivalent budget are some of the all time classics? Thrillers, character dramas, horror movies? These movies still get made but much less frequently and to substantially less financial success. 

People by and large are simply not interested in ""wasting"" their 3-4 yearly trips to the cinema on a psychological thriller that they don't know much about when they can instead go watch Generic marvel movie #535 and be guaranteed certain elements (quips, action, the same characters, a plot requiring literally 0 thought etc). Of course, if you enjoy these movies, I have no issue with you spending your own money to see them, it just fucking blows that the saturation of the movie landscape by comic book movies and nostalgia snooze fests like the new Star Wars movies and especially something like Ready Player One has to come at the expense of having a diverse selection of films.

What kills me, though, is that even the movies that don't fit this mold have in recent years become so fucking wrapped up in western social issues (racism, sexism, LGBT etc) that despite the variation in plots/concepts, the same messages and beats are omnipresent. Just look at the oscars nominations for the past 5 years. SO many movies are like this. Not every movie starring a woman needs to have her be a generic strong female character. There is variance in women in the real world. Some are strong, some are weak, some are pieces of shit and some aren't. Not every movie about black people needs to be about racism and victimization. Surely there are so many great stories to tell about a variety of subjects and groups of people that don't need to hit these repetitive beats. &&Someone on reddit made a post about how they don't care that minorities are getting better representation in the industry? It must be Wednesday!&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I remember something similar with Budweiser (or Miller - definitely one of the major beer companies) using their distribution chain to get water to victims of a natural disaster... then promptly blowing a shitload of money on a masturbatory Super Bowl ad about it.&&Did you know that Stephanie McMahon started the Women's Revolution? &&The lesson they took from Trish Stratus' popularity was ""we need blonde supermodels"" rather than ""we need women who can wrestle"" and it ruined the women's division for a decade

But hey, at least they backtracked on naming a bathroom break Wrestlemania rumble after a sex trafficker&&This is why I liked how the UFC treated women’s MMA. They didn’t sugarcoat it. They straight out said “we won’t do it because it isn’t profitable.” Then Rousey came along and she was super popular and the UFC created a women’s division. There was never “oh, look how progressive we are!” Ronda was marketed a bit as “girl power” but the UFC never treated it as charity. It was the simple fact that women became profitable and so they created the division. That is pretty complementary in itself.&&If there’s any industry that I’d expect to be breaking through glass surfaces, it would be wrestling. &&I know, it hurts so much.    
    
Don't get me wrong: I love a lot about the womens revolution. The way the represent the women, the way they are allowed to show themselves, the freedom they seem to get in matches etc. etc.   
     
HOWEVER, it has been like this in a lot of different places, like japan and mexico, for way too fucking long to the WWE to pat themselves on the back and act like a pioneer in this, especially since, as you have pointed out, they have put the limitations on their former diva division themselves.&&Perfectly worded, they shit on the “pillow fight” and “bra and panties” matches from the last decade, but you were the ones putting it on TV! 

It was the exact same people in charge then as it is now.&&Then they had James Ellsworth win the first womens money in the bank match&&CTRL+F ""WWE"".....here it is.&&To be fair, the WWE used to treat the women like absolute shit on tv, and it wasnt ever something done under the cover of industry secrets. Shit was on tv. 

Theyre effectively trying to a PR turnaround, telling people theyve made mistakes in the oast and are trying to correct it. 

Is it obnoxious how much they promote themselves for it? Sure, its often better to let the wrestling speak for itself regardless of gender, but WWE is in the business of marketing and promotion. They know theyre past with women wasnt great, so theres no real harm in overpromoting doing the right thing if its for the right intentions, and they genuinely do push womens wrestling as equal footing now to the men. &&Just don't mention the upcoming event in Saudi Arabia&&I have always wanted to see a female wrestler fight a male wrestler and win. While the stunts are ""real"" in that they do require physical prowess, those women are obviously up to the task and it would be awesome to see, like (it's been a while so it might be dated) Rahkishi being tossed around by Lita.&&Every. Fucking. Week. 
Oh trust me, wrestling fans know. Better yet was them trying to fix that whole Great Moolah Battle Royale thing. &&Yet they still treat the Women's division like an afterthought. It's probably also a thing to make Stephanie look like a hero. 

They also go on during Black History Month.

Yet they still haven't had a black guy hold the WWE Championship since The Rock. (Rock is half black). Despite the popularity of guys like Booker T, Mark Henry and Kofi Kingston. Black guys have been able to hold the IC and US titles, sure, and the old Heavyweight title too, but never the top title - the one with history behind it, the one that's often been shown as the most important, just the mid-card belt. None have held the NXT title at any point either. 

Black women are better off though being able to hold the Women's Championship at least. Jacqueline and Jazz in the past, Alicia Fox, Sasha and Naomi in more recent years as well as Sasha and Ember Moon over on NXT. But I guess that's because there's never a mid-card or secondary belt to give to them instead. 

I think Xavier and Big E are guys they can build into top faces and champions once they move forward from The New Day. Its obvious that Vince acknowledges how good and over they are at the moment and they can shine on their own as well. If they end up just being midcarders it's obvious there's something shitty going on backstage in terms of race.  &&Yup! It's revolutionary to have actual female athletes instead of models doing 3 minute matches no one gives a shit about, but PUPPIES! 

Ugh... So glad it's changed at least. &&I just recently got back into wrestling and was really surprised at how good the women's division is. But damn am I tired of them jerking themselves off constantly about it. Can we just get  on with it already? &&I've been a wrestling fan all my life. WWE is beyond terrible with this.

Every time there was a black quarterback or a black coach - the commentators say some dumb statistic like ""Warren Moon is the first black quarterback to score a touchdown in the snow on monday night.""

Great film, I would have liked to have seen it at the cinema but it came on Netflix here so ""free"" is a pretty satisfactory second place &&As u/Sudvesen pointed out in a thread, there were attempts of interference, it’s just Alex Garland had a backbone and stood up. 

Sadly, it cost him a highly promoted theatrical launch. 


And side note: I must say that is the best way to experience the movie. I’ve watched it both in theater and at home on Netflix; and watching it in theater was a fantastic experience.&&If the studio had faith in the movie, You better believe they would've marketed as progressive bait. It's the marketing department's job to put butt in seats. If that requires marketing ploys and progressive baits, They would've done it.&&Thats cause the distributor Paramount wanted to bury the movie and went as far as to cancel most theatrical releases.

Nobody talked about it cause it wasnt promoted or advertised as much.

Its that simple.&&This has been my favorite film of the year so far.&&Because I'm the only person that saw it and nobody cares about me  &&Well the Character's in the book (excepting the husband who's really only in flashbacks) are all female.  Side note: did not know the movie was out.   How is it?&&The fact that it was an all female team in the book probably helped.  If anyone cares, the reason it's all female in the book is because science.  They mess around with team composition.  The team before was all male.&&I was looking forward to this movie ever since I learned they were doing it - but I am a VanderMeer fan, and absolutely love the Southern Reach trilogy.  I was also nervous too, because the books are great but their content is so strange that I figured they'd either change a lot to appeal to audiences, or they'd keep it weird and it simply wouldn't have as much widespread interest.

Basically, the latter happened, and I'm glad it did because anything else wouldn't be Annihilation.

I agree with the overall tone of this thread though.  If Annihilation were more accessible, there probably would have been some element of ""hey, ladies, something for you!"" in the marketing somewhere.&&Exactly, real feminists movies just don't care if their character are male or female. They focus on interesting characters. I read that for the first Alien movie all characters were written without any sex attached. That's why Ripley ended up as one of the best female character : because they didn't write her to represent woman.&&[deleted]&&RLM did a great video about this. 

Hollywood isn’t interested in feminism or diversity in film. They’re interested in selling the idea of feminism and diversity in film to wannabe limousine liberals. &&Some lines were incredibly forced though.

""No, all scientists""

We heard the fans complaining about this, and we were completely unaware of the problem and have now fixed it as per request...

No, the plot doesn't have to go into every black actor's blackness or every gay one's gayness...but you shouldn't just toss in a sub-plot dealing with them being gay, either. Not if it won't add to the film. The film quality comes first, since representation means nothing if it's for a shoddy film that's worse for the pitiful attempt at representation.

So progress.....?&&I love being told, by a movie star, how I need to do something about global warming&&I loved the movie, but spoilers for Annihilation:  the main character also cheated on her spouse and wasn’t the kind of Mary Sue character that the media likes parade around as progress.&&Almost all human progress is made for reasons other than altruism.&&Most behind the scenes on dvds are just self-promotion&&The problem with cynically motivated progress is that as soon as that motivation disappears, progress can begin to backtrack.&&Precisely this. What exactly do you want them to do OP, go back to being racist and sexist? Equality being profitable is a GOOD THING because it means the populous is supporting the cause. Who cares if the three people making the moves are sincere when the thousands supporting it are.

By making this post you’ve actually RESERVED progress, because some people will be compelled not to watch movies based on this effort, sales could drop, and before you know it they retrograde al the efforts made so far. Or, companies will see it and try to avoid being accused of altruism and revert to more “traditional” methods.&&""The revolution will not be televised"" in the trailer for multi million dollar film from a multi billion dollar franchise&&This right here needs to be stopped.

You don't see the 99.999999% of the time when they're right. You just see the oddball that got through. 

The reason that movies are so fucking formulaic is because the formula sells. As soon as they depart from the formula you get:

- It was dumb, I didn't understand it.
- Why was it so long it just dragged on forever?
- Why are these people doing these things?
- This is strange and different and this makes me feel uncomfortable.

We are surrounded by reboots (we fucking have two names for reboots now, soft reboots, and hard reboots, there are so many fucking reboots that we need to differentiate), sequels, adaptations and remakes, because people are afraid of strange and different and studio execs are afraid of giving people who are afraid of strange and different, strange and different.

When they shoot something down it's based on the balance of risk. It doesn't mean it won't ever fly, it means it is risky to try to make it fly. 

To say that the producers are consistently proven wrong is like saying those dumb doctors, they're always contradicting themselves with these studies. It's just reading the headline and not analyzing the data.
&&Not the case for Annihilation.&&I think there's two halves to it. On one hand, it's great that we've come far enough that producers are willing to greenlight mediocre diverse films, that the bar for diverse films is being lowered further and further, normalizing diversity in modern culture (which is hella important). Now not every black lead film has to be Moonlight, now we can have films with more commercial appeal like Get Out, now we can have films made primarily as blockbusters like Black Panther, and maybe one day we can make a society just enough to let a black Jack and Jill pass by.

On the other hand, capitalism and commercialism are capitalism and commercialism. While art is incredibly important as a way for human self expression and as a way for people to relate to one another, entertainment is and has always been a business. Let's not pretend that Disney isn't reaping the PR rewards from stuff like Black Panther, as genuinely good as a film like that does, and let's not pretend they won't be making good use of that in the coming years as their anti-creatives practices start drawing accusations of the dreaded M word. &&Every time some mentions ""Hollywood"" as if it's a single entity is beyond infuriating. Like, an independently financed and distributed movie is not in the same world as a PTA movie which is not in the same world as a Disney movie. The fact that you watch the end product on your TV doesn't mean shit about who made them and how they were made and marketed.&&Best of the thread right here.&&i would gift you gold if i was the gold-gifting sort.

well said.&&It's just as annoying when people generalize all of reddit like they're one person. We all know there's at least 5 people on reddit, the rest are bots.
&&This! All of this!

And also-- can anyone explain to me why patting yourself on the back for putting in effort towards something worthwhile (whether it be for profit, or not, but let's be real money is very important in keeping things running) is a bad thing? I like that people in Hollywood are trying harder to be inclusive. Why is it such a terrible thing that they're trying to change things AND make a profit?&&Excellent answer.  Thank you for that.&&Great points.  The hollywood generalization always cracks me up.  My favorite is the gun one ""but they have armed guards! but harvey weinstein!  but hollywood is immoral/racist/sexist!"".  Okay, some of them *might* have armed guards, but also many of them pushing for *gun control/reform* also aren't asking for all guns to be banned.  And they queitly ignore that many in hollywood are also victims in situations like Harvey Weinsteins.&&> 20 years ago, everyone would get the same advertisement, but it just doesn't work that way anymore.

Meanwhile, the gaming industry has degenerated into Skinner box and microtransaction riddled repetitive BS. The Triple A industry fails time and again to make anything meaningful, bar some exceptions, and the indie devs can only do so much.&&I don't think your observations are inherently wrong, but I think you are failing to take into account how radically the media landscape has changed. the A-list blockbusters and C-list copycats have always done their own market-tested thing. We've sat through monochrome decades of musicals, spaghetti westerns, action movies, etc.. Now is just the age of cinematic universes and Heroes and Villains. But the thing is, that A-list and C-list industry is now a much smaller portion of the overall media pie than it has ever been since the entertainment sectors grew into the empire they are. We are in a new socialized media age. For every corporate cookie-cutter piece of media, there are thousands of answers from private and independent sources. In movies, music, television, games, etc.. In recent years, I've seen more chances and risks taken than I've ever seen before. You just have to remember that independent budgets aren't going to give you the polish and depth that those A-list corporate budgets can pull, and to set expectations accordingly.&&I don't think it's entirely fair to blame Disney for the prevalence of remakes, reboots, and franchises. The trend of franchises dominating Hollywood started in 2001, the first year in which a majority of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were franchise films and it's gotten worse since then. Disney made it worse, but it was already pretty bad.&&If anyone tells you that there are no good movies being made, that Disney and Marvel and the reboot/remake machines have ruined cinema and all that garbage, then you can leave the conversation with full confidence that they have no idea what they're talking about.

There's acceptance that the WNBA will never be as profitable because there just is not as much an audience for women's basketball.  But it's never sexed-up for the sake of marketing (ahem Tennis) despite not making significant inroads towards profitability or a large audience.  Similarly, on the men's side, there are a few female trainers, refs and coaches, but no obvious attempts to recruit women or attempts to market the fact that they're recruiting women.  The female ref with the high usage is criticized and disliked as much as her male counterparts.  There are still gender issues, but I think the main thing is the participation of women in the UFC and NBA seems less forced.  It's organic and beneficial to the sports in themselves because both BBJ and NBA have many young female participants.&&[Not always.](https://i.imgur.com/Ok2Cc0X.gif)&&I hate how they act like they’re unearthing new ground.

Similarly Jinder started off as an asshole cheater who couldn't win matches without the help of the Singh Brothers to cheat for him and used his race as a scapegoat for why people were booing him.

You can't escape gender whether you want to or not.

As for *Alien*, the film is quite a different thing with a woman as Ripley.  It becomes a pretty interesting (and early) look at gender in genre films.  The men are uniformly either useless or outright deceptive, and the only survivor is a woman.  It's obviously way, way more complex than this, and all manner of academics have looked at this from varying angles and results.  That's why *Alien* (and its sequels) are so interesting to anyone who pays attention to gender in film.&&That’s not any more “real feminist” than movies that *do* explore female/male problems. If complete lack of gender was the golden prize for feminism, we’d be celebrating the great feminist icon of some genderless, sexless robot character. &&i think there can still be commentary there even if it's unintended; there's a ton of sexual imagery and innuendo in Alien. another example is ben in Night of the Living Dead, who is black and his race goes unmentioned for the entire 1968 film. while romero insisted he cast him on his acting prowess (and i totally believe him here), this gives a different meaning to certain events that happen within the film than if he were white, because we don't live in a post-racial society now and we definitely didn't in '68.&&That still has a downside as the result is a distinct lack of femininity in movies. There are still very few feminine characters who are portrayed as the hero of the story. Characters like Ripley are great but they are also written with positive traits that are more typically coded male. Positive traits for heroes that are feminine are still very rare even with female characters as it's often avoided in order to avoid the movie looking like a ""chick flick"". How many movies would be written with male characters that have positive feminine traits?&&All too often women suffer from tokenism. Sure you get a single great female character but where's the rest. Women are more then around half the population. Would it be that hard to see more females in cast as a normal thing &&> Exactly, real feminists movies just don't care if their character are male or female. They focus on interesting characters.

There's a million other ways to handle the ""right thing"" other than saying, ""Everyone's invited, even if you're unqualified and a bad fit! Look at us! Gold star stickers all around!""

Yet that seems to be the method 99% of everyone is using. 

There needs to be more ways to include everyone, sure, and everybody deserves a seat at any table despite their backgrounds, sure, but a lot of the current solutions are just slimy. They exist for brownie points and accolades only. &&award ceremonies are ways the studios had of:

1. getting people back out to see movies that got awards and make more money
2. crown new ""stars"" so the public could become infatuated with them and make more money
3. award old ""stars"" who never quite made it (it's his turn) to squeeze a few last drops out of them and make more money
4. get the public to tune in to a 3 hour long commercial that constantly mentioned names and movies and lodged them in their brains and got them thinking, maybe I'll go see that and make more money
5. give out badges of success so that if you just stuck around long enough you could be marketed as ""academy award winner"" or ""academy award nominee"" and make more money

*Well, if this actor was nominated for an award, surely he is good and I can trust this product. Maybe I'll go see this movie now.*

&&Reddit is really no better.  At least Hollywood is doing it for something more tangible than karma.&&>Consider all the award ceremonies

I think it's commendable that some of them are trying to use their position for good.&&You could have taken any other issue and I would have agreed like harassment, representation etc, but this is an issue that is effecting everyone and the goverment is not only denying but making it harder with taxes for people who are  working on renewable energies. That is a cause that no enough people are working on and there are no speeches about it even since Leo. Not like cause I mentioned that is preached at every speech.&&I love how they promote their junior directing programs as something 'beneficial to the inner cities,' when actually those screenshots are from USC, a university with sparse numbers of Latinos and Blacks to begin with.&&Idk why Hollywood thinks the Mary sue route is good for feminism.

Almost every single scientist I've ever met is motivated in their career by the desire to make the world a better place.&&This is what drives me crazy about reddit and the modern left. They don't understand that as humans we are inevitably driven by price incentives, and that can be totally fine!

When some mega-rich dude invests a ton of money into something that will obviously benefit many people; who the fuck cares what his intentions were? It's still benefiting many people!&&Not sure there's much of a way behind that anymore. These days the promotional material is done during film production, which means they don't even know if people liked the movie so it all it just comes off as self congratulatory. 

It's a shame because when DVDs first became a thing, the behind the scenes and commentaries were my favorite parts. But that was because at first they were making new features about films that had been out for a while and could be more self reflective and honest about all of it. &&[deleted]&&It does move the Overton Window, though. The more forward we look the less likely we are to look back. I sincerely doubt a movie such as “Birth of a Nation” will ever be made again even if the motivation to have a movie like “Black Panther” subsides. 

In fact, having a decrease in financial motivations for inclusion would be nice. I hope we have a world where the genders/race of the characters make sense for the movie/overall population of the cinematic world. It shouldn’t be rewarded to be accurately inclusive, it should be just standard practice. 

But until norms move that way, I’m fine with profit motive. &&Jesus. I forgot about that.&&He felt the same way about the beating your SO. He had a whole standup bit about it.&&> Why was it so long it just dragged on forever?

First time I watched *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* I thought it was almost 3 hours long & was very surprised that it was only 2 hours.  It doesn't follow the standard ""3 act"" formula & it changed the experience of watching it for me.&&It's not movies but there was a study done on video games and it saw that games with female main characters got a lot less promotion.  So it becomes a vicious circle. Annihilation is being brought up in this thread as a counter-argument and that also got no promotion (I hadn't heard about it).&&I agree with this, but the overall trend that diversity is becoming more accepted and more lucrative is undeniable.  

>When they shoot something down it's based on the balance of risk. It doesn't mean it won't ever fly, it means it is risky to try to make it fly. 

You also have to consider that if you consider it ""too risky to make something fly"", then it will likely never fly via a self-fulfilling prophecy.  

Giant budgets need safe bets, because they can leverage huge amounts of money, so certainty is more valuable to them.  

Smaller budgets use riskier bets, because they can afford to lose money.  

And in recent years, the number of small budget opportunities has exploded thanks to stuff like the internet and Netflix.  &&I loved Annihilation and its excellent cast, but let’s face it, the plot was never gonna make it a mainstream hit. It was way too strange and arty for a wide audience. &&Annihilation didn't work because they didn't release it internationally (where people would probably be more inclined to see it in the theater) and there was basically no marketing in the US. It also released right after Black Panther.&&Such an awesome movie. Four diverse female leads working in STEM fields and it completely flopped at the box office and on Netflix internationally. Disappointing. &&>maybe one day we can make a society just enough to let a black Jack and Jill pass by.

So every Madea movie?

&&... there have been black lead comedies, black lead dramas, black lead shakespeare, black lead comic books, comic book to animated series, and comic book movies and everythings. I am still a huge fan of Blade. Those have all been very successful. Black Panther didn't change this, it's just the first one that racked in a gazillion dollars.

This has more about it being a Marvel movie than about it being a black movie. Marvel is making competent, not great, but good and most importantly predictable movies.

They have slowly built up characters and concepts and given people the safe feeling that even though this is a new movie with a new character they will be entertained and their expectations met. 

Marvel found a formula to make people color blind: Black Panther was introduced briefly and was pretty cool, and people got that few drops of what the movie would then be like and went out to see the movie.

Marvel didn't do that because the character was black, Marvel did this because this is how they build their universe. Brick by brick. The more familiar you are with the brand, the more they can slow walk you through concepts, the more likely you are to spend your money.

Black Panther got great reviews because it's a good film but anything with a social message attached gets bonus points in the current atmosphere and is insulated from criticism.

All of this built for a situation in which this movie made a ton of cash. This is great.

But people who think suddenly the world changed: well I would like to introduce you to 2008 when a black president got elected for the first time in a country that enslaved people of his race before. We all thought the world was going to change from then on and this was it. 

I would like to point you to 1991 when the Berlin Wall fell and we thought great, we're going to be friends now and the cold war is over but it kept going, just not in the headlines anymore until now.

These things don't change the world, as someone posted upthread, the world changes movies.

Someone is now going to rush out and try to *clone* this approach but it's going to fail because they will just try to copy the *effect* of what Marvel did because they will do it the most cynical way and think that this is a wave they can ride and it will be like Ghostbusters. 

And if people think wow now we can have movies with black leads, I mean we had that since the 60s and I'm not sure where your head has been. Oscar winners, box office successes, it's been done. 

&&Black panther wasn't a diverse film. &&Add ""The Media"" to that list. &&I once wrote a fan letter to Hollywood and It sent me back a signed headshot.&&Right. So the analogy would be OP being a black McDonald's customer but being upset McDonald's is trying to get Asian-Pacific people to eat there too.&&The problem seems to be that you're seeing marketing and mistaking it for congratulations.&&Don't worry, Disney will put out a new trailer soon and all this will be over. &&the gaming industry minmaxed itself. &&We can only thank the people throwing money at microtransactions. It if didn't make them boatloads of profit we wouldn't have this problem. I don't think it'll get better anytime soon. 

 That being said, I know a few games AAA that are amazing. &&Bloodborne, BOTW, The Witcher 3, Overwatch... the list goes on man.&&The indie scene has largely fallen into nostalgia cashgrabs in the form of throwback 8-bit side scrollers. It's not just the AAA games that have gone to shit. &&Gaming has gotten quite a bit better in the past year or two with the rapidly rising popularity of AA games (Civilization, XCOM, etc) and indie titles that the developers don't treat like a pretentious art school project (Cuphead, Hollow Knight).&&Yeah seriously, blockbusters filling up theaters and showtimes and getting all the media attention is nothing new.

If you go to your local theater, they're playing tons of ""smaller"" movies everyday! Sure, the one showing might be at a weird time, but that French drama or anime movie is worth it! Not to mentiom the tickets are cheaper, and the theaters are emptier.&&Is it a waste if it keeps adding business? &&I moved away for this year (but plan to end up back at home once the year is over.)

For years, there had been rumors of Fabulous Moolah abusing potential trainees... she'd recruit women that wanted to train to be wrestlers, force them to live on her complex... she'd determine their booking fees, skim some off the top for herself then pay the remainder to the girls, then charge them rent and utilities on top of that.

>Lets get this out of way first, so I don't have to dance around the subject - Moolah was a pimp. From her sprawling 42 acre estate in Colombia, South Carolia, Moolah would send out her half-trained underage female-wrestlers to ""photo shoots"" that would by the standards of today be considered pedophilia and pornography. She sent trainees to wrestling promoters in set numbers. Renting them out to promoters in bulk, with the understanding that the girls would have sex with the promoter and all the wrestlers on the roster who wanted them. Promoters liked free sex, but what they also liked is for boys not to go outside looking for it and possibly running into trouble. Sex on a road with a steady and pliant group of semi-attractive women in return for money, that is what Moolah offered. The women that were sent out on this tours were not told of this ""arrangement"" ahead of time. They found out about it on the road. Those that refused to have sex with promoters and wrestlers, were raped.&&Don't forget arguably the biggest angle among WWE women being Asuka's undefeated streak&&Wait what?

FUCK THAT BUCKY BEAVER MOTHER FUCKING COCK SUCKER 

*takes sip from Sprite can*

LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THAT UGLY MOTHERFUCKER DUNN AND THAT GODLESS FESTERING WOUND ON MY ASSHOLE VINCE RUSSO&&Cornette jokes aside, with the exception of Moolah, Kevin Dunn is probably the man most responsible for women's wrestling being in such a terrible state in WWE and more widely America as a whole for so many years.

In a world with no Dunn and no Moolah, probably throw Russo on top of that, women's wrestling may well have been as big as men's wrestling during the boom periods&&Not to mention this happened several times before. Santina comes to mind&&Don't forget the Miss Wrestlemania tournament being won by Santino Marella or Harvey Wipplemans womans title reign&&I remember Booker T losing to Triple H for the WWE championship.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ARd2wpUO0Y

At this point I watched for the athletics and storylines because the year before I found out it was fake.

But letting Triple H win vs Booker. And ruining Kane's and Rob Van Dam's push is why I'll always have an irrational hatred towards HHH. Since he's married into the company, I don't want to associate with them.

At least the Rock finally won vs Stone Cold in Wrestlemania that year...

Edit: IDK if RVD was injured in 2003, but I just remembered about Rey Mysterio. Kinda sucked that the guys I mentioned WCW/ECW status probably factored in their booking.&&I know this is r/movies but I recently rewatched season one of the good place and a few episodes in I thought ""oh. I didn't notice almost the entire cast is non white"" 

Stuff like that is powerful. It absolutely should be the goal for that kind of stuff to not be noticed&&A great example was Peter Dinklage in Xmen. Nothing about the script or the movie was about his physical appearance. Any person could have played that role. But he is an excellent actor and made an interesting character. &&Disagree, *Annihilation* used sex, and gender, and gender roles in interesting ways. They used them to drive the story, and play on interesting themes, and even create horror. Same with *Ex Machina*, the director's last film.   
  
It's fine to notice sex, or gender, or race, or whatever, we all do. Discrimination & prejudice based on the things is obviously bad though. &&Yeah, it's good. I wish I hadn't noticed, in a way&&>When no one notices or cares what gender/race/whatever a human is. 

That's true and it's also true that it wasn't forced in the movie. But the protagonist literally says, ""all women"" to which the other person replies, ""all scientists"". Hard not to notice it after that.&&But Natalie Portman’s character literally pointed out in the movie why their group was an all woman one, going out of her way to do so. And it was because all the male soldiers never came back. Not noticing that fact is literally bullshit.&&I feel somewhat worried and i can't quite put my finger on why.

I never used to notice. It wasn't until the last year or so i would be watching a commercial and be in 15 seconds and think ""Oh, this guy is black and i've been enjoying this commercial. So file that under evidence that i'm not a racist.."" Before i would have just enjoyed the commercial or not and not given any thought to the race or gender of the person on screen. 

I think maybe it's just part of a seemingly growing political divide. Combine that with what i feel is a strong message that i as a white male am the source of many problems, it just wears me down and makes me feel defensive, even to myself. 

Again, i'm not sure what to make of it all. But it gives me anxiety. &&I think about that scene like once a day, so deeply unsettling. It was like an actual nightmare, where your brain mashes up 2 things that don't belong, and it just sticks with you. Same with the intestine scene. &&A meditation on how all things by their nature die to change and grow but how in humans it's viewed as self-destruction.&&Red Letter Media&&Fuck that bear though. Heeby jeebies. &&Eh, on reddit there's buzz. But it's a huge financial loss even with Paramont selling the theatrical release (which it really deserved imo) to Netflix. &&There's been buzz but nowhere to the degree movies like WW or BP had, signed people are trying to misread that into believing that ""Hollywood doesn't care about actual diversity etc"".

Most of the buzz has been from SciFi fans or Garland fans who have been anticipating the movies and critics who love it. The buzz you get from GA due to heavy marketing is absent.&&Why was Paramount trying to bury it?&&I think they meant more of that a lot of the people in the industry who have the platform to talk about a movie like Annihilation to a wide audience refuse to do so for whatever reason, not that general movie goers refuse to do so&&This happens in lot of single issue subreddits I've noticed. Like, if someone's all into a particular ideology, it becomes a legitimate complaint to them when not enough coverage of the thing that their ideology either loves or hates isn't produced in the matching tone or in amount. 

Meanwhile, there are tons of points of views and interests in the world, and not everyone agrees with this or that subgroup, so when that ideological subgroup gets coverage for general audiences, it's too much if negative/deconstructive, not enough if positive/reinforcing. &&they wouldn't.  i could see them not having budget left for promotion, or the producer/distributors using their promotion budget to push some Other movie they had that they thought would be a bigger success, but BURYING the movie?  fuck that noise.  this is a retarded notion.&&Studio wanted reshoots to make it less complicated and intellectual, producer (who had final cut) sided with director and didn't make any of the requested changes because he felt the film was fine as is.&&> The movie, which wrapped shooting in July 2016, had a poor test screening this summer that sources say was the root of the conflict. After the screening, Ellison became concerned that the movie was **“too intellectual”** and **“too complicated,”** according to sources, and wanted changes made to make it appeal to a wider audience. They included making Portman’s character more sympathetic as well as tweaking the ending.

Rudin, who executive produced Ex Machina, sided with Garland, defending the movie and refused to take notes. Rudin was able to hold his line, according to a source, because he has final cut.

Much more fleshed out, too. &&They didn't ""bury"" it so much as they didn't want to throw good money after bad. They knew that it wasn't going to be popular and they weren't going to make their money back, so instead of spending another 20-50 million promoting the movie they just abandoned it. 

Then they got a great deal from Netflix that said ""we'll buy this movie from you [probably around $20mil] if you pull it from theaters and let us have the exclusive on showing it."" It got a showing in the US but went straight to Netflix everywhere else. 

It's a shame because it deserves to be seen in a theater with a big screen and huge speakers, but Paramount probably got more from Netflix than they were going to get from distribution. &&>Why would you intentionally bury a movie?

the only film i've heard of this happening with was Iron Giant and this is an unsubstantiated rumour, but the producers were largely absent from the creation of the movie, and the result was a surprisingly good animated film that tested pretty positively.  the production team used little to none of the budget to promote the movie in order to reduce it's success and let the financial flop prove that the producers were necessary to critical hits.

now, That is some pie in the sky conspiracy shit.  typically bombing your own release doesn't happen.

you DO want all your movies to make money, and stories like this one, and the one about paramount ""burying"" annihilation are beyond retarded.  they're hyper-fabricated nonsense.&&Judging by your last two comments, I've determined you're not a fan of the bear.&&Unhear&&The bear was awesome&&> The men are uniformly either useless or outright deceptive

I don't think this is fair. Firstly the script was written without a gender in mind for each character. And second, everyone is useless when confronted by the Alien. Only Ripley barely manages to escape. &&Exactly. The reason why we are having more movies that are, in redditors' minds, overtly feminist is that we are having more movies that are actually written and directed by women. These movies don't set out to be pushy about anything, they just happen to be couched in their creators lived experience of being women.

It's no coincidence that redditors in this thread are praising Annihilation for having a female lead that doesn't feel ""forced"" and Annihilation was written by a man.

I'm not saying male writers can't write feminine characters, but it's obviously something that is easier for a woman to do.&&Bless you&&Love Silicon Valley. Its pretty accurate about the overall mentality of tech businesses.&&This is exactly what I thought of!! Haha&&Holy shit there’s no way I’d be able to take them seriously.&&What’s even more surprising is that anyone thinks Hollywood will change just because of #metoo.

Not that it's right, but if you're unaware of it you've been living under a rock since the BIRTH OF HOLLYWOOD.&&They're not being *made* to do the right thing. They're just finally able to profit off of it and if it stops being profitable, they'll stop doing it. &&kids are not stupid. They know when they're being preached at. 

Movies are being made by checklists making sure that everything is socially acceptable. We are going through a similar age to the 1950s where the nuclear family was presented as flawless, Dad is wise and knowing, Mom is perfect and a great cook, everyone loves each other and mistakes are honestly made and all the issues wrapped up at the end of the day.

It is saccharine. 

What you see from that is the pendulum swing. Anti-heroes came about in comics and movies because people were bored with the perfect hero in a white hat. They were tired of moustache twisting villains. It was over simplistic. 

110 pound women going toe to toe kicking the asses of men double their size and weight is a trope of our era. Every action movie has it. Some don't bother to try to explain it away, others do (the Matrix, Jumanji). It's done for social justice reasons (girls can kick ass too!) whereas in reality, men and women do not fight in the same ring for a reason. Some movies need to be naturally excused such as Wonder Woman where there is a good reason for it and we're dealing with comic books. 

But every movie following this exact same recipe and exact same set of tropes starts to look like the Standard Group of Racially Diverse Models Laughing Together stock photo. Do it once, it's unusual and cool, but make everything look like this, especially when it departs from reality and it becomes tiresome. 

I can say I don't buy for instance John Wick fighting hand to hand with a woman half his weight and it being a fair fight he barely gets out of any more than I would expect him to have problems dispatching a 14 year old boy who is in the same weight class as the woman and in a higher strength class. There is a reason an elephant would fuck up a tiger and a rhino fucks up a warthog. Tigers and warthogs can kick ass but show me enough warthogs fucking up rhinos and tigers fucking up elephants and I am eventually going to go, ""Oh, this again."" 





&&If you want to see diversity for the sake of diversity taken to the extreme, you should see Marvel comics. I always thought Miles Morales was the right way to introduce a minority character into an established canon. Instead of shoving him down people's throats, he was eased in. There was definitely a lot of backlash, but he's become probably the most popular of the Marvel diversity characters because of how he developed from a small time and deeply flawed character to where he is now. The most important thing they did with Miles was that they didn't suddenly replace main universe Peter with him. 

But with their other characters, they suddenly replaced all of their most popular and established characters with minority characters. You can't snap your fingers, replace fan favorites that have been around for decades, and then expect people to be happy about that. The worst thing about it is that Marvel has the gall to straight up say that their dwindling sales are because comic book nerds are racist and sexist, despite how comic books have a **long** history of people getting pissed about characters getting replaced, no matter what gender or race they are. &&What movies are you referring to? &&> ""Everyone's invited, even if you're unqualified and a bad fit! Look at us! Gold star stickers all around!""

Who's using that method?&&I think those who have been woefully underrepresented don't care if they're now being represented just for the sake of diversity, or in sincerity. The problem with your argument is that you think women/minorities/the disabled are somehow inherently less qualified, and the only reason they're being hired is because the company has some quota to meet. But how many places are actually finding *unqualified* minority candidates, instead of trying harder to find minority candidates who are in fact qualified, but have been overlooked for a variety of systemic reasons? E.g. Hollywood wasn't shafting black or female protagonists bc talented black and female actors didn't exist, they were shafting them bc they thought they were unprofitable, and have now been proven wrong. 

Also, even if it were ""for diversity's sake,"" there's a snowball effect when people see themselves properly represented. Someone brought up STEM fields now pushing for more women as an example. Smart, qualified women have always existed in STEM, but get pushed out of the process largely because of the sexism they face (for example... assuming they are unqualified and a ""diversity hire"" bc they are women). Making an effort to recruit and keep more women will help combat the college or company culture that is making it so hostile to women, leading to more and more women feeling like they can stay in STEM. So even *if* those women weren't recruited in sincerity, there is a net positive effect for them being there. Basically, I agree with u/SaveComplete, I don't care about their motivation because they're still doing the right thing. 

I just think a lot of people wanna white knight the underrepresented groups by going ""they should have hired you because they ACTUALLY WANT YOU, not to meet some quota!!""... without realizing that they are now automatically assuming that these groups are less desirable and that no one could possibly want to recruit them in sincerity. (Another poster brought up Miles Morales, which I think is ironic because everyone assumes he was a diversity character shoehorned in to a major Marvel property. In reality, the writers were inspired by a Twitter campaign to make Donald Glover the next spider-man, and came up with the character Miles Morales. Everyone saying ""they just did this for diversity's sake!"" just automatically assumed that no one could genuinely want to make a black spider-man character...)&&Then i'm going to downvote you to keep you safe!!&&Okay, that was funny as hell. &&That still does not beat the Hale Berry Oscar speech where she called the oscar voters  a bunch of racists and sexists and she had all those oscar voters clapping for it.&&And got a rapturous applause from the audience when he said Black Panther was the first comic book movie with a black lead and Wonder Woman was the first with a female lead.

People seem to forget the Blade Trilogy, Supergirl, Catwoman, Electra, Barb Wire , Tank Girl etc.&&I fucking hate Jimmy Kimmel since he suddenly became the beacon of moral propriety. &&Can't believe I used to watch that show and have so quickly forgotten about it completely.

They were paid, they were upfront with them about what their job would be.  A better job then most people get.  &&Exactly.  People act like because they have a car that they drive, and a private jet that they don't care about the environment when they are some of the only people trying to get the message out there.  Them choosing not to fly in their jet isn't going to reverse global warming.  They are pushing for a global change in the way that we think AS A WHOLE.

Personally I care, because I don't like the idea of people doing the right things for the wrong reasons. It is disingenuous, manipulative, and exploitative a.k.a **Pandering**. People then praise these kinds of profit driven assholes who are just taking them for a ride, and profiting from exploited values as opposed to espousing them.&&I think the idea is that if someone is motivated by altruism they will attempt to do good things regardless of whether they will personally benefit whereas if someone does good things solely out if rational self-interest that person could just as easily do something pernicious out if rational self-interest tomorrow.

Obviously motives are usually complicated, but the idea is that an ""altruistic"" person can be counted in to try to do good things - they are reliable - whereas a self-interested person is not reliable.

We should incentivize good behavior by rewarding it and part of that is rewarding principled altruism.  If we don't distinguish between principled altruism and self-interested altruism we discourage principled altruism.&&It makes you feel better about your deeds (or lack thereof) when you pick apart and devalue other's deeds.

I'd argue that while entry into filmmaking and distribution has become easier because of streaming services and the internet, the general trend in the movie industry has been toward mergers and  acquisitions, leading to blockbusters which take the least risk possible.

Just look at Disney, they recently acquired Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Fox, and they show no signs of slowing down. The bottom line is that only profitable studios can continue to make movies, and anything profitable will tend to be bought by a huge company who will inevitably begin using their IPs to create films that cater to the lowest common denominator. 

As long as people are more inclined to see safe, inoffensive, blockbuster which they are familiar with over something new and thought provoking, larger and more derivative films will continue to dominate.&&Nothing says equality like a series of horrible movies that are still funded and exhibited regardless of the race of its actors.&&> This has more about it being a Marvel movie than about it being a black movie. Marvel is making competent, not great, but good and most importantly predictable movies.

its also an origin story, too. Those usually get good reception. If the BP sequels are nothing more than the blue lazer in the sky and space bugs, then the series is done for. &&Well the media is owned by a small handful of corporations, just like the movie studios.

One of my favorite shows is The Expanse, and I remember reading a review after I watched the entire first season praising it for its diversity. Only then did it occur to me that it had a very diverse cast. Thing is, it does no hand waving about it. It doesn't need to make a big deal about a woman being a competent engineer, because why wouldn't she be? It doesn't make a big deal about an old Indian woman being one of the most powerful politicians in the planet, because why couldn't she be? Something I think the industry is failing to realize is that when you virtue signal like that, it doesn't help - it reinforces the idea that what's going on isn't natural because you treat it like its unusual and noteworthy. &&If I feel like I'm told that the cast is all black/white/female/whatever by the movie then I mentally start checking out.  As a 6 year old Star Wars nerd, i didn't even realize that Princess Leia was a princess role flip from damsel in distress to political and military leader (and soldier/spy/infiltrator etc) till I grew up.

Until this comment I didn't even think about it. It's a show about a certain percentage of all of the Earth's population ending up there so it's totally organic. I think if the show was mostly white in this context I totally would have noticed. It's like Heroes season 1 vs. Heroes season 2. Heroes was about a small percentage of humanity globally going through a transformation. So the diverse cast was organic to the story and you never thought ""oh wow, I'm enjoying a TV show with a diverse cast! I'm making a difference!"" 

But plenty of critics heaped praise on it for this reason rather than for it being just a phenomenal groundbreaking TV show. The creators really seemed to take this praise to heart, to the point that the main thing that you noticed in season 2 was the fact that apparently 95% of Caucasians in the world were somehow wiped out after season 1 despite no one ever mentioning that and several characters were introduced whose soul purpose seemed to be existing in a non-white form. Season 1 was a great story with a diverse cast, season 2 was no story but a parade of non white characters that seemed to be looking over their shoulder asking for praise for being so extremely diverse (although they were all insanely hot. Hollywood can seemingly celebrate diversity as long as that diversity is entirely made up of gorgeous models).&&I mean...1/2 the main cast is white...most of the extras are white.

It does it super well, but I wouldn't say most of the cast is non-white.&&I think you kind of miss the point of his character.  With Dinklage they changed the role in a subtle but important way. 

Dinklage has dwarfism or more exactly  achondroplasia which is a mutation. So his crusade against mutants takes on a great new edge.  He is clearly a mutant but he has a mutation that doesn't benefit him instead he lashes out at other mutants who have beneficial powers who also seem to help mankind often.

It is not called out as much but its clearly part of the character himself.  Rather excellent casting that tells a small story that the movie could skip.

In the comics Trask is normal its his son who's a mutant who he tries to suppress. &&I've seen people complain about the introduction scene where Portman's character notes something like ""just you women?"" 

The others brushed it off very naturally and I remember thinking ""Yep, whatever. Makes sense.""   

There were things I didn't like about Annihilation, but their casting and how they handled gender were not one of them.&&Yeah, they made it super obvious in the film. Also, all the close ups head shots in the class scene were of only fenale students&&h̜̳͕̳᷉̽᷉͐᷉᷉᷉᷉͂᷉᷅᷉ͨ᷉᷉̓᷉ͭ᷉᷉᷉̏᷉᷉̕̕͜ȩ̸̗̳̺̥̳᷉᷉᷉ͧ᷉᷉᷉ͣ᷉᷉ͪ᷉̃᷉᷉̔᷉᷉᷆᷉ͨ᷉ͤ᷉l̳̖̘͈̳᷉ͭ᷉͆᷉̑᷉᷉͗᷉᷇᷉᷉᷉᷉᷉̑᷉᷉᷉̐᷉᷉᷉᷉͡p̷̢̢̰̳᷂̘̣̳͖̺̳̭̞̳̝᷉᷉̀᷉᷉᷉᷉᷈᷉᷉͒᷉᷉᷉̈́᷉᷉᷉̅᷉᷉̀᷉ͮ᷉ͯ᷉͋᷉᷉ͬ᷉᷉̐᷉᷉̋᷉᷉᷉᷉̋᷉᷉᷉᷉͘ m̮̳̻᷊̲̳͓᷉̄᷉̌᷉᷉᷉ͥ᷉̈́᷉᷉᷉᷄᷉᷉̓᷉᷉̒᷉᷉͐᷉e̴̫̳̦̱͕̩̳᷉̽᷉͛᷉᷉᷉᷉᷉᷉᷉᷀᷉ͨ᷉᷉᷉ͧ᷉᷉̌᷉͘
&&That scene made my skin crawl. It's funny, I didn't see a trailer for the movie, only a few tv spots, so that bear came out of nowhere for me. &&The last time I felt that mixture of terror and awe was when I saw Aliens when I was a kid. &&That's the best modern horror scene since, I don't know, it seems as for ever.. such a brilliant concept behind that bear and the way that scene was shot was phenomenal.. shame about some of the visual effects, but apart from that that scene was perfect.. no annoying jumpscare, but perfect buildup &&WW and BP have wide appeal.

Annihilation is not as accessible.  It's weird af and is slow, quiet, thought-provoking.

I don't remember the marketing for Mad Max, but a movie like that shows that if it's entertaining in a summer blockbuster kind of way, it will make a ton of money.  Word of mouth can be powerful.  It's the main reason BP is over a billion.&&I don't think it was an issue of not having resources to promote it. The movie isn't a sequel or tapping into some existing fanbase so it was a gamble on if it would do well or not. The distributors took the safer route of releasing it to Netflix and a limited theatrical release to hedge their bets and ensure a return on investment&&[removed]&&The previews for Ex Machina led me to believe it was going to be a sexist disaster about fragile broken doll women but I actually loved it. What a call out of sci-fi nerd culture! I started out feeling like I was supposed to sympathize with Caleb (which I did not) and then they turned it on its head. I felt like I was watching a long Black Mirror episode. &&To be fair to Paramount and the screen testers, I thought it was pretty good, but not nearly as good as Ex Machina.  
  
It's mostly a BDO exploratory exercise (big dumb object), and has a wacky ending (think Contact mixed with Interstellar).  
  
  
The character development is also weird, and hard to believe at times.  
   
But it's pretty, and fun enough for one watch-through.&&WB was closing down their animation department and the guys at the top didn't give a shit about the Iron Giant. In fact, it only ever got released because it had the best audience test scores that the studio had had in decades and they still fucked up the release by failing to market it. 

There's a really interesting documentary about the making of that movie, it's on youtube I think. &&Sometimes, movies are buried for other reasons, like inter-studio politics and drama.

A real-life example is *The Adventures of Baron Munchausen*. This was a multi-million dollar fantasy film directed by Terry Gilliam that had a notably troubled production but was supported by one of the top executives of Columbia Pictures, until he left/was booted from the studio. His replacement (and apparently other executives who had some beef with the guy) did not like the idea of his predecessor getting credit for what was already shaping up to be a pretty popular movie (pre-screenings were getting really good attendance for a movie like that, and critical reviews were all positive), so they intentionally torpedoed the movie's release by scrapping all advertising for it and cancelling its wide release, turning it into one of the biggest box-office bombs in film history. The studio simply wrote off the movie and moved on to the darling projects of the new executive.

You'd be surprised how many companies, even the largest and most profitable ones, are run by spiteful and childish people who will sabotage the well-being of the entire company just to get back at people within the same company they have a personal grudge against. This happened to Sega in the 1990s and the company has never recovered from it.&&I thought it was because the studio was releasing Wild Wild West at the time & thought its success would cover for the anticipated loss of The Iron Giant?&&Bears eat skunks. No Bueno. &&Yes. The bear was a work of genius. 

So many great moments in the movie. The flaws are minor in comparison. &&Kind of funny when the Aliens die by the hundreds in the sequels.  &&And some of the loudest people (who weren't direct victims) were people that brown nosed him hardcore when he still had a company. Meryl Streep called Harvey a god onstage at one point. Considering how much of an open secret his behaviour has been for so long, there's no way she didn't know.

The only respectable people against Harvey are those who spoke out against him when he had all his power.&&I think I heard that saying in a movie once.&&They’re even using the whole #metoo thing to gain brownie points. They just go with the flow of what people will like &&You mean tweeting things doesn't make a difference? But they're *activists*!&&I wouldn't say separating the art from the man is defending behavior. At worst, it's ignoring it.&&[deleted]&&Susan Sarandon hinted recently at how director's/producer's basically cast women they wanna fuck. I read a lot of gossip sites (a lot of it turns out to be true later down the line) and supposedly how it goes down is they let them know what's expected and if they agree they meet at the director/producer's house to ""discuss the part"" so to speak. Both sides are very complicit. Even Marilyn Monroe supposedly said when signing a multi picture deal ""That's the last cock I have to suck in this town"" so this ain't a new thing. I've even seen heavy allusions to the phenomenon in movies from the early 30's.&&The cultural shift that lead to these movies being profitable, is I suppose, making them do it. But you're completely right about the underlying motive.&&> They're just finally able to profit off of it and if it stops being profitable, they'll stop doing it.

Alternatively, if the social climate has made them take a bigger chance on a film with a female/minority focus, and they are surprised to realize they can make good money on it, they will continue to make those films even after the social pressure has gone away. So that could be a more permanent positive change that comes as a result of trying to be politically correct.&&It depends on the age of the kid and it depends on the kind of ""preaching"".

I was 4 when Disney's Aladdin came out and 7 when Disney's Pocahontas came out. I was THRILLED to have Barbies of Jasmine and Pocahontas because they had a skin color like mine. Up until that point, Barbies (and many other dolls) were either [white or black.](https://barbiecollectivemanila.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/4630199185_1bfe7ba4af_b.jpg) There was no in-between. 

So kid-me was not thinking about the fact that Disney was trying to represent more people of color in order to jump on the diversity bandwagon, kid-me was just happy to see someone who looked like me. 

I think they did it for the wrong reasons (and of course those depictions weren't exactly the pinnacle of accuracy or cultural sensitivity) but they served a good purpose for kids who felt like they had no representation in the media.&&We can reduce the ""good guy beats bigger bad guy"" to gender if we want, but there's another factor at hand.

What you're seeing at a deeper level is a reimagining of the hero, and ""our"" team, as the one who's at a disadvantage against a stronger foe, as such has to rely on grit, intelligence, and dexterity rather than pure strength.  

It's a common propagandistic tool to sell movies.  Instead of reality, where it's actually us, i.e. America, that is the imperialist, superpowerful bruiser in the room, the tables are turned and somehow the evil bad guy is somehow more powerful.  The current power structure is justified, and the degree of struggle needed to keep that structure alive is given more dramatic punch because the baddie is somehow harder to overcome.

The use of women as heroes in this vein is like an additional factor on top, for multiple reasons.  For one, women are considered a minority with less power, so the idea of a woman defeating the the bigger, badder bad guy has more oomph.  Also, having a woman as the hero, supports the status quo; instead of the women of the film being the bad guys, they're good guys on *our* team.  And on top of that, we get to pat ourselves on the back for allowing women to fight with us, rather than repressing them.  But we're only OK with women having power if they're on *our* team.  A woman playing for the bad guys is extra bad.

You can see this with people of colour (if that's the term) too.  There's always a black guy on the team, on our team.  

Now, I'm certainly not saying that having women beating guys up in movies is entirely a conservative political function.  It's more likely a positive, progressive force in general... but what's really interesting is how films can be simultaneously progressive and reactionary.  Mainstream films will usually dangle progressive themes and angles to sell themselves, but will often contain that progression with a regressive angle at the same time.

Woah, that turned out longer than I thought.&&[deleted]&&> 
> What you see from that is the pendulum swing. Anti-heroes came about in comics and movies because people were bored with the perfect hero in a white hat. They were tired of moustache twisting villains. It was over simplistic.

They came about because Marvel got tired of being beholden to the Comics Code Authority limitations and started pushing back against an incredibly repressive set of rules dictated against comics after  Frederic Wertham and his book Seduction of the Innocent all but destroyed the industry.

It took the industry 20 years to publish the first issue without the code out of fear of reprisal. After they realized nobody gave a shit anymore, the ""grim and gritty"" style became incredibly popular.

It had nothing to do with the public wanting darker stories and everything to do with Marvel and DC trying to get out from under a stupid regulation system dictating what they could or could not do.&&Spot on Johnny. And it’s the reason everything in Hollywood is a sanitized, prepackaged pile of garbage. I don’t care about diversity in entertainment. In fact I don’t care about diversity at all. I’ll watch films with only Chinese, or Indian or American or anything actors as long as they take risks and try to explore something that isn’t already done to death and boring as fuck. Entertainment is a meritocracy by its very namesake. You cannot pick and choose what is entertaining.&&> You can't snap your fingers, replace fan favorites that have been around for decades, and then expect people to be happy about that. 

Isn't that basically what happened to DC in the 60's when they rebooted the Flash and Green Lantern, among others?&&Speaking from a minority standpoint, lots of white people. Most of the white people ive come across seem to care about the appearance of not being racist than actually caring about not being racist. &&>  99% of everyone

&&I upvoted you to award your clever response.&&It was a funny show and they had some good skits such as asking women at a women aimed festival and getting the majority of them to agree that woman suffrage needs to be stopped.&&It wasnt even a good show for being ""manly"", it was cheesy funny-or-die-skit-tier trash that had one good segment (girls on trampolines) that quickly censored itself with more and more of the women wearing sportswear underneath their skirts.&&Like how an arms race to kill the most people possible with one bomb gave us an alternative energy source.&&True equality will only be achieved when Tyler Perry is given a 6 movie deal from Netflix.&&Because if there is equality in excellence, there is equality in the lack thereof.

Actually, there is a thing here: I really do believe the zeitgeist is moving towards seeing Medea as a terrible franchise because of the content of its characters, not the color of their skins. That's... a kind of progress.

I think that might even be changing. And that's a good thing.&&[More like this.](https://i.imgur.com/len5s1H.jpg)&&You are right. It won't change what people buy. I sell beer, I know. Most people who have ""their beer"" will not change.  

BUT the Super Bowl ads definitely aren't just for fun. Every year millions of people become legal drinking age (not to mention those who decide to start earlier). These people do not yet have ""Their Beer"". The first time they walk into a bar and order a beer they'll have to choose something and they are going to say the first thing that comes to their head. And those ads exist to ensure that the first beer they think of is Budweiser.&&There is empirical data that advertising works. These companies don't just spend millions in advertising hoping it will boost sales. They know it will. Every person on the planet knows what Coca-Cola is, yet when they run a big ad campaign sales rise. Your brain is far more receptive to suggestion than you realize.&&That only works if someone calls her on her bullshit, but that never happens. &&She didn't say it though. Michael Cole said it in a painfully transparent attempt to paint Stephanie as humble, when she is anything but.

Just one of the many inconsistencies in WWE storylines and creative in general.

McMahon's must always go over, or at the very least be in the main or co-main event picture.

It's been reported that the only reason they even want Ronda Rousey in WWE is to basically get Stephanie McMahon over with the mainstream audience.&&Also to be fair,  if anyone's voice had the power to make that change it's her and her husband.     
    
We give the credit to HHH, but as his wife (and a McMahon) it's more likely than not that she has a pivotal role in the things he does as well.&&can you explain ""heel authority""? internet search only turned up ppl using it with no context. &&Shes a different situation. Whenever she's dealing with the women she's a face, but when she's dealing with the men she's a heel. Its odd. So when she says shit about the 'womens revolution' its 100% what the WWE wants to get across.&&So we can thank Edge for a lifetime of great matches, and Lita's signature thong look. Thanks Edge! I was so sad the day he had to retire.&&I think Sunny actually started this, but Sunny was a legit great promo and manager, so I don't know why they decided to lose the talent aspect. &&No, but she could dance.

Too bad she was 10 years too early for Fandango.&&> Stacy Keibler

Doesn't matter. &&But also fuck WWE for making them turn their real lives into a storyline back when kayfabe mattered?&&Hey you take that back about edge. He had the best entrance music of any wrestler ever&&She was one of those especially nasty pieces of work. You know the type who had no actual talent of their own, and are incredibly bitter about it, so instead they become a vicious and cruel sack of shit.

If Moolah was a fictional character, she'd be considered up there with 'Nurse Ratched', 'Dolores Umbridge' or 'Napoleon the Pig' in regards to being utterly and irredeemably evil&&Vince McMahon is still in denial about how the internet works.&&as a very casual wrestling fan i had no idea that any of this had ever happened until the uproar about the name of the event&&Absolutely. Which I agreed with Warrior. There are so many guys behind the scenes that should have the chance to be publicly honored. His name shouldn't be anywhere near it, but I know there are countless guys and gals backstage that have helped talent tremendously that deserve some recognition. It's cool WWE is doing what they are with the award right now, but they clearly are doing it for philanthropic reasons. 

Stephanie herself said a couple years back: ""Philanthropy is the future of marketing.""&&They even changed the name. He originally said to call it the ""Jimmy Miranda Award"" for WWE's behind-the-scenes employees.  Miranda, who died in 2002, was part of the WWE merchandise department for more than 20 years.

To be honest though, the award is still good. They're giving it to people who really do deserve a bit of recognition and its almost always a tear jerker when they announce the recipients every year.&&Warrior didn't even want it to be called the Warrior Award.  He suggested naming it after one of the WWE's longtime crew members (I forget the name).

It was honestly the one selfless thing that Warrior ever said, and it's funny how it's now being used to lionize his name.&&The allegations against her only really came to light in a widespread way the past few years. 




There were a few allegations while she was still alive but they never really made headline news at the time and a lot of people didn't know about it until more recently. &&But there's a strange mental box we are putting around things too. Part of the reason we are feeling the chemistry less is the assumption a cast should look one way and when it doesn't we are made hyper aware of it by poor chemistry or just our brain being aware it's a diversity cast.

I'm thinking part of our reactions are to do with conditioning to expect one thing and we aren't getting it. 

I've found with a bit of distance most things aren't as bad as people think they are. I put so many expectations on game of thrones I didn't enjoy them until I watched them again much later. &&Yes! Well said. I think that's why this show really resonated with me after I noticed.

Sure movies like the Black Panther and Wonder Woman are great ways to introduce women and people of colour to traditionally (for no real reason) white male dominated movies, but why did it have to be such a big deal?

I think I'll check out that show, I haven't seen it before&&It's almost like if the story is good and pulls you in than the cast doesn't have to ride a gimmick.

Because let's be honest, whenever they advertise a movie or TV show by going on about the cast than the movie/Show isn't all that great.&&[deleted]&&That could have a lot to do with the fact you're 6 and not had a lifetime of conditioning re what a cast should look like &&Compare that to episode 7, where they have to conspicuously assure us that Rey is capable by having her beat up the Stormtroopers that Finn tried to rescue her from (Get it, cuz she's a woman, and women don't usually do man things like that!)&&I've never seen or heard this before. But I like it.&&The characters don't brush it off, they take a jab at the history of all-male sci-fi squads: ""Yeah, well, all of the previous ones had been all men.""&&Right? God I hate virtue signalling. &&Nightmares thanks&&Which is funny since there are parts of the movie where their skin literally crawls lol.&&It wasn't in the trailer that I saw for the movie so it was a surprise to me too. &&The bear scene is one of my favorite movie moments, ever. &&> Annihilation is not as accessible.  It's weird af and is slow, quiet, thought-provoking.

Not to mention the trailers were pretty misleading. But then again, how exactly do you even market a movie like that in the first place?&&i feel like a lot of industry people didn't see mad max. and it was weird. because its a masterpiece. people in different circles, never saw it because they heard the same rumor ""that it didn't have story"". like basically one person was being snarky and elitist about a movie they hadn't seen, and then it was like a domino effect.&&He was correct. Annihilation got a [C on Cinemascore](https://www.cinemascore.com/), which is awful. The movie does not have wide appeal. Test audiences probably said it was weird and terrible. 

The guy deserves to be shot into the sun for wanting to change the movie though, I agree. But he was mostly right in gauging its wide appeal.&&I'd watch an Alex Garland movie with that as the premise&&Sympathetic villains is one of Alex Garlands signatures. He does it so well in Ex Machina that Caleb is for all intents and purposes the protagonist for like 3/4 of the movie until you realize he's ready to betray Ava as well. Then for the last part of the movie it's about Ava escaping her captors.

Oscar Isaac nailed his role so well. The character is so cool and charismatic, but you slowly start  to realize he's a bit quirky. But then that quirkiness has an edge to it... almost threatening. Then suddenly you realize you are bros with a fucking dangerous maniac.

I'd rather reward Dove and Hollywood for putting out positive messages than reward companies who put out negative ones that enforce bad stereotypes or hurt people.&&The social climate hasn't changed.  The social JUSTICE climate has changed.  Spike Lee took bigger risks 30 years ago.  Sidney Poitier took even bigger risks 60 years ago.&&This is what gets me about people who blast political correctness, as if individually trying to make society a more respectful place is somehow a bad thing. &&If a film is set in that area, it should feature an equally diverse cast. However, currently the climate is a bit ridiculous in that diversity is demanded even where there should be very little of it. This isn't a movie example, but The Witcher comes to mind. It faced some criticism for featuring almost exclusively white people *in a setting based on medieval Poland*.&&[deleted]&&Im sure she mentioned that she was a trailblazer in the early 00s herself?

Might be mistaken though, i sorta tuned it out haha.
I dont think Mcmahons always have to go over tbh.
The only one that consistently goes 'over' is Steph and 90% of the time Haitch if you consider him one now.

Vince was always 50/50. He always got his dues given back to him and Shane has never really been in a 'winning feud'.
I mean, even with Bryan returning for the match, i cant even see shane beating Zayn/Owens this weekend :P&&Heel is term for “bad guy”. Authority is the person who “runs”the company. Many times the authority (owners of the company, Vince, Shane, Stephanie ) play a factionalized character based on their actual job in the company. If the character is “bad”then are both a heel and the authority, hence heel-authority.  &&Coincidentally enough, his last match was 7 years ago yesterday&&Which is proving their point of just hiring [blonde] models who couldn't wrestle. &&McMahon is a scumbag lol&&That storyline is LIT.&&You think you know me you think you know me...

Edit: love the Hardy's but yeah edge was dope as fuck.&&He knows Zack Ryder invented the Twitter box to put himself over.&&It’s weird to me because people were complaining or praising the diversity in the last Jedi and I wasn’t swayed one way or another in that movie. The color of the cast didn’t bother me the slightest nor did I feel a need to praise it, but the quality of the characters and the overall story disappointed me. The most alarming thing was being called a racist or misogynistic for disliking it. That had zero issues with my letdown of that movie. And overall it was a fun movie, just not a satisfying continuation of the story. It had nothing to do with who the actors were or the color of their skin. &&I think it had to be a big deal so people noticed the change and took note that these things can work if they're given the right chance to succeed. The only female driven mainstream comic movie I can think of before Wonder Woman was Supergirl decades before, but female heroes tend to be as popular in the comics if not more so than their male counterparts. Minorities in big budget films are incredibly underrepresented, both on screen and behind the camera, and Black Panther and Wonder Woman made waves by changing both of those things and giving moviegoers something they hadn't really had yet.    
    
I'm a white guy, and while I enjoyed both of those films I don't think either was particularly amazing. If I'm a young girl, or a young black person going to see those films and seeing myself reflected in a positive way in the types of movies that I don't usually get to be the hero in, though, you might just be inspiring the next generation of creators and showing that they do have a place in that world. Of course they're making money on it, and every venture in our world relies on that anymore, but that doesn't lessen the future impact those things have on the social commentary our entertainment sets the groundwork for. 
    
&&Yea, not exactly subtle that one. I mean, her titles literally change.&&Luke would have gotten his ass kicked by a group of stormtroopers on tatooine. If anything, it was representing how much more skilled she was than anyone. Not just a guy. Not to mention, the guy watching her is someone running away from stormtroopers.

It's comedic because Finn is running away, and Rey is standing and fighting. It shows their differences.&&You're free to read that into it, but in the movie the previous expeditions had literally been male-only special forces etc.

It's not a given there was anything more to it than that.

Either way that's still brushing it off.&&The intestines moving like snakes.... *shudder*&&I don't know what they did in other countries but here in Norway Netflix promoted it front-and-center with that autoplaying top banner for a long while.

That's pretty decent coverage. Everyone who visited Netflix during that time will have at least known about it.&&That movie was incredibly feminist, which I think destroys the dumb ""passing the Bechtel test"" argument considering there were only two women in the movie and one was nonverbal. I loved the way they framed Caleb's almost obsessive need to help something soft and broken only to show she wasn't that way at all, AND Nathan had used Caleb's own Joss Whedon complex against him to draw him into the snare. I have a lot of feelings about the ""soft"" benign sexism he displays which is always accepted and goes unquestioned next to men who are sexist like Nathan, but both forms of sexism are equally objectifying. The fact that Ex Machina made that point in a conversation between two men rather than two women is amazing. &&A Predator helps too.....somewhat.&&Or Tim Allen. Literally shut down his show cause he criticized Hollywood’s “fuck you for not thinking like us” mentality. &&> Which is why nobody should look up to Hollywood for morals. 

Based off what you said, another thing people do is looking at celebrity couples as the pinnacle of true love or some shit. And act heartbroken and shocked when couples break up or get divorced. Like seriously, they're humans just like you too. Everyone's fucked up&&just looked it up, R Kelly has been charged with 40+ counts of making child porn over his career. Shady as fuck.&&Actually Dove and Axe are both owned by the same parent company- the latter of which is notorious for making ads sexualizing and objectifying women, whilst the former is attempting to be some paradigm of feminist body positivity. It’s all for the moneys&&> people who blast political correctness

I think a lot of these are objecting to what they see as going overboard with catering to oversensitive people rather than the notion that we shouldn't be assholes to each other. The problem is that a lot of them then go overboard in the other direction.  
  

  
&&Those things aren’t the same, necessarily. Political correctness in places like college campuses is stifling intellectual discourse for *no other reason* than that some people are offended by views outside their perspective. Is Ben Shapiro really a Nazi worth shutting down or is he someone with a conservative view on the world? If he is a Nazi, the onus is on his critics to prove that he, a Jew (and practicing, iirc), is a Nazi. 

More than that, screaming till your lungs burst in order to shut someone up you disagree with is inherently destructive. *Discussion* cannot happen that way. Do you hate Nazis? Don’t drive them underground so they can grow in the dark. Dark ideas must be cast in sunlight because that’s where they die. They are vampiric in nature. The black market of ideas is far more dangerous to society than a black market for booze or cocaine. &&If you want a better example, look at the backlash Dunkirk got for the cast it had, despite it being true to the era. &&The problem with the reaction to TLJ is that resonable criticism is mixed in with outright misogyny and just angry nerds. 

The movie was problematic becasue of the structuring of the acts, make it hard to follow. All the other critisms like Mary Sue or the outright rage about it being anti men or ruining star wars is completely overblown. Its really not that bad. &&No they tried all women because they have no clue whether the soldiers genders played a role or not. It is them throwing darts at a board. &&Tbh the Bechdel test is about trends and is not really supposed to be used about individual movies, but like everything it gets misused. But you are spot on though, I loved that movie and it really gave me a lot to think about afterwards. &&Never forget Dave Chapelle walking away.&&Thats not why his show was cancelled. Youre literally in a thread about what a whore Hollywood is and how their only goal for anything is to make money. If his show was a big enough success with the right demographic they wouldve paid him what he wanted for a renewal.&&Not really. His contract was coming up and he wanted home improvement money. That show's main demographic was age 50+. The least desired demographic because they don't spend a lot of money and tend to be on a fixed income -hence the least desired by advertisers. Networks would rather have 3million viewers aged 19-49 than 4million viewers over the age of 50. They are lining up to kiss Ro$eanne$ ass in Hollywood. 18 million viewers is still 18 million viewers.&&_I_ just looked that up too, shady shady shady&&Exactly, and if people only bought Dove and stopped buying Axe, they'd stop making it. The products companies make and push are funhouse mirror reflections of the desires of their consumer base.&&... or their parent company isn't controlling how they advertise&&Right - so then if that matters to you then buy Dove and don't buy Axe.

I remember a long time ago reading about different strategies for managing online forums in the early days -- because we quickly saw that a complete free-for-all tends to becomes a garbage dump. One method is to attach value to users, giving ""trusted"" users more visibility. Another method is to treat all users as equal and give value to individual comments. The study concluded that trusting at the user level was usually erroneous: all ""good"" people can sometimes write bad comments, and all ""bad"" people can sometimes write good comments. Ultimately, you do best by encouraging good behavior and punishing bad behavior, regardless of the individual's history.

So that's a digression, but I think the same applies here. The parent company has lots of options. Rather than just condemn them wholesale, punish the bad and reward the good. Don't think ""but I'm rewarding a bad actor!"" -- instead think ""I'm rewarding good behavior"".&&SpaceWhale is saying that it was a reference to sci fi in general not the previous squads in annihilation.

I think he's clearly wrong too.&&Hugh Grant said nobody at the studios cared about him being caught with a prostitute - he said they only care about issues that affect revenue.&&Doesn't that literally prove his point though? The parent company doesn't give a shit about social priorities so Dove CAN'T give a shit about social priorities. They can advertise themselves as caring but the second the parent company thinks it would be a better idea to market differently they will.&&> so Dove CAN'T give a shit about social priorities

I think you're greatly over-estimating the power of a parent company over the companies they own. I've worked a couple jobs now where the child companies can essentially just do whatever they want, so I'd say that the chances of the parent company having absolute control over Dove's marketing are not as high as you might think.&&",2018-04-04 09:03:45
New International Poster for Wes Anderson's 'Isle Of Dogs',35390,8biabf,https://i.redd.it/z3ieabyb0br01.jpg,860,1523463129.0,,"Style reminds me of something Katsuhiro Otomo would make

I am not a smart man.&&This movie was so fucking good. &&Was there ever a discussion thread for this movie? I didnt see it on the discussions list in the sidebar.&&I wish there was a Shiba Inu character in the film&&I love dogs.&&Wes Anderson out-Wes Anderson'ed himself with this one, I loved it&&all of the posters are great, want to get them very much&&I want to buy&&Why is it け instead of の?

[source](https://classicaljapanese.wordpress.com/tag/%E3%83%B6/)&&Animation was great. I love that stop motion is still alive and well in the film industry. 
However, I felt like it was distractingly ‘Wes Anderson’ to the point of it messing with the plot. 
The constant symmetry and quick pans just for the sake of signature. 
Francis McDermott’s part was totally unnecessary. Don’t get me wrong- she’s great, but her part in the movie was pointless. 
 And yoko ono? Playing the part of a scientist named yoko ono? Why is she famous again? 
The part with the exchange student was pretty unnecessary as well.

I don’t know, it felt kind of pretentious and hipster-pandering in parts.
All personal opinions aside though, I’d say it was worth the ticket, enjoyable moviegoing experience for sure. &&Saw it last night and fell in love with it&&Can someone explain to me why this movie is racist? I watched it and thought it was the furthest thing from racist.&&Anyone know why this movie isn’t at cinemark theaters in northeast Ohio?&&But that dog isnt even in the film&&one of Wes Andersons best to date, the animation was the best I have ever seen and the story was captivating beginning to end.&&Honestly wasn't a fan of the movie...it just didn't grab me&&I️ don’t get the hype for this film, it just seems very odd, perhaps I’m too young to understand?
&&Any idea where one could purchase this poster?&&a damn fine piece of cinema.&&Movie was so fucking good!! VINTAGE WES!! 10/10!!&&Am I the only person in the world that's isn't a fan of this particular style of animation? There's just something ""off' about it to me. I couldn't get through Fantastic Mr. Fox for the exact same reason. I know some of you out there must agree with me. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills over here.  The art design is distressing to me and I can't figure out why, but even watching the trailer made me feel uneasy.&&Did anyone go see this movie?&&Totally out of the loop here.

What even is this movie, and why it's it so hyped? I see ads *everywhere*.&&Oh! I get it

Isle of Dogs

(I love dogs)


# MeToo&&r/fakealbumcovers &&IM SO HECKING EXCITED TO SEE THIS! &&When you say 'Isle of Dogs' it actually sounds like you're saying 'I Love Dogs'.&&Is this movie worth seeing??&&This movie is phenomenal. Maybe it's just because Wes had the human characters speaking Japanese, but the dogs are way more human than the actual humans (bar Atari).

Edit: Changed ""was"" to ""is""&&As soon as I saw the trailer for this, I was like “this is gonna be some weird crap... I’m seeing it.”&&Lord help me but I haaaaate Wes Anderson so much&&I have been reading a lot of about the movie being a cultural appropriation.^[1](https://www.slashfilm.com/isle-of-dogs-cultural-appropriation/) ^[2](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/isle-dogs-is-cultural-appropriation-hollywoods-next-big-battleground-1098228) ^[3](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/paxqkn/isle-of-dogs-is-a-white-mans-fantasy-of-japan)

What do you think about that notion after watching the film?&&My mom pointed it out to me last night.
""Isle of Dogs"" ""I Love Dogs""&&I can't get over how Anderson put a Maoist school setting in Japan. It seems trivial to white people (like my wife) but this really bugged me. Also, the white girls' burden thing was a little too much.&&Me fantastic fox surprised me so much. I'm glad I watched it and now I'm excited for this. &&Reminiscent of van goh's Bedroom for me&&I loved the h*ck out of this movie&&This poster fucking sucks &&dumbest movie I've ever seen

like something a 3 year old would make with their own poop&&That pup looks kinda... -*wiggling hands*- different.&&/r/intentionalwesanderson&&Where can I get one&&He would be a better doggo with 37 pieces of flair. &&Did he do Fantastic Mr. Fox?&&A dog of dogs&&If you want all dogs to wear 37 pieces of flair, then why dont you just make the minimum 37 pieces of flair?&&This old Japanese style of painting (where the animals look Hella scary) is really cool, I love this poster.&&Everytime I see a mention about Wes Anderson, I think of his brother, Mel. I use to work fairly close with Mel. Such a good guy. Genuine, humble, clever, smart, earnest, and funny...miss working with him. Great genetics from that family.&&Ah yes.  A new addition to my room.&&Unpopular opinion: I didn’t like the movie that much. Loved Fantastic Mr Fox and I love dogs. I just couldn’t immerse myself and was bored through many parts of the movie. Maybe I’ll find a new appreciation watching it at home. &&Is there a trailer for this movie? I'll have to search it up.&&Saw it with my wife the other week. We both loved it and she's Japanese.

But I'm going to say, fantastic Mr. Fox was better. Isle of Dogs is still fantastic though.
&&[spoiler] 

one of my complaints about this movie is over something really minor, and its when the girl realizes that she has a crush on Atari. it bothered me for some reason and i felt like it was just unnecessary, i dont know&&What goes on in this man’s head? &&May be recency bias, but my favorite Wes Anderson movie since Darjeeling Limited. I plan on seeing it again soon.&&Best Wes Anderson film since Royal Tenenbaums IMO. &&I'm in Japan literally right now and I haven't seen a single bit of advertising for this movie, I thought it would be all over the place. Guess it doesn't come out for a while? I have noticed a lot of big American movies from a few months ago are only just releasing here (Boss Baby, The Post, Greatest Showman). I wonder how audiences react to it here. What's also interesting is that the Japanese voices aren't subtitled in the English version, so we don't know what they're saying most of the time, but in Japan the audiences would, so their experience with it might end up being very different.&&Hello Criterion cover.&&Just came here to try out my new username&&> Katsuhiro Otomo

for a second I thought you meant the film. but yeah this poster was made by him not the film.&&Oh wow, the guy who drew Akira! He's responsible for me discovering comic books... as a 21 year old... in a local library. Never cared much for the superhero stuff, then I see this epic, 2000-page novel drawn with almost savant-like precision and I was hooked.

I kinda want this poster. *Badly*.&&I was going to say it's a mixture of Richard Bachman's [book cover](https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8AIV.jpg) and Rumo [book cover](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/33/95/64/339564e53aaca26b703f2a6b2e9f1f9c--walter-obrien.jpg).&&> Katsuhiro Otomo

He's like a God to me&&Well I just realized it just now so. &&This seems to be a common occurrence with movies lately.  In the last week I've caught myself asking for tickets for ""Love's Hymen"" and "" 7 Days in Aunt Debbie"".  

Edit: Actual movies are  "" Love, Simon"", ""7 Days in Entebbe""&&I literally lived on the Isle of Dogs for three years. It’s a small London borough on the peninsula south of Canary Wharf that used to be a slum, now a quiet residential area with a normal amount of dogs. I am less confused about the title now. &&Is it true that was the intention or are you just reading into it too much?&&I didn't realize that either. Interesting that the Japanese title and Kanji of the title is Inugashima, literally Island of Dogs, so they wouldn't get the double meaning. Must be really hard to do wordplay like that with foreign film titles. &&Not necessarily. Isle of Dogs is a real place in London. Think this 'parallel' is a bit of coincidence&&I needed to hear Jeff Goldblum say it, amd suddenly it all made sense&&So Isle Of Man is actually... &&Fucking no one in the word realized that besides Wes Anderson and you just now, you genius humble bragger &&Holy shit you just made me realize this as well.&&Woah... mindblown&&I didn't realize it until I was telling my co-worker about the movie and when I started to describe the plot, he goes ""Oh, I know what you're talking about. I thought you said 'I Love Dogs'."" &&I interviewed to work on it (did not get it) and your comment just made me realise...&&It was a tv ad I saw last night where they kept repeating it over and over for me to get it 

I also had no idea what Fractured but Whole meant until I heard someone say it out loud &&I only realised it when I watched YMS's review and he wondered if that was meant to be the case.&&I only realized after they dropped a new trailer where they kept saying it over and over again and I thought that's what they were saying&&What's not to like if you are a twelve year old boy, dogs love those&&Neither am I, I looked at the poster again thinking I love dogs was somehow spelled in the image.

I’m dumb as hell sometimes. I just got it too&&It took me a long time to realize that everyone who hadn't seen trailers thought that's what I was saying &&Isle of Dogs is an actual place in London, Millton is the suburb. I watched a documentary on the worlds largest ship in 1850 that was built there.&&how are people even seeing this movie it is still nowhere near me&&Would be real nice if it was actually showing anywhere actually near me. I really don't understand the limited release for big movies like this. Really, I'd like someone to explain to me why they do it.&&I couldn’t agree more. One of the few films I’ve seen where I’d give it a 10/10. It was truly a masterpiece. &&""...Did you hear the rumor? About the movie?""&&I'm glad to hear this. I saw quite a few comments worried about how the movie didn't look very good from the previews and trailer but I want to see it still. &&I just saw it last night, and I really don’t know how I feel about it. I’m not a huge Wes Anderson fan, but I like his films. Fmf is one of my favorites from him as well as the Royal Tenenbaums, but I can’t place exactly what I didn’t like about the movie. What did you like about it? I want to like it, but I can’t grab on to anything, aside from how incredible the animation is. &&ReallY? As a huge lover of Wes Anderson cinema i'm very disinterested in this film. It looks like Wes Anderson on acid. Wes Andersons films of late have gotten so Wes Andersony i'm having a hard time enjoying them. Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest were both enjoyable but still over the top and this one looks like it's too much. It's taken the kitch to such an extreme level it just feels padering at this point. Can someone tell me i'm wrong?&&I think Wes' style works better without live action. &&Good to hear. I haven’t seen it yet but I’ve been a little worried about it. I am a fan of other Wes Anderson films though, so I was planning on seeing it anyway. (Fantastic Mr. Fox is my fav animated movie) &&yeah i loved it. &&Dude I can't wait to watch it. Not released where I am but been trying to find a good quality download. So impatient I've been waiting months!! Fantastic mr fox is my favourite movie I need more stop motion Wes ASAP&&It FINALLY got to my area and I get to see it tomorrow and I'm so excited.&&It was good. I preferred Fantastic Mr. Fox. I really enjoyed the music in Isle though. &&Saw it Monday. Definitely going to buy it when it comes to dvd&&I fell asleep the first two times I watched it. Third time's the charm. &&I disagree

It was like a seizure in movie form made from sculpted poop

no original ideas whatsoever

even the talking dogs were uninspiring

skyrim had better voice acting&&Did you go into it knowing it was Wed Anderson and expecting greatness or was this the first film you saw by him? &&The detail in the sushi scene made my girlfriend and I go back to japan. &&I think I saw earlier that it'll be posted this Friday, April 13.&&wait this movie came out?&&There was, but it was when the film was in limited release. Most people didn't see it until a week or two later.&&I haven't watched it but I've heard that the dogs are supposed to represent how japan sees outsiders or something like that so having a japanese breed wouldn't make much sense&&Me too. I haven’t seen it yet but I have two shibas and went to Japan last year and would have loved a cute Shiba character. In Japan we met a dog who was the exact replica of our girl Shiba, down to her less common coloring (cream with reddish ears and reddish down her back) and smaller than standard size. The owner was so excited when he saw pictures of our girl, we got his contact info and he ended up sending us a collar, leash, harness, and specially made name plate with our dog’s name in kanji so that she would match her long lost twin in Japan! &&There was a picture of a Shiba in a sideshow during the movie, unfortunately no actual character &&Instead, there's Inu Shima characters on the poster&&I felt the same way about a corgi. Last time I visited I saw more corgis than shibas.&&You have just spoiled the movie.&&I am ashamed to admit that I didn’t get the “Isle of Dogs/I love dogs” wordplay until I saw the TV spot with all of the characters repeating it.&&Heckin’ bamboozle&&What a Wes Anderson thing to do&&Wes Anderson doesn't do what Wes Anderson does for Wes Anderson. Wes Anderson does what Wes Anderson does because Wes Anderson is Wes Anderson.&&I googled and found nothing, but it's only a few hours old! You can buy the previous poster on Amazon, I hope they'll do this one as well! &&Confused me too when I first saw the poster haha, obv I need to work more on some classical Japanese (I probably won't)...

Just to clarify for anyone else reading through since it wasn't in the quoted part, the title is written 犬ヶ島 and pronounced ""inugashima"" - the particle here is a *small* ヶ (a holdover from classical Japanese read as が) and not a regular ケ. 

 &&I was confused as well. I'm nowhere near advanced enough to know about the *small ke* yet, my teacher said it was a pretty archaic usage.&&Actually, according to [a Japanese viewer](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.vulture.com/2018/03/what-its-like-to-watch-isle-of-dogs-as-a-japanese-speaker.html#ampshare=http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/what-its-like-to-watch-isle-of-dogs-as-a-japanese-speaker.html), it is supposed to be reminiscent of another movie Onigashima&&I'm going to ignore everything else and just go straight for Ono. I think she's a talentless hack. However, she has spent a lot of her life being an activist for a lot of great causes and I can't fault her for that. &&This is how i've felt with all of Wes Anderson film of late. Ever since Moonrise Kingdom his films are so focused on the kitch and the quirks that it's almost pandering at this point. Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest were enjoyable but the quirks take away from the plot in my opinion. Something that didn't happen back in the day with Life Aquatic and Tenenbaum. The quirks and kitch was perfectly balanced with an artful story. But they seem to have taken over in all his recent film. &&Do you like movies like Moonrise Kingdom or the Grand Budapest Hotel? Grand Budapest Hotel didn't even have a plot compared to this. If you don't like those movies, well then you just don't mesh with Wes Anderson's style.&&The poster makes me wish it was traditionally animated. I am not a fan of stop motion.&&I enjoyed the movie a lot. I would not call it a racist movie. But I do think it had a couple of elements that could be described as thoughtless or insensitive.

1. The film leans heavily on Japanese cliches. Taiko drums, sumo wrestling, Shinto temples, kabuki plays, advanced technology, a subservient populous, an authoritarian leader. These cliches aren’t bad in themselves - in fact, when the film treated them with earnest, they were accurate and respectful - but there were moments when care lapsed, and then it didn’t feel like I was watching a film set in Japan, but a Westerner’s take on what they think Japan looks and sounds like.

2. So, there’s this unfortunate [trend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film) that’s been going on for decades in films, where by a white character will swoop in and save the day from the non-whites who were apparently unable to save themselves. Isle of Dogs does this pretty blatantly. I get the impression that the American character was written in specifically to get around the film’s deliberate language barrier. If that’s the case, then I understand why an American character was necessary for the plot, but I don’t understand why she had to fit the white saviour archetype so neatly. There were many other, more interesting, more sensitive ways that she could have been written.&&From what I understand some people are mad about it because of how the Japanese dialogue was pretty simple.&&It’s not the people saying this stuff haven’t even watched the movie or just get offended by the slightest stereotype &&One thing that stood out to me was the quote (it’s also in the trailer) “god, this would be much easier if he [the boy] spoke the same language as us” or something along those lines. It just irritated me since the dogs are from Japan, so they should still understand the boy. I understand it’s an English movie, but it would have been awesome to have more Asian-Americans, especially Asian-Americans billed the same as their white counterparts (see: IMDB). 

Also like another comment mentioned above, casting majority white people. The last major thing that stood out to me was having the villain have “chinky” eyes and speak English in a poor Japanese accent, which was poor taste. 

Edit: grammar 

Edit 2: also to clarify, I haven’t seen the movie yet I just was slightly wary after the trailer. But I don’t mind seeing it still. Let me know if it’s different as a whole and I’ll definitely watch it. Don’t mind spoilers if you want to tell me why it’s not what I initially thought it was! &&Ok so, alot of people are asking why isn’t it out yet so i’ll answer it here for anyone who doesn’t know. Wes anderson for some reason likes to open his movies exclusively for a little bit to certain theaters then he does like a worldwide release. I live in NC and only 2 theaters played it on april 6th which was its 2nd release date. March 23rd was its first release date but for a limited limited amount of theaters. It’ll release everywhere on april 13th i believe. &&I watched it at Regal in Crocker Park but it was also playing at the AMC in Rocky River... I think it’s coming to more theaters this weekend. &&I'm also in northeast Ohio. I'm seeing a few at cinemark , but the majority of them are near/in Cleveland. &&[deleted]&&hey! that's where *I* live!

hey! those are the theaters *I* go to!

are you my neighbor?&&[deleted]&&Mansfield Ohio has it. Not sure why they would but others do t &&Interesting, i loved this movie from front to back. But thats wes anderson for ya, polarizing audiences worldwide.&&Nah - some films you either enjoy them or you don't - I wouldn't sweat it.&&> Am I the only person in the world that...

The answer is almost always no. Is it stop-motion in general or is it specifically Anderson's? Could be because his is very toy-like and the eyes have the weird Chuck-E-Cheese animatronic vibe. I haven't seen Isle of Dogs but I remember Fantastic Mr. Fox having some jarring movements with fur or facial transitions. I didn't mind  it though. 

You might be hearing less about it since folks who saw Fantastic Mr. Fox and disliked the style were less likely to give Isle of Dogs a shot. I feel like it was a quieter/smaller release (in my opinion).&&You're not alone. To me this type of animation style feels like it was made with taxidermied animals.&&I think that's inherent for all stop motion.  The viewer has to do a little work to see through the imperfections.  Or embrace them.  I can't think of another medium that incorporates so many artistic disciplines.  They're sculpting almost every frame then tying it together with enough precision to mimic movement.  I'm always in awe of this style, even if I'm not particularly fond of the story.

Probably a bad reccomendation for someone who finds stop motion off putting, but [Alice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rri69wKUUQ) is one of the creepiest films in this style.  After watching something like Alice, Wes Anderson's stop motion films seem like a walk in the park&&The movement of the fur on Mr. Fox creeps me the fuck out. I still really like the movie and the style, but I agree, there's something unnerving about it.&&Yes, I'm with you.  The style is absolutely horrifying to me, as if someone took poorly done taxidermied animals and put their lifeless limbs through stop motion to make an extremely morbid film.  I don't mind Chicken Run type stop motion but the ones with fur and lifeless eyes give me the creeps. &&For me the whole look resembles intentionally creepy outsider art masquerading as legit entertainment, but the thing is I don't think it *is* intentional, I just suspect they didn't do a terribly good job...&&>Am I the only person in the world

Yes, just you. Literally the only one.

&&Nah dude I honestly just hate claymation. Never have I seen one I liked.&&Interesting, I loved FMF, but this one left me flat.&&I did! It was excellent!&&Just go see it. I wasn’t sure what I was about to go see either and walked out extremely happy that I went and didn’t bail.&&whoa&&yeah it is&&If you liked the Fantasic Mr Fox, you'll love this.&&It's a garbage claim. The creative arts have always built off each other's work. Plenty of eastern movies take from western sources. That's the way creativity works. 

Should Kurosawa have been forbidden from reworking Shakespeare? What about John Woo's French and American inspired movies? &&I wouldn't say cultural appropriation is really an issue, as the VICE article brings up, some aspects of Japanese culture are hammed up for aesthetic purposes. However, I would agree that the Japanese characters were underutilized, and that the foreign exchange student seemed awfully shoehorned in. I guess you could argue that the reason the FES was the driving force behind the revolution is because audiences would be able to understand her without ruining the aesthetic with subtitles, but it did seem a little bit odd.

To be clear, I'm not saying that the movie is racist for utilizing a white main character, but that claims that the movie suffers from 'white saviour' syndrome are not completely baseless.&&There are no white people appropriating Japanese culture in the film. White people making a movie about Japan is not cultural appropritian. 

I really wish people would get over that whole thing anyway. 

SJW's simultanesouly want us to see everyone as equal and make society a melting pot but then complain when we take on aspects of each others culture. 

Make up your damn mind. That's how culture works.

I guess we're supposed to stop eating pizza and sushi now because it's ""cultural appropriation"". 

Good lord. Talk about privelege.&&I think Wes was doing exactly what Fallout did, exaggerating certain cultural aspects to create a nostalgic effect.  It's not stereotypical just because a white guy did it.&&I think there's definitely an argument for it. On a lot of levels, I really enjoyed the film, but the depiction of Japanese peoples and culture often felt superficial at best. 

Most of the dialog spoken by humans in the film is in unsubtitled Japanese. There's an understanding that most audiences won't be able to quickly understand, so when the writers want to convey something quickly, they just have the character say the word, but with ""-o"" at the end (Such as Atari saying ""biscuito"" when giving biscuits to the dogs). If it was once or twice, it would be suspect, but this crutch is leaned on constantly to get around language differences, and makes the use of Japanese throughout the rest of the film feel like a stylistic choice, rather than anything really respectful of the language itself.

There's exactly two English speaking characters in the film, one of whom is a translator through whom a lot of exposition is conveyed, the other of whom is an international exchange student who [ends up pretty much saving the day, managing to overturn generations of political corruption in one night](#spoiler) . My issue with this is that there's no reason for her to not be Japanese herself. Being an outsider never really factors into her arc, nor does it define her character. It feels like some studio exec decided that western audiences wouldn't be able to root for someone who didn't speak their language and look like them because, honestly, there's just nothing in her character that would require her to be a westerner. It just feels like pandering White-Savior Complex.

All that being said, I greatly enjoyed the film. It felt like Wes Anderson tried to make a non-pandering children movie, and for the most part I think he really succeeded. I'd be interested in the opinions and thoughts of the Japanese actors within the film on its portrayal of their culture, because I could honestly be totally off. Overall, I don't think the missteps are enough to sink the film, but I would go in wary of it's problems. 

Edit: A few people have pointed out to me that the addition of ""-o"" at the end of a word can be common for loan words in Japanese. I appreciate the correction, but I want to leave my post un-amended because it feels dishonest to delete my own mistake.&&Who gives a fuck it's a movie&&Cultural appropriation is a bullshit claim anyway. No one in Japan has every been offended by these ""cultural appropriations"". Instead, it's the up and mighty SJWs who obviously know better than those Japanese people being offended for them, as they obviously need protection by the SJWs. See the irony here?&&I thought the students were inspired by Zengakuren, Marugaku etc. Although, I may be wrong and missed the references to Maoism. &&It wasn't a Maoist school setting lmao god damn you guys love to read into anything to make it offend you.&&I agree with the white girls burden thing, felt super shoehorned. I suppose they needed a way to have some English speaking characters, but yeesh.&&I'd say the girl is just a plot device, someone with an outsider perspective that looks at what's going on and goes ""hang on..."" Making her some other randomly selected race or nationality just to avoid possible criticism would just be silly.&&[deleted]&&I actually came to the comments to see if I maybe missed something about this. 

So if Tracy is in high school (and I could be wrong on this part) I thought it said something about her being a senior, would that make her a 17-18 year old having a crush on a 12 year old? 

Unless I just totally made up the senior part, in which case she could be like a freshman or sophomore which makes it a tad better lol&&[removed]&&I mod /r/Akira.

https://youtu.be/GIQC9M1qPAg&&It wasn't the intention, but now I believe the marketing team is running with it. 

The story behind it comes from when Wes Anderson was making The Fantastic Mr. Fox in London. He saw a sign for Isle of Dogs and found it mysterious, so he did some research on it and that was the jumping off point for making the film.

Why is it a 10/10 film to you?

I agree the film was good, but to me it's roughly 7/10.

The animation style really was fantastic. I'd give that a 10/10 I was watching a stop motion but wasn't aware other than right at the start.

The storyline was 5-6/10 for me, it was ok, the subplot with the American girl really dragged it down for me.

Especially when they first met; it was so forced and awkward.

An example would be the part when they mentioned that she used to be a show dog and she said that it didn't ""identify"" her or whatever.&&Thank you, finally someone who feels the same. I really wanted to like it. There isn’t any reason why I shouldn’t. It just didn’t click with me. &&[Spoiler Alert]   It feels like it's too shallow and almost cheesy for me.

She does help but she’s not the hero imo. The Japanese kids and the dogs did a lot more than she did.&&Here’s why I don’t 100% agree with the “white savior” logic. At least in Anderson’s intent. 

(I posted another very similar comment elsewhere in the thread.)

If I had to guess Anderson initially wanted to frame the narrative from the position of the dogs which is why he has them speak English. We are are able to understand the dogs. In the dogs interaction with the human world they do not under stand Human language (in this case Japanese). they may understand a few key words, but its mostly gesture, inflection, and context clues. Hence why no subtitles for the Japanese speakers. he didn't want every word of theirs to be understood. its kind of like this farside comic strip:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/sluggerotoole/153603564


But in certain cases they need to flesh out the key plot points and motivations. For the mayor character it is done during all his sessions at the podium on stage In front of TV cameras and microphones so the introduction of the female translator is not out of place. Her appearance in the context makes sense. Through her translation into English, the more detailed and nuanced points are fleshed out. 


That then brings us to the group of student protagonists who are opposed to the mayors plan. Anderson I believe REALLY did not want to use subtitles but needed an outlet to flesh out the plot points of that side of the narrative, but the other options of human translator or machine translator wouldn't really fit or might make that part of the plot clunky or distracting. Thus we get the white foreign exchange student character who pretty much for the most part is an expository device, but the writers really didn’t want her to be just Just an expository device. so her character and actions in the  plot has to be built up to give her some dimension.


So she, or a character like her, was needed at least if they really wanted to stick with no subtitles. (Which I think would have been an absolute no go for Anderson.)

Edit:  plus the true protagonist is Atari “The Little Pilot”. 

I really enjoyed the movie. This might be my favorite Anderson movie yet. Its definitely in the top 3.&&Just a heads up, the word you are looking for is populace, populous is an adjective.&&>  but there were moments when care lapsed

What parts lacked care?

> but a Westerner’s take on what they think Japan looks and sounds like.

Is this not a Western director's take on his view of Japan? 

> So, there’s this unfortunate trend that’s been going on for decades in films, where by a white character will swoop in and save the day from the non-whites who were apparently unable to save themselves. Isle of Dogs does this pretty blatantly. I get the impression that the American character was written in specifically to get around the film’s deliberate language barrier. If that’s the case, then I understand why an American character was necessary for the plot, but I don’t understand why she had to fit the white saviour archetype so neatly. There were many other, more interesting, more sensitive ways that she could have been written.

She wasn't the savior though. She helped the savior, who was a Japanese boy. Are you of the opinion that white characters can never help or aid a foreigner saving the day in a foreign land?&&In my opinion, the film was more like an homage to Japanese culture.  Similar to the Fallout series, the movie takes us to a place where culture at a certain point stopped evolving.  I feel that, when talking about a film's entire setting, the word ""stereotypical"" is ridiculous, because it's a filmmaker/writer's duty and privilege to create their own compelling world.&&I think the critics who say she saved the day are the racist ones, because she played such a minor role in the final victory. There is a tendency for Western viewers to fixate on the white, English speaking characters and ignore the input of the rest of the cast.&&To the point of #2 though, thinking back on how that subplot played out I actually think the intention might have been to subvert that trend.  [Keep in mind, in the end she's about to be stopped by Kobayashi, who immediately cuts up her student visa and deports her.  It happens so quickly it's actually kind of funny.  Her character's bravery really only comes from her assumption that being American makes her untouchable, an illusion which is shattered in moments.  In the end, Atari is really the one who gets the big climatic moment, wins over the masses, and changes Kobayashi's heart.](#spoiler)&&The Dogs aren't really speaking English.

I'm not sure that the exchange student is a white saviour so much as there for exposition.  It is Atari that ultimately saves today together with the major change everything, two Japanese characters.  She is there for the target audience in a role that maybe wouldn't work if she was speaking Japanese. That said I would be surprised if actual Japanese movie goers see this and are offended.
&&Are people mad shes white or that shes american. Like if she was black, would they still be complaining she isnt Japanese &&It's just an exercise in futility. Why does a movie that takes place in Japan have to be done the way you want it?

Did anyone complain about ""Lost in Translation""  featuring two white American actors?

To many liberal sjw's see the world in these polarizing terms instead of accepting and enjoying the intersectionality of the world without having to be through the lens of some nonending political agenda. &&You're missing the point by a mile.

He's using Japanese cultural influences because he likes them and wanted an homage to them, no problem there. If Wes Anderson decided he wanted to do his take on a yazuka movie, or samurai epic, etc., I think he'd find funding and an audience.

The problem is that he's using it as a veneer to tell a story that has jack shit to do with Japan, and in a way that wouldn't be welcome anywhere. Imagine *Idiocracy* only with Ken Watanabe in the lead. And none of the Americans are intelligible. It's like that.

There's nothing about the story that makes it Japanese. He could have made the movie with practically the same script, set it in Nashville, filled it with cornball references to hillbillies and country music, and it would be the same movie.

Using a mushroom cloud to mark an explosion?

The Young Pilot's name is 'Atari'?

He's just using the Japanese as a foil to be *weird* and I will not be surprised a bit if it offends.&&[deleted]&&> so when the writers want to convey something quickly, they just have the character say the word, but with ""-o"" at the end (Such as Atari saying ""biscuito"" when giving biscuits to the dogs).

&&Its really more so they didn't have to subtitle everyone &&> It feels like some studio exec decided that western audiences wouldn't be able to root for someone who didn't speak their language and look like them because, honestly, there's just nothing in her character that would require her to be a westerner.

She was put in there to be the link for Western audiences so they had at least one person speaking in English....I swear everyone reads this into as ""white person in film is a positive influence = subtle inference that white people are superior"". I don't get it.&&FYI - it's not a case of ""adding an O at the end,"" it's how the Japanese syllabary works. It could be a case of a -A, -I, -U, -E sound at the end of the word, or the final vowel might be just barely voiced at all.&&Might I suggest in the future you limit your cultural clucking to cultures you know something about? I'm hardly an expert in Japanese culture and I knew about this linguistic trope. I know that for some people the urge to virtue signal is irrestible but it truly poisons conversations especially when proffered in basically complete ignorance of the culture you are white knighting for. &&> My issue with this is that there's no reason for her to not be Japanese herself. Being an outsider never really factors into her arc, nor does it define her character.

Wes Anderson movies are heavily character driven. Tons of his characters have pointless little quirks which, while adding nothing to the narrative of the film, greatly add to the depth and humanity of the character. They're pointless and goofy and lovable.

Why was Alistair Hennessey from The Life Aquatic ""part gay?"" Why was Scout Master Ward from Moonrise Kingdom a math teacher while not at camp? Why did Kylie from Fantastic Mr. Fox have excellent credit? Why did Brendan from the Darjeeling Limited have alopecia? Why was Tracy from Isle of Dogs from Cincinnati? Why did Chas from The Royal Tenenbaums breed dalmation mice, of all things?

They're all pretty mundane details about the characters that are largely insignificant to the plot, shoehorned in for no compelling reason. But frankly little details like that are exactly why I love Wes Anderson's work so much. Taking time out of the movie to slow down and appreciate little human quirks about characters is very refreshing and entertaining.

And frankly, she had to speak English anyway. If she spoke Japanese, she would need to be translated. Who would be translating her? The only time anyone gets translated is if there's someone in-world doing the translating (other than text being translated, and very occasionally by narration). She's carrying a huge chunk of the plot on her shoulders, and she needs to be understood, and there's no in-universe reason for her to be translated. She could have subtitles, but then she'd be the only person with subtitles, and that would be remarkably stupid. She could be Japanese and speak English, but that's also very stupid and I'm sure you'd still complain about it. Or Anderson could have just given *everyone* subtitles, but that massively detracts from the creativity of the world that was established, and frankly would have made it way less enjoyable. Having her be white is really the only reasonable way to execute the story in the manner that he wanted to.&&Morons really care.

Usually I go for vanilla or chocolate, with fruit or sprinkles, but sometimes I just want something *really different*, dammit!

I love Wes Anderson films!&&I wish I loved it as much as you guys :/ the animation is truly incredible, but as the movie went on, the plot or characters didn’t captivate me. There wasn’t really a standout character and the plot was ok. I actually thought the foreign exchange character was bad. 

Overall, I thought it was really funny and the animation alone is worth the price of admission, but it wasn’t one of Anderson’s best. I’d give it a strong 7/10&&I know some people thought the characters or script were weak, but I didn’t get that at all on my viewing. And my god did they play with your emotions a lot. I teared up at least 3 times during the movie. And like you said, the detail they put into each scene and each set were absolutely incredible. I just hope this gets a wider release so I don’t have to drive an hour away to see it again lol. &&I find myself critical of films as well (I despise much of the last Jedi but that’s a different conversation), and personally I felt each element flowed into the other really well, with the parallel stories happening simultaneously (the American girl), as well as his use of flashbacks dispersed throughout the story to show you *why* thats the way it is. 

The art style was another point for me. It looked amazing, and to me it’s a great way to express the story though another way besides dialogue. So it wins there for me too. 

Admittedly this is my first time watching a Wes Anderson movie, so I’m not familiar with his style or other films, however they are on my watch list. &&There's few films that make me feel like this film did. I probably cried 3-4 times watching it. I came out of the cinema thinking to myself that this is one of those extremely rare moments when I had the opportunity to witness a masterpiece. And no, I don't know how to explain it - I just felt like this was among the best films I've ever seen. So yes, for me it was a 10/10.&&I went to see this movie and not being someone who really cares what director made what movie I really had no idea who Wes Anderson was or what to expect from this movie. And with that said, it blew me away.

I only thought it was some kids movie about dogs (went with my daughter). Wow was I in for a shock. I loved everything about it. I loved the humour aspect of the dogs being so straight and deadpan about everything dramatic happening around them. Such nuance and detail in the characters that could be missed if you're used to the standard Hollywood blockbuster style. I loved that it gave moments to absorb what was happening with held shots whilst the dramatic music of the drums continued relentlessly in the background. Those pauses really intrigued me.

In a sense I guess you could almost compare it to South Park. There's something about the characters who were very deliberately forced to turn and face the camera. Even when they turn sideways it would only be briefly and then have them face back at the audience whilst forcing us to pause along with them and absorb a moment whilst staring them in the face.

But all that amongst the action that goes on around them. It's almost James Bond like. These dogs acting so deadpan matter-of-fact whilst the world around them is going through an existential crisis and their own predicament would send others in to insanity.

Maybe that makes some people uncomfortable. Maybe some people get awkward when a movie doesn't keep an incessant march of progress through the plot. But I loved it. The way to forced us to share at these dogs and take things in at their pace.

And the humour was beautiful. I totally imagine it would irritate some people. It was quirky humour. Silly humour and often quite subtle, staggering a line of whether it was humour at all. But it always was, yet to some eyes I could imagine people saying, ""What mate. I don't get it? Is this meant to be funny or somefink?""

And the detail throughout the movie was intense. The music was well placed, even if just incessant drumming. The style was beautiful and intricately done. The characters intriguing.

And scenes like the kidney transplant. Totally not needed but just a nice little touch of silliness. That sums up the whole movie. A visual feast of silliness  around a very serious story that reflects the very dangerous and real scenario we all find ourselves in the real world.

I can't really in words do justice to how much I enjoyed this movie. &&I’m hoping to watch this tonight if I can find it streaming somewhere.

For one example, some the Japanese dialog, particularly from the mayor and Ono, read and sounded pretty stereotypical. The mayor‘s redemption at the end where he talked about dishonour almost read like something from a Japanese South Park character.

>Is this not a Western director's take on his view of Japan?

Of course, but I assume Anderson was trying to depict Japan, not an outsider’s stereotypical view of Japan.

>She wasn't the savior though. She helped the savior, who was a Japanese boy. 

She was the driving force of her subplot. She literally rallied the Japanese students and led them from scene to scene. She shared a common goal with Atari, but she was largely the saviour of her own story.

Thank you for the correction!&&It's not that any time that a white person has a positive influence, for me at least, it's when a white character, above other people, is the hero. In her introduction scene, we're shown this whole classroom, all these kids who are politically motivated to help the dogs, but outside the hacker, who is never formally named or given any lines, she, the only non-asian kid in the room, saves the day. I have no issue with her, or her whiteness, or her helping and trying to do good. My problem comes from that out of all of these kids who really want to help the dogs, she is the only one from that classroom that's focused on.

Additionally, if her motivation or character had to do with her whiteness, her otherness from those around her, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it. She is clearly an outsider trying to do good, but other than being handed a deportation notice that's immediately revoked, her outsider status doesn't effect her journey at all. There's no *plot* reason for her to be an outsider, yet she clearly is one. At least for me, that kind of tonal inconsistency takes away from the movie.

I do totally agree with you that she was added so that western audiences would have an English speaking character, I just disagree with that approach stylistically. Of course, this is entirely my own tastes, but I think, if the dogs and the dogs only spoke english, and the rest of the cast spoke Japanese, there would be been a better distinction between their worlds. It may have required more effort put into blocking or scenery in order to convey story to an audience that most likely doesn't speak the language, but I feel that would be worth it for what it would acheive. The film's only in limited release anyways (I live in a major US city, and I could only find one theater showing it), so I don't see why they would tailor the film to a wide market. Again though, this last part is more just my tastes and opinions. &&I totally concede my point on the linguistics, it is my error and I should have looked into it more, but that says nothing about my other point on the film.

Also, who am I signalling to, or white knighting for? I don't think I'm some great defender of the Japanese because I posted a critique of a Wes Anderson film deep enough into a comment thread that barely anyone will probably ever see it. I just have some opinions on a film I saw, admittedly some of which are wrong. I'd rather have some kind of discourse and learn something.&&I would suggest you read up on the JCP, Minsei, Nihon Kakumeiteki Kyōsansugisha Dōmei, Marugaku , Zengakuren and lastly the Japanese Red Army/Nihon Sekigun. 

You should also check out the student protests of the 60’s as a whole. &&The foundation of the industry - ie the influences of the Godfather of manga, Osamu Tezuka - was rooted in a love of an appropriation of Walt Disney. 

From Anime to videogames, there's actually a quite lovely decade-long exchange between Japan and the West - two unlikely bedfellows who've learned to vault over any language barriers and reflect and refract what one sees in the other. Kojima's whole ouevre is a reflection of that, as is Pacific Rim and Mortal Kombat. &&I’m American and don’t care if my culture is appropriated by Japan. I also don’t care that Wes Anderson appropriated stuff. People have done this throughout time. The entire idea of “cultural appropriation” is one of the things that keeps me from going more to the left.&&Cultural Victory - USA&&Love old westerns.

The area is also known for being the filming location of 28 weeks later (sequel to 28 days later). I remember watching that movie with friends and in one scene we could literally go on the balcony and look down at where the scene was filmed (on the DLR tracks). &&You you really love Wes Anderson, especially Mr Fox, you'll enjoy it. It was highly entertaining. &&Show me like 2 unintentional things related to Wes Anderson films and I'll show you 2 editor errors&&Doubt he had the only final say in the title also.&&That’s more the marketing team though, the Isle of Dogs is a place in London which Wes Anderson has said he was inspired by. &&They probably just figured out it worked and ran with it.  English is the only language where the wordplay works.&&Is English your first language?&&Check at the end of the week it's gonna start going wide. &&Same here. I see that is finally starting to show this weekend. &&This happened at my theatre too! They kept playing previews and trailers for it, and then the day it was released it was as if they just changed their mind. 


I was going to go see it and there were no theatres near me playing it at all. I was very disappointed! It looks like a really cute movie!&&Yeah, I was seeing this marketed all over the place and then it just seemed to vanish once it was released. I was really surprised--figured it'd be in every theater in town based on the marketing. Instead, it's just in the local art house theater. &&Hot doggo? You lika hot doggo?&&Same for me. I can't get away from this damn movie, it filled 75% of the Showtime's last week at Dallas Alamo.

I've seen it's preview at every. Single. Movie for the past four months.

At this point I almost don't want to see it because I'm so sick of hearing ""doooo do do do doo""...&&Yeah I'm kinda here too. Its a great movie, but I don't feel like really any of the characters, human or dog, that were especially engaging&&It was extremely Wes Anderson-y.

You either like the style or you don't. I can see both sides&&The animation is really the strongest point because the script is just not good. Anderson’s stilted dialogue did not work for this movie, as he turned it up to 11 and made all the characters sound like the same person. Some of the things people say in the film are so blunt and badly written that it’s honestly cringe inducing at times. The whole scientist-foreign exchange student subplot was completely unnecessary, and as a whole the movie felt a little unfocused. I would have enjoyed the movie much more had they dropped the Japanese government angle all together and just went for a story about a kid finding his dog. The kid-dog relationship seemed to be at the center of the film yet they bogged it down with a convoluted conspiracy plot instead of keeping it as a simple adventure film.&&> I actually thought the foreign exchange character was bad.

A lot of people have said this.  She was definitely the weakest part.  My guess is that she exists because its an easy way to convey english to a western audience without resorting to subtitles. E.g. the scene where she was translating the speech to her dictaphone.&&I'm the same. I'm a big Wes Anderson fan but this movie never captured me. I was pretty disappointed by the end. &&I'd give it a 6/10. Probably the weakest Wes Anderson so far.&&Same. No Wes Anderson character has captivated me since Gene Hackman’s character in Royal Tenebaums. &&Same page! Would have been better as a short. Story and characters were flat. I love Wes Anderson, but this one was a rare miss.&&I was actually the opposite, I started out a little underwhelmed, but loved it by the time it got to the end. &&As a huge Anderson fan, I very much felt the same way. The constant exposition wore thin for me. There's no question the animation is a masterpiece and has immense value. I saw this with a friend at a free screening. Yes we were very lucky to get into it. He didn't react to anything the whole movie, but said he liked it a lot once it was over which surprised me. I felt like it followed the Anderson format very well, but I wasn't all that taken away by it. If it matters, I do like FMF quite a bit. I feel it's more well-rounded than IOD, but if some people are really into it then lucky for them. Grand Budapest Hotel has been my favorite since the first time I saw it. To me, it's still an institution.&&Same for me.  Loved, loved, loved the dogs, their personalities and comedy.  Hated the stupid nonsensical political parts, really just the ending in particular.&&Yeah, I thought it was good, but to me his other animated film is still the one I’ll think of when I hear Wes Anderson.&&I absolutely loved chief. He stuck out immensely for me.

And hey, 7/10 is still a great score. Not everything can be perfect! &&i agree. I thought that some of those decisions were hamfisted into the plot to make up for the non-subtitled japanese which led to some shallow characters and scenes. Also, I thought the puppets were awesome and all, but the designs and characters of the main dogs wasnt diverse enough. It doesnt need to be a slapstick cartoon but there are so many different types of dogs out there with unique personalities, that the main group seemed rather similar. &&I think the main thing that really bothered me is how rushed the third act was. All the other characters aside from the main ones fell away with no resolution.&&Yeah, it was a fantastic animated movie with incredible style, I think I'd definitely say I liked the animation even better than Fantastic Mr. Fox, and I *would* say I thought Chief was something of a standout character.  But overall I'd agree the story itself isn't what I'd call perfect, especially compared to his previous two films which I thought were both some of his best storytelling to date.  I'm a little more generous I guess, it's definitely an 8/10 for me, but he's made films I'd give a 10/10 and this wasn't quite that.&&The only weak part IMO was Gerwig’s character. Unnecessary and they could have tied in that subplot neater. But I still love the film and am eager to see it again!&&I think people associate that weakness with the dog's characters but that seemed intentional to me. They don't get highly excited ... They just have a pretty monotone demeanour. But that's intentional to appear more simplistic alongside the emotional strung human characters. And the dogs just try to get the task done. They don't mess around too much making decisions. They've ended up in a tough situation so there's no room for being sentimental in this new existence. Maybe some people watching this movie don't realise the small nuances that are important for the overall essence of the movie. Like one guy here saying he felt the Japanese government plot aspect wasn't necessary...that was the critical underlying linchpin holding it together!&&Don't get me started on the last Jedi... In my mind once all the actors from the original films die we can to a degree get rid of the throwback cheese.

It did flow pretty well, but I feel the division of the film with titles was pointless (for the sake of this conversation because I can't remember ""acts"")

The sushi scene was out if this world, really the best stop motion I've ever seen. However the flow of the film felt unnecessarily broken at times. 

I can't recommend Wes Anderson films enough, but there's a bit of a circle jerk (on Reddit at least) around him. Not everything he directs is 10/10 but I've never been disappointed by a film. If you're ever disappointed by a Wes Anderson film it's because you're expecting a 10/10 Wes Anderson film. He's not infallible. Not everything is great to everyone.&&I really just dislike Wes Anderson movies. They... leave me... unsettled. Sort of like I'm not getting the joke or not understanding what makes them good.

So I had completely written off seeing this movie, but maybe I'll just go into it blind and not think of like a Wes Anderson movie.&&It's great! They're both good fun, but the Fox one was my favourite.&&One of my personal all time favorites! Hope you enjoy it.&&I saw it last night, you should definitely go see it as soon as you can.&&When me and my friend were buying tickets, the woman at the counter thought they were filming in her hometown too.

Paul had a falling out due to Allen Klein and Linda as much or more so than Yoko iirc. and ringo is on the record as saying he felt the other three were closer and cutting him out. which was funny because when they temporarily reconciled they all had been thinking the exact same thing. that each was the odd man out.&&Did you notice that he killed a bunch of people? Hacker friend was stone fucking cold.&&> For one example, some the Japanese dialog, particularly from the mayor and Ono, read and sounded pretty stereotypical. 

Any particular scene you have in mind?

> The mayor‘s redemption at the end where he talked about dishonour almost read like something from a Japanese South Park character.

You do realize that Japanese culture is heavily based on honor and they have multiple tales of that sort right(even though they are cheesy)? If you watch any anime this would be picked up on almost immediately. 

> Of course, but I assume Anderson was trying to depict Japan, not an outsider’s stereotypical view of Japan.

He has an outsiders view of Japan...I don't understand this point. He can never give the view of Japan from a Japanese perspective because he isn't Japanese. 

> She was the driving force of her subplot. She literally rallied the Japanese students and led them from scene to scene. She shared a common goal with Atari, but she was largely the saviour of her own story.

She was the savior of her little side story...but not of the main story or plot. 

> This is a silly question. I even said in my previous comment that there were other, more interesting, more sensitive ways that she could have been written

But you aren't answering the question. You bring up the white savior. Are you of the opinion that a white character should never be depicted as helping or playing a large part in a foreign character saving his land?&&Great comment and rebuttal, could not have said it better. &&330!&&Good to hear ha. Yeah I checked the first day it opened in March and I think the only option I saw was in Columbus &&>There's not a single Japanese who loves dogs who can lead the rebellion? 

Literally the Main character.

Also Hackerman&&Ah, yes. I didn't like it because *I didn't understand it*, that's the case? いいえ。I believe you are really stretching to make a point when you bring pixelated porn or the overworked salaryman as metaphorical context for the film. Like I said, he clearly appreciates Japanese cultural touchpoints and there's nothing wrong with that. It's simply that his film has little or nothing to do with Japan.

And actually, on balance I liked the film. It's simply that the story and setting is fundamentally misbegotten, along with a couple of cringeworthy mistakes.&&Just to further that point, one of the interesting things you learn when you start studying Japanese is how many English (and other language) loan words they really do use in everyday life. The more interesting thing for me was that because of how the language works, a lot of people aren't actually going to understand you if you say those loan words ""correctly"" as they'd be pronounced in their original language - if you don't know the loanword itself as it's said in Japanese, you're better off saying it with a fake ""stereotypical Japanese accent"" than saying it how you're regularly say it. 

The language has a kind of limited syllabary that's based mostly on pure vowel / consonant pairs - pretty much the pure vowels themselves (a e u i o = あ　え う い お) and combinations (e.g. ka ke ku ki ko = か　け く き こ) with a few switches and sounds that just don't exist e.g. there is no crisp ""ti"" sound (pronounced ""tee""), only ""chi"" = ち. 

When people that have grown up with that limited syllabary first used words incorporating the *much* more complex sounds that exist in germanic/romantic/etc languages, the words ended up being ""modified"" into very common words today, many of which don't sound like their native language original. For example, a few (also, I was writing hiragana above, but all loanwords are written in katakana - they're both the simplest character set and represent the exact same sounds, just appear differently for different purposes):

- アイドル - ""aidoru"" meaning ""idol""　
- アイス - ""aisu"" meaning ""ice"" as in ""ice cream""
- チケット - ""chiketto"" meaning ""ticket"" 
- コーヒー - ""kōhī"" meaning ""coffee""
- ファイト - ""faito"" meaning ""fight"" but also a really common chant/cheer for sports teams, like ""Do your best"" or similar
- ビール - ""bīru"" meaning ""beer""

Honestly it's kind of tough to get used to a lot of those words until you develop your overall vocabulary a bit more, because they're pronounced like regular Japanese most of the time and don't stick out in the middle of a spoken sentence if you only know a little or none. 

Anyways, just a little extra knowledge for you if you made it all the way through!


 &&> I do totally agree with you that she was added so that western audiences would have an English speaking character, I just disagree with that approach stylistically.

But does a stylistic choice = cultural appropriation? I'm just trying to understand where we draw the line between cultural appropriation and having different cultures in movies.

> it's when a white character, above other people, is the hero

She was the secondary hero...the main hero was the Japanese boy....

Is it your opinion that white people cannot be heros in movies where they are the minority? For example, say something like the Last Samurai?&&Thanks, I will do so!&&I'm not saying westerns aere bad I'm just referring to that time period in film making&&Wow, that joke is... not funny at all.&&That's funny, it reminded me of that h3h3 video about YouTube scams where he kept linking to Jeff Dunham website&&I am all idiots on this blessed day&&Fish sticks&&Ehhhhhh... I be willing to bet that Wes Anderson has full control these days.&&Yes- isle of dogs could possible sound like I’ll of dogs.  Unless I’m say it quickly and without enunciation. Then maybe. I get what that people think it sounds like I love dogs, but isle doesn’t sound like I love. At least not to me or when I say it.  &&I think... This may be the point. 

They did the same here in Hawaii. I thought this movie came out a couple months ago but the non-stop talk about it has created some hype. &&It could have used some cleaning up. The pack of dogs themselves needed some more character. The Goldblum and Norton dogs were good but Bill Murray didn’t do anything throughout the film. &&Agreed it was a good movie not a 10/10 masterpiece.&&The Frances McDormand character really made for a huge emotional disconnect between me and any of the human characters.&&I don't necessarily think that applies here, I believe there are lots of fans of his style that didn't love this movie, myself included. There's lots of positives and it's still an enjoyable movie, don't get me wrong. But it felt like the script was a lot weaker than what I've come to expect from a Wes Anderson film.&&I actually think it was one of his least wes anderson-y movies. It didn't feel very whimsical to me. It felt a lot darker to me. In his previous movies, even when people were terrible and doing awful things there was still a light heartedness to it that I didn't get in this movie. It definitely had his attention to detail turned up to 11, but the overall tone of the movie didn't exactly feel like his others to me.&&He needs to learn how to direct more than two emotions.&&thats a cop-out. you can still critique the nuance of his craft without chalking it up to 'its wes anderson-y, you like it or you don't'&&I like the style but didn't enjoy this movie &&Really, I thought it was about authoritarianism and to me that made it feel really timely and poignant. It's about a kid trying to find his lost dog AND about resistance to an authoritarian regime. It covers topics like corruption, nepotism, suppression of freedom of speech, cronyism, and using populism to endorse and attempt to carry out genocide. The dogs being gassed are literally these people's pets, and they've been convinced they all need to be out to death. It takes such an endearing relationship as man and his dog and uses it to display just how dangerous populism really is.

I think a child can enjoy the movie as a boy tries to find dog story and their parent can enjoy it on a deeper level. My only criticism of the story is the ending is a little corny, but I will rewatch it with an open mind.

I also found the characters to be well done. Chief is a fantastic character. The kid is pretty well fleshed out and his relationship with Spots is endearing and heartbreaking. I think trying to flesh out some of the side characters is difficult because the movie has a lot going on as is. I think the world itself is a character, the way the scenes and sets are compose tell such a wonderful story. 

To be fair, I'm a sucker for Wes Anderson.&&ehh, the conspiracy plot I can accept if only it was pulled of better. There have been other film with somewhat parallel plot lines and some were better executed. There was a lot of plot conveniences between the middle and end. I could buy the hacker part though considering he's a chekhov gun and he's been in the background quite early on. This movie needed more time. it's runtime is only an hour with 41 minutes.&&This is what I took from it too.  

If I had to guess Anderson initially wanted to frame the narrative from the position of the dogs which is why he has them speak English.  We are are able to understand the dogs.  In the dogs interaction with the human world they do not under stand English for the most part.  they may understand a few key words, but its mostly gesture and context clues.  Hence why no subtitles for the Japanese speakers. he didn't want every word of theirs to be understood.  its kind of like this farside comic strip:  

https://www.flickr.com/photos/sluggerotoole/153603564

But in certain cases they need to flesh out the key plot points and motivations.  For the mayor character it is done during all his sessions at the podium on stage In front of TV cameras and microphones so the introduction of the female translator is not out of place.  Her appearance in the context makes sense.  But through her translation the more detailed and nuanced points are fleshed out for the mayor.  

That then brings us to the group of student protagonists who are opposed to the mayors plan.  Anderson I believe REALLY did not want to use subtitles but needed an outlet to flesh out the plot points of that side of the narrative, but the other options of human translator or machine translator wouldn't really fit or might make that part of the plot clunky or distracting.  Thus we get the foreign exchange student character who pretty much for the most part is an expository device, but the writing couldn't just have the character be just that so her character and plot point has to be built up to give her some dimension.  

So she, or a character like her, was needed at least if they really wanted to stick with no subtitles. 

I really enjoyed the movie.  This might be my favorite Anderson movie yet.  Its definitely in the top 3.  


edit:  expository instead of expeditionary.  
&&Wow, really? I honestly thought it was one of his best. His most stylized for sure, but I thought it was extraordinarly well done&&I've learned that with Wes Anderson, there is almost always no consensus. Ask 5 Wes Anderson fans which film is their favorite, and you'll likely get 5 different answers.

To me, the only Wes Anderson movies better than this are Grand Budapest Hotel and Life Aquatic. But plenty of people will disagree. &&Definitely agree there. Though her plot gave us Hacker which was my favorite part of the whole movie. &&I'm going to agree despite not knowing who Gerwig is. 

Foreign Exchange girl?&&I think her character was only there for us to have enough dialogue that we understood, since it'd be strange to have the entire film with a narrator. And I like the idea of no subs, so I won't entertain the idea of there having been subtitles. I agree she was the weakest in an otherwise fantastic movie.&&I hate this whole ""circle jerk"" terminology. I think this film is amazing, but I can admit that I do absolutely love Wes Anderson, but I don't think it skews anything for me. I am always prepared to be disappointed, but this film hit all the right spots for me. There just happen to be enough people that love him as much as I do.&&Thanks! Do you happen to know if it’s streaming at all? &&Yeah he gassed that poor guy&&440, actually, but my work number is 330!&&[deleted]&&Wow, the old saying about how you learn the most by posting something wrong online is true. Thank you for all this.&&On your first point, not necessarily. If something that has cultural significance is used purely for it's aesthetic values, without any of the cultural context around that, it can be appropriation, although it's usually not so black and white. Although I don't quite get your response, as my gripes about the style of the movie doesn't have much to do with appropriation. 

To your second point, I agree, she is the secondary hero of the film, but the primary of the context (the high school politics club) that she's in. It's not my opinion at all that white characters can't be a minority and a hero in a film, but that her portrayal as a member of this group where she is the minority, yet the only one in said group that makes a significant impact, or even has a name, is suspect. It's her positioning not just above of, but in spite of, her classmates and peers that rubs me wrong.

Edit: I haven't seen the Last Samurai, so I can't really speak for.&&https://youtu.be/trtyzv00Kos

Last Samurai is a horrible example. That movie is the poster child of white people being shoehorned into roles that have nothing to do with them. Tom Cruise is gonna teach Japanese Samurai how to Samurai? &&Like all of Jeff Dunham's jokes.&&I still can’t figure it out&&I am this blessed day on all idiots&&r/unexpectedkenm&& BIll murry phonning in a performance. Unheard of.&&Yes. I felt like she really dehumanized them and didn’t even make sense in-universe. I sort of wished they’d either communicated the dialogue’s intent visually or just subtitled it.&&I believe this was intentional. The movie is supposed to be about dogs.&&Absolutely agree. It was a good film but feel like Wes Anderson lite to me.&&He doesn’t *need to,* I enjoyed the film because of the bluntness. Could’ve been cool to see the more nuanced version tho&&Well said.  It felt like Wes was going against fascism and nativism.  The dogs were essentially metaphors for the poor, immigrants, or any scapegoat population really.

But at its heart, I really felt like it didn't stray too far from a story about human's deep connections with their dogs. E.g. When the boy and his first dog were saying ""I can hear you"" to one another with tears in their eyes. They really had no reason to be crying, but for a viewer with a dog, it is very emotional because of how emotional WE would be if we could suddenly speak with our dogs and vice versa.

But yes, everything you said just built upon what I saw was a simple foundation story about man's best friend.

Full disclosure: I am also a sucker for Wes Anderson ;)&&SPOILERS:

 That’s exactly the way I see it. I also think the movie was making a point of how easily our perception of the world can be manipulated, not just by the government but by, well, each other. For example, a lot of what the dogs said turns out to be partially misleading to completely false, from Nutmeg having a thing with some other dog to Spot starving to death to the “cannibal” tribe being cannibals. And this might be a stretch but I think they even try to trick the audience in a similar fashion when they make us presume Chief’s group to be killed in an over-the-top way, only to later show that it isn’t the case.

I think Anderson’s drawing a very intentional parallel between how government propaganda and the way we share and interpret information among ourselves distort our knowledge of the world around us. And like you said, its a very timely message in so many ways, including  how we haphazardly share rumors and fake news through social media. 

Or maybe I’m just over analyzing it lol. Either way, great fucking movie.&&Well done, yes.  But the story was weak and he was trying too hard to be Wes Anderson-y.  It didn't even come close to his best IMO.  My wife loved it though - and she's not really into Wes' movies so who the hell knows  &&*gives shifty look*&&I think I know what part of Kung Fury you'd like.&&Yup, exactly. Greta Gerwig is an actor and recently directed Lady Bird which is a really good movie, I highly recommend it!&&I think there was just too much of her. In small doses she would have been fine but it was obnoxious as a lead.&&It's on YouTube for 3 bucks. Also on Amazon video.&&Try solarmovies&&BOOOOOOOOO

Kidding. Hello kinda neighbor &&How about putting a little more work into connecting the dots between pixelated porn and the movie?

You want some film school argument about what this signfies thus so so so, those are questions for Wes Anderson himself.&&fair enough I can understand that opinion&&Isle of dogs

I love dogs&&I am this day blessed of all idiots. &&Can’t phone in something where you’re given nothing to do. &&I think what you mention about the dog and human communicating could also be applied to people of different nations. If we could suddenly all talk with one another without the interference of government propaganda and illogical xenophobia and hatred but instead just hear each other clearly. That would bring a tear to our eyes.

The creepy tall guy, who I'm not sure his character name, is what represents twisted propaganda to make people of nations hate one another. The dog and the boy represent the innocence of people of different nations who would just get along if weren't manipulated to hate each other.&&My dog is a former street dog. His personality is A LOT like Chief's. He still has a lot of ""stray"" traits, that pop up, even though I've had him for years. He always seems so sorry after. ""I don't know why I bite..."" That shit was heavy. 

Then Chief got a bath, my dog is also white with spots, and a black nose. I literally started crying in the theater. 

I loved the movie. I'm sure other people can relate. &&I don't get how people can say this story was weak but the Grand Budapest Hotel had a great story lol&&Holy shit I didn’t know Gerwig was an actor. Thought she was just a director &&Me too&&Grand Budapest was much funnier for me&&Definitely...I thought it was more clever. But from a story perspective it was lackluster.

‘The First Purge’ Official Poster,30810,8a9red,https://i.redd.it/6onif0f8paq01.jpg,2421,1523023488.0,,"When in doubt make it a prequel.&&This is the fourth Purge movie, right?

I wonder if this will be the first that shows a crime during the Purge Other than murder. ALL crime is legal during the Purge but through three movies, we essentially only see murder.

If this is the ""First"" Purge, then you would think all strategies to avoid being victims of other crimes wouldn't have been accounted for yet, so there better be more than just murder.

Edit:
This review of the second Purge hits my point to a tee.

http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Purge-Anarchy-66244.html

>It’s entirely likely that The Purge: Anarchy was handcuffed by a very small budget kept in check to make sure that the final product would be profitable, but it’s still frustrating that a world that opens up so many horror possibilities as The Purge still hasn’t been effectively explored. While there certainly is a good amount of violence in the movie, it never gets to the point of being either shocking or overly brutal – which severely limits its overall effectiveness. **What’s more, so much emphasis is put on murder that it shortchanges the fact that all crime is legal in the world of The Purge. The rules of the film really allow for all kinds of psychotic chaos, but none of it is capitalized on effectively. Given the overall message from the larger metaphor at play, this is a series that should be effectively punishing the audience for finding brutality and horror entertaining, similar to the story’s villains. but it never steps up to the plate.**&&Looks like Zack De La Rocha raging against some sort of ""machine""&&I hate myself for liking these movies so much&&The movie might not be great, but the marketing for the movie has been top notch so far.&&The Purginator: Sent back in time to preserve the Purge&&I want to see an offshoot satire of the purge.

*insert Skrillex*&&Horror is without a doubt the most profitable film genre. It's crazy how fucking everyone isn't trying to make horror movies.&&True. I’m personally I’ve always thought a bank hiest/casino hiest during  the purge would be great. Focus on the less bloody crimes for a change. &&First of all, what happens to prisons during the purge?
Imagine a movie where a band of excons/criminals and whatnot on the outside attempt to break their friends out of prison during the purge. Or of prisoners attempting to break out while all crime is legal, so they cannot be put in prison for any of their new crimes during the attempt. What happens once they break out, will there be warrants out for their arrest the next day?Also, would there be more security in prisons during that 24 hour period? Maybe they just keep them in their cells all 24 hours with guards watching them on high alert. Its definitely an interesting angle.&&I wrote a little short about a government protected clean up crew that gets set out the day after the purge. It's kinda in the style of What we do in the shadows :)


Edit: I'm not home at the moment,  I'll send one out when I'm back :)

Edit 2: Sorry it took so long folks. Turns out I didn't actually finish it when I wrote it (I thought I did) so I spent the last few hours finishing it and it ended up turning out better than I had hoped (I hope lol)

Nah not a prison, but it is set in a small section of New York.

Just happy to be free!"" &&using prisoners to test of the moral compass of a nation seems a little poorly thought out...&&Close! This prequel takes place on Staten Island. &&Purge 5: Parking in Handicapped Spaces&&What about scientists doing unethical experiments on people during the Purge time-window?&&I dunno man. I can see it now. The scene opens in a dimly lit room. A besuited man is feverishly typing at a computer, frantically looking back at the clock. As the big hand marches toward the top of the clock face, beads of sweat shower off the mans face. Cut to a close-up of computer screen. The cursor hovers over a button that says ""execute."" The camera quickly focuses on the mans distraught reflection in the screen before refocusing on the button. He clicks it. Silence. ""Processing..."".....""Processing....""...""transfer confirmed"" 
The camera zooms out to show the full screen displaying that John Wabadh has successfully transfered $10million from his regular IRA into a ROTH IRA.

I mean, take my money already!&&They need to expand the universe and allow a Netflix show. It could make for some good one off episodes to focus on specific crimes and the fallout and lead up to those events. &&Have you seen the trailer? [It implies that this was the case, but a politician hired a bunch of ex-military to kick things up](/spoiler).&&Not to mention, both in expectation and perhaps relevance to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, probably a lot of rapes.&&Unless this shows the political agenda set from the beginning. It was never about just letting people do what they want, but rather to use as cover to accomplish something specific. &&Yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know? 

At first, everyone was like, ""look at those douchebags purging,"" and then the next thing you know, they're like, ""it's just so convenient.""

&&Technically wouldn't Wells Fargo be okay'd to deplete everyone's accounts and then park all the money somewhere else? 

I guess it'd depend on if civil court is still active. &&I haven't seen any of these movies, but in reality, I feel like rape would be the number one crime committed during the Purge outside of murder and theft. I think it would be a terrible idea to show a ton of rape or attempted rape during a movie like this though.&&I think a good concept of a Purge movie is a heist flick where the robbers also have to deal with murderous psychos. I think there could be a movie in that.&&I agree they won't expand it, but since they never did, even from the beginning, I was, and continue to be, disappointed in  this series of movies.

Had they just said ""all murder is legal"", that would have been fine. But they've teased a high concept of ALL crime being legal, i.e., no laws for a specific period of time. To only show murder is extremely short-sighted.&&I can practically hear an orchestral version of this song being sung by a children's choir for the trailer..

The Purge as we know it now was what people were expecting when the first one came out, instead people got a family under siege in their home by a gang of maniacs. 

It was a great movie, but very contained in its setting, and vastly different from its marketing campaign expectations.&&They’re kind of unique horror movies because they don’t rely on anything supernatural. Humans and society are what is horrifying. &&lol I have zwro interest in the movie but that's hilarious &&Ok you almost stopped my heart, at this point the world is crazy enough that was plausible.&&I mean honestly the concept of a purge night is great enough to be taken up by a good director in the future. Someone who can discuss whether morality is just a social construct or why good people can do evil things. Intelligent horror is a fledgling genre with Get Out and Quiet Place, and the purge concept would make a great allegory with the right script.&&The generic [“political ad”](https://youtu.be/gYYMnkoFtjM) trailer about how “You’ll be so proud when your child looks you in the eyes and says, “Dad, I wanna purge too.” that they released right after the State of the Union Address. &&The timing of the ad campaign &&4th of July release date too.&&So theres murdering psychopaths with all kinds of weaponry on the street. 

Why the hell would you go out there and risk your life to snag a TV from Walmart?

Thats how I explain it to myself anyway, &&[deleted]&&A major plot point in the third movie is a man staying behind to protect his store from looting and whatnot. They address other crimes &&To be fair, there was one attempted rape in the 2nd movie, which was stopped by self-defense killing&&I bet Walmart (in this world) would force their employees to secure the store with really good weapons, and pay them minimum wage for it&&The Election Year edition actually had a coherent plot too. 

But yeah, I fucking love these movies and the Fast and Furious movies.&&I gave up being guilty about my pleasures. So The Purge and other non-""high art"" films are just straight up pleasurable.&&Everything has to be high art

&&The preemptive defense is really telling.&&Crossbones as Punisher? Interesting &&The third is kinda ""Frank Castle in: Escape from New York!""&&And some friendly advice, don't look too much into lore, there is supposedly something like a 15 year gap between 2 and 3, and the main character shows literally no signs of aging, and the technology isn't advanced at all. &&Ah, right. Thanks. Which one would you recommend? &&Thanks. 

Would you recommend any one in particular? &&The second one is a big step up. It takes place out in the streets of the city, so you get to see a lot more ""Purgers"" in action.&&No...for me.&&Thats because the cinematograohy and choreography for their action scenes are top notch, combined with creative (albeit far fetched) stunt work and very little CGI make a very enjoyable experience. I wish other action movies put even half as much work into their action as F&F movies do.&&Am I the only one that wants another fast and furious movie about cars and racing? The ones right now are fun action movies but I’d like to see another like the first 3.&&I think people are be able to believe it, the movie companies just don't put in the time or money to make sure the writing communicates that.

&&The hunger games is basically the whole Minotaur thing but vaguely futuristic.  The premise is send two youths a year per region (mainly targeting the poor) to remind the rest of the country why they shouldn’t rebel anymore.  &&""No one will commit crimes 364 days a year if we have one day a year with no laws"". ""Economy is now booming because people buy a lot of guns and security systems.""

I can think of at least a dozen reasons none of this makes any fucking sense!&&Like there's so much potential in the premise for examining how, say, propaganda plays a huge role in what we just assume to be immutable human nature, how the purge is a blatant program for killing the poor and the working class in a society whose economic systems have not kept pace with technology, etc...

The ideal purge movie is one that recognizes that what is being purged isn't people's deviant urges, but people that the administration finds problematic. That the violence against random people is seeded and manufactured by propaganda instead of genuine nature of people, because otherwise a purge night would be liable to straight up turn into a class war. &&and just for shits have it tie in with the Cloverfield universe.&&What happened to that Pornhub campaign to shoot porn in space?&&*’The Splurge’*&&You could probably get a job at Blumhouse with ideas like that.&&Made me think of Jason X&&The first was only for 3 schmil, most of which likely went to Hawke and Headey; unless they got points.&&It's [Blumhouse productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumhouse_Productions) model that started with Paranormal activity. They pick up these movies and do them on a small budget with the goal to break even if they don't get a wide release and have done pretty well over the years.&&The first one took place in one location, you don't need many cameras, actors wearing masks so they can play multiple roles if needed.  You had one known actor who hadnt done much, so could offer a good salary and a cut of the gross.  Plus it probably only took a week to film and say 2 weeks to edit.  No cgi just good old blood and dark lighting to hide mistakes.

Now the sequels cost more due tonlocations and props but still don't require a lot of money.&&Purge squared? &&Like saw but more psychologically messed up. &&then out of nowhere a t-rex eats him while taking a shit.

24 Purge Street crossover film universe confirmed, keep in mind this universe is also MIB, gonna have some crazy shit going on. &&That's just Hotline Miami The Movie then &&A 25 million dollar horror movie can make a big profit even in the hundreds of millions . But a 300 million dollar avengers makes a profit in the  billions. &&For one I imagine these people are smart enough to realize over saturating the market would be a bad idea (They already get cranked out like crazy if you think about it you just don't hear about most of them).  Unless I am not reading what you said correctly.&&Didnt Get Out cost like 100 bucks?&&You don't remember when they did and they ruined horror for like fifteen years? We're finally getting incredible horror movies again in the last few years, The VVitch and Babadook are standouts for me.&&Tbh I’m not sure why murder is the most widespread crime there is when financial coups and property crimes would probably be the most significant.  It’s one of the reasons why I can’t buy that it’s a sustainable system; I imagine that there would be significant turnover as to who was and who wasn’t wealthy every year. 

But to your point, yes I would like to see a bank robbery in that world. &&They explained during the second movie that the Banks are cleaned out and the money is kept in undisclosed locations during the Purge so it wont get stolen. &&[deleted]&&Purge: Civil War

People in *certain* states are angry that they are being *economically repressed* by having their right to have purges taken away and secede.  Gotta preserve their heritage after all.

Not great but I mean not bad either. &&Then you actually have army and police come in for LA riots 2.0&&Purge: The Stories - Volume 4: Milton’s Idea for his Office&&I'd like to see a Purge movie like the original idea for the Cloverfield franchise.

I don't want a people vs secret military government purge movie. I want a mother fucking purge movie with ordinary citizens and no government pulling the strings behind the scenes. 

Hell I want an HBO series that follows three different groups of people participating in different parts of the country. I want it to explore the aspects of those who are killing randomly, those seeking revenge, the ones being chase, people trying to save others and etc. &&>What have I done

I don't know what she expected&&> The trailer is out today actually and finally clarified the plot for the most part.

Doesn't ""clarify"" so much as it explicitly states the entirety of the plot including the ""zomg"" twist.&&I could use a good Running Man movie&&Let's be honest, none of this series' premise is plausible. Having prisoners work as a test case for your annual murder night is just as stupid as having a *murder night* itself.

Violence is more often than not a product of having a violent temprament or predeliction, it's not something you satisfy. Think of it like sex, nobody says to themselves ""Well, I don't really feel like having sex this year because I had that really big gangbang in February"". And regardless of what this stupid film says, few of us actually *want* to commit murder. &&Purge 6: Masturbating on the Plane&&O god, thatd be terrifying!  Great idea though, they missed out if its not in the movie.&&Well that’s Purge 5 written, a proper horror film. &&Cut to his 17 year old son, who somehow has found his way to a bar despite the mass chaos going on. He shittly pours himself a Coors Light and then sips it as he watches the murderfest unfold outdoors. &&If the Social Network can be made into a compelling movie, this can be too!&&a thought-provoking premise ruined by shitty military presence?

What is this, the Belko Experiment? &&Here is an idea, we show full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Full penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends.&&This. The second purge movie shows military going into poor neighborhoods. And that played into the narrative of the New Founding Fathers of the purge making undesirable people kill each other. 

The whole point of the series is that when given a chance the government shots on the less fortunate and the wealthy are okay with that so long as they are protected.&&It wouldn't be a criminal act, but the next day depositors could sue to recover funds. 

It would also cause their stock to tank.  They would basically be out of business.

Banks make more money on interest over time than they could make by a one time theft of deposits. &&Yeah I think the concept is flexible enough that that would be fun and doable. 

There was a movie called the collector that was a burglar that goes into a house to burgle, only to find a serial killer that sets up traps all over the place. Do a little cat and mouse thing. It's not a masterpiece but I liked it and the sequel. &&Yes! And to expand on that a little...

These aren't movies I'm going to to have the cinematic experience of a lifetime, they're something that's a cool thing to see once and be done.&&What got to me in the last one is the idea purge tourism, but I don't know why it scares me so much. The optimist in me wants to believe that some random foreigners are booking a convertible in the US that night and flying down Route 66 at 150 mph, because that's what I'd do....... Wait! I know! Let's make it a road trip movie!&&Have you seen the others? The first one is kinda boring and underwhelming but 2 and 3 are solid ""Escape from New York-ish"" flicks anchored by Frank Grillo.&&I thought they all released on the 4th
&&Ah, that's a good point. 

I was wondering how malls and car dealerships were left standing after the purge, though. Any security system is only as strong as its weakest point, and that weakest point is usually a human with a code or a key. A mall would be easier to defend, I guess. Lots of malls are built like fortresses anyway, and a mall could afford really really nice security.

But a car dealership? The cars are sitting outside. You need the keys, but car dealership buildings are all windows. Sure, they probably have some security on the building, but all it would take is one disgruntled employee who had a key or knew the code, right?

Oh, maybe they move all the cars on purge night. Like how banks move the cash. I wonder if that would be more or less expensive than purge insurance? I need to know how the economics of this world work. &&My point is that there really wouldn't be so many murderers. There would be far more people just wanting to steal stuff. It would also be much easier to find 50 people willing to break into a Walmart and steal stuff then 5 people who just want to go killing.&&That's why I said group up. Plus that problem still exist within the purgeverse and it would still fit the idea the purge is secretly about putting the poor and middle class against each other (poor people going after mom and pop shops) and protecting the rich (like the Waltons).&&[deleted]&&Fast and the furious are my guilty pleasure.  I don't actually care about cars, I just enjoy the stunts and even the stories a bit, even if they are ridiculous. &&Everything has to be high art &&I wouldn't be surprised if the technology hasn't advanced at over the span of 15 years in that universe. Shit gets trashed once a year.&&I’ll give the 15 year thing a pass as at as technology goes.

You're not gonna lose any story by skipping the first, but I'd still recommend watching it&&Start with 2 and then watch 3.  Then go back to 1. If you watch them in order, you will probably stop at 1, and that would be a shame.

That right there is a great twist: they go on a cocaine bender and forget which day it is, they fight their way out of ""The Purge"" and then find out it was just a regular day in Florida with crazies trying to kill them.

&&With surprise appearance from Armie Hammer armed with hammers.&&In the case of Avengers, Disney could lose money on those films and still make hand over fist profit from toys, virtual characters, TV show ratings, comics, parks, and more.


Like seriously, they are basically a huge marketing scheme for anything else that Disney bases on the characters and logo. The Mouse gets it's due.&&Not to mention the merchandising. Not a big demand for GET OUT action figures. &&But it's a lot easier to get $25 million vs $300 million.&&I'm not a purge scientist but do they have to pay taxes on purge money? &&The insurance system would be a complete wreck. &&Someone working on the movie is probably scrolling through this thread looking for ideas for the next one. &&The Purge runs from 7pm to 7am so outside of US banking hours. The following day might also be a bank holiday just in case. I assume banks would be locked down and all cash removed from individual branches just in case. 

Since it's outside business hours you really can't commit wire fraud because the transaction would post during business hours when it's all illegal. 

Even insider trading wouldn't work since you can't execute the trade until markets open at which case, boom you're trading with privileged information. 


I think the point is that the purge protects the wealthy against crimes done against them. 
&&White collar crime purge would absolutely wreck the economy. Would love to see a purge about that tho. let's get some accounting purge! &&It's been a while since I saw the third one, but if I recall they address this.

::edit - My mistake, that was from the second movie. I may or may not have watched them all in one day... &&>  I’m not sure why murder is the most widespread crime

This is why I've never really bought into the Purge franchise. The idea of a night where crimes go unpunished is interesting, except that in the films there are always gangs of psychopaths going around murdering people for the hell of it. It would probably make more sense for the violence to be caused by attempted thefts, or something like that. &&Well from the new trailer for this movie it seems that people weren’t fighting enough so the government sent in people with the purpose to start fights. Seems like the Purge was more about drugs and sex parties until the retired marines came in to hunt.&&...which would only make the heist that much more interesting.&&Cleaned out by whom?

You've basically described every Purge movies&&You're right about one thing Master. The murders were short.&&Thank you for the warning.&&Welcome to most trailers in recent memory.&&So...does it look any better than the other movies? I always liked the concept, but the films were kinda boring. &&I think this is the first time I’ve ever been thankful for revealing trailer. If I had set myself to actually watch this one, I would have been  and mad stopped watching once they got to that reveal. 

It’s just ridiculous! It explains why all the movies are ridiculous, but it really just nails in that stigma they already have.  &&Seeing as I don't plan on actually watching the movie this was perfect. Anyone who wants to actually see this should stay away though &&That actually sounds really good. Purge definitely would have been a better tv series than a movie series. &&Yeah, one of the best parts of Purge was the ""free for all""ness of it. The small conflicts. The individuals. It's the same reason people like well done zombie movies - they're practically designed for viewers to put themselves in the character's shoes and think, ""what would I do?"".

But every movie they keep expanding their scope. First it was just a random family and circumstances of chance, then it was a rebel group, then an entire political party, now the whole government....

It's the same mistake SAW made.. they went too big picture and it lost it's personalized touch. &&I mean the whole point of the purge is that it’s essentially FFA groups, and not just a TDM of two teams. I hope that in this one it’s not just Side 1 vs Side 2, but rather a battle Royale of groups and individuals. It’s annoying that they also had the government get involved and sorta mop up the people with APCs and military grade gear. The point of the purge is to be gritty, that means civilian grade weapons and hopefully some melee weapons. It’s just a war movie if it’s two sides going at it with M416s and mounted machine guns + flamethrowers. Wouldn’t be surprised to see like seal team 6 with m249s at this point. The first was the best&&Can you explain the appeal of any of that, perchance? Not being  facetious or anything, it’s just an entire genre of media that I can’t grasp the basic potential appeal of. &&I'm gonna stab a man. Oh no, I stabbed a man.&&From my knowledge of the movies I’m guessing she wanted it all to be civilians against other civilians.

The original movie is still pretty damn entertaining though.&&Purge 7: masturbating in the airport&&That's just Saw&&Well I'm sure there'll be a 5th movie to correct that error (I agree though, that's a great concept, possibly enough to warrant a spinoff film just focusing on one particular laboratory during the purge)&&So Saw 1-5?&&That sounds like porn dude.&&Does your protagonist happen to smell crime by chance?

I agree with your other points, but this probably isn't true. If you could sue for damages created during the purge everyone victimized would just sue...&&Banks make most of their money through investing. So most of the money isn't in the bank anyway. That's why you have to give notice before trying to make a super huge withdrawal. They have to move funds around to make it available &&Yep I saw that. Completely forgot about it. Yeah that would be sweet.&&Rally 'round the family! *With a pocket full of shells*...&&The other movies actually show whats going on out in the open during the Purge, on a much larger scale than the first.  They build up the lore and story on-screen and follow different sets of characters through the chaos.&&People under attack outside their house. Plus you get to see more of the story and drives of the purge and various characters perspectives on it. &&The 2nd one is basically what people expected of the first one. It mostly takes on the street, and it goes into the politics abit.

It follows a stranded couple, 2 people out to save someone, and a seemingly normal guy yet he's out and armed this purge. I actually kinda liked it. &&Grillo needs more projects, hell, I'd watch a 5th Purge that involves time travel if Grillo just shows up in the final act of this one&&I was interested in seeing the first one when it came out but didn't because of reviews. Should I/do I need to start there if I want to watch them?&&There'd be plenty of death for that very reason. Lots of people in America fantasize about shooting home invaders, theives, and looters, you can find plenty of them on Reddit if you know where to look. I'm sure Walmart would have plenty of defenders.&&The films we've seen are a couple years in now. People aren't willing to risk their lives to commit other crimes now. &&[deleted]&&I think they stopped being about cars after the first movie.&&Those movies are like live action cartoons.....so much fun.&&Everything has to be high art 

&&Which again collides with how they say the Purge saved America, or one might even say: ""*Made it great again*"".&&Shit gets trashed in movie!america once a year. The rest of the world carries on.&&The concept is the same as in the saw movies. 1 introduces what the purge is, as it affects one family. Saw did the same thing, having the whole movie basically take place in the bathroom. 

After that, then they can expand on the universe a little and show more of the world and the craziness.  Saw also did this, and just as in the Saw movies, the later ones will tie back into the first.&&The first one had Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke though.&&Yeah. The first purge is a normal ""Trapped in a house"" Horror movie, where the second two come off as more ""action thriller"" with horror elements. &&Because the 2nd one has an extremely powerful message at the very end. I actually really love that movie because the ending alone elevated a mediocre movie to something really special to me.&&Yep, it's touched on in all 3 films. Poor people are the most likely to be killed during The Purge and if more poor/homeless people are killed then its 'less mouths to feed' for the Government. There's also the implied 'snowball effect' that with less and less poor/homeless crime also falls (since they are disproportionately more likely to commit crime).   

It's also touched on in all 3 films that people tend to just hold a grudge and wait until Purge night to act on it. This probably also helps to reduce the crime levels because people won't seek out revenge (i.e. murder) for the rest of the year because they'll be jailed for it. Instead they just wait for Purge night to do it.

They haven't really done much with the films directly in terms of social commentary (beyond establishing the 'universe' in which an event like the Purge would exist), in my eyes, but given the premise of this film I think there may be more than in the previous 3 films. &&I'd also imagine most people with money hole up and protect what they have...so the purge would disproportional weed out the poor and those likely to commit crime the rest of the year.

After a few years there'd be much less waste from crime and from taking care of those who can't take care of themselves.  Mom old and using up healthcare funds? Purged.&&[deleted]&&You mean JJ doesn’t want to see The Blowverfield Pair-o-dicks?

&&I always assumed the comedic parts of Jason X were intentional, the sleeping bag scene absolutely has to be. &&They offered sex and I guess he banged them...&&Yes&&Three Billion Stanley Nickels.&&It's the same relation as a unicorn to a leprechaun.&&Yes he has done a lot, but before that he hadn't done a major movie for a bit.  Look up his imdb.  In 2012 he did sinister, which was good but still not a major movie.  Got lots of good reviews for a horror movie.  He was uncredited in total recall in 2012.  Then 2 movies in 2011(one was a tv mini series so not a real movie).  Then no credits again until 2009.  Nothing major there too.  Then 2005 hes in assault on precinct 13 and lord of war.  Majorish movies.  So hes looking good there.

So my point is its been 8 years aince he had done a major role if not more, so you can't quite demand top dollar for a movie.  Yes he's done a lot, but like I said he hadnt done much for a while.  So maybe I was a little vague in my response but still hasn't done much since training day leading up to this.

If the other form is a schedule C, will purge supplies be tax deductible?&&Yes, income is either legally or illegally obtained and the IRS has a section for income from illegal sources in addition to all the legal income.  Since all crime is legal anyways, any stolen assets would count as legal income and would be taxed normally.&&A lot of things in the Purge universe don't really make sense. It could have been a really interesting idea if it had been fleshed out more thoroughly (see similar problems in Netflix's Bright).

Having a Purge would likely change so many sociological and cultural dynamics, however in the films, everything besides the actual purge is pretty much the same as it is in real life.

I feel like the purge would do things like create new family dynamics where everyone would live in one big house or neighborhoods would band together into small fortress communities, kind of like in feudal eras. &&They deal with that in the last movie.  It's presumably uncovered in standard policies, as there is a special ""purge insurance"" that you need for coverage.  &&Good&&It would be interesting to have a heist film set right before the purge, with a group planning to rob one of the money transport trucks that's emptying the banks before the purge, only for the convoy to get delayed into the purge. Set it during the early years when people haven't quite worked everything out yet and you got yourself a thriller. &&Generally white collar crime takes longer than a single day though, at least I assume.&&The movie ends up being a 2 hour reel of a bunch of people in front of computers snickering at themselves as they mess up financial statements and fail to follow gaap (on *purpose*) lol.

Edit: hit send too early. &&Pretty sure that was second but touched on again in the third. &&I assume that this is part of the marketing of the event.  It's sold to the public as a ""cleansing"", which will greatly inform how the public receives/participates.  

There's also the possibility that property rights don't transfer during the purge.  Like, do whatever you want, but that's still a stolen car and if you're in possession after 7am we're arresting your ass.

edit- given that the whole scheme was a ""kill the poor"" thing put together by the wealthy, it would make a lot of sense for them to structure it away from property crime and towards murder/mayhem.

&&Ocean's Purge-teen&&Oh no! You can't just *escalate* the *stakes* in a heist movie. It should be about a guy stealing a wallet and then running from Purgers.

So after like, 2-3 purge cycles most of the crazies would be offed and the ones remaining would be easy to contain/defend.

So you'd end up with most people staying inside on Purge night and a few crazies running around killing each other, IF that.

A Silent Cloverfield&&I mean the astronauts already got the Tang.&&Why? Are you tryna get into acting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&I'm starting to really like this purge universe&&Sign up for every social security and government schemes for disability. Take out every loan you can think of then file for bankruptcy on purge night. Repeat every year. Fucking ballin'&&But you're forgetting that 99% of the crimes that would actually be committed in a Purge scenario would be non-violent.  The vast majority of crimes committed would be online scams, fraud and theft.

The Purge movies are so wildly unrealistic because they're essentially just murder-fantasy movies.&&Yea the 3rd movie covered that

The purge isn't as effective so it's leading to alternate purges&&Which will evolve into governments and nation states &&Well it's tricky with the purge day. You're conspiring to do something legal. Planning to kill someone is illegal. But what about planning to kill someone on Purge Day? &&Purge-ybird. &&The Purge, oh wait...&&Yeah the main plot of Election Day is an assassination attempt organized by the government on a senator who wants to end the purge.&&I've seen them all at release and I get them confused but I do remember it very very heavy handed with gov involvement being obvious and heavier than actual citizen involvement. &&Not for the squeamish be warned, so incredibly fucking brutal.&&I don't think it's anything like the Escape from movies.  It's well done and worth watching if you can take brutal, graphic violence, but completely different genre.&&I think we can all agree that court fees alone would erase all economic potential of the purge.&&>The poor are killed

Cloverfield's Blessing to This Wonderful World

A Boring World Where the Concept of Cloverfield Doesn’t Exist&&I've never had much interest in watching this series, but a Purge film about upper-middle class white collar crimes sounds awesome&&Government and businesses close on purge night.  You probably wouldn't have internet access anyway. &&I feel like the illegal drug industries would benefit hugely, and probably even legal ones... imagine typical legal pharmaceutical giants deciding to pump out meth on purge day. &&Imagine the amount of movies that would be downloaded on purge night&&Oh yeah. That’s a very good point&&It isn't illegal to plan a legal act. &&Get Purged&&I think the poor are being paid by the rich to repair all the crap they destroyed killing poor people.&&",2018-04-06 10:04:48

(I know there was some other stuff in that movie, like there was one part where an old man sucked a titty or smth like that, but I wasn't paying attention.) So here are my Reylo questions:

1. Why did you describe the Kylo/Rey hand-holding scene as ""The closest thing to a sex scene in a Star Wars movie""?

2. Can you explain the narrative necessity of The Shirtless Scene and The Thigh Grab? And how did Daisy and Adam react when you told them about these scenes?

3. What Reylo fanfics did you ~~plagarise~~ take inspiration from?

4. How much did you pay Mark Hamill to support Reylo on Twitter?

5. Can you tell JJ to include a Rey/Kylo sex scene in Episode 9? (Full penetration pls)

The Last Jedi was a bad movie. &&Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?&&TLJ needed more Klingons&&Why does everyone seem to think this is real?&&This is easily one of my top three AMAs. &&Considering the amount of backlash The Last Jedi recieved, are you still as excited to make the new trilogy? Are you ever worried that fans won't accept your interpretation of the franchise in the new trilogy?
&&What are your thoughts on a remake of the film Silence set in the Star Wars Universe. Where instead of Christianity and being the last 2 priests of Japan. There would be two jedi remaining after order 66 that have stuck together and they soon begin to question the force whilst being hunted by the empire?&&Does it piss you off that soo many people think that your Star Wars was one of the worst ever created! or do you kinda just blame the bad actors and bad writers. I would totally understand if you do.  xx
&&It's funny how it seems so many people haven't caught onto the fact that this is fake lol&&Have you seen Youtube user ""Mauler""'s review of the Last Jedi?  It is an excellent literary critique of your movie and points out many issues fans have had difficulty articulating.

What was the point of bringing back fan favorite Luke Skywalker only to turn him into a broken husk of a man and act as a foil for perfect, unstoppable Rei?&&Rian how does it feel to be held in the same regard as George Lucas since some have also accused him of ruining Star Wars?

Question aside, hope your April Fools is going well.&&Are you here to ruin Reddit like you did star wars?&&Why did you decide that what Star Wars *really* needed was gravity, in space? Cannons shot at high angles then arching towards the target, and bombs dropped out of the bottom of a bomber bay, behaving like bombs dropped in WWII. Oh and those First Order command ships must have been battling so much wind shear and gravity in space since apparently they were too heavy and bulky to travel faster than the smaller, suppository shaped Rebel ships. Who knew aerodynamics were so important in the vacuum of space? Rian Johnson! That's who!

Happy Friday the 13th! I made an illustrated info-graphic going through all of Jason Voorhees' various looks and stats.,28971,8c58bj,https://imgur.com/e1d5Ikh,1538,1523679112.0,,"1984: The Final Chapter. 1985: A New Beginning. Lol what an about face. In a year! &&I don't know why Jason X got a rotten rating. That scene where he is in the virtual reality using a woman in a sleeping bag to club another woman in a sleeping bag is like better than schindler's list. &&How exactly did he take Manhattan?&&So the only good Friday The 13th film is the one where Jason doesn't kill?&&Quick, correct the spelling of Manhattan before anyone else notices!&&I now see why they make so many of these movies. Relatively low budget and high profits in comparison. I always wondered why they would make 20 sequels to each slasher flick, now I know. &&Until Freddy v Jason, it seems like the more money they spent the less they made, those Jason X numbers hurt to read. Also funny that one of the earliest in the series was named ""The Final Chapter.""&&This is awesome. Jason is my favorite horror movie killer. I was terrified of him when I was a kid. I actually got to meet Kane Hodder years ago and acted like a fan boy. &&Here's the animated version for anyone interested :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oZ9ExQ--Rs

We then switched gears to Friday (2009) with my boy Sam Winchester.

Good times.

Great post btw, man. Really enjoyed it.&&My favourite is in part 4 where Jason is killing a guy and the guy is yelling “he’s killing me!”
Or the boxer in Jason Takes Manhattan&&All I took from this is that I really need to see Jason X, apparently. &&Jason is an earner!&&Jason Takes Manhattan deserves the rating it got. But that doesn't mean it's not still one of my favorites... it's one of the most 80's movies out there. It's like if Jason snuck into Michael Jackson's Bad music video.&&Why is part III so hated? I started in on this series a few weeks ago and so far it has the most similar plotline to what I knew about the series. It's basically everything you think a Jason movie is. Most of the other ones have some gimmick. &&Part 6 deserves more respect. Upon re-watching it, it deserves props for being self aware and fun&&Why did no one like the most previous one in 09? I thought it was good. Loved how he crow hopped a chick with the machete. A running Jason is a scary Jason.&&All these names make me feel like I’m playing Game Dev Tycoon - when I’ve made practically the same game over and over and haven’t unlocked sequels / prequels so my brain defaults to “Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday”&&*spoiler*

What about the only surviving girl at the end of the first that he grabs off the boat at the end?  Did she survive to tell her story in some other version of this I don't know?&&There should be some kind of law against naming a movie in a series ""The Final Chapter"" and then releasing a sequel a year later.&&Damn, I had no idea there were so many movies! Can someone give me a top 3 or 5 for someone who’s only seen a few of them? (Also can’t remember which ones I’ve seen other than Freddy vs Jason, I’m more of a nightmare on elm street guy, plz don’t machete me)

Edit: I also just realized there are 13 movies. Cool!&&Is it just me or should part 3 Jason be in red and blue 3D?&&LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS! Do one for Michael Myers?&&Why do horror movies tend to have really high disparities when it comes to production costs and box office earnings?

Like your typical (humor me) horror movie is <10M to put together and does 100M+ at the BO and these happen all the time? Why?

Is it the dopamine from the shocks or these movies can get away with not using popular (and expensive) names or that horror movie fans will go see anything or what?&&I remember just catching bits and pieces of the f13 movies when the USA network would run marathons back in the 90s.

The game made me appreciate the series on a whole new level (imo. The game **is** the best Friday the 13th)


>all these movies are rotten!


First off, I think some people miss and dont  understand how **bad** horror film fatigue was in the 80s/90s. You know how people shake their heads at each *Saw* iteration?


F13 not only had that problem, it was also going against literally **dozens** of franchises and slasher films. The horror film genre was arguably dead in the 90s till *Scream* came along.


Going back and watching these films brings a new light to me and I'm able to enjoy them differently.


>**watching these back in the 90s**

Oooh this is supposed to be scary! I'm a BAD MAN for watching these in middle school! I have no idea what this is about other than a guy in a hockey mask killing people, hes so evil!

>**watching them now**

I really appreciate each iteration of Jason. The original movie is not in my top 5. I care about how each of these films were made and my friends and I cheer for Jason when he gets a good kill.&&>Friday the 13th Part: The Final Chapter.

Something's not right...&&Ugh, I have never been so bored of a slasher flick than I was of the 2009 Friday the 13th.  No imaginative deaths, it just felt like everyone was standing on a conveyor belt slowly moving towards being stabbed.  13 deaths, all generic stabs.

There was a guy in the film whose name in the credits was literally ""Wood Chipper Man"", and he just got stabbed.  The number of times they kept going back to the wood chipper, and nobody went in the wood chipper.  Even Jason at the end, when he seemed like he was going to get the wood chipper GOT STABBED.

It felt like a movie made by comittee, trying to check boxes rather than be something interesting.

Ugh.&&This looks like something I'd find on Homestar Runner. &&Wait, in Jason X didn't he blow up and entire space station (city) or something with like millions of people on it? Does that count or no?&&TIL, If you want to make money make a Jason movie. &&Damn this deserves more exposure and praise. It’s brilliant &&There’s 1 thing you can count on when watching those Friday the 13th movie. You will see tits. I love em. The movies and the tits....&&Jason X was so bad its awesome.&&I like toolbelt Jason. Like I can hear Hank Hill behind the hockey mask. &&Why write same as the previous? Like it was less text just to put the fucking numbers.&&Pamela Voorhees is the OG.&&OP cross post this to r/malefashionadvice &&I sooooo love this! Being an 80s kid who grew up scared out of my wits at the first ones that made it to cable to actually seeing part 6 and on in the theaters as they came out I have a great appreciation for the franchise and growing up with it. Even the crappy ones. Just looking at these graphics takes me right back to each film and I can play out how he got each mask, the people he killed in order, etc... 

Just awesomely done! &&I love how between the time Jason went to hell and went into space, he got cold and put an extra layer on underneath his tattered jacket. Was that outer jacket somehow emotionally significant? &&Excellent work. Have only seen a couple of these. Was surprised that the max Kill Count was actually that low. Is 22 considered a lot?&&This taught me that nobody likes Friday the 13th, but they still go to see it, so they keep making more. &&These movies have got an amazing ROI&&I think Jason X looks really cool.&&You should do one of these with Freddy... or the Police Academy movies.. you know, for shits and giggles &&I remember Jason Goes to Hell being super creepy because of that eel thing that would go down peoples throats and turn them evil.&&I want this as a poster!&&I always wondered why they kept making these. Always saw a profit. &&Why are there such low scores on II and III? Things only got shitty after III. &&Did you account for inflation in the budget and box-office numbers or are those the numbers reported at the time?

Edit: Also, nice work over all. Would really like to see more of these. Batman would be cool.&&So I've never seen any Friday the 13th movie. Do they ever explain how Jason keeps coming back to life?&&Why would they stop making something so damn profitable? &&I was always fond of Jason movies because I livd about 30 minutes from the old unused boy scout camp where they filmed the original movie. &&Damn. In all these movies, they've never once lost money.&&TIL there is a fuck ton more Jason movies than I ever imagined &&This would work perfectly with the SAW franchise as well&&Well to be fair, at least A New Beginning had a different killer. They just acted and dressed like Jason.&&We just had Final Destination 1, 2, 3 and ""the final"" destination. Then 5. With more planned. Lol&&about face?&&>Guys, it's okay! He just wanted his machete back!

Greatest line in cinematic history.&&I just went and watched this scene based on your comment.  I feel like the fact that I feel confused about whether or not I was watching the right scene means that I was in fact watching the right scene...&&Damn straight! That scene is an unparalleled cinematic achievement.&&That was the best, but when he pulled that girl's face out of the liquid nitrogen and smashed it on the counter was pretty fucking amazing. 

I saw this in the theater, reluctantly, but I wound up loving it way more than I had any right to. &&That's basically the only thing I remember about that movie.&&The whole premise of Jason X still slays me (pun intended) and the kills were inventive.  It's one of my faves.&&If you watch *Jason X* expecting to be scared, I can see why the rating is that low.

If, instead, you watch *Jason X* expecting to be entertained, then the rating should be a hell of a lot higher.  &&I like the whole movie but yeah... that’s definitely the most memorable part besides the boobs from that same part in the movie.&&I'll always say it, Jason X is both the worst and best entry in the series.&&He already did this in part VII though (which, telekinesis nonsense put aside, is one of the best in the franchise) &&The hulk scene with loki in the avengers gave me a dejavu feeling that i knew wasnt a coincidence. &&Out of ALL his kills throughout all his movies and all the years I've watched him, that's the kill I remember. I cried.

""We just looove unprotected sex!""
Is that what they say?&&Isn’t that the same movie with the android love arc where her nipple falls off and make a metallic thunk on the ground? Some cinema treasure there, no sarcasm intended.&&Does no one remember the scene where the robot girl’s nipples fall off? That was brilliant.&&True story that probably only interests me.... Jason X was written by a guy who used to play Everquest.  I didn't know him well or anything but our ""Tank"", a Troll Shadowknight named Waylander grouped with him a lot.  So the dude actually named one of the characters in his movie after him.  Always thought that was kinda cool anyway...&&I actually loved that movie when I was a kid. I got obsessed with Friday The 13th after marathoning 5 of the films. But, I went back and watched Jason X again a few years ago and  it was so bad I may have had a stroke.

Moral of the story: kids have shit tastes in movies, and Jason X is an abortion of a film.&&Haha...the fact that I actually remember this scene truly makes it memorable...&&Did you forget the part where the guy arms his sex robot and says ""I gave her an upload""? That made me cringe my fucking arse off.&&I remember that movie coming on the SciFi channel when I was a kid. I had to look it up because I thought it was a spoof or something. Nope, but I did watch the whole thing and surprisingly Jason on a space ship isn't too bad.&&""Hey, do you want a beer?""
""Or do you want some pot?""
""Or we could have premarital sex?""&&It's even better when you realize that X was made in order to keep the character in people's minds as Freddy vs Jason was being worked at. &&From behind. &&By dicking around a boat for most of the runtime.&&Just before he took Berlin.

But in all seriousness, my main memory is that he had a short kungfu fight which ended with him punching the other guys head off&&I mean he beat the Olympic hopeful Julius in a fair hand to hand boxing match on a rooftop

https://youtu.be/mluutEMR3hs&&I thought that was a joke until I googled it and sure enough, Jason did go to Manhattan. I think I stopped at #3 but had no clue there were that many made.&&With a can do attitude and the Mary Tyler Moore theme song playing on his ipod.&&https://i.imgur.com/MeEb3gL.jpg 


https://i.imgur.com/zhhYYf8.jpg &&>How exactly did he take ~~Manhattan~~?

*Manhatten*&&9/11.&&via boat for 60 minutes of a 90 minute feature&&On Broadway, his dream was to become an actor and in this film he decides to try to stop killing people and live out his dream. &&technically yes, his mother is the murderer in the first part, Jason is only seen in a flashback of sorts. But she still kills 9 people I think.&&>So the only good Friday The 13th film is the one where Jason doesn't kill?

Freddy vs Jason is fucking awesome. Fanservice movie done right.&&It depends on your definition of good, or rather what you want out of a Friday the 13th movie. If you just want to watch Jason year apart teenagers in a over the top and comical fashion, the later movies are very good at that.&&2 4 6 are legitimately good horror movies 

3 is good for a laugh &&2 and 6 are good&&2 is almost as good imo and way scarier. 4 is not terrible either.&&It's too late for me to save face now, but hopefully my Muppet post won't make this same blunder&&This info graphic really pisses me off. So many little mistakes and laziness. 
> Friday the 13th Part: The Final Chapter

Should say Part: IV

> Jason X

> Jason Kill Count: Same as previous

> Budget: Same as previous

What is this shit? It took more effort to write ""same as previous"" than it would to just write the number, but also the previous item is on the line above it making me dance my eyes around the page to find the info.&&What other reason could you possibly imagine? &&They even made them with a year's difference most of them&&Editing in these films go a long way... despite how bad it is. &&Okay, as the budgets go up the revenue goes down, so eventually you would think they would stop making them as the ratio gets smaller. But then 2003 happened. Sure they doubled the budget, but the revenue went up by a factor of 5? What changed? &&I feel like the real reason was they wanted to make 13 of them&&I'm shocked to see how profitable even these terribly rated films are... and they have the gall to get mad if someone pirates it?&&Blumhouse has been making a _killing_ with the low-budget formula.&&And it's still happening. Awful movies and sequels get put out because no matter how bad they can be, people still wanna see it.&&Yeah it was meant to end the franchise. But money. Technically in the sequel, part 5, it wasn't actually Jason doing the killing, just a guy dressed like him. But they quickly reversed that with the next film. &&I grew up deep deep DEEP in the woods as a child, didn't think anything of it. Until one of these movies was my first scary movie, and fucked up my childhood. &&That's awesome! Kane will always be my favorite Jason, even though most of his films were lackluster. I wish he was in FvJ.&&I loved Freddy vs Jason, and miss straight up monster movies. Like, stupid mashing-action-figures-together level Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla shit.&&Awesome stuff! I've been following you since I saw this video originally posted earlier this year. Can't wait to see Freddy dude!&&Ch ch ch ha ha ha&&Congratulations, I've become your 40,435th subscriber.&&When you said stats in the title I was expecting weapon skill, strength, constitution, charisma etc.

Got to admit, a little disappointed.&&That's Jason Goes to Hell, I believe. &&he grunts in that movie absolutely unwatchable &&There's Freddy Krueger at the end of Jason goes to hell, just that makes it a better movie than Manhattan. Manhattan really is a piece of shit in everything it does.  
Well, except the boxing match and the face reveal. &&Jason Goes to Hell is one of the best ones even though it's not Jason's body doing the killing for most of the movie. &&i thought the premise of freddy being the one to resurrect jason was pretty goddamn clever. would have chosen better music and a definitive winner (team jason) but the kills are inventive and the fire+water contrast is a solid theme&&“1, 2, Freddy’s coming for you...” You know why they sing that? Because he’s coming for you.

actual dialogue from the movie .&&I feel FvJ, Jason Lives and Part 4 all deserve fresh ratings, but alas.&&I didn't like how they didn't get Kane Hodder for Jason but still managed to get Englund for Freddy. Ronny Yu is pretty disliked in the F13 fandom for this. Also I get fear is an important factor for Freddy but making it something that Jason has clearly never had a problem with (tons of clips of previous Friday movies were Jason moves in and out of water) was pretty damn lazy even for a slasher flick. Why Mark and Damian still get allowed to write for stuff now is beyond me.

And design wise I didn't like how they made Jason tall, lanky, and super slow (was never that slow in previous movies). The only good thing to come out of it was giving Jason a jacket. Which looked even better in the remake.&&The production quality and execution of scenes are pivotal factors for a movie, and I wouldn’t really assess those highly. &&That's weird. My first thought was surprise that it's considered the third best one. People hated that movie. &&Apparently video game developers don't either...How many Final Fantasy games are there now?&&The best part is that only one year separates the two movies&&Sucks many don't like the 2009 one. I liked it. Stupendous tits.&&Thanks! What did your wife think of the movies?&&My favorite was in part 4 when Crispin Glover is looking for the corkscrew and then Jason stabs his hand with the corkscrew. &&RT ratings are a terrible indicator for the most part for horror movies especially slasher flicks.&&It's really the best in the franchise. Terribly bad in a hilarious self conscious way, and even has a few really cool kills to boot.&&I saw it in the theater. I laughed out loud on more than one occasion and so did other people in the nearly empty theater. It’s not a good movie and it’s not scary but it is funny. The surprise is that *I think* it’s intentionally funny but who knows. Maybe tommy wiseau was part of its writing team.&&Watch it with a few friends and a few beers. Amazing movie.&&yah say what you will about there quality but they all made money&&It's poetic that part 8 got an 8%.  That's how you know it's actually the best one.&&I think the 3D at the time was a little over the top, but now we can look back on that cheesiness as part of the fun&&I think a lot of fans have started to enjoy it more with time, it was somewhat cheesy and satirical in comparison to the first 5 so I think some people at the time were a little sour on it. &&She's alive at the end of part 1 and is in part 2...&&Him grabbing her was a dream/hallucination she had. She dies in the first scene of the 2nd movie &&She comes back in the second &&The criminal part was trying to end the franchise when it still had so much to give us.&&4, 6 and 7 are my go tos. But I'd watch them all in order for a kick.&&3, 4, and 6 are personal favorites.&&1,2,3 and 6 for me are the best ones. Worst ones would be 5 and 8. &&Thanks! I actually have an animation in this same style for Michael Myers here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBpRaXn8Oec 

I'll probably make an info-graphic at some point for him too :)&&https://youtu.be/ykUumpoUNO4

Hope this helps. Saw it on Reddit a while ago. &&Horror is always super cheap to make because the scripts are pretty simple and like you said, a bunch of no names can fill out the cast to be killed.&&So you're saying that woodchipper left you with blue-balls?&&I'll take that as a compliment :)&&Haha thanks, I'm surprised it's gotten as many upvotes as it has. Most things I upload get like 20 upvotes and one guy commenting.&&That should be another stat. Number of gratuitous tit shots. &&I actually couldn't believe the kill counts were so high actually lol. Considering he mostly kills 1 on 1 and uses melee weapons. It's not like he's firing a rocket launcher into a bus full of teenagers or anything. I never really counted them but I would have assumed 8-10 kills per movie!&&A good slasher movie kill is not like a fodder soldier kill in Rambo IV (those can reach very high numbers, 100 or more, a rate of several per minute after the introductory scenes).

In a slasher you need to show the teenager's unsuspecting face as he goes about his teenage business (usually involving trying to get laid), even as the ominous music begins playing, softly at first. Then the killer closes in, slowly and clumsily; suddenly Jason jumps in for the kill. The teen panics, flails about, escapes miraculously, BUT NO! He just tripped on a root, the monster is gaining on him! The machete falls down and slashes his leg, he screams at the top of his lungs, but still manages to get up and to go again, now with a limp. Cut to how nobody heard the scream because the music is too loud at the party. Cut back to the teenager, terrified out of his mind... Who barely makes it out to safety. He won't get killed, not yet. That way, we'll believe there's hope when Jason turns on his next target, for whom a similar scene will be re-enacted (with various interesting variations, like the repetitions of a musical phrase in a fugue); this time ending in a savage decapitation or some other interesting and satisfying conclusion.

Altogether that's 10 minutes of movie, two attacks, lots of set-up and suspense, and in the end only one death. In a 90 minutes movie you've only got room for about 10 such murders, plus a few that are more ""collateral damage"".&&I never knew that until I saw this infographic. Lucky thing they put a bunch of Friday the 13ths on Netflix recently! Time for some research.&&""Roy."" &&Yeah I was going to say the same thing. That wasn’t Jason so.... kill points go to the crazy dude and not Jason. &&They were going to have a new killer don the Hockey mask every movie after Jason was 'dead' in part 5. The end of 5 has a new person as Jason. Then the filmmakers took a poll with fans who wanted Jason back so for part 6 they revived him. 

Kinda like what theyd wanted with Halloween, to have each movie a different killer and plot. Oh well. &&If I recall, movies 2-4 also happened pretty much back to back. I think it's only a period of like 2 weeks at best from start of 2 to the end of 4.&&The final destination films just got worse and worse. Having said that, 3 absolutely terrified me as a kid and it took years before I would even think about getting on a rollercoaster.&&It’s been seven years since the last Final Destination with zero new news about another one. If there are any more I think it would just be a reboot.&&“Final Fantasy 13-2”&&Yeah I mean it was cheesy and crappy but it was self aware so the meta humor brought it up a bit &&Yes.&&Machete don't text. &&""It's gonna take more than that to put down this old dog...""

*stabs again*

""Yeah, that oughtta do it...""&&For me, it's a toss up between this line and FvJ's ""Dude, that goalie was pissed about something!""&&Holy fuck, I forgot that line LMAO&&Damn I just had to do the same thing because of this comment I can completely relate now it looked like something out of a weird low budget scifi movie and it cuts so abruptly, just all around weird.

Edit: [link](https://youtu.be/mF629C5WRqU) for anyone else that wants to momentarily bask in this Cinematic achievement&&I think thisovie benefits from low expectations better than most. I love it, but the idea sounds stupid to most.&&only thing i remember is when the robot kicks his ass and locks him in the room and then its like 'OH NO GUYS WE ACCIDENTALLY LOCKED JASON IN THE UPGRADE ROOM THAT UPGRADES YOU NOW HES GETTING UPGRADED'

and then the room upgraded him. because its the upgrade room. it upgrades you. this is a standard thing in the future apparently.&&[deleted]&&You don't remember the scene where Jason is floating through space towards the escape pod and then the red Power Ranger comes out of nowhere and pile drives his ass into the earth?&&Funny, I don't remember any plot points in Schindler's List aside from a little girl in red.

I think my brain just suppressed all of that movie as self defence mechanism.&&That and the scene where the dude is in a nightgown getting his nipples tweaked by the student. I was 11 and... confused. I thought maybe they were depicting some weird futuristic version of sex, like the seashells in Demolition Man.&&What?? How about Jason getting woken up from his centuries-long slumber by teenage sex? Or the liquid nitrogen face explosion? Honestly the whole movie was amazing.&&still waiting for fast and the furious in space&&What was the premise of Jason X? &&It was a callback.&&Got my keys, heading to a Blockbuster. BRB. &&And then the back alleys of Canada for the later half&&And, if I'm remembering the correct movie, standing beside (like 5 feet away from) a 7 year old kid whose mother is calling him and doesn't comment on the 7 foot tall sea weed encrusted machete wielding hockey mask wearing monster beside him.&&Only not-bad scene of the movie haha. Seriously, Jason Takes Manhattan is the worst. &&Boxer tried boxing him. Took Jason one punch.&&That and kicking those ruffians' boombox &&Jason Makes the Olympic Boxing Team&&In all fairness it is kind of a joke. Like the first three or four or so were legitimate horror movies, or tried to be, but then they devolved into being gruesome camp. Like you go to see a Jason movie for the outrageous, over the top deaths, and it's all a little tongue in cheek.

They *really* leaned into it in the newest remake, which is my favorite one. It's practically half comedy, if you're willing to accept that bizarre outlandish deaths can be funny. &&You should watch them. They're fun movies.&&[deleted]&&Wow. As famous as Jason is I had no idea the original wasn't even about him.&&damn dude, spoilers.  it's only been 38 years. not all of us have had a chance to see it yet. &&Why is Jason black in some of the movies? &&Technically he didn't kill in one of the middle ones, right? It was just some guy pretending to be him?&&I think it was his mother all along but he still drags the final survivor into the lake.&&Idk I think Jason Lives is pretty dope&&Loved that movie. My only regret is that they didn't give Freddy more kills. I loved seeing Robert Englund being hammy and over the top with the kills in the sequels.&&I still really wish Kane played Jason in that. 
Edit:  Kane Hodder, who played Jason in parts 7-10. Not the Undertaker's brother.  &&Exactly. None of the films are truly ""good"" they're violent slashers. Jason is infamous for his iconic image, not because his films are great.&&Well a movie is only good if rotten tomatoes tells me it’s a tomato and not a splat. Duh. /s&&That's the one where he's in the halfway house right? Geez that was a rough one. Or was that 5? I can't remember. Every other one sucked.&&3 is the best imo, and i thought 2 sucked.  4 and 6 are greats, agreed&&I watched all of them over the course of a week with a friend in college. Much alcohol was consumed, and it was determined that 6 was by far the best. 1 was revolutionary, but other than that it's just alright. 2-5 kinda added a bit of lore and created the tropes. Then 6 comes along and makes it all a big fun gorey joke. That opening kill had me in stitches.

Basically, 1-5 are the setup and 6 is the punchline. Everything after that is taking the joke too far.&&Jesus, how many people did the Muppets kill?&&Don't forget ""Part: the last one""&&Here’s to hoping your Moppats post goes better!&&The director has always wanted to tell the story of a guy that gets killed in an outhouse. &&Creative freedom, of course. &&As famous as they are I'm actually a little surprised they're not higher budget/higher box office.

Like if you had asked me, I would've assumed they were typically around $30mil to make and brought in around $50mil and made just enough in DVD sales to justify them eventually making another. (in today's money) &&A passion for making timeless classics? A thirst for making cinema magic that can only be quenched by spamming movies? &&Freddy vs. Jason happened. Crossover appeal & whatnot.&&Every so often, the director is like, ""Alright, call it Friday the 13th: The Final Friday/The End/The Final Chapter/Jason No More/The Finale. That'll let everybody know that there shouldn't be any more movies.""

Then a new director shows up and says, ""Let's bring Jason back somehow. Time travel? Friday The 13th: Jason Takes Time""&&I grew in the deep suburbs and after seeing my first one of these I was convinced Jason lived in the aluminum lawn shed in the backyard. For weeks I left the backyard patio light on because some kind of childhood logic convinced me that he couldn't come out of the shed if the light was on. &&It was such a let down that it wasn't Kane.  Kane IS Jason in my mind.  He brought so much to the character just from his body mannerisms, the way he would hold his head, how he walked, even how he breathed.   He was the perfect Jason.  Haha good thing I haven't met him (yet)..talk about fanboy lol.   &&Thanks man! I'm working on him, damn real jobs are slowing me down&&Yep. Director wanted to integrate Jason with the Evil Dead franchise by making him a deadite... so he did.&&Correctomundo &&So so much grunting, the opening scene is bonkers haha. But the female detective was something in that opening&&I like the reveal/retcon (I mean, the original sort of had it, but then it was mostly ignored) that it's fear and belief that powers Freddy. Not only does it give him a good reason to get involved with Jason, but it explains some of his franchise's weirder moments.

Like why he seemed to perish at the end of Nightmare 1, only to attack one last time, yet Nancy is alive in Nightmare 3; he can visit the dreams of those who know about him, but wasn't strong enough to kill after she took the fear away, same way he couldn't kill that guy in FvJ until Jason made more people fear him. So the dream at the end of Nightmare 1 happened, but wasn't real enough to be lethal.

Or why he possessed Jesse in Nightmare 2 to kill a bunch of randos despite that being against his usual MO. Appearing in public and terrifying dozens of people made him strong enough to start stalking dreams again in Nightmare 3. 

Even the extremely goofy weirdness of Nightmare 6 makes some sense if you assume the reason Springwood is completely isolated, despite a town with all the kids dead and all adults insane seeming like it would be newsworthy, was because the adults realized (before losing their minds at least) that they had to basically quarantine the town because if knowledge of Freddy got out, *he* would get out.

Honestly, for a series as silly as ANoES could be some times, that's pretty solid worldbuilding.&&They should have kept going. Chucky vs Leatherface? Candyman vs Pinhead?&&> a definitive winner (team jason)

I remember feeling so hyped when the ""winner"" was revealed after the battle... only to have it negated seconds later. I understood the *why* of it, but it still deflated me a bit walking out of that theater.&&also discount jay and silent bob lol&&Are you trying to tell me the nu metal soundtrack hasn't aged well? &&Whoever wrote that film obviously understood both characters.  

Freddy's motivation made sense.  The people in and around Elm Street forgot about him, and his his powers were fed by fear, he lost his mojo.  

His plan made a lot of sense, too.  Without his mojo, he couldn't brutalize anybody in their dreams.  So instead, he manipulated Jason to kill the people of Elm Street, which would remind them of Freddy and thus reinvigorate his powers.  

Meanwhile, Jason's behavior made a lot of sense, as well.  Once he starts killin', nobody can stop him, not even Freddy.  That pissed Freddy off, which set up the blood match, beautifully.

I think *Freddy vs. Jason* is one of the most well-written horror movies, or at least one of the most well-written of campy horror movies.  The setup is more complex than most, yet the overall film is very straight forward.  And like I said, the motivations and the actions of the two stars definitely fit each one.&&I always saw it as Jason wins in the physical realm, but Freddy will always win in the nightmare realm because he can prey on your fears and use them against you and there's almost no fighting back because he's using your own mind against you.&&Yeah I think he is being sarcastic because it's really bad&&/r/moviedetails mvp here&&While we're at it, Part 2 was alot of fun. 

Edit: consider posting this on /r/horror. They'll love it there!&&Agreed, those and the first are the ones I throw on when I want to have a fun summer evening. &&> but making it something that Jason has clearly never had a problem with (tons of clips of previous Friday movies were Jason moves in and out of water) was pretty damn lazy

Actually Jason was only scared of water in the dreams. &&This sounds like an out of touch Seinfeld joke.

""Final Fantasy 15? Is it Final or is it 15?""&&The name derives from the director of the series. He made many games that flopped. He decided he wanted to make one more game, and if it did bad, he was going to stop game development and go back to school. That was Final Fantasy 1 :)&&I don't really even get why a lot of people didn't really like it. I mean I get the weird part about the girl reminding him of his mom but that isn't even that far of an ass pull as part 9's demon spirit. Hell it even went back to it's non paranormal roots with him being a malformed hunter type survivalist who has burrows all over camp. It even has cool kills. Some people just don't like fresh takes on stuff I guess.&&Absolutely stupendous.&&Welcome!

She thought the first one was perfect; campy and easy to follow. She's not able to handle today's horror well.

Friday (2009), she liked the cast (Jared Padalecki) and thought it was a good second movie to watch for the uninitiated horror noob. &&Liquid nitrogen ftw.&&> say what you will about there quality but they all made money

Just like any other good, cheap whore
&&No clue why they spent so much on Jason x though when it made about the same as the few before it. &&I only remember a part with a baseball bat and about 15 seconds of yoyo action. You take that out and the movie is 45 seconds shorter max.  It's less than the 3D gimmicks in Hondo (1953) which is considered a classic. &&True. It aged better because of this. It was doing what scream would end up doing years later. 6 is probably my favorite Friday movie. &&Plus it's never truly known if she was hallucinating that or if it was a memory.&&And we are supposed to somehow believe that a murderous mongoloid who has grown up in the woods somehow tracked Alice down, travelled there and murdered her?&&You and your art are awesome! Thank you for sharing your work with us.&&Thank you for this. 

Answered my question direct and also led me to an even more fascinating [video interview with the head of BlumHouse productions who had even more to say on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp3BRbdArxw)&&Yes!  Most underused Chekov's Wood Chipper in cinematic history!&&Really? In argentina we only have two the remake and i think part6&&[Roy without the mask](https://i.imgur.com/3FF5qwF.jpg)&&So that's what Rick did after taking Roy off the grid.&&That's why in this infographic, they go to the crazy dude, and not Jason.&&And what they tried with Scream before deciding to only change the killer.&&The last Final Destination film did have a very good ending to tie the series up if I remember correctly.&&Omg is that the one with the tanning bed death? That freaked me out from ever going tanning...I mean besides skin cancer&&Final Destination origin time?

The Pre-cursed Final Destination &&the writers of the movie: exactly! that's totally what we were going for , you nailed it! *laughing nervously*&&The nudity was cut out.&&Damn Jason on Thot patrol 24/7&&Smoke some P A H&&Top tier porno scene &&Wtf people post that Catwoman basketball scene like every day, but no ones posting this scene all the time? I feel robbed for not having seen it earlier&&Feels like I'm watching an Old Spice commercial&&It reminds of of Robot Chicken for some reason.&&You're right. After hearing the premise I was like...wat? After seeing the movie I was like...this is fantastic. 

I would normally be mad at this type of movie getting greenlit but I'm glad these producers had this vision. &&Somebody’s got their hater pants on&&What did he get upgrayedded to?&&I mean I don't hold it against him. I was playing a game called SCP: Secret Laboratory where you and other players try to escape an underground facility full of paranormal horrors and the like. We locked a bunch of zombies and the monster that makes zombies in with a paranormal machine that upgrades things. Well eventually one of the security guys opened the room and instead of zombies coming out a fuckton of the monsters that make zombies came out instead. Turns out the zombie players realized they could upgrade themselves while they were in there. &&aw fuk LMAO&&Usually one of the top 3 Jason kills on horror forums.&&""I am invincible!""

Wait, wrong movie.&&Holy shit. Maybe I kinda do remember that part... &&And the guy that does it is the guy who got Sparta kicked into the well in 300.&&I cried laughing. The best part. &&I thought I was the only one. I remember having to watch that twice in school, and for the life of me I can't remember a single detail other than Schlinder had a factory of sorts and had Jews working there and he saved a bunch of Jews.&&In the present the government has captured Jason and is trying to study his regenerating ability, but the head scientist decides he’s too dangerous to keep around so they freeze him in a cryogenic lab under Crystal lake. 

Hundreds of years later science researchers find the frozen Jason while exploring earth which has been abandoned. They take him on their ship into space and the movie proceeds as expected: Jason becomes an undead half cyborg killing machine. &&Jason in space&&Grab some tacos!&&You drive a DeLorean?&&Nothing screams Manhattan like Vancouver's west side and rooftop punching.&&It was supposed to be set in New York in the late 80s. There were a lot of seaweed encrusted, machete wielding, hockey mask wearing monsters walking around. Especially around Times Square.&&Jason Goes to Hell would like a word with you. &&Jet fuel can't melt Jason's machete.&&He was the reason his mother was killing, because he drowned at Camp Crystal Lake and she was getting revenge. But then in the second he's alive some how and getting revenge for his mother who was killed in the first part. 

It's a real chicken and the egg thing.&&That fact was a plot point for the cold open of Scream - Drew Barrymore got the answer wrong and her boyfriend got killed for it.&&Yep. Another fun fact. He doesn't get his famous mask until the 3rd movie.&&You haven't seen Scream?!&&I can't believe the nerve of some people to spoil a movie so soon after it comes out. some people are just true assholes&&Some people here were not alive when that came out and could potentially be in the class that would be affected by spoilers. I know that older media is probably gonna be spoiled because of its pervasiveness in pop culture and I think spoilers like that are fair game, but the argument that people have had enough time to see it is silly. We make new people like all the time. It's one of the things we do best&&Jason's mother being the killer was spoiled in the movie Scream, and that movie was twenty years ago.  It's pretty much public domain information.  &&Because he’s brought back as a rotted zombie in Jason Lives. &&I can't remember which one it is, but it might've been the one in the graphic titled ""Friday the 13th: A New Beginning"" which also has ""Roy Kill Count"" rather than ""Jason Kill Count"". Just maybe.&&Yeah, a dude named Roy.&&I remember this too. I think it was either 3 or 4; it was a copycat that was obsessed with Jason.&&That was a dream&&I don't know that I would be against Kane the wrestler playing Jason. He's got the right build and experience acting non-verbally and through a mask.&&5 was the halfway house with fake Jason. 3 had the awful 3D gags and the unexplained disco theme music. &&6 was a masterful redirection, full of meta humour and poking fun at the slasher genre whilst still being a fun and inventive slasher in its own right

...then 7 dropped absolutely everything from 6 except zombie Jason, added a psychic protagonist in the lead character and then took itself way, way too seriously.

8 tried to bring the goofiness and fun back (the uppercut kill is a classic) but did a really piss poor job of it for the most part.&&So many... So, so many. &&It ain't easy being green, but it's surprisingly easy to hide bodies in the swamp.&&Dead snow is a movie for you!&&There is a Jason movie where that happens, actually. &&“This shitbox is gross!”&&Ooooo baby ooooo baby&&After that you can just reboot.&&Grew up in the deep suburbs.... Right next to the ""Elm Street"" that the movie was named after. That fact did not help and easily frightened child. &&But Jason never hurt kids. Now once you were ready to drink/smoke/fuck, that's when you were in trouble.&&But... why would you want that? I swear to god Jason and Michael have gotten the worst ret conned back stories/origin stories&&How did I not know this... 

I really do hate that movie so that’s probably why &&she certainly didn’t defecate like I would’ve &&Here's the plan guys, all 20 of us will hide in the bushes.  When Jason comes out and stands directly in the middle of our perfect circle of gunfire, we will all open fire with automatic weapons.  To make it more interesting 6 guys will repel down from trees firing all the way down.  Then, if we haven't killed each other with crossfire, we'll send down a cruise missile right in the center!


btw this movie is on youtube in full.. kinda weird.


&&Candyman grunts and it's terrifying.  That movie should never have had a sequel.  It's a self-contained love story.&&Haha I'm working on an animation/illustrations about Freddy next and your totally right, even though each movie works on it's own and tends to somewhat ignore certain things in previous films, it seems to have somewhat of a cohesiveness that carries the series.&&Chucky wins, hands down. Cunning supernatural serial killer doll over a mentally deficient backwoods hillbilly with a chainsaw. 
Although, leather face does have a crew. Which is part of my argument below so maybe not so hands down on Chucky.

I don't remember enough about candyman, but pinhead has a whole crew, I'd put my money on the demon form hell with some heavy hitting back up over a guy that terrorized the worst project in Chicago with bees.&&There were rumors at the time of a Freddy vs Jason vs Ash but that obviously never materialized. &&Terminator vs. Robocop.&&Chucky vs Leprechaun is what I always wanted. &&I always though Jason vs Michael made the most sense, even more than vs Freddy.  Hear me out;  Going from the H2O timeline, you just need to have John go camping with some friends at Crystal Lake.  Michael follows (to kill John) and Jason does what he does.  No  need for a convoluted story to get them to fight each other, just have Michael stop Jason just as he's about to kill John.  Jason just wants to kill him just because he's there.  Michael won't let him because killing his family is 'his' job, not anyone else's.  The lore, and motivations of each character are so easy to bring together naturally.  The only issue is they're both silent haha.  &&Jason kicked Freddy's ass.  In terms of kills Freddy only had one that entire film. &&My problem with FvJ is at no point in the Friday series is Jason ever afraid of water and even has a few water centric kills (from under the raft in part 3) and yet in FvJ, fear of water is a major plot point in the final battle, only to again be thrown away at the very end as Jason’s house is in a swamp. &&don't think so, it was the serious blonde dude who said it lol . when the main girl has the fits in the hallway at school .&&They thought it would be a bigger hit, setting it in space, special effects, ""cool"" new concept. But things fell short.&&Costs can be incremental and blow past budgets.

Crew: ""Pls more funding to finish movie only halfway done and we ran out :[""

Executives: "">:(""&&Yeah I agree with you. People always seem really hung up on the 3D gimmicks in this movie as if they were half the runtime or something. I never understood that. Its one of the better friday movies if you ask me. &&I always thought it was an hallucination, meaning she would be the next to die - the first to die in the second film.&&Yep.&&Good point. He doesn't become supernatural until a couple of movies in...

People don't realise that before that he's just a terribly malformed freak who never actually drowned in crystal lake. (If someone's only seen Freddy vs Jason)&&Just had a look, seems we have the 4th, 5th 6th and 7th ones in Canada. Not the best, but still pretty cool.&&And somehow I missed that >_<&&That was the only thing I liked about it, tbh. I think the characters were unlikable and bland, but having it as a prequel tied into death clearing up the loose ends, and brought the series full circle. That was pretty cool!&&What happened?&&Extended Final Destination, where people slowly die from cancer and lose feet to diabetes.&&In this one you find out that it isn't really Death going after people, but William Bludworth's murdered grampa who had a knack building Rube Goldberg machines. &&The First Destinstion would be an ok title name for a prequel &&It was a terrible film but the self referential jokes made me chuckle at least &&Ya I figured something was up I thought it might just be the movie cut to a different scene following some other characters then cut back Jason killing them.&&It feels more hilarious this way. I watched it with the sound off, so I can't speak to that, but that abrupt cut killed me.&&Jason has always been the real thot patrol since day one.&&If i remember right, those women arent real and hes in a simulation or something.  It was a hilarious scene because he stopped what he was doing to kill his more traditional prey, like he couldnt help himself.&&Replace Jason with a Sasquatch and you get a jack links commercial.&&well you better be careful which room you shove me into because i might end up with titanium cybernetic hater pants.

then i will HATE THE EVER LIVING SHIT OUT OF YOU.

And doesn't die.&&Thank you!!!  Minus a few scenes and a few good characters, 9 is by far the worst and least F13 of them all. &&Yeah his mother killed camp counselors because other camp counselors were fornicating instead of saving a drowning boy. And I guess he was under the water forever and then came to life and pulled the girl underwater, then came back in the second movie like 20 years later or something to kill camp counselors because they killed his mother. It's like an inverse Romeo and Juliet&&I think he's like a revenge/hate powered zombie after the first movie. Maybe he's just a freak that heard the story and decided to put on the mask.   
  
It's kind of better that they don't explain too much. &&Jason is a Revenant. There, explained!&&This was the movie where the ""teenagers being killed during sexual adventures"" trope was *created,* and it's still the only time it ever made sense. Jason died while the camp counselors were screwing around, and his mom got revenge.&&Nominally.   
  
I kind of think that if she'd got the right answer they wouldn't have just gone ""Shit. That's right. Guess we'll just go home... I mean... guess *I'll* just go home. Yup. Just the one of me here...""&&That one pissed me off! It took too long for me to get excited!&&> We make new people like all the time. It’s one of the things we do best

Bride of Chucky and I think there might have been others that worked with him. But I personally would rather see Chucky vs Leprechaun.&&It technically did materialize, just as a comic book. As for its quality, well, I've read worse.&&Yeah, Robert Englund was very excited to do it, but executives got pissy because Ash was ultimately the winner and killed the project.

Bit meta though, Nightmare and Friday are pretty well dead franchises (Though we'll have to see how Blumhouses^tm Halloween turns out.) but Evil Dead is still going with its TV Show. So in a way...&&Ash would just use his Pikachu and electricute them both. Not even a fair fight really. &&Termimator vs. Predator, I had many a argument in middle school about who would win that (T1000 all the way)&&Terminator period.&&Yep. Freddy may have survived, but Jason won.&&I see what you mean.  But I was cool with it, because the fear only affected Jason when he was trapped in a nightmare, which is, of course, Freddy's home turf.  Once Jason was back in the real world - where he's an emotionless, unstoppable killing machine - he was no longer afraid of water, and also no longer afraid of Freddy.&&Haha no I mean the guy you were replying to&&>Its one of the better friday movies if you ask me.


I've only got through 4 of them so far but it has everything you want. &&Oh well i take any classic one over the remake&&It's all good. I actually forgot it wasn't Jason in that movie, so when i was reading the kill counts in this infographic i was like ""Roy? Who the fuck is Roy?""&&Well we were able to get this great music video featuring the cast acting as saved by the bell characters dying in final destination fashion https://youtu.be/_lNEQAXX43g &&Honestly, I don't remember any of the characters. Were they the generic teen slasher movie archetypes? The good boy/girl, the jock, the slut, the nerd, etc. I pretty much watch it for the same reason as Saw, creative deaths. &&The group of teenagers in the last Final Destination film goes through the same thing as the other movies, somehow escaped death in the beginning and got killed off 1 by 1 over the course of the movie until the main protagonists are left. At the end of the movie, the main protagonists board the Flight 180, and overhears someone having a vision that the plane was going to blowup but it was too late for them to leave, setting off the events in the first movie.

One thing I should mention, this movie was not marketed to be a prequel in any shape or form, the twist came out of nowhere.&&Plot twist: that’s why people get cancer and diabetes &&Here's the scene without the weird cut. 

NSFW 

https://youtu.be/GWMWMI8YaeQ&&I.. I want cybernetic titanium haterpants. They sound awesome.&&In my head I'm hearing Peter Dinklage sing ""titanium cybernetic hater pants.""&&

When suddenly you see the most hateful pants you've ever seen

And even though you know

All your karma's gonna go

You have to have the worlds worst pants!&&Correct you are!&&And then Jason punches his head off. Incredible.&&He didn't come back to life, he survived the drowning and fended for himself in the woods for years and ended up happening to witness his mom being killed which set him off. He was a normal human being until part 4 where he officially died and then came back to life in part 6.&&Him pulling the girl underwater was just her having a nightmare&&So in a way, Jason had a brief role as a hero figure...and then went nuts for 10 more films?

I remember watching the first couple and thinking they were scary.  Never even knew some of the later one existed.  I can't imagine Jason in Manhattan...lol.&&Nah, he was human in parts 2-4, then he died at the end of 4 and came back in 6 as an actual zombie.&&If you read the *Freddy vs Jason vs Ash* comic based on the unused script for an *FvJ* sequel, Pamela Vorhees tried to ressurect Jason after he drowned using the Necronomicon (which was seen in the Vorhees house in *Jason Goes To Hell*), where he became a deadite vengeance demon.&&But he isn't until part 6.&&Friday the 13th was using a well established trope...

Black Christmas, Last House on The Left, The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween all came out in the 70s, as did a billion Italian movies with similar themes. 

Even Peeping Tom from 1960 had a killer hunting down prostitutes, which isn’t exactly the same, but it’s fairly close. &&That's right. Blondie. &&Actually ar least one serial killer had weird rules like that in real life. He checked random doors, if they were locked he would move on, if they would be inlocked he would enter and kill the sleeping persons. Ofcourse that was just one of the ""rituals"" he killed people, he had no problem ising the more ""standard""  one likes abducting girls etc.

Cant remember the name though.


EDit: [Richard Chase]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chase?wprov=sfla1) was at least one that I found that did this, but I am pretty sure he wasnt the only one.&&Burlap sack Jason is so much better though &&I make new people all the time, one of the things I do best&&I am all making new people all the time.&&That's Final Friday (after they blow him up at the beginning of the movie).&&So, Rick's playthrough of Roy had him going on a murder spree until he himself was killed in that save file?

My new fan cannon&&You stupid ass fart saving carpet store motherfucker.&&Oh god the yo-yo going toward the camera over and over again&&He said kill, not rape&&Just spend a good 45 mins on this sub I'm pretty disappointed in myself &&The villains that, if people had sense, could be punted across the room when they get threatening.&&Indeed he has a crew, besides Tiffany there’s also their child Glen/Glenda. Whilst Glen is meek and a pacifist his alter ego Glenda has no such reservations about killing &&Fuck yea! That would be sweet as fuck.&&You both make great points. Who can Mike M fight?&&>It technically did materialize, just as a comic book. As for its quality, well, I've read worse.

It's because there's no point having Ash in a medium where you can't also make full use of Bruce Campbell's talent.&&Um in one of the movies Jason is brought back to life by having his grave struck by lightning so I don't think it's so clear cut. &&I dunno man, there’s no reason to think the plasma castor couldn’t track him, I don’t imagine even the T1000 could survive a shot from that. Even if he only downed him with one shot and then had to finish him off. Though I guess predators desperate need for trophies might come into play...&&It made for a pretty badass comic book at the time.&&I wish that I was your friend in middle school :/ &&Terminator 2 vs. Robocop 2.&&lol, oopsie daisy . 😅&&I like the remake over some of the classics though. It wasnt even bad and the fresh take on it was better than part 9 and 8 by a long shot.&&That tune is catchy af. &&The credits are great. “Graham Reaper” and “Lou Sifer”&&This is amazing. As always, the real gold is in the comments&&Well now I need a final destination high&&No, in fact, most of them weren't even teens. I just remember them all being assholes and I didn't really care if they died. In contrast, I remember in the first Final Destination I was sad when Todd died in the bath, and I was really rooting for Alex and Clear to get out alive. Same with a few characters in the second (the stoner guy, the cop, the black guy who rode the motorbike, and the main girl) and third (the main couple).&&Yeah its weird because it's called Final Destination 5. It's predecessor's title, The Final Destination, would have made more sense.&&Didn't Saw do the exact same thing with one of their movies? &&""or do you wanna have premarital sex? We love premarital sex!""

Pure scriptwriting brilliance &&Thanks I appreciate it much better and still just as weird&&YT is doing tits now? Alright&&Nudity on Youtube?&&Everybody’s talking about MY haterpants.&&I got the socks and skull cap, can't wait for the pants man so pumped.&&Right you are, Ken! &&I remember thinking that was the funniest thing I'd ever seen at the time. My friend and I rewound the punch so many times there was noticeable degradation on the tape. &&So as someone who's never watched any of these movies let me see if I've got this right. He started as a kid who was supposed to be dead but wasn't and saved the main character from his own murderous mother, then when he saw his mother die became a psycho killer himself, then eventually was killed and became a zombie, then at some point turned into a t-9000 with half its skin melted off, then later became a normal, non-zombie psycho killer again?

...Well, I can see why this franchise is so popular.&&I'm not so sure. She was damn sure he pulled her under. The cops just said they never found anyone else, to which she replied ""then he's still out there.""&&Jason Takes Manhattan is more like Jason on a boat. They couldn't exactly afford Manhattan or any city that could double for Manhattan&&So he just didn't drown as a kid or what?&&These movies were a mess canonically, like all 80s horror franchises. Just gotta have fun with it. &&To be fair, the villain in Friday the 13th was created because of teenage negligence, rather than just featured in the movie. &&Even *Psycho* involved a murder after the victim undressed.&&I'll agree it was much creepier, but hockey mask is iconic.&&Send Igor my regards.&&aka Jason Goes To Hell&&Thought it was Freaky Friday&&Pretty sure that's how they beat Chucky in the first one. The mom punts him into a fireplace.&&Mike Myers? That’s tough. Depending on which Halloween we base him off he’s either just a dude that can’t run if you’re looking at him or basically a demon. For human Mike I’d say one of the Ghostface killers from Scream. One of the first slasher movie killers versus one he inspired. For supernatural Mike I’d say go weird with it and put him against someone like Pumpkinhead. Demon for a demon.&&I wsih I had more than one frined in middle school :/&&Tehe!&&Remake Jason is quick and brutal. The plot is not very good but the Jason action is top notch. &&I didn't realize that the remake had a budget of 19 million but made over 90, not sure why they are not trying to make more especially with the 80's nostalgia going on.&&I will watch it again someday, try to give it another chance&&Saw's timeline needs a damn college course it's so complicated.&&In this scene, Jason is trapped in a VR simulation. That's why it's so cheesy. The rest of the movie is still pretty cheesy, though.&&My favorite part is where non-descript set of boobs #2 goes to get in the sleeping bag and totally fails it.&&/r/YouTubeTitties&&Take em off...with your teeth.&&I believe they call that Fast Times syndrome.&&No, he doesn't save the main character. He's never seen in the first movie except at the end with the jumpscares. And nah, Jason X and Freddy VS Jason aren't really connected in any way except in having Jason in them. &&psycho killer!!!’ Run run run run run away!!! Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba&&The second movie took place 5 years after the first. ""Jason"" still looked like a child in that ending sequence. In the sequel he's a full grown adult, meaning it had to be a dream.

One thing for sure, they never found a body in the lake.&&Shit scared the crap out of me first time I watched it.&&He didn’t die as a kid. He was a living man in 2-4 that could be killed. &&That's the likely explanation yes. He fell in the lake but didn't drown.&&FTFY Eyegor. Put Ze candle beck&&[I only make robot dinosaurs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dY-kACvfgc)&&It was a VR simulation intended to distract him as well, so they just loaded up the exact thing that would distract a classic trope horror villain like Jason. &&I feel like I was watching a comedy sketch. &&Subscribed&&So that we can have premarital sex? I love premarital sex!
&&Yeah it was a little confusing with the way they did the beginning of part 2. I remember someone saying ""he would be grown up by now"" or something along those lines.&&5 years before he was an adult, he looked like a child, so it had to be a dream?&&To be fair, part 1 was supposed to be it. Sean Cunningham hated the idea of Jason being the killer in part 2 and didn't want anything to really do with it, and didn't even return to deal with Friday the 13th much until part 9, which is the one about the weird body snatcher Jason. &&That looks so fucking terrible it must be amazing.&&Future horror movie victims?&&I mean to be honest I woulda been distracted by 2 women naked sayin they love pre martial sex and I’m not even a villain!&&This scene was intended to be this way.&&That's the point.&&Jenny is the best.&&That's near the middle part of part 2 when they are all in the bar and they are all drunk making fun of ~~Chris Higgins~~ Ginny Field (the survivor girl from 2) for saying she thought there was more to the Jason mythos than they thought. 

I believe you're thinking of the recap at the beginning of part 3 which is confusing because they kinda splice in parts from the recap at the beginning of part 2 in it and parts of part 2.

Edited due to brain fart. Just watched these yesterday too.&&At least it was intended to be a dream. Kid Jason drowned 2 decades before the first movie took place.&&Oh yea it’s definitely a retcon but it’s canon. &&The body snatcher thing was a travesty. However, the opening sequence when the government blows him to bloody hell was awesome. 

I've always asked myself the question ""If there are so many gruesome murders here, shouldn't someone be looking into this?"" And they did. And they blew him up easy peasy.&&",2018-04-14 00:11:52
