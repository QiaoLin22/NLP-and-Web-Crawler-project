I think Reddit might explode. &&The nicest man who ever lived being played by the nicest man currently living. Great casting. &&I hope the first trailer is a recreation of the the intro. &&https://imgur.com/tUX0HXo Contrast photo. 

He looks really good and I think this will be great. But I think the hair is a little too gray, unless he's going for Rogers towards the very end of his run, in which case it needs the glasses.&&Honestly i think he is the perfect person for this. Hes a fantastic actor. Very well respected. He plays the parts he takes with such passion. I'm happy with this. &&We need this right now.&&Well this is gonna make me fucking cry.&&YOU ARE MY FRIEND

AA

Ano hi no yume

Ima Demo mada wasuteretenain Dashou?&&I’m gonna be honest and say I don’t see it. They’re both incredibly nice seeming men but beyond that and Tom Hanks being white I don’t really see him as Fred. &&I don't doubt the mans acting chops in the slightest, but as of right now after viewing this image, I'm not sure that I'm buying Hanks as Mr. Rogers. Doesn't quite look right&&Look son, it's the greatest human being ever to exist :) &&""Ok casting director. We need someone to play a super wholesome real life individual.'

""I mean, Tom Hanks is the obvious start.""

""Yeah, let's go with him.""&&Ever since I was a teenager people have said that I look like tom hanks. He’s much older than me but through the years I have slowly morphed into his older form. This is just a picture of me from the future as an old man living in my trailer&&I'm not American. This thread has me totally baffled.&&i wonder if he lost weight to 143 lbs like the real Mister Roger. Kinda doesn’t look it.&&This movie is gonna be so pure&&They made him lose a lot of weight.  Still doesn't look right for the role.&&This is creepy looking, its like buffalo bills version of mr rogers&&Tom Hanks won't rest until he's played every man in history &&First Walt Disney, now Mr. Rogers. If he plays Jim Henson next, my life will be complete.&&Won't be a popular opinion but I hope he pulls it off because I just don't see it. It just looks like Tom Hanks with grey hair. &&He looks the part but I think it might be a bad choice. I wont be able to watch it and think of Mr Rogers. It'll just be Tom Hanks.&&I don't agree. I don't want a bio pic on Fred Rogers. This dude is special to me and his demeanor is so uniquely his own. Watch the recent documentary on him and that's all you'll need.&&Couldn't there be a decent actor out there that at least has some of the same facial bone structure as Fred? This picture is hilarious to me.&&I honestly did a double take. I had my doubts before but not anymore. Hanks is going to be magical. &&I just don't see him as Mr. Rogers at all&&this is making me think of ""The Burbs"" for some reason.

like with Tom Hanks as Mister Rogers but in that same movie with that dark twist.  

""He's your neighbor, in a strange land""&&Some odd reason Tom hanks looks like a creep here&&As much as I love Tom Hanks, I really don't see even the tiniest bit of resemblance. I understand that similar looks isn't the most important thing, but there has to be *some* resemblance. Hopefully his performance will mostly make up for it.&&I think Tom Hanks is an excellent actor and enjoy almost all of his movies. Despite that I wish he was not chosen for this role. When I watch this film I will see Tom Hanks and his twist on Mister Rodgers. It may be impossible but I would have loved for Mister Rodgers to be cast as a not so famous actor or a young emerging actor that portrays him as he was, not the actor that portrays him.&&such a class act&&One of my favorite actors playing one of my favorite people.  &&Tom Hanks stars in who gives a fuck&&Another one?

Now its just milking.&&This was my introduction to Mr. Rogers a few years back. I watch this video a few times a year specially when life hits hard. Thought appropiate to share this with you guys.  Have an excellent day, neighbors!

https://youtu.be/fKy7ljRr0AA
&&Not my Mr. Rogers dammit&&Wouldn't it be amazing if he played younger Rodger in this movie? &&TIL that guy is Tom Hanks son.&&What ever happened to his rapper son? &&Can’t wait until Collin plays his dad in the Tom Hanks movie!&&I just realized Colin Hanks is Tom Hanks' son&&Somebody's poisoned the Neighborhood of Make-Believe&&Snakes oir oir neighbors too.&&Where's Kevin Durant&&[deleted]&&I'm not sold until Hanks weighs 143lbs  &&I gotta disagree. I don't think he looks anything like Mr. Rogers. There's just way too much Tom Hanks there. &&If he does anywhere nearly as well as he did in “sully”, it’ll be wonderful &&He’s going to have to walk a fine line to avoid sounding like Forrest Gump&&Did you watch the documentary? &&100% chance of tears just from this picture.  I mean, damn.  We need Mister Rogers right now.  Tom Hanks is perfect casting.&&Hello boys and girls of Reddit. Today I'm going to talk to you about exploding.

Do you like to watch explosions? I do. Have you ever seen a big fireworks display? All the colours and lights? I think that can be a lot of fun. Some go way up, and some make a big bang, and some look like flashbulbs!

But that's a firework exploding. That's not a person exploding.

When a person explodes because they're happy, it's wonderful. But sometimes people explode because they're really mad. And they might say or do things that make other people sad. They might even accidentally hurt other people too. They might not mean to, but sometimes it happens.

That's why it's important to think about what's making us get a little crazy and explode. Is is a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan explosion where lots of people fight a lot? Or a Tom Hanks Mister Rogers explosion where everyone is happy and really wants to feel good about something? 

Which do you like? I like the second one. And I hope you come and see my movie.

Now let's meet our special guest today...&&all we need now is a cameo by Will Ferrell playing Bob Ross&&You say that like it's a bad thing!&&I'd also like to see Hanks in some edgier roles, not always in the America's dad role like in recent years. &&Next up, Tom Hanks as Neil deGrasse Tyson.&&This movie is going to be concentrated wholesomeness. I imagine it'll be hard to watch without a smile.&&Tom Hanks is wholesomeness incarnate, he’s the best choice to play Mister Rogers. &&God, I hope Tom Hanks doesn't have any skeletons in his closet. Please, please, please God, please. Please. No skeletons. Please. &&If I found out Tom Hanks punched a 100 year old lady in the face, I'd only wonder what she did to deserve it.&&Wonder if Fox News will [call Mr Rogers evil again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5JkzyGXJ2w) in their review.&&Why does everyone think Tom Hanks is so nice? I'm not saying he's not nice ... but there's a lot of nice people out there. But I'm not sure how he got the crown of Nice.  Are there a lot of stories of him being nice to fans, or something he did that made him extra-nice?  Or is it just the characters he's played? I don't fully get it.
&&I was hoping Jim Parsons would be cast as Mr. Rogers. I was watching some of the first episodes of ‘Neighborhood’ this week, and it hit me just how similar their demeanors are. &&That's not Keanu Reeves.&&People used to think Bill Cosby was nice too. &&That'd be a great teaser! &&Oh gosh, if we don't see Tom Hanks do a full recreation of the intro and outro now...&&Mr. Rogers was super thin (he had a very specific exercise/eating routine he followed, and maintained ~143 pounds for the last 30 years of his life)...143 pounds is very low for a 6'0 individual (e.g. Tom Hanks), so some allowances are going to have to be made.&&[Side by side...](https://i.imgur.com/2P3o05Z.jpg)&&Thanks for this, no one ever posts a comparison&&Momma said life was like a box of Choco-lates.&&glad they didn't shit him up with distracting prosthetics like they love to do recently.&&I agree and they did a good job picking Kevin Spacey for the role of Mr. McFeely.&&one bright spot in a sea of maddening (but important) posts today &&Why did I have to scroll so far to see this?&&This was the first thing i thought of&&I realize the SCREAMING PEIN &&For some reason I can never look at Tom Hanks in any role and not just see Tom Hanks. I know he's a great actor, but something about his face is just extremely distinctive to me, and I can't get past it.

I'm sure he'll nail this role, but all I can see in this photo is Tom Hanks dressed up as an old dude.&&I think this is one of those instances where the casting works so well on other levels that people can overlook a lack of resemblance.  Looking at this photo I'm surprised how well they captured the likeness, but agree that Rogers and Hanks don't especially resemble each other.  Still, would rather Hanks be playing him than a less-fitting actor who looks more like him.&&Yeah, I thought I was going crazy with everyone gushing over it.
I love Mr Rogers and Tom Hanks as much as the next guy, but it just looks like Tom Hanks in a Spirit Halloween Mr Rogers costume.&&I agree. It looks like Tom Hanks wearing a Mr. Rogers costume. I'll have to wait to see how it works in reality, but looks like I'm going to have a hard time telling myself that's not Tom Hanks.&&Prove it&&Pics or GTFO&&Tom Hanks is an American actor. The person he's playing as is ""Mr. Rogers"", which was a well-known children's show that was on PBS (Public Broadcasting Station), which was a free access network that ran shows for children. Mr. Rogers was a very kind, wholesome person who was very well liked and did well with his role, despite the show having next to no budget.

I imagine you can do a search for Mr. Rogers on Youtube and find some clips.&&Mr. Hanks is a diabetic, going through drastic weight loss is not the best idea for a diabetic.&&I think that's underweight for someone who's 6'0""&&I'd watch me.  I'd watch me so haaard.&&I guess I’m pretty much alone on this one. It doesn’t really bother me, but I don’t think he looks much like Mr. Rogers.&&I am the opposite. It's pretty funny how much he doesn't look like Mr. Roger's at all. It'll be tough to suspend my disbelief during the movie lol&&Really? It looks like Tom Hanks cosplaying as Mr Rogers, I think it looks terrible&&I mean.. I'm sure Tom Hanks will do a fine job but he looks nothing like Mr. Rogers lol.&&[deleted]&&[Here he is in costume from Drunk History.](https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/DXFIhVfVAAAu1zQ.jpg)

If not him, [John Mulaney would make a close second choice.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dhc1q_jVMAAc8oL.jpg)&&Basically what Ice Cube's kid did in Straight Outta Compton? I'm down.&&Its funny cause he doesnt look like him until you know he’s tom hanks son and then he looks exactly like him.    

Also, which drunk history ep was that? Never saw! Damn&&Orange County has him starring.

The first half is pretty funny, jack black reminds me too much of myself in this.&&He was in Band of Brothers too. He was a Lt Jones that shows up later in the series. His face always looked familiar in the most annoyingly vague way, and then I found out it was Tom Hanks son lol&&Used the N word 1,362 times on his second album- got dropped by tower records and couldn't score a a deal elsewhere.

Last I heard he's in the midwest- a whitewater rafting instructor.&&Somebody poisoned the fish tank?&&Reach for the sky.&&>oir oir&&I think most people trying to copy Rogers' inflections would come off as psychopaths (not that he did, but it's a hard rhythm to do and not sound creepy).&&Well uh... he did play Forrest Gump.  A character that was defined by his rhythm and inflections.  I contend that it would be really weird if he was just talking like Tom Hanks the whole time.  I think Hanks is a better actor than that.&&I can't imagine they'd cast *anyone* if they couldn't come close to Rogers' voice. Pitch might be tough to perfect, but he will nail the rhythm and inflections. &&I mean... that's what acting is for.  I'm not saying Hanks will do it perfectly, but I'm sure it'll be respectable.&&I’m sure he has a coach.  While he cannot change his voice much, he can emulate many elements of Rogers. &&Yes, the wildly successful Tom Hanks, with an acting career of over 40 years. The man who never as adjusted his voice for movies such as Forrest Gump or The Terminal. I can't believe they let WOODY of all people play those parts.&&Hanks is diabetic, do you want to *kill* the man?!

#HEY REDDIT, THIS GUY'S TRYING TO KILL TOM HANKS!&&ILY&&I love you &&Seriously though I was just saying this. Hanks must weigh at least 200.&&There were definitely ugly tears there. &&I was crying during 90% of that doc and I never even watched Mister Rogers, everything about him is just so amazing&&I'm out of the loop, what's the documentary you're talking about?&&Oh my god I watched it and I, a full grown man, was weeping.&&Literally every person in the theater was crying when I went.&&I watched it on an airplane, that was a bit of a messy ride.  &&[deleted]&&Okay, be honest, how many of you read this in Fred's voice?

Though to be fair, I heard it in an odd blend of Fred and Tom's...&&Bless you, whoever you are. &&I'd gild you, but I can't. And that's okay. We all have our own ways to make our neighbor feel special.

So let me just take this time to tell you how wonderful you are for taking the time to type all those words. They're funny, yes, but they also bear a beautiful message that we could all learn from and share with other people in our neighborhood. Mmhmm.

On behalf of everyone, thank you, /u/the_original_Retro. I'm proud of you.&&I'm crying as I'm reading this post.&&He’s in the post credits scene; it’s the set up for the PBS cinematic universe. &&And Donald Glover as LeVar Burton&&Or a perfect actress as Shari Lewis.&&Who going to play Steve Irwin?&&I NEED AN ADMIN&&I'm down with Reddit exploding. It'd probably be a good thing overall. &&like Hologram for the King or Cloud Atlas?&&He literally *just* played a vilain in 2017 in The Circle. Road to Perdition as others mentioned. The LadyKillers. And if you want to technically be a wise guy, his cameo in Forrest Gump as his ancestor General Nathan Bedford Forrest KKK leader.&&They tried in The Circle. It didn't really work.&&I'd like to see him in a movie where he can really stretch his chops.  Maybe on a desert island with just him and a basketball....or a hockey puck.  Make it about 3 hours long. &&> I'd also like to see Hanks in some edgier roles

Hey, he gave Jimmy a good dressing down in That Thing You Do&&[deleted]&& Without a ~~smile~~.

Without tears..

&&I hope no one accuses Tom Hanks of sexual assault...&&T.Hanks for being my neighbor&&But he does, you know, as Halloween decorations&&> God, I hope Tom Hanks doesn't have any skeletons in his closet. Please, please, please God, please. Please. No skeletons. Please.

I probably shouldn't tell you that Tom Hanks has a spooky skeleton *inside him*.&&He probably does but I can't imagine they would be anything worse than any other average persons. Along the lines of he bullied a kid in middle school for like a year or something stupid like that.&&>skeletons

[Sorry to be the one to tell you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS00xWnqwvI)&&She was a skrull! &&Maybe she was a Skrull?&&Typical fox news pure trash&&All of that combined. He's really nice to fans, nice to people he works with (I worked with him briefly when helping with an interview once, he was beyond nice), and usually plays nice guys in the movies. It's kind of a perfect storm of nice. &&Insiders knew.  And they gave out vague hints.&&Nice until proven shitty. &&Just be ready for some ugly crying.&&Tom Hanks is also diabetic so messing with his weight and diet isn't a bright idea.

&&Did Mr. Rogers have an illness he was keeping in check? Or was he just very health conscious? &&For anyone curious, Fred Rogers decided to be that weight (his words) because it represented the number of letters for his favorite phrase,

""I love you""

http://www.fredrogerscenter.org/support-freds-legacy/143-club/&&Fun fact, he didn't just maintain ~143 pounds, he supposedly worked to keep his weight at *exactly* 143 pounds. He did this because 143 was his favorite number, and contains the number of letters in the phrase ""I Love You"" (i-1 love-4 you-3)&&But can you give me a side by side of Tom Hanks as Rogers and Colin Hanks who also played Rogers.?&&My Twitter feed has just been non-stop Kavanaugh/Ford today so when this popped up it managed to put a big smile on my face.&&Idk&&That's exactly how I am with Tommy Lee Jones. I can never see him as another character, I can only see him as ""Tommy Lee Jones as"" another character.&&It’s not just his face, he has such a distinctive voice, and set of mannerisms that are almost a brand. I love him, bu it’s harder to see him dramatize specific characters.&&That’s very true. Sometimes it’s more about the character than the looks. &&I think they missed an opportunity to cast Edward Norton. He has much more likeness to Roger's and could easily had performed on par with Hanks if not better. I think they gave it to Hanks because he is more of a ""good guy"" icon, and pulls in more $ in ticket sales.&&I was kinda hoping for Scarlett Johansson to play Mr. Rogers.&&It's actually hitting uncanny valley for me.  I'm almost subconsciously repulsed by Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers.  Maybe it'll be better once the movie's actually out.&&Found a pic of them https://i.redd.it/nm1oqd4awto11.jpg&&Yeah, I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled and had no idea who this was about until this comment! &&Everyone knows who Tom Hanks is, Mr Rogers isn't really known internationally. &&oh dang didn’t know that.&&According to the bmi index its okay but it does seem that way&&I agree. I think he'll do well in the role, but all I see when I look at him is Tom Hanks in a sweater.&&I agree 100% It looks like Mr Rogers cut off Tom Hanks' face and is wearing it.&&Right? I grew up on Mr. Rogers and then loved Tom Hanks my entire life. Maybe I just have looked at them both so much from all the exposure, but I don't think it is that close. Hanks is WAY bigger than Rogers. You put pretty much any slightly built, grey haired male in a red vest and some comfy shoes and you'll be in the ballpark.&&It's hard to make Tom Hanks not look like Tom Hanks. I'm sure once I'm watching the movie I'll forget all about it and be absorbed.&&It matters less to me that they look alike and  more how he plays him. &&Wow. On looks alone, Mulaney could pull it off. The resemblance is uncanny.  &&Wow, that's good&&I legitimately would never have known that he was tom hanks' son. that's really cool&&""It's good to get some rest, tall child.""&&Ehh close but not really Colin Hanks playing young Tom Hanks in a biopic would be the same.&&My mom was like ""Wow this guy they got REALLY looks like Ice cube. Do you know if they used like prosthetics or anything?"" And I was like No that's his son haha&&LOL exactly my thought. I had no idea, mind a little blown&&Fargo Season 1 has him as a lead / lead supporting actor type role.  It's by far Colin Hanks best IMO.&&“Sorry to interrupt, but has anyone seen my piss?”&&Had no idea this guy existed.  His name is Chet.  What did anyone expect?&&He was on Shameless &&There's whitewater rafting in the midwest?&&WIIIIILLLLLSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, won’t you be my neighbor &&This town ain't big enough for the two of us, neighbor&&I think that’s because when most people try and sound like Mr. Rogers, it isn’t genuine - so it comes off sounding ridiculous or creepy. 

Mr. Rogers was 100% genuine and his tone communicated that. &&There's a Graham Norton segment where he talks about how he came up with that voice. In short, he didn't. The actor who played Young Forrest had such a distinct way of talking that Hanks said, ""Why don't I just talk like he talks?""

I think if he focuses on rhythm and tone, and doesn't try to do an impression of Rogers, he could easily pull it off. Can't wait to see what he does with it. &&Not only that, but he didn't just make up that voice - he was copying the inflections of the boy who played child Gump.&&Also that crazy accent from Terminal&&I was thinking the same thing... He's one of the greatest actors of his generation, granted, he's not known for his ability to chameleon into anther character like Gary Oldman but the comment you replied to that doesn't think someone with a 40+ year acting career in some of the biggest/most influential movies ever can change their fucking rhythem and inflection of speech?

I'm not going to be surprised if he even get's the pitch down. Either way I don't think it's going to be an issue. &&Sure, but he also played Walt Disney, another historic TV personality with a known voice, and intentionally did not try to imitate that voice. &&He definitely is.  This will be great.&&Perhaps instead of trying to find an actor who does the best imitation of Mr. Rogers they decided it was better to cast an actor who's public persona most closely mirrors that of Mr. Rogers. If that were the case then they nailed it.&&My wife and I can’t even make it through the preview. Haven’t braved the actual movie yet. Gotta work ourselves up for a few years, like the recent Carroll Spinney documentary. &&[deleted]&&I was fine for most of the movie until the moment where they stopped to think of someone special to them. 

That part got me. &&I didn't even know there was a documentary... I've already been sobbing after putting on All Dogs go to Heaven since my fluffy boys are sick today.

This might be a better alternative to A Dog's Purpose. &&""Won't You Be My Neighbor"" (2018)&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV_kxc9PxrQ&&""...love or the lack of it."" 💔&&I'm mad that this guy made me have feelings again. Like some kind of child.&&We can fix that. First, navigate to /r/politics. And there you go, Republican or Democrat, pure, raw anger. Enjoy!&&Forrest Gump, actually.&&I'd be surprised anyone read it in any other voice.&&That's how you know it's perfectly written. That was so good.&&I honestly didn't expect the reaction to this, but I have to share that it makes me feel good to make other people happy.

At least, that's what he says in the recent documentary that came out earlier this year.&&I don't think I can picture Mr. Rogers chowing down on some burgers & fries. Seems more like a petite salad guy.&&He loved being 143 lbs. because of its relation to ""I(1) Love(4) You(3)""

Mr Rogers was good to the core.&&I'm pretty sure he was just health conscious. I know he was a vegetarian, so I'm sure that helped. &&143 was his number for “I Love You.” He said keeping himself fit and healthy was a way to show his love to his family. He also was a chubby child who was bullied and called “Fat Freddie” which left a lifetime impression on him, both in terms of his own insecurities and his beliefs on how people should treat one another. He was a vegetarian because he said he “couldn’t eat anything that had a mother.”&&omg, Mr. Rogers, come on.... the man is just too good.&&[Side by Side by Side...](https://i.imgur.com/WAS1NX9.jpg)

The original post has made me beyond excited. Mr. Rogers was a huge part of my childhood. Daniel Tiger is a huge part of my daughters. Tom Hanks is my second all time favorite actor (only behind Robin Williams.) This is by far my most favorite day in recent memory just because of OP.&&Exactly, maybe its less about actually looking like someone and more about capturing who that person was.

&&Edward Norton definitely looks the part more, but even me being an adult who can pretty-well separate the actor from the role, I'd have a much harder time 'believing' that than I would Hanks.

Calm collected tones are horrifying when they aren’t being nice lol&&Yup, and while it might not be 100% convincing, I have cautious optimism that Tom Hanks that can pull it off because Tom Hanks is one of the few people on the planet that comes off as being nearly as genuine as Fred Rogers. That's the important ingredient.

Man I'm crying right now just typing this. We did not deserve that man. A real super hero. &&Yeah, I am a huge ugly crier. My face turns bright red and mucous a’plenty. I don’t think I want to subject people to that in public.

The trailer alone reduced me to nothing and I love Tom Hanks. I’d probably start wailing in a very alarming manner and clutch the poor soul next to me.&&If you want to dry up those tears watch Dear Zachary.&&Can’t make it through the trailer of the documentary?
Sorry, I’m behind on this topic and couldn’t find a trailer for the movie in the post, so just curious.
I want to watch it&&I saw it with my mother we were crying every 15 minutes it was an absolutely beautiful film. Huge dude in front of us too, watching his shoulders shake and head bow almost in synchronicity with us. That's a feeling I've only gotten a few times in my life. Being on the exact same wavelength as a group of strangers around you. It was wonderful.&&How weird is it that I never saw his show but somehow when I saw the preview I was overcome by pure, raw emotion and cried like a lost little child?&&And “Do you think I’m a sheep?” 

FUUUUUUUUUUCK&&A Dog's Purpose had me crying through 90%. &&Is there anywhere I can stream it?&&>What do you do with the mad that you feel,  
When you feel so mad you could bite?  
When the whole wide world seems oh, so wrong...  
And nothing you do seems very right?  
What do you do? Do you punch a bag?  
Do you pound some clay or some dough?  
Do you round up friends for a game of tag?  
Or see how fast you go?  
It's great to be able to stop  
When you've planned a thing that's wrong,  
And be able to do something else instead,  
And think this song:  
I can stop when I want to,  
Can stop when I wish,  
I can stop, stop, stop any time.  
And what a good feeling to feel like this  
And know that the feeling is really mine.  
Know that there's something deep inside  
That helps us become what we can,  
For a girl can be someday a woman,  
And a boy can be someday a man.

Rock on!!&&My wife and I went to see him (and the docu) as well, in Philly during that tour.  He was the nicest guy.  Speaking with Oscar was like a childhood dream.  I feel like growing up with Sesame Street, Mister Rogers, and Reading Rainbow really helped make me into a kind, empathetic person.  

I'm hoping my kids can have similar experiences.  Daniel Tiger is the closest we've found, but it's just not the same as a real adult human speaking to you as an equal.&&Crying so hard that your face is swollen and you've just completely lost it. Sobbing, essentially. &&I believe it was a term coined to counterbalance the beautiful crying done in some movies where the eyebrows raised so ever slightly and a gentle tear falls across the cheek, whereas in real life your whole face is blotchy you got snot running out of every orifice and you're making spluttery blubbering sounds.&&Those were when my friend and I started *bawling,* we both really needed to hear them.

The Wachowskis could only laugh. They took so much care in making that film (the idea to make they got from Natalie Portman, who was reading the book during the making of *V for Vendetta*). 

I swear the match cuts alone in *Cloud Atlas* make it worth watching. It's really amazing.  &&Yeah purely from a technical film making perspective its a stunning piece of work.

I’m so used to hating everything and everyone and having this dark outlook on the world. The use of that mindset and comedy have really helped me get through some of the worst points in my life: it’s easier to not have things hurt you when you just hate everything.

Then I remember Fred Rogers was a real human being. He wasn’t an act. He didn’t use his position to do anything malicious toward anyone. He was just this beacon of wholesome light and goodness and it makes me realize that I have spent so much time and effort hating things when I could have been like him and enjoyed things and seen the good in the world.

More than that, I could have actively been working toward making the world a better place. And then the worst part of this feeling is that he would forgive me for feeling the way I have because I was sad and scared and lonely and didn’t know how to handle the circumstances I was in, but he would still see the good in me that I tried to forget about and he would call me his neighbor and invite me to help him make the world a better place.

The only real answer to Life's mysteries&&Thank you for sharing that. I think you described the mindset many people I know, myself included.

You know that meme that goes around, something like, ""you're not being the kind of person Mr. Rogers knew you could be"", and its supposed to be in reference to someone doing something bad or acting like an asshole or something? Yeah well that legit gets to me every time I see it. I feel like if I were in a situation like that, being obnoxious or spouting off my opinions in a rude way or something, and someone voiced that to me I would instantly stop and assess the situation. Am I doing my best to treat everyone fairly? Am I being honest? Am I making an effort to make the world a better place? Am I accepting people for who they are? When I grew out of the Mr. Rogers age and into teenage years and early 20s, the answer to those questions would most likely be no. As I got older though, and experienced all the shit life has to offer and hateful people, at some point I just decided to stop being so cynical. It just didn't help anything. I didn't have a revelation that I needed to be happy and good, I just realized that I was actually putting effort into being an ass, MORE effort than if I were to just be neutral! And it didn't do anything to solve problems and usually made them worse. So why not try to just NOT be so cynical? It improved my mental health and outlook on life dramatically. Not right away, it took time, but it definitely was a noticeable difference. 

Even later, I start seeing that meme, and recently watched that documentary. Now I've realized that I don't want to just be neutral anymore, that I need to inflict good upon the world if I want the world to be good. I'm at the phase now where it's not enough for me to just coast by and ""survive"". Is what I'm choosing to do going to change the world in a better way? I don't know, but I'm passionate about it and want to see if it is. Can I answer yes to all those questions I previously couldn't before? Probably not, but I'm trying my best, and I feel like that is all Mr. Rogers would have asked of me.  &&My favorite episode was when they went to a construction paper plant.  I dont know why I remember that so clearly. &&There's an adjective he uses for us. Special&&That's a noun.&&It's basically a cliche at this point but Alamo Drafthouse is easily the best theater chain in the US.

Ryan Reynolds starring in movie about a man who realizes he's a background character in a video game. Stranger Things' producer Shawn Levy to direct,94560,9jojjy,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ryan-reynolds-star-action-comedy-free-guy-1133159,2625,1538152768.0,,"Title of film is ""Free Guy""&&*The truth was a burning green crack through my brain. Weapon statistics hanging in the air, glimpsed out of the corner of my eye. Endless repetition of the act of shooting, time slowing down to show off my moves. The paranoid feel of someone controlling my every step. I was in a computer game. Funny as Hell, it was the most horrible thing I could think of.*

— Max Payne&&Stranger Than Fiction 2: Wreck It Reynolds?&&Ryan Reynolds really knows his audience &&*Acquired as a spec in 2016, Free Guy is in the vein of The Truman Show, where a bank teller stuck in his routine discovers he’s a background character in a rather brutal open world, action-adventure video game and he is the only one capable of saving his world.*

The possibilities based on this premise with Reynolds starring are very enticing.&&I always thought it would be cool to make a movie about backround characters in a musical. They would basically have to put up with constant song and dance numbers happening at random. Like they can't get to work because the highway is shut down because the stars of the movie are dancing on cars and shit.

Edit: Apparently I need to watch Buffy, among other things.  &&Shit, yahtzee wrote this book.&&Wait, and it's *not* called NPC...?&&I’m hoping for the Stanley Parable narrator vibes and Ryan Reynolds frequently arguing with the narrator.&&I wonder if the people behind [Epic NPC Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G97xdpy6Am4) are disappointed or pleased.&&Reminds me of [this sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv8XToZ7cC0) by WKUK, where a guy calls 911 because the events of Terminator 2 are happening around him as an innocent bystander.&&There is a book call “Mogworld” by Yahtzee Croshaw (the guy who does the Zero Punctuation game reviews) that is based on a similar premise. 

I thoroughly enjoyed that book so hopefully this film will be as good.&&So deadpool is going to be playing a character with the same defining trait as deadpool but isn't the main character. &&Is it called ""Rosencrantz & Van Wildenstern Are Deadpool""&&Sounds like that book Mogworld by yahtzee crowshaw&&If you haven’t seen The Nines, check it out. Currently on Prime. John August wrote and directed. Ryan Reynolds. Melissa McCarthy in an early mostly non-comedic role. It’s weird and interesting and this immediately made me think of that. &&So the last action hero?&&People here saying NPC wouldn't be a good title for mainstream audiences... but *Free Guy* is?

I think *NPC* is good. *NPC: The Movie* might be better because it's sillier, and then there could be a video game called *NPC: The Movie: The Game*. *NPC: The Musical* would be my personal preference, even if it isn't actually a musical. But it definitely should be an action musical. &&Doki Doki Literature Club?&&If they take the same tone and direction as the new Jumanji then I'm down, I liked that movie way more than I expected, especially with the videogame trope references and stuff.

This is not an insult to the man, its the exact opposite: He's too much of a movie star. Too much of a handsome hero-looking guy. Like, I have absolutely no problem believing he's the protagonist of a story.

I know people will disagree, but I'd prefer if the main character was something you didn't expect. Like a pudgy balding guy with a mustache. I guess Peter from Deadpool 2 would fit the build.&&Not a musical, but Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is a clever look at Hamlet through they eyes of two of its most insignificant characters, with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman in the starring roles. Highly recommended.&&Galavant had moments like this. People would break out into song and you'd see background characters just trying to deal with it.&&The musical episode of buffy is similar in tone to what you describe. When they are singing, it's a compulsion and they can not act in any way that wouldn't be right in a musical. When the song is done, however, they are all completely aware of what just happened.&&Directed by Larry David.&&I had this idea once, I'm probably not the only one either, of a guy that's just down on his luck, has a girlfriend, working all these shit jobs just trying to make it. He gets caught up in crime doing odd jobs and things like that, and you follow him through the movie, he starts to make contacts in the industry, starts to move up the ladder and such.

Eventually he gets into some syndicate and the movie ends with him getting a call from his boss. 

""You're going to go meet this European gentleman downtown at uh Nakatomi Plaza. Should be an easy in and out Job, no big deal 50k for a nights work, you'll be able to buy that engagement ring for Christmas""

Pretty good. &&Yahtzee as in Zero Punctuation?&&Thank you for reminding me, I was going to put the audiobook back on my phone.&&And loading ready run did a few videos based on the same topic back in the glory days of The Escapist. &&*Free Guy* isn't that great of a name anyway.&&I feel like if the movie did badly (even if it was good) one of the many parroted opinions of redditors would be ""who the hell thought it would be a good idea to call it NPC?

Edit: I feel the need to say I don't really have an opinion on the title. Just trying to make an observation about reddit in a moviescirclejerk way. Op if you read this I'm not shitting on your title idea.

Edit2: NPC is a way better title than Free Guy. &&Let's call it **Stranger Than Fic**- oh wait, no that's been done.&&There is an ongoing book series called NPCs about a group of side characters in a pen and paper roll playing game who become self-aware. &&People keep saying that most movie-goers wouldn't know what NPC stands for. That may be true but I get the feeling that you could convince the movie-going public to watch

Non

Player

Character&&I think the problem is general audiences have no idea what NPC stands for.&&> Stanley Parable 

that's exactly what I thought when I saw the headline.&&Sorta like “Stranger than Fiction” with Will Ferrel.  

Narrator:  little did he know that he would soon die.  

Will Ferrel: Wait what????&&I've been meaning to play this, but never got around to it.  I'm assuming since you brought it up you enjoy it, but is it a quick game or a time sink?&&Scrolled down way too far to see these guys mentioned.&&Hope they at least give those guys a cameo in this upcoming film.&&Lol, I forgot about these. &&This was entertaining. &&Reminds me of a 90s animated cartoon, Reboot, where characters were living inside a PC and were forced to play npc's and try to beat the player when games were started. It was awesome when I was ten.&&also somewhat related is ""Redshirts"" by Scalzi, except instead of video games, its a ""star trek"" like setting.&&Loved Mogworld. But I feel the target audience was people who have played MMORPG games. (And I mean actually spent time playing, not merely ""heard of World of Warcraft"".)  
Like, there was a part where the main character needed money and agreed to ""give experience"" to a stranger in change for cash, not knowing what that meant. The second players found out there was such an ""easy quest"" available they mobbed him with money. He then claimed he was """"the opposite of mugged"". 

I *loved* that bit, but to explain it to an average movie-goer would be almost impossible. I don't see a big studio making a movie about it.   

This premise seeks to involve a ""hyper violent shooter"" game, which I think large audiences can identify.&&Patrick Ness wrote a YA book called ""The Rest of Us Just Live Here"". Some sort of apocalypse is happening, and while you see parts of it interrupting their lives, the main focus is on normal teen preoccupations like crushes and graduating high school&&But instead of playing with comic book tropes, it'll be parodying video game tropes.&&halfway through, surprise twist, the game's main character is wolverine! the movie actually was deadpool 3 all along and this was how he had to twist it to make a team up movie.&&Deadpool is a supporting character in the overall Marvel Universe. He is just popular enough to get a spin-off. But every time something important happens in the comics he never appears in the main book.&&Is this the same Yahtzee that does Zero Punctuation?&&I had the same idea. Read this and thought of The Nines, but I think The Nines almost plays more to him being the main character of something like the Sims to me. Or even just someone that gets too far gone into VR/Holodeck experiences and refuses to accept that there is another world outside of what they're experiencing. Great movie, but I think this one will be very different.&&Absolutely made me think of The Nines! Only ever saw it when it screened at a local film festival. &&I think few enough people saw The Nines for them to worry about comparisons, and the fact that the similarities are only revealed as the twist ending further limit how much people may talk about that.  But this sounds like it could be titled The Nines Two: The Twos.&&[deleted]&&Fuck it, I’d watch a DDLC adaptation where Reynolds plays monika.&&First thing that came to mind. &&More like Doki Doki Deadpool Club. &&Just Monika.&&Yuri is best Doki&&[deleted]&&The premise reminded me of Stranger Than Fiction.&&Ralph knows he's a video game villian and truman doesn't know he's a television actor until the end of the film&&Reminds me more of the premise of *Redshirts* by John Scalzi&&Wreck-it Truman&&The first one gets pretty damn crazy at the end.

>Bye Yukio!

&#x200B;&&I'm so hyped for that and the Jim Carry Sonic movie!&&That sounds pretty fucking cool. &&He did buried which was good and the nines, which I remember just being weird for the sake of it but it's been a long time since I watched it.&&Back in college, learning about film and by extension actors, I was one of those that thought if you couldn't transform yourself for a role (like Christian Bale can, Daniel Day Lewis, etc) you weren't an actor.  Then I watched a few acting seminars/interviews with Michael Cain (and some people whom I respected talked about their favorite actors), and then got to really delve into it and watch some stellar performances from people who basically play ""them self"" but as a character and I gained a new respect for actors who just act ""normal"". 

I fucking Love Paul Giamati, he's one of the ones that at first you think, ""psh he just plays a normal guy"" but really his chops are fucking fantastic.  

I always think of that when people are typecasted/said to play themself/etc.  &&What about Detective Pikachu? &&He wasn't playing himself in *Buried.*  That shit wasn't fun.&&And I absolutely do not mind that. I've loved his movies ever since Van Wilder.&&and I'll always be OK with that&&When you're an incredibly charismatic guy who people love, then why not right? &&Congratulations, you played yourself&&How is that an unpopular opinion?&&Even more unpopular opinion? Still waiting for them to nail it.&&I agree. I thought 2 was way better but few people seem to think so&&Just watched for the third time with a roommate who hasn't seen it before. We both agree it's better then the first. Not to say the first wasn't fuck amazing as well.&&People didn't like Deadpool 2? Glad I stopped looking at the movie subs. &&That’s deep. &&[deleted]&&there's definitely going to be a section in the third act that makes him wonder if he's still just following his programming.&&That's immediately what I thought of aswell.&&I'm not a fan of the ""Loud Obnoxious Stupid Will Ferrell"" schtick ala Talladega Nights and Anchorman, but I love the shit out of Stranger Than Fiction. He's so goddamn amazing as that character. &&Underrated movie. I think it’s one of Will Ferrel’s funniest performances, even though it’s more muted than normal. Great casting as well.&&Also The Nines.&&[deleted]&&there is a book that has a fairly similar premise.

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13055592-redshirts&&[deleted]&&Check out the show Westworld if you haven’t. Very similar premise  &&It's somewhat alike the gwenpool comics, a girl from our world gwen Poole who's a giant comic nerd get teleported to the marvel universe and realizes unless she become a main character she could easily die. So using her knowledge of comics she kinda steals deadpools schtick.  It's actually pretty good.&&Hitman's Bodyguard was such a good time. &&But he *is* the protagonist, of the story *we* are getting. 

It’s not like he’s gonna be a background character, realize it, and continue being background. 

So to me, it makes sense to cast a handsome, capable, well known actor. 

Although I do see your point.

Plus I just think he’s super ducking sexy... &&The Daniel Radcliffe and Joshua McGuire one is really good too.&&Also, if you’re into Star Wars, the comic book “The Adventures of Tag and Bink” is written in a similar way and is pretty damn funny.&&One of my top movies. (Also a wonderful play if you get a chance to read it - similar but in some places even  a bit more clever.)
I try to watch it once a year, it's a masterpiece.&&Similar to the off-broadway play ""The Puffs"" about what the Hufflepuffs were doing during the time of Harry Potter.&&Also has Iain Glen (Jorah Mormont of Game of Thrones) as Hamlet according to IMDB... yeah I should check this out.&&I love that movie. That would be on my list of ""Movies I'd stop and watch through if I saw it while I was flipping channels.""&&Galavant was the definition of underrated. Sadly, but not unsurprisingly, it never gained enough of an audience to take off.&&There's a great SNL Sketch about what happens when the High School Musical kids end up in the real world - 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNUKou8vnJQ

It's great!&&The dude doing an big number about his dry cleaning in the background while the gang walks by is the best.&&I'm not sure if anyone else has mentioned this one, but check out the episode of Always Sunny in Philidelphia called ""The Gang Turns Black"".  They basically consistently bitch about having to sing. &&I had a friend in middle school that was obsessed with Buffy... I can probably sing all the words to “Going Through the Motions” to this day.&&Starring Larry David.&&[deleted]&&This is a funny pitch, but it would be a pretty dissatisfying film. You're watching a character, presumably getting invested in what they do and what they're up to (if the film is good) and then it essentially ends on a punchline.

*Monty Python and the Holy Grail* got away with a punchline ending because it was an extremely silly comedy. An actual film ending like this would be a drag (and a huge chunk of the audience likely wouldn't even get it.)&&What’s the punchline supposed to be here&&I remember seeing on reddit someone posting a theory before the film came out that, ""Office Christmas Party"" was actually set in Nakatomi Plaza, and that in the middle of the film, Hans Gruber and the terrorists would take over, forcing the characters to inadvertently help John McClane.  

I think that would've been the only way to make that movie good, and I would LOVE to see something like that.  A movie that out of nowhere bleeds into another wholly unrelated movie.  

Like a movie about a normal guy having normal problems suddenly takes a 180 turn when he gets on the bus from, ""Speed"".  And then the rest of the movie is, ""Speed"", but from this guy's perspective.  That shit would be wild, especially if you didn't advertise it.&&That film was next level. Maybe a little ahead of its time.&&Yes, thank you!  I was hoping someone would mention that episode!&&Okay, now, Once more *with feeling*&&*Buffy the Vampire Slayer* did it as well, a decade earlier.&&They have a short about an NPC&&[deleted]&&I concur, fun story to see.&&Yeah the best of all his novels. Very pythonesque in its humour!&&Only one of his I haven't read. Absolutely adored the rest though. You can really see how he's grown as a writer between each of his novels.&&Yeah, he’s also an author, he mentions it every once in a while&&I found it hard to get through the first time, but it's a solid book if you get past like the first 10 minutes.&&Supporting Character&&Inner city kids will watch it to support their friend Guy who is still in prison for something he shouldn’t have done&&Might just be a place holder or cover name&&Solid point!&&I dont think this is a big problem, like who knew what ""Meg"" was and ""free guy"" is just bland, it doesnt tell anything and it doesnt spark interest in an high concept movie.&&[deleted]&&I mean it isn't like my grandma is going to go see this movie or anything. Sometimes you need to call a spade a spade.&&This is essentially exactly what I was thinking too&&Is it good? &&But what the hell is a free guy? How does that tell you what the movie is about? At least NPC is familiar to the main target audience and somewhat mysterious to the rest. 

Or call it non player charter then.

Or maybe they should have called Harry Potter ""little British wizard kid"" because people that didn't read the book wouldn't know who Harry Potter is. &&Yeah - when I first saw the poster for Spielberg's BFG my first thought was ""you mean the gun from Doom???""   &&But who knows what free guy means?&&It just sounds like a TV channel  &&That's exactly what happens in Stranger than Fiction, with Will Ferrell. Great movie.&&It’s not a time sink at all :) very interactive and while guided, you can go wherever the hell you want!

VLDL is the first YouTube channel I've actually binge-watched.&&Way way way too far. 

I bet they steal the female armor joke.&&I really hope they do. VLDL has been successfully riffing off of this concept for a while now.&&I've never played WOW or any other MMORPG but I understood and loved Mogworld. I don't think it would be that much of a sticking point, people are better at filling in the blanks than you're giving them credit for.&&I don't enjoy reading but that book sounds great! &&Spider-Man shattered dimension&&it seems like it’ll be parodying GTA, based off of the description&&Haha that is fairly plausible.

He's done four books (I think)&&How many Yahtzees are out here so you need an exact clarification?&&It's billed as a thought-provoker about the relationship between character and creator, so I think it's supposed to be a little more ambivalent than just VR. He's basically (but not totally) a god, that's why all the stories run together. Because he's the main character, but he's actually none of the characters you actually see him play. &&How about just ""Non-Player Character""&&Your Brutality &&Just Monika &&All dokis are best doki&&A video game movie that doesn't take itself seriously but instead is self aware it's a video game movie...surprised it took so long to happen, actually.&&Great movie&&It’s totally different. That was a book. This is a video game. Cmon. /s&&They also aren't background characters. I assume based off OP that Ryan's character would be like one of the random people in GTA.&&Probably because it is the premise of *Redshirts* by John Scalzi.&&That fucking crying baby...&&I still remember playing this as a kid, got me hooked. Nightmares where worth it&&Played the demo endlessly until I convinced my parents to buy it for me&&I always liked how they used the actual in-game model for the character in the second panel. In all the other panels/cutscenes they seem to use a real person that only mildly resembles your in-game character.&&[MFW I'm in a Computer Game](https://i.imgur.com/AcoajMu.png)&&It's where I got my hate for Mark fucking Wahlberg from&&Yes, it's a bit different from the first two, but the combat is still really fun. Just know that the story is pretty serous and the cutscenes can get long, with explosive action sequences in between.&&Max Payne 3 is a wonderful game that deserves more praise and popularity than it got. The gameplay is probably the best it can be for a 3rd person shooter and the story, though not as well written as the other two, is well done and explains everything you need to know about the two previous games.

If you have a pretty beefy PC, I'd recommend you get it on that since the game is pretty headshot reliant. The game does allow for lock on aim, but it often aims for the chest, which can be annoying at times (because of body armor). Basically, it's going to ramp up the difficulty by about 3x if you're using a controller, since a mouse is going to give you that level of precision that you will benefit you greatly.

There are also a lot of cutscenes that streamline the game pretty heavily. For your first play through, they won't be a problem, but after that, you're going to get a little annoyed by them. 

The game is also incredibly linear, so don't expect anything besides every level being a game of going from point A to point B. 

Don't let that discourage you, though, this game is one of my favorite games ever and I wish I had not played it yet, so I could've experienced it for the first time at a more matured age (so I could've understood the humor a little more and had a PC). 

Overall, I'd give it a 9/10 and a recommendation for everyone who likes videogames.

How the fuck did this turn into a game review? &&Max Payne 3 is really good and in My opinion one of last gens most underrated games. It is different from the first 2 which were very gritty and Noir, while part 3 became at parts so over the top that it was borderline ridiculous. I mean at one point in the game you'll have a giant shootout in a brothel in the Slums of Sao Paulo. It felt almost like a Crank movie at that point.&&I preferred the dark and gritty/grimy setting of the first and second and also the monologues that went with it.&&And a movie..&&Happy international women's day!&&even better, detective pikachu talks and hes kind of a dick &&Isn’t it weird that Ryan Reynolds sounds exactly like Deadpool?&&I'm still upset that they didn't get Danny DeVito as the voice of Detective Pikachu. The game would've sold like crazy.&&When asked about the role, DeVito replied with “what the fuck is a Pokémon?”&&Nah bro, Danny Devito should play a Braviary and the movie should stop for 50 minutes for some sweet Braviary/Lopunny action. (That's a Lethal Weapon 5 reference by the by.)&&The new Burt Reynolds?&&Have you seen The Voices? This movie convinced me Reynolds is something more than just a pretty face in Hollywood &&If you wanna see a weird Ryan Reynolds movie with some comedy and horror elements, check out ""The Voices""  it's not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot.  It's on netflix.&&[deleted]&&He's also in smokin aces, which....isn't really a good movie, but Reynolds acts the shit out of it in the last five minutes.&&There's a scene in the third act of *The Truman Show* where if you blink you'll miss it, when Paul Giamatti's character stands up to Ed Harris (the ""there she blows"" sequence). That's one of the earliest roles I can remember him in aside from Pig Vomit, and I remember thinking he had range that wasn't being used.

*John Adams* proved it.&&Paul Giamatti is an acting beast in Billions&&I’ve been a Giamatti fan ever since Big Fat Liar 😂&&I think the ability to blur the line between character actor and method or whatever you want to call it is what makes a truly unique, incredible actor.  I know Brando is considered method, or at least not character, but I think he blurs that line, and I’m enough of a movie nerd that I’m willing to say he’s the best actor to ever live.  IMO, he really is a character actor, because he never seems to play himself, and often took roles of people he didn’t relate to at all.  If you didn’t know Brando, you would think he *was* playing himself, like a Reynolds.  And yet it’s so seamless that you also don’t realize he’s playing a character.  He literally becomes the character.  I could write a thesis on it, thus is the strength of my conviction.&&> I always think of that when people are typecasted/said to play themself/etc.  

Most of the time these actors are considered ***“character actors.”*** 

Kind of like...that one guy who ALWAYS plays the general or military officer in everything (edit: eg, transformers, [Glenn Morshower](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/michaelbaystransformers/images/2/20/General_Morshower_ROTF_film.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151223040101)), or Giamatti who always plays the neurotic character in most of his stuff, or esteemed character actress Margot Martindale who mostly plays government bureaucrat and office mid level exec types. 

You’re kind of right in that they “play themselves,” but it’s more like they “play up their personal traits that suit common minor character archetypes.” Like Morshower, he has a slight drawl to really emphasize he’s cornfed American, he has a high and tight hair style, and a commanding presence, which is why he’s always in military roles. 

Then you have actors like Reynolds, who’s somewhere between movie star (versatile to lead a movie) but not, since he has had success in only really two different film premises (The Proposal and Deadpool franchise, where the first one was carried by Bullock and the second one was a perfect marriage of actor to character). Not quite character actor not quite movie star, but not exactly typecast, either. &&Which is why I love Paul Giamati in Shoot Em Up.&&I massively agree. it's why actors like Jack Nicholson are amazing. you always know it's Jack Nicholson and sure he has some incredibly varied roles, but he doesn't have to go full Johnny depp chameleon type to get an amazing performance. he brings his own character to the role &&I mean, the post speaks for itself. Reynolds is basically an electric mouse detective.&&He had BETTER be playing detective pikachu as himself, that’s what I’m paying for! 

If I had it my way, there’d be no cgi. Just a naked Ryan Reynolds and gallons of yellow paint. 

You know what, forget the movie, just give me that. &&Everybody was saying that 2 was more of the same but worse, which i completely disagree with, even if i didnt enjoy the fat fireball kid &&And I’m 14&&Couldn't you *kind of* say that Hardcore Henry was a you're in a video game movie? I know it's a stretch, but I don't think we've gotten a movie quite that extensive with a first person perspective throughout the whole film.&&I hope it goes well.&&Predictive programming to accept we’re in a simulation.&&When he's the straight man he's awesome. Like in The Other Guys&&Yeah. Him singing [Whole Wide World and playing it on acoustic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Zdz61iSLo) was actually pretty wonderful and emotional too. Love that movie.&&I agree, except that I do enjoy his other movies. Stranger than fiction is by far my favorite movie of his, however.&&He's a much better and more well-rounded actor than those other movies would indicate, yeah. Stranger than Fiction was really, really well done.&&If you haven’t seen it, Everything Must Go is another example of his more subtle performances. It’s an excellent movie. &&His interactions with Maggie Gyllenhall (or however it's spelled) were some of the very few times I've ever genuinely laughed at awkward/cringe comedy. He was just completely endearing in his shiness.

Also, the dozen flours was just adorable.&&he's great muted, i don't know why he doesn't do that often&&It's quite good and a great departure from the typical Will Ferrell fare. &&Another book, similar premise.

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mogworld-Yahtzee-Croshaw/dp/1595825290&&just recently finished it, loved the level of meta the last chapter brought. I too recommend this book, not strongly but I still do.&&Yep. Isekai is super fond of the trope.&&I expected it to be awful, honestly. But it was a lot of fun, I absolutely agree. The bar scenes with Samuel L Jackson and Salma Hayek were pretty hilarious, and just everything was well put together in general.&&In the meta-narrative, I mean. Like, if you play a game and see a character that looks like Nathan Drake, you know that character will be important.

I mean he shouldn't look like a protagonist within the text of the video game. Now people are the movie, they just see Ryan Reynolds and think ""Yeah he would be the main character, he's a tall good looking athletic guy with a strong jawline.""

That's the other problem: He's sexy! For me, that kills it. Sure it works for romcoms or action movies, but for me that breaks the immersion. 

I'll give an example of why it doesn't work  for me. For the theme they're attempting, I'd be much more invested in a romance story if the guy who's supposed to be a normal background character didn't look like eyecandy.&&And Lion King 1 1/2&&had no idea that was a thing. will have to watch it. 
&&Someone else said holy shit at the revelation that the Lion King 1 1/2 was like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, but this one is the holy shit for me. The first ones are even called Tag and Bink are Dead!&&I mean it did get a second season, so at least it had that going for it&&I was lucky enough to just randomly stumble on Galavant on Netflix. I went in blind and laughed so hard it hurt throughout the first episode. I then promptly binged the whole 2 seasons with my wife.

I've talked to people who could not stand Galavant. I think some people just hate musicals. Also, the fantasy setting threw people off. While I enjoy both things, I feel that if this had been set in modern New York or similar it likely would have done better. 

I got to say, I really liked a lot about Galavant, but it was a bit uneven at times, and felt some of the jokes just felt out of time (especially the gay bar scene that felt straight out of the 80s). 

I still wish they would get a new season.&&It honestly ended on such a good note though.

Doesn't ever get the opportunity to prove it, but he's got range. &&>He's also in smokin aces, which....isn't really a good movie, but Reynolds acts the shit out of it in the last five minutes.

Fuck that, Smokin' Aces was awesome from start to finish.&&>He's also in smokin aces, which....isn't really a good movie

You shut your filthy mouth!&&What?!?!? Smokin' Aces is a great movie, no doubt about it. The second one, is terrible, but the first one is fantastic. Jeremy Piven is great in this movie as are most of the hitman (hitwoman?)  


If you have not seen this movie, it is a must watch. &&He is a fucking powerhouse in *John Adams*. That whole series is just insane with every aspect of production.&&Scene in My Best Friend’s Wedding where Julia Roberts starts smoking in the hall of a hotel and he’s an employee telling her she can’t. He takes a drag and has a small convo with her but damn was he compelling in that little snippet of a scene. &&He's phenomenal on Billions.&&I love him in that.  Him and Maggie are phenomenal.  Her character my fav character in the show.  Probably the most level-headed and interesting female character i've seen on a TV show recently.  &&You ain't seen shit til you've seen him in the 6 hr epic by Matthew Barney ""River of Fundament"". &&Him but colored blue is just how I always think of him because of that movie.&&I dunno where I heard it, but I heard that Marlon did things actors hadn't done before.  Like the popular ""New Yorker"" accent that people make fun of now-a-days in old movies where they talk fast and they have that accent that no one had was popular.  Marlon didn't do that, he tried to do an accent that was more normal, and back then people acted way over-proportional to the material, if they were angry they acted 2x-5x angrier than someone would normally be, if they were sad, the same. 

He tried to act according to what the tone of the scene was, and it blew people's minds from what I heard.   &&> electric mouse detective

&&Two wasn't as funny, but it was definitely a better movie, in almost every other aspect.&&[deleted]&&The problem with Hardcore Henry is once you strip the gimmick away, there isn't much there.&&Fucking love that movie. I was looking for something to watch tonight, but I might just rewatch that!&&I forgot what a crush I have on Maggie Gyllenhaal. &&Because he likes to have fun and isn't hurting for money.  I agree though, for every Step Brothers, I'd like a Stranger Than Fiction.  For every Anchorman, I'd like an Everything Must Go.  He's a great actor, but he also plays to his fans more than anyone else, and I say that as a Will Ferrell fan. &&Didn’t know that the zero punctuation guy had a book&&As if any scene with both Jackson and Hayek in it could ever be bad.&&Most video games are populated by relatively attractive characters.

The worst NPCs ever really get is like a 7. Unless they're supposed to be some horrible mutant or something.&&I can see your point, and I think we both have merit. 

But imma stick with overall I’m glad its him. For me the pros of knowing he can act, carry the movie, bring in more funding, likely cares about the project AND is pure dripping sex all outweigh your cons. 

Like I said that’s just for me, I don’t have issues with immersion. &&How have I never put this together?&&I have spent the last two years deciding who will live and who will die. It shows. I am so lean you can count my ribs. My hair is falling out in patches, leaving skin that looks like cured leather. Some of my people call me martyr. Most call me traitor.

It had begun when I befriended one of the lords. At the time we were both outcasts, lost and trying to survive in the jungle. When I met the young noble, a child really, he was nearly starved. He had been exiled from the kingdom and forced to find his own way. But I taught the child to find food and shelter. I taught him to live with his past and the obvious guilt he carried around. And over time we became great friends.

This might seem perfectly natural: two lost ones meeting and mutual survival growing into mutual friendship. It was not. The lords have always preyed upon my kind. They relied upon us to feed their kingdom. They hunted us for sport. My kind are beneath the lords, not worthy even of being seen.

But this lordling turned out to be something more. He was a king. One day a lady from his kingdom came to him and bid him to return with her. He did, bringing me back with him. And when the king regained his throne he said to me: “I cannot stop the killing and abuse of your kind, but I will spare you personal losses. So name for me those we would spare and it will be done.”

And since that day I have kept a list. A list of those who might be spared. I named those whom I grew close to, and those who led our kind. But I couldn’t list everyone. 

And so the burden grew heavier. More and more people blamed me for the deaths among us. I became a pariah. Fewer and fewer of my people would have anything to do with me. More and more called for me to be given to the lords as a stinking traitor. As a murderer. All I wanted was to save a few.

One of these few was a woman I loved. I don’t know what she felt for me. We argued often about my role, and about the decisions I had made. And she refused to be on the list. This strength of spirit drew me to her even more than her beauty. We kept this up for many months, often arguing but also growing closer. And I caved to her desire to keep her off the list, hoping that my obvious proximity and fondness of her would be protection enough.

Then one day two young lords came up to me smiling. “We bring good news. That sow who has been giving you so much trouble is dead. We killed her.” They seemed so proud of their deed. Seeing the beginnings of my despair the other lord said “Don’t worry. It was quick. We didn’t play with her, just ripped her throat out.”

I shouted. Screamed. The lords look at each other, confused. Then they shrugged and wandered back the way they had come. I continued to scream until I ran out of breath. I could have saved her. I could have put her on the list even if it meant she wouldn’t talk to me. My desire killed her. I collapsed onto the ground and sobbed. Sorry for her. Sorry for myself. Sorry for all of my kind.

After a while I staggered to my feet and started walking toward that distant jungle. I sang to myself quietly. “Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase.”

Of course that’s not what people are pitching. &&>What's the point of these endings, to invalidate the entire movie you just saw? 

Does finding out that Thanos is actually the main protagonist and not the antagonist invalidate the movie? Nah, if anything it makes it better. 

Black Mirror did an episode where the main protagonist was ""hitler"" too (not actually hitler but roughly as morally repugnant in the modern age). Granted, Black Mirror is a bit of a schlep sometimes because they do the twist so much you're already anticipating the twist (making it more of a twist when they don't actually pull a twist on you...) but the point remains that it can be powerful. 

A story that allowed you to understand that evil folks are just people who take things too far would probably benefit a lot of people to see. A lot of folks think there's some sort of ""evil"" gene that turns you into an inhuman monster when most folk who do bad shit are people just like everyone else. It's kind of a meme that Hitler likes dogs and yet people still seem to think he twirls his mustache. &&They were about to invade the French (with an massive standing army that was apparently there all along), and during the charge, the police show up and arrest them for slaughtering an important historian earlier in the film.

I mean they shouldn't look outrageously attractive when compared to the rest of the population around them. Or at the very least, they have defining traits.

Ok so I have a buddy who does commercials. He walks in for casting calls that want ""tall, thin, white male with short blonde hair"". He walks into the casting room and there's 20 dudes that look extremely similar to him. And that's what NPCs are like. The world is populated with people very similar to them. They're designed to not stick out.

Ryan Reynolds sticks out a LOT.&&Well, I'll also admit that I don't really like him. He's ok I guess.

I want to call you biased, then I realized my own bias. So we're at an impasse.&&The Lion King was influenced by Hamlet. I didn't realize this until I was in my 20s, and I absolutely love both The Lion King & Hamlet. So you're not alone.&&oh my god&&It has been done in a short story by Dino Buzzati in the 60s, he wrote  about a kid who gets unfairly scolded by his mother for getting his clothes dirty after being bullied/beated during a game with a bunch of children and it ends with someone telling the mom: ""Goodbye madam Hitler"".   

It's a nice little essay that we got to study in school back then, it was an easy way for teachers to start multiples discussions over the natural bias a storyteller has, the need not to judge a book by its cover or the fact that nobody's really born evil.   

The punchline can serve a purpose in itself but as you said it's limited to short stories because as good as the punchline can be you don't watch a movie solely for the ending.&&To this day I don’t think anyone has achieved meta-comedy any where near the heights of Python. 

My favorite is something they never actually got to do. They pitched the idea that for an episode of their show the volume would decrease steadily but very slowly through the entire episode. That way people would have to get up and walk to the TV and manually turn the volume up a little at a time over and over again over the course of the full episode (this was pre remote controls). Then at the very end of the episode they wanted to have a full volume loud noise to scare the audience. BBC apparently said no because it would blow out the speakers in everyone’s TVs. &&It was a cop out.&&Oh my fucking god ahaha I never got it.&&>What a cop-out.

People worry about kids playing with guns, or watching violent videos, that some sort of culture of violence will take them over. Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands, literally thousands of songs about heartbreak, rejection, pain, misery and loss. Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable? Or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?&&Yes! That movie was really unsettling. Made me stop talking to my dog for at least a day. &&yeah that scene when Ana Kendrock came over and ran into his bedroom 

when she fell backwards and broke her neck and was paralyzed when he came in and was just talking to her while she wriggles in fear.


that scene made me uncomfortable&&Definitely. That scene really stuck with me.&&Because he does all the voices&&Shit. That was darker than expected. &&!Goodbot!&&And Jeremy Piven gave an outstanding performance. Also the soundtrack is great too. I love that movie.

I watched it again recently and thought it was still awesome. &&Well he's the main character of the movie, Henry is the camera.&&I think this defines the difference between a ""good"" movie and a ""cool"" movie. Pacific Rim? Super fucking cool, far from good, but you can give me *any* reason to watch giant robots fuck eachother up and I'm there. Green Mile? Not exactly super cool as far as entertaining visuals go, but dammit if it doesn't pull you in simply because of the plot. &&Damn, there’s a smart comment.&&Will Save Galaxy For Food was a fucking riot.  I have Mogworld on my bookshelf and haven't made time to read it yet.&&And Lion King 2 was pretty obviously Romeo and Juliet&&It's also lowkey the Death of Osiris/Contendings of Horus and Set&&Apparently the folks who run basic cable and local tv are fans, because they do this every commercial break. &&I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.&&Yeah that's true, you were drugged with an OD of the Valkyrie drug or something like that.

So the controls can be explained away as max basically dying of an OD&&Beating Max Payne quicker than you, most likely.&&Yeah for mp1 it was Sam's face because they were on a low budget hence the resting constipation face lol. Then after I think they based the model on McCaffrey. Fun fact, McCaffrey was on Jessica Jones season 2 and he played a character named Max.&&I imagine it would.  I exploded a nut in a motorcycle accident.  Caved in the steel tank on my Kawi with my balls, and that was a tremendously terrible experience.

Oh man, I forgot that scene happens at that Vista Point. I actually have an eerily appropriate story about the filming of that scene that I heard from one of the people at Nevada Tourism who handles film stuff. Apparently Ben Affleck et al were doing that scene (and others) and most of the area was roped off. As they're filming this family shows up, but they don't seem terribly interested in the filming so much as the Vista Point and getting into the roped off area. Eventually someone finds out that the family is there because a relative had died and they wanted their ashes scattered overlooking Tahoe. Once the actors find out they stop filming after the next take, then let the family in and give them time and space to scatter the ashes. Ben Affleck in particular was apparently very nice and respectful according to the family. Once they were done they started filming again. Makes me wonder if maybe that scene was filmed afterward.&&There’re dozens of us maybe&&I think people could shit on Hardcore Henry if they want, I really liked it. I still think Sharlto Copley dancing was the scene that stuck out in the whole movie, and he fucking kills it.&&It's really funny, especially the in-company employee e-mail chains in between chapters, which explain in the driest way possible what's going on from the game developer's perspective.&&And much like R&J, it was inferior to Hamlet.&&I thought Lowkey was a Norse God not Egyptian?&&I am the walrus....

I wonder how much of his ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" scenes they shot?  It would be a hell of a last movie for him. 
Edit: According to TMZ, he never shot his scenes.

Funny name.&&I was a kid in the 70s and Burt Reynolds was the biggest star around.  Great career and great life!&&His performances in Deliverance and Boogie Nights were so great. RIP

Time to rewatch Boogie Nights&&Damn, I remember growing up on the Smokey and the Bandit/Cannonball Run movies and stuff like Gator and White Lightning. Def recommend some of his lesser known movies like The End, Semi Tough, Hustle, and Staring Over!
  
So I guess this means his last movie was with Tarantino then? He had a role in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood apparently. &&Can’t believe it! His voice acting in Archer will always be one of my favorites!&&[deleted]&&No &&I met Bert Reynolds in 1979 at the Bert Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter Florida. Also got a ride in the ‘Bandit’. Was a great memory from my childhood. RIP.

-Burt Reynolds&&Burt Reynolds was a legend, I worked with him about 5 years ago, and we could tell he was not feeling well especially since he had recently come out of being pretty sick with a respiratory infection. 

Even though it was a low budget production he was a consummate professional, always on time, and as soon as the camera would start rolling it is like he would de-age by a decade and you would see this shimmer of old Burt under the surface, if I didn't see it happen myself I wouldn't believe it. 

One time the grips showed up with a jug of moonshine and started sneaking Dixie cups to everyone that wasn't operating a vehicle, I took one sip and was like, Hot Holy Damn, this is strong as shit. 

It got into my head, that Burt would love some. 

So me and a friend went over to set as Burt was exiting for the night and we walked up and asked Burt if he would like some Moonshine, ""Hell yes!"" Was his answer, he took the cup from us and took a sip and his eyes lit up, ""Damn, that is some SMOoth Moonshine."" Pause for a beat. ""Can I have this?""

All we could say was of course you can. 

Rest in Peace Burt, will always remember the Moonshine we shared. 

Edit: One of the few photos I have of Burt on set, they were taking a publicity photo and I snapped a shot since a lot of people were snapping phone shots. I also have one of his stunt double somewhere who was also a REALLY nice guy. Please excuse the quality, it was on a 7 year old phone camera in a dark room. 

https://imgur.com/a/zaYYK0w&&Just saw him again in *Driven* last night, thought again how most everyone associated him with more comedic roles like *Smokey and the Bandit* and *Best Little Whorehouse in Texas*, but my first thought of him is always from more serious roles like *Sharky's Machine*, and *The Longest Yard*.

Sad.&&Not to sound like too much of an old fart here, but most Redditors will never quite understand just how much of a man’s man Burt was in the 70/80s. Growing up, he was definitely both of my parents’ favorite actor for very cliched reasons. &&This is just surreal.... I know he was up there in age, and this was inevitable, but still, just is unbelievable to know one of the biggest icons in modern movie history is gone. RIP, but if there’s solace, I’m happy he got to live a very full life. &&This is going to get buried, but I met Burt Reynolds once when I was like 16. I asked him: ""What's the coolest thing you've ever done?""

He responded: ""Sally Field.""

Absolutely legendary response, I was blown away&&Rest In Peace, Bandit. If anyone plans to watch some Burt movies to remember, I recommend Hooper. It’s one of his lesser seen movies but pretty damn fun and classic Burt Reynolds. &&[removed]&&I wonder how Norm MacDonald feels about this  
  
The man was a legend. Sleep well, Burt.&&Archer is going to be devastated.&&Bufort T Justice finally caught him.  RIP you summabitch.&&Ah man...Archer is gonna lose his shit. &&I met him at a gas station once in LA. He was such a good guy.&&My parents went on a date to see Smokey and the Bandit at a drive in theater. I was born 9 months later. I owe my entire existence to Mr. Reynolds. RIP Bandit. &&I’m really saddened by this one, he’s a big part of my teen years. 

Deliverance, all the Gator films, Smokey and the Bandit (funny story there) and so much more. 

RIP buddy. 

For anyone interested- my dad was an OTR truck driver back during the release SatB, cross-country, home every other weekend, and had a big group of friends. 

My dad was 6’6”, larger than life. Played for the Chicago Bears for a year after leaving the Navy, and I idolized him.

There happened to be a drive-in theater near our home, and my dad and 11 of his friends arranged to be home for the release of the flick at the drive-in, and took the entire back row with their trucks (no trailers) to the show. 

My dad and his friends all worked for a company (Vitalis out of Des Moines) that places a high value on nice rigs, and dad’s truck was a two-toned blue Kenworth, like Snowman’s black and gold rig, two others had blue and white, and a few other color combinations. 

They all got together at our home (we lived in the country on 20 acres) and spent an entire day washing, waxing, polishing chrome on the wheels, the stacks, the mirrors, armor-alling the interiors, etc. We had a cookout, it was a huge to-do.

Anyhow, the drive-in was packed, and my dad and his friends were surrounded by throngs of people. They were literally stars that night, and my dad and his friends beamed with pride. Me and my brother got to ride along, I was with dad and my bro went with dad’s best friend. 

One of my favorite memories from childhood; dad died at 48 from DVT, and we still watch the movie for old times sake. My brother gave it to me for Christmas a few years ago, and we watch it every summer. 

&&R.I.P he lived a nice long life&&Truly a sad loss, will Once Upon a Time in Hollywood be his final performance?&&He was probably the biggest movie star of the 70's and early 80's. Burt had underrated comic timing and charisma to spare. The fact that he was able to laugh at himself as time went on only endeared more people.&&Just tell em to send the bill to Big Enos Burdette...

&&Let's mourn his loss, but also remember that **Kirk Douglas** is still kicking at 101.&&[Eastbound and down, loaded up and truckin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HpmlIDIXPs)&&Awhhh man... remember All Dogs Go To Heaven? I just rewatched the ending. All three of them are gone now: Dom, Burt and Judith.

If I were a religious man, I’d love to think they are up there somewhere. Dom has Judith on his shoulders and Burt shows up and they both go and give him a huge hug, Dom cracks a joke about how old he looks and they both take Judith by a hand, swinging her back and forth as they walk into the pearly gates, Judith talking about the castle she lives in and they are both invited over.&&In the black theaters of the early 1970s, Burt and Charles Bronson were the only white actors black audiences really went crazy for, especially Burt.

He just naturally connected to southern blacks and we cheered him on in movies like ""White Lightening"", ""The Longest Yard"", and ""Gator"". Hell even his movie ""W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings"" was popular in black theaters.

You don't see that kind of natural charisma anymore. At least not since Will Smith. That charm will always be remembered and admired for future generations.&&Growing up and seing all your childhood movie heroes die one by one sucks major balls.
I'll never forget first time i saw Cannonball as a kid, what an awesome and funny movie and still is.
RIP.&&[deleted]&&Someone should shave his mustache and give it a separate burial.&&I recently saw Burt Reynolds at a screening of The Last Movie Star. He did a Q&A after the movie. I will be honest, I ended up at the screening on a whim and I didn’t really know who Burt Reynolds was. 

The movie follows him portraying an aging actor who is a complete ass. After the movie, he was so hilarious. “Guys... the movie is pretty obviously about me.” Through all of the questions he answered, he was so honest. He said, “Don’t let bullshit get you down. Everyone makes mistakes. Keep going.” 

I don’t really know where I’m going with this, but just wanted to say that he made a real impact on me, and everyone in that room, and it was so clear from the audience that he was truly admired. He might be physically gone, but his great acts of compassion will keep him alive for a long, long time.&&What are they gonna do about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood?

Anderson thread a few months ago regarding Burt Reynold's performance in Boogie Nights:  
  
*That was part of the reason I wanted him to win the Oscar that year. It was certainly for how good he was in Boogie Nights sure, but I also like to think that a part of it would have been the Acadamy saying, that's Burt fucking Reynolds. Who was not only a great actor but he was a goddamn Movie Star who put a lot of butts in the seats; and for good reason.*   
  

>Nearly a generation has passed since [Burt Reynolds's](https://www.gq.com/story/burt-reynolds-trump-toupee-paul-thomas-anderson) last movie of note: Boogie Nights, the 1997 Paul Thomas Anderson masterpiece in which Reynolds played, with disquieting authenticity, the porn titan Jack Horner. It's easy to believe the real Reynolds is somewhere in that character (which won him a Golden Globe), especially when you go back one more generation and remember the schticky, toupee'd boob he perfected in the late-70s and early-80s: Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Stroker Ace, Sharky's Machine. (Reynolds cemented his image as a kind of high-redneck Lothario when he married Loni Anderson in 1988, then lost a shit-ton of money in their divorce five years later.) What's too easily forgotten is that there was a time (1978 to 1982), when Reynolds was the number-one box-office star in America—and anchoring landmark films that are not just classics of the male-experience (The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough), but also on the National Film Registry (Deliverance).

A much underrated actor when you look at the range from Deliverance to Smokey.

Sad day.&&>  Smokey and the Bandit

When I was a kid (in middle school) and went to a week long summer camp ran by the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife, watching Smokey and the Bandit on the projector/screen they set up was a yearly tradition. That is just a fun movie.&&I'm a big fan of Hooper&&He was great in Boogie Nights.&&The End is amazing and so under appreciated. &&Came here looking for The End recommendations. He and Dom DeLuise have such chemistry in that movie. Really enjoyed that one.&&Cannonball Run is one of my favorite movies.&&Sharkey's Machine is another one you don't hear about.

""No you didn't.""&&Despite how much he didn't get along with PTA, he was great in Boogie Nights.&&It's definitely up there - I was just watching one of the episodes with him in it last night. I thought about posting an Archer / Burt Reynolds gif, but they just made me kind of sad. Happy sad, as in thanks for the memories, but still sad.&&I think he liked spy stuff a lot, he also was in an episode of burn notice as a former spy that was fantastic. &&[deleted]&&“I don’t mean to sound Hollywood but...
Could I have my Pimms cup...”

Someone found you could do that run through the shortest route at about 75 mph and make it back with hours to spare.

Of course, factor in a few gas tank fillups, a couple of burgers at a choke and puke, and boffing Sally Field in her cutest tightest pair of pants and maybe it would run down to the wire.

The real problem would have come with that second bet of Boston Clam chowder in less than 18 hours.

He would have had to roll that big ass Caddy of Enos  at nearly 120 MPH average to even get there with time.  Not counting traffic...

But he lived a good and long life, and entertained many.&&I refuse to believe it. &&IT'S NOT TRUEEEE NOOOOOOO&&Burton. So his name is Burt. &&I wish I could give you more than one up vote for this glorious photo. &&I was just telling coworkers - my grandparents had a house in Jupiter and I used to occasionally get to go down there when I was a kid.  The Dinner Theater, the State Park - I remember seeing him waving from a helicopter when I was young.  As a kid that LOVED Smokey and the Bandit, seeing him was about as close to royalty as I could imagine at that age.  &&You lucky bastard.&&That moonshine tickled his ‘stache.&&I don’t care that there’s no proof that this is true.

I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE!&&When Dukes of Hazzard was filming in BR, my roommate at the time ended up as an extra in the jail scene as one of the prisoners in one of the bunks.  Apparently Burt was having an off day with his lines so the scene was taking a good while to shoot.  So long in fact that my roommate ended up nodding off in the bunk.  Now, he tends to be a bit gassy when he's sleeping, so he starts fogging the set, to the point that Burt started making ugly faces.  They wound up having to take a break to clear the air. 

So yeah, my roommate made Burt Reynolds gag.&&Was this ""moonshine"" or actually MOONSHINE? 

(if anyone doesn't understand, store bought moonshine sucks compared to the stuff that rolls out of those mountain hollers)&&And Deliverance&&""Ah yes, Movie Night. The Guild before your time tried to do a hostage thing. Jonas Venture. The big man in his space station. Ah, the 80s. We did that back then. Dumb kids gonna get famous, notorious. We dressed as crew members. Some of us had our space suits on, some of us didn't. With this face, the helmet never came off. Went perfectly, flawless. Well, until someone opened the bay doors. No one knew who did it. The crew shot out like their momma's were ringin' the dinner bell. You ever see a man die in space? You can tell the ones that held their breath. Their lungs rupture from all that gas expanding. Blood from their mouth like a torn pillow stuffed with red BBs. Stab Girl, she was a little thing. Carried switchblades. She knew to exhale. Watched her for a full minute. Puffed up like she had a peanut allergy, floatin' by me with her mouth open, screaming. Making no sound. Spit on her tongue boiling.

He wasn't aloof, or super macho, he was approachable and friendly and not the least bit intimidating.  I can't help but think that he had influence on me for the type of man I like.  Sorry to say, never bought in to the mustache, although it suited him well.  &&The man was one of the coolest mother fuckers there's ever been. That's a life well lived!&&I'm surprised he was 82.  Always thought he was younger.  RIP.&&He's one of the old guard, who started in the days of the old studio systems. An arrogant, husky, kind, spikey, old-school man.

Unless of course they put sunglasses on him and do a weekend at bernies thing.&&I found one of these ""cool trivia"" moments the other day that I'll share with you now.  The voice of Garfield the 80's cartoon is played by Lorenzo Music which  is the same voice as Bill Murray's character Peter in ""The Real Ghostbusters"" cartoon from the 80's.  Bill Murray would then later play the voice of Garfield in the Garfield movies.   Blew my mind.  Sorry for random comment, RIP Burt!  Cannonball and Smokey and the Bandit shaped my youth! &&> I think the same thing happened with Twin Peaks and the actress who played Log Lady.

Watching *Twin Peaks The Return* has another layer of emotion due to this, as well as with the others who had passed by the time the show aired (or shortly after): 

* Miguel Ferrer
* Warren Frost
* Harry Dean Stanton 

And then David Bowie allowed Lynch to use older footage as they never had an opportunity to film him before his passing. &&Man, I really hope so.  I know there aren't a ton of roles for men his age and he's not the best actor but it was somewhat sad as a fan of his early work to see all the direct-to-dvd movies he's done as of late.  I would love to see him go out with a good role albeit a small one that showcases his talent. &&With Catherine Coulson (the actress who played the Log Lady) IIRC she already knew that she had terminal cancer I believe and they specifically filmed her scenes ahead of time in anticipation of her passing. She died 2 years before the show aired and they dhot her stuff before anything else I think.

I think they said they wished they could have done something similar with David Bowie but nobody knew he was sick except those very close to him.&&They shot Catherine E. Coulson's scenes right away for Twin Peaks because she had terminal cancer and was not doing well.&&They may be half, but our mustaches will be at full salute.&&are we not shaving half of it to honor him?

Definitely has some of the most memorable climactic scenes I’ve ever seen.&&My god, I wish I could watch that movie again for the very first time.

I envy you.  It’s a masterpiece.  &&IMO Boogie Nights is one of the most underrated films of all time and his acting made the film what it was. Such a loss.&&My favorite movie. Honestly, if you like it (you will), you should watch it more than once. You'll find something new to love every time. Also, if you can get the director's commentary, it's one of the best ever made. I actually feel like I learned a lot about film-making from it.&&One of the best movies where the emotional landscape entirely flips.

The first half is funny, the second half is so, so dark.&&He also said that he wanted to punch Paul Thomas Anderson and that it wasn’t “his kind of movie” and filming it made him very uncomfortable. Kinda sad seeing as it’s arguably one of his best roles of the last 30 years. &&[This scene in Smokey and the Bandit](https://youtu.be/YkXgnqtH7tY) was actually Burt's idea. My family and I quote this movie a lot!&&We watched that film so many times growing up. Apart from Burt, the Pontiac Firebird was my dream car for a loooong time. &&Took the words outta my mouth. Hooper is my favorite. Just... so many pill jokes. Pure, concentrated 70's right there.&&When I was a kid, Hooper and the End were two of my favorite movies.&&Fuckin Hooper!&&Highly underrated Burt Reynolds flick.  Jan Michael Vincent as the young upstart stunt man and Robert Klein as the jerkoff director.

A good time was had by all.  

Thank you Mr. Reynolds.  &&""Gator Mcklusky is back.......with *amnesia*""&&His best role IMO&&>""...one of the episodes...""

Did he appear in multiple episodes?  I can only recall the one where he date's Archer's mom.&&excellent, I know what im watching tonight.

Someone found you could do that run through the shortest route at about 75 mph and make it back with hours to spare.

/s&&He was kinda like Lemmy in the fact that I kinda refused to believe he could die. Dude was timeless, RIP&&THATS IMPOSSIBLE!&&I will PM you what role I had on the film and you can dig it up yourself if you want it. 

I will say me and Burt weren't buddies or anything, he was a really nice co-worker for a few months back in 2013. I don't want this to come across as embellished or like I had a closer relationship with him than I did, because I did not. 

All I can say is he treated me well, he was polite to crew, was a professional, and I would have been honored to have had another chance to work with him.

Edit: This is one of the only one of my personal shots from set that had him in it. I have a lot more shots from set that don't have him, because it is generally bad form to harass the talent or try to sneak shots of them. I only felt this was semi-acceptable since a lot of people were getting snapshots and some crew were getting photos with him.

RIP Burt&&I still need to know what a diablo sandwich is. That movie is definitely one of my top 5 all time, I love it. It's my girlfriend testing movie.

Yes, I should be— GOOD LORD, WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THERE?&&I started watching archer recently and just yesterday I've seen this episode. I don't know how to express my feelings at the moment.&&Only one he got an Oscar nod for.&&Watch The Last Movie Star. I don't usually cry from movies, but the shit hits hard man. It's the best he's ever done, by far.&&Pretty sure he was in a couple while in a relationship with Malory in the show. &&Common misconception. It was actually Turd Ferguson. &&Also, I don't think the problem was having to do it in a Trans Am, it was having to do it in a semi.  You'll just get a ticket in the Trans Am, but if you get pulled over with the truck they'll want to see your manifest, and if they see your manifest is a lie and you're hauling alcohol across state lines (bootlegging) you're in big trouble.&&Yup. People also vastly underestimate how much less convenient the world was back then. Fewer interstates. Gas stations were much more rare, especially ones that could handle a semi. Then the number of pumps was lower, etc... etc... 

It is small stuff, but shit adds up.&&And millions of moustache hairs around the world stood on end in salute.&&Exactly, there is a part of me that will always be a small child seeing Smokey and the Bandit for the first time. Burt Reynolds was the coolest guy I had ever seen, he always will be. RIP.&&Search your feelings, you know it to be true!&&That's so nice. I'm going to let my guard completely down and believe all of your story because I have nothing to lose by doing so. Thanks for sharing. &&That sounds like MOONSHINE &&Sorry I meant *I'm* gay&&Don't forget Cannonball run&&Yeah just seeing recent pictures of him now and I realized my mental image of him were 20+ years old.

There used to be a trucker themed bar by my place that had a huge shirtless and kinda homoerotic mural of Burt Reynolds in a trucker outfit covering the door to the men's bathroom.  That's how I choose to remember him.&&Magnificent, even.&&Thank god. I have almost exactly the same body hair distribution and thought I was a hairy ape.&&Same pose. I'm waiting.&&The last true sploosh of all of our lives is gone &&Both&&This made me really, really,        really sad.&&TOO SOON.&&Yeah...why?&&It was Turd Ferguson&&No, it wasn't. It was Turd Ferguson.&&Its ACTUALLY very possible as he was supposed to headline a convention in October, when Burt should've been filming this movie, near me but now is lowered down and cancelled due to a ""Filming Commitment"". He cancelled maybe a few weeks ago, recently, so they may have known about Burts condition.

Heres the convention: http://www.chillertheatre.com/gt/gtc4.htm&&Think that was Sean Penn unless it happened a second time.

Louis ck made a joke before he was famous and then he abused Louis ck’s character in American hustle.

Probably said if he died before they went into production then go ahead and use old footage.&&I believe he gave permission while still alive but too ill to do any filming.&&He knew he was dying, the last album he released days before his death, Blackstar, is all about his slow, inevitable death. He must have known he wasn't physically up to the stress of filming for TV, even for a few short scenes. &&That was a Hell of a picture and a fantastic send off for him. Blended everything so well with his past and future, even if it was fictitious.&&I'll have to watch it. I was reading over the plot and it looked good enough but the cast looked......interesting. &&It's not been a good summer for Archer celebrity guests.&&I'm gonna watch Cannonball Run and maybe Celebrity Jeopardy. &&Or Sharky's Machine

I thought I saw him on the show Burn Notice about 5 years ago which the last acting I remember him in.

It’s bigger than a normal hat.&&At some point during filming he got pissed and started going after PTA. Crew members say Burt might've thrown a punch or two.

I loved going up the stairs and chopping dudes up with the blades, and going through the narrow passages fast to set the bombs up.&&I just realized RC helicopter was really a drone strike &&I'd wager a small percentage of reddit users were actually around in the 70s so that kinda makes sense. &&And a cop in every 90s TV show and movie&&Yes I'm sure this has nothing to do with the fact that a majority of Reddit users weren't alive in the 70s.&&Lol yes I was thinking that too. The guy was nominated for an Oscar and was an icon in the 70s.&&I mean, I remember his stuff from the 70's and whatnot. I was a big fan of Smokey and the Bandit when I was a kid, I really liked Deliverance when I saw it, but I grew up with things like Vice City and My Name Is Earl (he played Richard Chubby, the eccentric businessman who owned a lot of the local businesses, most notably the strip club, Club Chubby, who eventually died when he mixed up his vodka gun and his real gun). So yeah, I know his 70's stuff and I like a lot of it, but the memories from such a young age of seeing and hearing him in these other things hold the stronger emotional pull.&&[deleted]&&Which is why we have Bandit in the Trans-Am to keep the cops busy and not pull over the Semi...&&I-20 was open then, which will take you all the way from Shreveport to Atlanta, except the Bandit for some reason goes through Arkansas on presumably the I-30 route, then inexplicably heads north toward Fayetteville which is totally out of the way.&&East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'.  We gonna do what they say can't be done.&&It was one of the first movies I remember watching with my Dad and younger brother. My brother texted me saying part of his childhood has died and I feel the same. 



Sure it was a bit cheesy, and today the story is outdated, but it perfectly captured a slice of 70's good old boy Southern Americana. 

RIP Burt.

Apparently they wanted to do the movie 10 years before that. The story is pretty interesting. I think the timing was quite timely? What a movie. It helps to have seen his old movies and know about his personal life, but the movie does a fictionalized version of it (ex-wife).

Its crazy expensive.  && Was really expecting this to be a 5 second underwhelming clip, like in parks and recreation&&Don't monetize the video.  The mouse will come for you.&&Funny how the universe works, my 3 year old and I were just watching Toy Story 3 this afternoon. It's a joy to share my favourites with him. He's obsessed! This was fantastic guys and I can't wait to show him!&&Why did you start with 3?&&You're both doing something in media right? This cannot just be a regular side hobby??? This is so professional - just all of it screams 110% effort.&&Haha I had a smile on my face the whole time &&More power to you. That was pretty awesome!&&How did u do the animation &&This is so impressive. Can't wait to see more and good luck to all involved - you can feel how much work went into this!&&I just realized Andy didn't have any friends and just stayed inside and played with his toys all day...
Feelsbadman&&That is some dedication. Bravo!&&OP are you guys the ones who made the original one for toy story one, or were you just inspired?&&Now this is how to watch toy story 3 for free&&You ever see parks and rec?&&My best friend plays Bonnie is toy story 3!&&Can’t wait to see Mr. Tortilla Head!&&this is amazing i can't wait to see the whole thing !! you sir have made my day ☺&&Please feel free to skip the 'when you loved me' segment. It would wreck me.&&You look like the pixarist on instagram&&I will pay to see this competed&&Great work on the stop motion!&&In before Disney issues a cease and desist. &&You mean it’s a passion project until Disney sues you into submission?&&Did you get Disney's cease and desist order yet? &&Love it. Looks great, seriously. I’m very impressed! I am a cam op in the industry and let me just say, the only advice I would ever think about giving out to you, (as you obviously got some editing skills) - is to flag the production when you’re shooting stop-motion. A flag is a semi-translucent filter or sheet/cover that you’d use to cover above your shot, so that the drifting clouds/elapsed daytime don’t reflect in your stop motion on your models. Prevents different light sources. Cheers!&&Did you guys do that remake of the first one too?&&!Remind me 5 minutes &&You two are going somewhere, hopefully film school. &&I don't even know you and I'm proud of you.  Not necessarily for the great work you did, though it was great, but for being a highschool kid who chooses to spend time on such a cool project with his little brother.&&This is unbelievable. It looks, sounds and feels great. Really well edited! &&C&D in 3... 2... 1...&&Good now we don’t need Disney to remake it as live action! 

Great job man. &&I forgot how emotional just the trailer was. . .&&Started out weak but the end was pretty good. &&I still have the actual film trailer from the original one. I use to work at a movie theater. I also attempted stop motion once. I commend you. &&This is beyond impressive. You guys deserve a gold medal for this astounding work. Such attention to detail even with the labor intensive, unforgiving medium of stop-motion. Not o mention you’re using actual toys to create stop motion. I bet this has been unbelievably tedious. 

I can’t wait to see the entire thing.&&That took some commitment. Great work&&Do drive pizza planet truck and live in AZ?&&Could a depressed person make this?!&&Cant even imagine the ridiculous amount of work this required. Well done. It looks amazing.&&This shows you how important good sound is to a movie.  Those professional voice actors that almost by themselves bring the character to life, the sound editing, the music composition, the quality at every stage is what makes this “real” version possible.  If you had to make the audio from scratch, you would have to come to terms with just how shit your version is without the original audio.
Don’t get me wrong, it’s cute and all, but the audio is what sells it and without it you wouldn’t have anything.&&Amazing work!!!  &&That is totally awesome! &&This is incredible!! &&But ... but...3 is the worst one. &&How did you get Paul Dano to do this project?&&Disney should turn a blind eye to this. I realize lawyers don’t care and probably feel like it’s the PR department’s job to deal with the fall out, but let’s not return to the days of a soulless Eisner Disney. Bob Iger has done a decent job balancing the creative wonder and business side of the company, and not being too dickish. Hope it continues.&&Dude that's amazing.

The voice overs are awesome!&&Amazing work&&27k upvotes and 6k views lol&&The original had better graphics. Hollywood needs to stop with the remakes already.&&Danggggg OP this is super impressive.&&Awesome! Looking forward to the Cease and Desist! I always love it when people make stuff like this then announce it before it's done, it's always fun not seeing the end results because someone couldn't be patient..&&Okay. Im sold. &&☺ &&How long till wrap up OP?  When and where are you planning to show it?  &&What software do you use for stop motion?&&I see no one asking so I’ll do it: why? &&At the time of writing this comment:

Awesome job&&This movie gives me feels like very few things can. Seeing a nostalgic remake about a movie that leans on nostalgia... I don't know if my poor heart can take it. Well done.&&WOW!!!!! 🙌🏻&&This is incredible!! Can't wait to see it&&Looks nice. Just have 2 questions:

1: where did you get the Woody and Buzz?

2: Did you guys do the first movie in IRL too?&&when did everyone get their mouth glued shut?&&Words cannot describe my joy for this!&&You are completly mad and I love it!!!!!!!!&&Hey!

I’ll send it along to him. &&Maybe they'll make a movie about moving toys!&&I'm sure theyd reward them with a lawsuit for copy right violation ..  kidding they should buy the idea off them&&Hey, here’s the deal. Whatever happens, happens. The last thing we’re out to do is offend any of the talented individuals at Disney/Pixar that we look up to.&&Unlikely if they do not monetize it. This has been up for 5 years: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G0j_Huv2Fg&&Yea they actually have algorithms that troll social media sites for their songs and images to send take down notices. My buddy posted a video of his 4 year old daughter singing to a song from frozen in the car and they sent him a C&D. 

Disney are so protective that they even have a place where students can report their teachers for using Disney videos/songs/images in class. Training a whole generation of snitches.&&There won’t be a letter.  Job offer is more likely. Disney is a bitch sometimes, but they appreciate talent. &&This was actually incredibly well done, thanks for linking it! Even with the extra-janky effects of the moving Truck scene I was still on edge like I was when first watching it (I was wondering how they were going to pull that off without the huge budget required). 

I also can't imagine how hard it was to sync it up with the audio. It put a serious smile on my face. &&I know the guy that did that one. He went to the college I attended. He's a really cool guy.&&I was in the house when they filmed the dog running down the stairs. 

Good times. &&Commenting for future reference. Thanks!&&Future reference comment #001&&Thanks. A lot. Not sure exactly. I watched it all the way through 3 times in a day once. &&Even watching this trailer reminds me of the first time I was glad I was wearing 3D glasses so no one could see me cry...then looking around and seeing almost every fully grown man wiping their eyes.

Perfect 5/7&&Check out the story of the Wolfpack boys.  It’s a group of like 7 brothers who were never allowed to go outside and learned everything from movies.

&&I was gonna say... Cease and desist in 3....2...1...&&Oh some kids that were inspired by our movies made a fanmade trailer that obviously took time and dedication? Let's reward them with punishment but always remind them to follow your dreams!

That’s going on the ‘ol resume. &&Yep. This won't end well now with them getting exposure....&&People worry too much!  First creator is a most likely a minor, I would guess does not have much money that Disney cares about.  If OP is not making money Disney will do more damage to there name by and reputation for suing kids that are having fun than some video will do to them.  (If anything you could say this benefits Disney as free advertisement for them).  Yes, the pessimists could find some rare case that this could happen to go to court but the odds would be a million to one that it would ever happen so stop listening to all the negative media that reports only the bad.  Disney is more concerned with the hundred's of copies of the official Toy Story 3 that have been downloaded and streamed legally in the length of time it took to type this!!!&&...the fuck did I just read?&&VHS effects by hand!?&&Have you not considered buying a VHS camera?&&How long did it take to get all the items from the movie?&&VHS effects frame by frame....what.&&> VHS effects were done by hand, frame by frame

In the past 2 weeks, I've gotten 2 posts in /r/movies taken down by reddit due to DMCA takedown requests. It had never happened once in 5+ years and thousands of posts. Spooky stuff, they were just movie posters too.&&We used to reenact Lady And The Tramp with our Pound Puppies. We never filmed, but Disney still broke into our play room and made us change it to Bitch And That Ho Over There (no abbreviation existed in the 80s).&&Can they use the audio from the movie?&&Santa will bring extra lawsuits to OP's home this year &&No good job, is without its cease and desist&&Sadly I think you're right. What happened to the real life toy story 1. I couldn't find it again &&Just finish making it and leak it to torrent sites&&Hey man, more power to you! Whatever the outcome, you and your bro have thousands of hours of experience filmmaking stop-motion. I’m probably not the first to mention the intellectual property issue, so you’re well aware. Companies like Disney, even if they are good overall, tend to file lawsuits against IP violations because even if your film is innocent, the next guy could do something sinister with Disney IP and it wouldn’t look good if they went easy on you.  I highly doubt anyone at Disney/Pixar would be offended. In fact, I’m sure they love projects like yours. Business is business, though. Just my 2 cents; good luck with the film! &&I adapted a Shell Silverstein poem into music and my friend loved it and suggested we make an animated short out of it. We spent 5 or 6 years developing it and finally finished it last year. My friend reached out to the estate for rights to license the poem. No dice. We can't share it publicly. No festivals. Not even on YouTube.&&Oh, I guarantee you every single person who worked on anything Toy Story related **LOVES** this.

You won't even be offending the lawyers.

You are however offending the legal obligations of those lawyers that they are forced at gun point to defend by some powerful whomever at the top who set the company standard. Who by the way, friggin' loves this too!&&I doubt this would ever offend the talented people who worked on the movie.

The lawyers on the other hand...&&Hopefully instead of a cease and desist they'll want to hire you to work in the big leagues&&I wouldn’t worry about it.   You are clearly doing it for recreational, not commercial purposes.   &&i think you're fine someone already remade toy story 1 with live action and the entire movie is still on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G0j_Huv2Fg)&&The creators will probably be flattered, it's the lawyers who you need to worry about!&&IANAL but unless there’s some sort of automated mechanism that sends a takedown notice to YouTube I think it’d be pretty shitty for them to take it down. This is great work and, if something you wanted to make in to a career, should result in at minimum an internship or mentoring opportunity. &&I'm pretty sure this would be covered under fair use as you're remaking it in a different format. It's basically a derivative work. &&Thanks for posting this. I was having some crazy flashbacks. I could've sworn I've seen this exact same thread on reddit before. &&Do you ever get so filled up with optimism that you just projectile vomit across your living room?&&I bet he was. Man, look at how small this world is. /u/EAPSER knew the same guy too. He said he was in the house during one of the dog scenes.&&Tell him I'm in awe. &&Looks like you and /u/kryofylus both knew the guy. He is more famous than we or he knows it!

If you still have his contact, tell him that watching his live action is the most nostalgic experience I have had in the past 10 years. I mean... I am only 26 but... I watched that movie when I was 6 years old. And to be reminded about 20 years later!&&but you can just save the post &&Same &&Are you my son ?&&I've never used 3D glasses and now I'm questioning every decision I've ever made.&&One of my favorite lines from the entire series :)&&> ""The Force Awakens"" remaking ""A New Hope"" shot by shot?

Time isn’t wasted when you’re getting wasted. /s

Have to add that I really like some of Asher’s other lyrics, and it feels wrong to bash a rapper I enjoyed. Also have to add when that song came out I liked it. &&I literally had it in my hand today at the Disney Store. He was $30 as well was Buzz. Toy Story is my absolute favorite animated movie!
I want to have my own Buzz and Woody toys. I didn't buy it, because Woody was in a open box, so I was worried it would get dusty. 
This trailer made my heart warm, thank you for sharing and I love that you have this as a passion project. I'm stunned by the awesomeness of this!&&try 500-600. I think it used to be even higher.

Disney is the king of cease and desist.  
 &&Yeah, that was my question.  I expect the audio is copyrighted and hence if this video is monetized in anyway, the producer is due for a lawsuit.&&No, you might be able to get away with doing it with original audio, but if they were to use the audio from the film, Disney lawyers would for sure be all over them.&&They might be able to get away with it if they release a silent version and you just have to find your own audio &&Yeah, we wouldn't download a toy car...&&Yes, or put it on PeerTube.&&[deleted]&&So better to ask permission beforehand probably&&Well, you can always air it on torrent and pm me the magnet URL :)

That being said, I agree that chances of a c&d letter are high :(&&Of course! But when you're literally starting out, there are so many unknown unknowns. By the time we got to a point where we were basically finished with the key frame edit it's too late to turn back. All great experience but, yeah, it isn't lost on me that we definitely should have researched the process for licensing before we started.

Which is a damn shame. Copyright law in this country is extremely broken and the result is a lot of creative stagnation. The US has always been the hub of the global entertainment industry, but it’s copyright policies are certain to kill that over time because none of the classic work from the last century is available to the population in a way that allows for creative development like the work of OP. &&OK.

They can make the argument that by realising a free shot by shot recreation (and using same voice acting) less people will buy original. Even if OP makes no money Disney can still claim lost revenue.

They can also make the argument that using the voice track from the original film is copyright infringement.

Idk if OP could make a valid defence here. But Disney has all the money and lawyers needed to make this a very long battle. &&My sister wrote a masters thesis about Disney animation and someone from Disney went through all the images she used and told her which ones she was allowed to show and which ones not. The thesis was never even available online.&&You truly do not know how laws work in the US.

They work to make the money piles, on average, fewer and bigger, and to protect those living in the reflected glow of the money piles.

Books could be written to explain and document those two pillars of the legal system. But as of now you have the key information.

Any paragraph written anywhere to suggest that the US legal system has any secondary or tertiary object not directly or indirectly buttressing the two pillars, was written by a liar, a fool, or a tool of the system.

Nonetheless, there is a certain something that is just... agreeable and neat, for lack of a better description... in how you can use physical, macro processes (cutting the physical medium with scissors, and taping resulting segments together!) to achieve a similar end result, even though the media involved is still in an encoded form; you're effectively concatenating sequences of analog data, and you don't even have to transcode it or whatever first, just plain splicing it works.&&I'm one year older than you and watched Home Alone on VHS until I wore out the tape.&&Oh this will help.

Directed by Tommy Wiseau.

Starring Tommy Wiseau.

Released by Tommy Wiseau.&&Surprisingly uncensored during the sex parts, hopefully YouTube doesn’t take it down


Edit: it’s unlisted now so this comment is irrelevant

The fuck?&&Where's my fucking money, Denny?&&Okay. I have genuine questions. 

1. Did we miss a scene where she started to say he hit her? 
2. Why did Mark randomly hit that dude while they played catch? 
3. What happened with the drugs thing? 
4. I swear the mother said they were together for 5 years, yet he said 7. Which is it? 
5. How much time is supposed to pass throughout this movie? I'd say a lot, but the wedding was always a month away, so I'm not confident. 
6. What was the point of...95% of the scenes? Coffee shop, boys night, random tuxedos, random couple boning, etc. 
7. Speaking of couples boning, what's with the way that guy moved his mouth?

Okay. I have to stop and leave questions for others. But seriously, I want answers! &&Of course, you haven't really watched The Room until it's in a theatre with people throwing plastic spoons and playing football in the aisle.&&That was even more glorious than I could have hoped for.

Its over. Honestly not the worst thing I've ever seen...that title still goes to either of the Mortal Kombat movies and/or The Happening.

Or at least, least, he got friend zoned by somebody. He didn’t make this up. I would LOVE to watch her version of this movie. Ma’am, if you are out there, please move to LA and self fund a movie.

Just served Greg today. Super cool guy! &&Damn didn't realize that 2.5 minute sex scene was in the first 10 minutes.  Did he dub in his lines? 
 What the hell am I watching?&&Never seen it before today, and I just watched the first 45 minutes.

I finally understand oh hi mark. So much older man butt wth? This poor woman is getting a barrage of dicks. Is this a failed episode of Red Shoe Diaries?

“Your my favorite customer ever” - best line so far. That whole exchange was like proper aliens trying their hardest to mimic human interaction. Wowsers.

Saw him in DC, he signed a butt plug (I thought what is the funniest thing to have him sign, bought one, he signed it without a question), then when we got to the theater they were lining up for the Q&A. I got in line, said that our relationship was built on The Room, as we met online and I sent her my copy of DA, and asked for advice. He said incoherent stuff about percentages and ended with ""get married before you die old and alone like I am."" I said we would if he officiated.

She fucking loved it!!! 

We have movie pass and see quite a bit of movies at home as well. However, I can attest as well as she can, that this movie is better than most films that come out today.

Lexibanner's questions

1. tbf, I think there actually was a scene where she said that, I don't know how he found out about it though.

2. There's a weird subplot about Mark's guilt making him more aggressive but it doesn't really go anywhere.

3. Lol nothing, they forgot to finish that.

4. Yup.


5. A month maybe?

6. Tommy kind of just shot scenes he wanted to shoot, I suppose.

7. Its hilarious that I know *exactly* what you're talking about here.



&&It's quite an experience but for those thinking of going to a theater showing of The Room, don't make it the first time you're watching the movie. You won't be able to hear a thing since the audience will talk over the whole movie, at least from my experience when watching it in LA when Tommy did a showing there earlier this year.

Much better watching it with a group of friends for your first viewing.&&I work at a theater went with some friends back in high school that had never heard of it and  were kinda skeptic over what the hell it was. They were crying 10 mins in from laughing and so many spoons were thrown. We live on the east coast so there’s never many screening near us. Honestly one of the best experiences at the movies period.&&Tommy has really cracked the  code to fight piracy. How many movies can do what The Room did, where people pay for movie ticket(s), not only after 10+ years of its release, but also after watching so many times at home? The Room is a movie not to be watched alone at home (*well maybe only the first time). It is an experience. It is truly a masterpiece. &&Could you explain all the rituals and stuff they do during the movie?&&Can confirm, it's a fucking experience&&It doesn't make sense outside of the theater.&&Now go and watch The Disaster Artist. 

It's a movie about how The Room was made, starting the Franco brothers. It's actually really good. &&Hahaha... What a story, Mark.&&There's no need to apologize. Go now. Spread the word. Share with loved ones&&Like sand

I don't like the sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating

And it gets *eeeverrywheere*&&You're little bit nosey guy&&I love how impossible those stairs are&&The best part? Tommy owned the building they filmed the San Francisco background shots on.&&I like how Mark even turns to the left like the stairs have a 90 degree bend, even though it would take him right out the side of the building. The actors just hiding in the little shack while the rest of the scene is shot is hilarious.&&I knew it was greenscreened but I never noticed how obvious it was before. Now it's the only thing I notice and it hurts my eyes.&&They shot the green screen background on one of their last days, a small remote film crew making a trip to San Francisco for B-roll.

What's ridiculous is Tommy let the crew shoot the footage from the roof of a building, that turned out to be his property. People were asking themselves ""But why didn't we just shoot the roof scenes here with a few of the actors and the remote crew, why green-screen it when you had an actual picturesque roof available?""

The answer my friend, is blowin' in the wind.&&I love him trying to display athleticism by clumsily throwing the ball up and down. Very obviously not a man familiar with footballs lol. &&That's some amazing tracking work.  Holy shit.&&It’s famously the worst movie ever made. &&Well it's a movie that tells a story that was made by a man that doesn't seem to understand how movies, stories or even people work. It made creative choices that many film makers would never even consider.&&Yes, very much so if you enjoy bad movies, and maybe even if you don’t. It’s kind of hypnotic in how strange it is. Best description is that it’s like if you gave an alien a collection of soap operas and melodramatic movies to watch, then asked him to make a movie about human relationships.&&Watch it with friends, it's a bonding experience.  &&Its high art, you haven't lived until you watch the room&&Yes, although I think it's easier to enjoy it if you watch it with a group of people. (alcohol also helps)&&Yes. It's awful, but in the most hilarious way possible. Every instinct Tommy has as an actor, writer, director, and editor are bizarre on so many levels and never come close to working in any traditional sense. That being said, it is entertaining.

I'd especially recommend watching with a group of friends and alcohol for the ultimate viewing experience. Especially if said friends haven't seen it either&&So here’s the thing. Objectively, it’s one of the worst movies to ever be made. But... it’s like major actors know when a movie is shit and you can tell. Tommy honestly thought he was giving us a masterpiece. And therein lies the rub. His sincerity bleeds through. He was honestly trying. This movie is horrible. This movie is extremely enjoyable. This movie sticks with you and not in a bad way. &&Ok I just watched it for the first time and let me put it this way.  It's like someone who had only heard verbal descriptions of a movie and how to make one made and wrote a movie.  The pieces are all there but they are just so out of place.  Like Two characters go for a run but they bring a football and throw it non stop on the run while asking each other how its going about four times in 12 seconds.

It was the most bizarre thing I have ever seen.&&Watch it yourself the first time. Then get all your friends over, buy a couple of drinks and have the time of your life.&&Yes&&It depends... do you definitely have breast cancer?&&Oh hi Mark!&&It's bullshit!&&Its sure something special.

Hopefully now Samurai Cop gets on there! Epic bad movie too.&&My wife ordered the DVD and a t-shirt for me for Christmas last year. I'm still waiting for it.&&Does it also go in the belly button?&&I tried, I really did, but gave up by the second ridiculously long sex scene with bad music. I can't watch this.

Buckets of fried chicken and hot n readys will take you far for little. &&You're going to have to explain that one. First, surely it depends on the number of people being served. Second, I find it hard to believe any catering service will cost less than about $8 per person.&&That could describe the entire production of the movie. The man bought both a film camera and an HD digital camera, and then had a custom rig made to use them side by side. As far as I remember, it’s a more common practice to just rent them.&&Well so is buying your own cameras haha&&I think the joke is that Wiseau had (still has?) a reputation for trying to get any video relating to The Room taken down. It used to be that if you posted a video review of the movie, Wiseau’s lawyers were certain to come after you.&&YouTube is an international multi billion dollar media monster the likes of which have never been seen in all of recorded history......VS Tommy Wiseau?

Tommy's out busting deals at the bank then he's back to his house for some more full penetration.&&Please nobody report it. Watching those scenes will be the closest I come to sex this month.&&I know TV shows I buy go into my YouTube account and load thru the site. Do movies work the same way? I'd imagine if movies they sell with sexual content can be loaded to the account, this would be allowed with some age restriction. If not, that's super hypocritical and deserves protest. &&The title of this post tells you that Tomy Wiseau posted it.&&>It's an unlisted video so it's probably good

This literally has nothing to do with anything. I've had unlisted videos taken down for music. If it hits their scanners or gets reported it can be taken down. &&God, forgive me. BOOM. &&I think Criterion actually listens to their customers, I requested Night of the Living Dead like 3 years ago and brought up that it's in the public domain and sure enough it recently got a release.&&General Wiseaubi!&&It's by far the most well known so bad it's good movie, probably of all time. &&The Criterion Collection is a boutique blu-ray label, their mission statement basically saying “[we release] important classic and contemporary films”, usually loaded up with tons of supplemental features and the highest available quality master for their releases. 

THE ROOM, be it one of the worst movies ever made, has become not just culturally relevant, but important. Despite how bad it is, it lives up to their mission statement completely...&&I TREAT LIKE A PRINCESS AND EW STAHB ME IN THE BEHCK&&Cheep cheep cheep cheeeee-eeeeee.&&And I'm dying.

Why does she not react to the news. Why don’t we hear about it ever again in the film &&8.I guess not.

9.I think the intent of the line was that Denny just likes seeing them together, and does not totally understand the notion of sex, or his feelings about it, because he is a young child in this scene. Your follow up question, no doubt, is ""wait isn't he explicitly stated to be a college student in a later scene, with a girlfriend and a drug problem, why is he a prepubescent who doesn't totally understand sexuality in the first scene?"" The answer to this is that Tommy does not understand human juveniles and considers them all to be the same thing. That, or he really did intent to paint Denny as a pervert who jacks off to his friends doing it.

12.The breast cancer does not come back into the story.

&&While being high on weed i could add: cliche i know but it made the experience 400% better for me; never laught so much in my life&&Dude, I think the opposite. Always go to a viewing first.

from what I remember that alley set was torn down and then put back up for additional shots, costing even more money. &&Best part for me was I didn't realize it was a green screen until it was pointed out to me.&&The answer is that Tommy is a vampire and couldn't be out in the day.&&It's real Hollywood movie&&>	It’s famously the *best* worst movie ever made.

Tommy is a real American movie maker and not a YouTube boy.&&The blu ray isnt even HD. Its just the dvd version on a blu ray disc. &&AFAIK, the digital version was never released.

That would look bad.

For example, the Star Wars prequels were shot digitally in 1080p. (Episode II was one of the first movies to ever be shot fully digitally.)

Its pacing (outside maybe the sex scenes) works perfectly for 'ironic watching' since it's so dialogue-driven, allowing the terrible writing and fundamental misunderstanding of the human condition to be so pervasive through  \*every\* scene.

I enjoyed Troll 2, but found there were significant stretches that just dragged on.&&Troll 2 was made to be a cult movie from the start. No way anyone took that seriously. But The Room genuinely tried to be good. That's what makes it great. Troll 2 is just a bad movie. &&Adam Sandler movie? When I was younger, me and girlfriend at the time didn't have cable or Internet for like 2 months because we spent all of our money just getting the house. We had that and ""after the sunset"" on DVD. I can't even count how many times I saw jack and Jill and now I sometimes randomly watch it.

But yeah certain shots are from his digital camera and so they look even more fucked. &&\> A movie wouldn’t be released in 4K if parts were shot in less than 4K. That would look bad.

If a movie uses different cameras in the first place, then the difference in picture quality is probably an intentional choice.

It's supposed to convey that the characters have a brighter future ahead of them.&&Well, that’s not technically accurate. You can still upscale things.

From what I remember it delves into it a little (stuff about importing and selling fake designer clothing) and some stuff about maybe he bought at the right time some real estate that he could rent out, but I'm unsure if that could account for all the money. 

What is there is vague. &&>Does it shed anymore light on his income source?

Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1400/&&Actual good business sense until he decided to make a movie.&&Tommy's backstory and income is more or less revealed, although it's unclear if Greg is being vague about it because Tommy still never told him everything, or he just didn't want to piss him off by publishing it.&&Damn maybe he's smarter than we thought &&Mostly correct. You don’t gain a lot in terms of resolution, so upscaling stuff captured in 1080p doesn’t give you much. It does give you a little in terms of the creators being in charge of the upscale (for better or worse) instead of the TV.  You also gain a little bitrate. Normal blurays cap out at 40ish mbps whereas 4K blurays go up to 120ish. (For reference, raw camera footage from an Arri Alexa is ~1200mpbs. And they only do 3.2K, not 4K. Netflix 1080p streams are like... 8-10 mpbs.)

It also depends a lot on the upscale. Some upscales do look pretty good, and it allows the creators to do a new color pass with HDR if they want. 

Now... Can you tell the difference? Is it worth it? Probably not, especially on a normal-sized TV. On the flipside, there are movies that were actually captured in higher resolution that are really lazily remastered in 4K and don’t look at all better than their 1080p release. 

TLDR: It’s confusing. &&Over at least 7/8 million dollars worth though?&&I think you missed the part in the book where it talks about his retail store.

Edit: getting more reports of things that should/shouldn't be on the list. Netflix catalogues vary by country so I won't be updating this anymore, you can stop commenting. &&To be more accurate, Netflix also has 75 of the bottom 250 list of movies that no one's ever heard of...&&This is why I went back to the Netflix DVD by mail service. They technically have almost every movie in their library, unfortunately a lot of them have “Short Wait” or “Long Wait” next to them. 

Edit: This is what I’m talking about 
http://imgur.com/askb1nc&&All I want is an A to Z list of everything in Netflix's library. That's it. Is that really too much to ask for? &&In the US, the UK is worse. 

Isn't not necessarily netflix's fault though. Studios will want charge a premium for these films as people will still buy them. 

Netflix is pretty terrible for films and all about box set TV.&&Only? How does that number compare to Netflix's streaming subscription competitors - HBO, Amazon Prime, and Hulu?&&What can they do? The studios won't license them the movies anymore. It's not that they don't want to, it's that either it's becoming too expensive or they can't.

i.e, it used to take like 100K to rent one of those top 250 movies for a year.

Now, because of competitors like Hulu, Amazon Video, and whatever Disney is trying to start up, but especially because of Hulu, they say ""Nah, netflix, you have a lot of success, we want 20 million""

&&I didn't know Netflix still had 35 movies.&&[deleted]&&Nonsense, we need more tv series about a murder on a small town in Europe&&Don't they rotate movies in and out of their library with some regularity? It's probably a fiscal decision not to make all 250 available at once, but to spread them out so that a few dozen are available at any given time. &&netflix has 5,744 ""titles"" total

netflix has 274 ""titles"" total from 1920-1995



&&It's 10 goddamn dollars a month! Netflix became such a reliable, useful service, that now people have forgotten that Netflix isn't supposed to solve every entertainment problem on the plant. It's 10 goddamn dollars a month. 

*Only 35 of the best 250 movies?!? How dare they?*

Who has more? &&Netflix is basically a $12 a month subscription to The Office.&&I have subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. They are literally all the same. It's like opening a fridge full of food but then claiming there's nothing to eat.&&People out here with no industry experience. Do you have any idea how fucking tightly the rightsholders hold those rights? (Wordplay intentional).

When you have a hit movie, you don't want a flat fee license deal with Netflix, you want points on the play with some pay-per-rental or digital purchase system.

Stop bitching and either be grateful Netflix exists or unsubscribe from it.

Edit: Thanks for the Gold, anon. Cheers to you.&&In my experience Prime Video has a much better roster of the classic 80s and 90s films. &&I remember when Netflix had a smaller but better quality catalog, it takes me so long to cycle through all the garbage movies nowadays. &&Only? I'm too lazy to the math but considering every single movie that's ever been made? 35 out of 250 is pretty damn solid.&&[deleted]&&I remember a time when this title would be a positive thing...&&35 is a pretty solid number I would say. You can watch one movie every day for over a month for only 10 dollars or something. Have fun buying them on bluray. will cost you hundreds of dollars.&&IMDb top 250 isn't exactly the end all be all of good movies, it's a pretty generic list. &&I'm impressed that a single streaming service with a rotating selection currently offers 14% of the top films.&&Who cares about IMDB  ratings anyways, it's not perfect.

Your Highness is on Netflix and thats apparently 5.5, even less on rotten tomatoes.  In my eyes, its 9 or higher... 
&&Another week, another shitty Netflix hit piece.  $12 is a small price to pay compared $120 a month + box ""leases.""

So yeah Mr. Paid author, I'm still sticking to Netflix.  Only way tbat would change that is if they put in ads.&&""Only""

Considering those are the best movies made and are probably in high demand for streaming services this isn't surprising in the least.&&I do get tired of the seriousness of the Netflix library. Sometimes I just want to watch a classic comedy that isn't staring zach galifianakis or Adam sandler. &&Are they supposed to have more or something? &&Netflix : Why not?  Its a good movie.&&> And they ALWAYS recommend them to me. I have already seen No Country for Old Men like 20 times, NOT TONIGHT!


""Not Interested"" button...how I miss you..&&for me, that's a movie I would always like to have the option to watch. it would be cool if you could archive like 10 movies that will never phase out. &&Lol, If I know I'll watch something more than three times, I buy it. I've seen No Country a bunch of times, but it's my copy.&&Gotta make up for everyone pulling their movies off Netflix somehow &&Netflix original content is extremely hit or miss too. It used to be fantastic but it's sort of become a bloated mess in the last year or two.&&And they're spending it on half-baked shit no other studio wants.&&Many big Hollywood films cost somewhere between say $100m-$350m, so they should in theory be pumping out several big budget films a year as well as plenty of premium television. I do feel their TV content is okay, but seriously, can you name any out of this world films? I can't. &&They took the “throw everything at the wall, hoping something sticks” approach, which is fucking dumb. When you’re a streaming service, the quality of your shit matters. If your business model is to market your own shows, you can’t have those shows be bad. Ridiculous, it’s a brand and clearly they’ve fucked up their brand. &&HBO, Amazon and Hulu have 44 combined.  Also, the list is outdated.  Netflix has 37.  The number one streaming service with the most is Filmstruck with 43....yes....I had a bit of time to kill.

* Filmstruck: 43
* Netflix: 37
* Kanopy: 30
* Amazon Prime: 20
* Starz: 17
* HBO: 13
* Hulu: 11
* Hoopla: 9

&&Thats the important question. If you own a top 250 movie, its properly more profitable to avoid streaming and still make digital or DVD sales. &&HBO's selection is smaller, but it's mostly great movies, they get new, good movies fairly often, and they're very good about bundling sequels so you can marathon a particular franchise of films. 

HBO currently has the best content right now, imo.&&In my country HBO actually have movies with very good IMDB scores, rarely I see something less than 6. Unfortunetely that also includes ambitious critically acclaimed movies like black and white dutch production about woman having a 3,5 hour mental breakdown while buttering the toast and some shit like this, but I'm too stupid and ignorant to enjoy movies like that. Give me more blockbusters to enjoy on sunday evening. &&Seems that prime has like 13.i can't find a list for Hulu &&This list is outdated. Just this month Dead Poet Society, Casino, Batman Begins, and the Dark Knight were all taken off netflix.&&Thank you for this. 

&#x200B;

I was personally sad to see 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' go which I think sits in at #9.&&I'm looking at the list and seeing pretty good movies.  Not that it's shitty but I would've never guessed that *Hachi: A Dog’s Tale* would be a top 250 movie.&&I think my big problem is how they get random movies out of a franchise without the original or sequels. Like where's Bourne Identity?&&There is only a bottom 100 list. I generally agree though.&&Yet they don't have The Room. &&..from Bollywood.&&I'm shocked there's that many. You would think they could use the massive revenue from their originals to buy some good movies but apparently not.

Edit: People below have proven my ignorance. Carry on.&&We all know you only use Netflix to watch t.v. show like The Office and....... The Office.&&If you are in the US then the public library system is also often quite good for getting films. In MN my brother can get basically any film sent to his local library in one or two days on request.&&I'm a little amazed at the amount of titles that aren't available on Blu-ray in their catalog.

I've gotten a couple of discs so far that were broken, only to be sent back and they don't have a replacement and they haven't gotten a replacement in **YEARS**.

It is not worse, but better. I count 40 movies in Netflix UK from IMDB top 250 (according to [unogs](http://unogs.com/countrydetail/) data):

Touch of Evil, Ben-Hur, Some Like It Hot, To Kill a Mockingbird, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, Per qualche dollaro in più, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Jaws, Network, Taxi Driver, Life of Brian, Das Boot, Scarface, Back to the Future, Full Metal Jacket, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction, Se7en, Fargo, Good Will Hunting, Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Cidade de Deus, Inglourious Basterds, Der Untergang, Swades: We,  the People, Million Dollar Baby, Rang De Basanti, Babam ve Oglum, How to Train Your Dragon, Taare Zameen Par, The Wolf of Wall Street, Warrior, Prisoners, Django Unchained, Guardians of the Galaxy, Hacksaw Ridge, PK, Whiplash, La La Land, Dangal.&&A lot of good discussion, especially as to what movies are actually available vs just putting a number on things.  But since you did ask...

Using reelgood.com , IMDb top, sorted by IMDb score, the Top 240 (the other 10? no idea):

Netflix: 35  
HBO: 13  
Amazon Prime (not counting channels): 22  
Hulu: 13  

Just to add:  
FilmStruck: 47  
Starz: 19  
EPiX: 19  
Tribeca Short List: 16  
Free services such as Crackle, Vudu: 16  

Total coverage across all services: 172  
Meaning not available: 68  

Total number of services listed ('free' excluded): 20 (fx and fox are essentially the same for these purposes)  

Stand-out items:  
The Dark Knight Rises - only available on tnt  
FilmStruck's selection from this top 240 is largely classic movies pre-1972 (some newer, with 2002's The Pianist being the latest)  
The Kid (1921) - available on 4 services: epix, Amazon Prime, FilmStruck, and the free SnagFilms service  &&Hulu lost their best movie content when The Criterion Collection pulled out & launched its own streaming service. Now their library is pretty much the same as Amazon's...which isn't much different in quality than Netflix. I prefer Prime's movie list over Netflix, but it may just be personal taste.&&Yeah, I thought it sounded pretty good. 35 of some of the best movies made in one place.&&Hulu has a ton of anime at least. Not just naruto and dbz. Shit you dont wanna watch. Its nice&&It's not just Disney.  All the major studios intend to set up their own streaming platforms.  That's why they are all pulling their movies from Netflix, Hulu, and Prime.  &&Stand up comedy specials is a goldmine apparently.  &&It’s so fucking annoying how I watched like 3 nature documentaries 2 months ago and now Netflix suggests I watch nothing but nature docs. I don’t care about the 9 hour long documentary on the water-gorillas ass-tit, Netflix, get your shit fixed. I enjoy movies as well, not shitty reality tv series. 

The suggestion formula combined with the selection and availability of titles is so bad that I’m considering just dropping it completely and sticking to HBO and Prime. &&the selection of movies is definitely netflix's fault and not the studios who would rather force people to buy the movie and not at all into piracy.

/s
&&>  a lot easier than using the Netflix dashboard

I think part of the problem is Netflix started pushing their tv shows, and it's become impossible to find movies on their site. 
&&There's actually a lot of quality on that list.&&People just love to shit on Netflix now because it doesn't have all the classics. For some reason they don't consider the newer movies and tv shows on there. There are so many amazing movies but they all get overlooked.&&Some they probably can't ever get because movie companies are more and more refusing to let anything go to Netflix because they are direct competition now&&I think a lot of it has to do with the licensing deal they secure for the movies.  Netflix has always been of the strategy to list all the content they can because more choice keeps people subbed longer.  This is why they release all episodes of their shows in 1 day, they wan't people to binge.

The more likely answer has to do with the way the contract for their movies is designed.  For example, now that Amazon and a whole lot of other companies have their own streaming service, they might want elusive streaming rights for popular films, which likely means those types of arrangements have much shorter agreements (1 year).&&Comparing any past time to today, they will always have less.  

HBO and Showtime are now real streaming service competitors.  Disney is pulling all stuff to start their own streaming service. Older movies are more frequently licensed by studios to FilmStruck. All of that drives up licensing prices.
&&Is that 5,744 feature films?  Or does that include stand-up specials and such?

I’ve ran the numbers before, and Netflix carries something like 10% of “movies people give a shit about” at any given time. It does rotate, but that’s not great. 

It’s easy to demonstrate to yourself too...just think of a movie. Then search for it. It’s not there.  I’ll start:

Casablanca, no. Fast and the Furious, nope. Predator, nosir. True Grit, nope, neither. Face/Off, oh my god they have it.

That actually went better than expected, usually I get to seven or eight. &&Ya I feel like people have either forgotten, or have never had to pay for cable/$100+ a month&&Seriously I bought dinner last night more expensive than netflix. For $50 a month people can get Netlfix, Hulu, Spotify and HBO and it would still be cheaper than cable&&That is my confusion with how people are trashing Netflix. The amount of content they have more than makes up for the price. Not all of it is going to be 5 star classics. So I don’t see why people are revolting against Netflix. 

You can just buy the Blu-rays, dvds, etc.. Own it outright yourself.&&NO THANK YOU SIR I PREFER PAYING $100 A MONTH FOR TV WITH COMMERCIALS&&They don't have the office in my country :(&&It's weird how it's always Netflix that catches the brunt of ""All they have is shit!"" charges but Amazon Prime is basically *the* destination for straight to VHS titles from 1987-1993.&&It is pretty hilarious how this is continually cast as a Netflix problem instead of a clear attempt by the content owners to stand up their own single-channel streaming services. The entire reason Netflix started making their own content is because they knew that once it was easy to stand up the digital architecture for streaming (thanks AWS) the entire movie industry would attempt to control both rights and distribution.&&[deleted]&&I am fully aware of how hard it is to get streaming rights. I am fully aware how hard a position Netflix is in. I do not blame them for losing the rights they could not hold on to.

However, this does not change the fact that Netflix's library has been shrinking and continues to shrink, making it a worse service over time to the point where it has not been worth it to me to keep up my subscription.

Remember this: Criticizing a product is not the same as attacking the company or people working on the product. It's sad that Netflix isn't as good as it once was, regardless of whose fault it is.&&I understand exactly how it works, and that a lot of companies are holding onto their movies to try and make their own streaming services with them.

None of that is Netflix's fault. I get that.

That doesn't change the fact that what they have available is not worth me subscribing to, so I don't.&&Not to mention that Netflix has made it clear they will cater to lesser known artists and producers to help create new original content, instead of showing nothing but comic book movies.&&I agree with the ""it's hard to even get rights to top movies"" thing, because the holders of these things are nuts. Look at Disney and the Disney Vault, for example.

But I never agree with the ""like it or leave"" thing. Asking for better service is an option in *any* environment, and the crazy binary-choicers here are the ones who cause a service to be shittier than it could be otherwise when they amass in numbers.&&I completely agree with you, but it's still frustrating. I just don't blame Netflix for that.&&But they rotate content in an out too. 

Last month, I was able to watch Batman- The Animated Series. 

This month, it’s not included and I have to pay to watch it. 

Penn and Teller- Bullshit! is available for the moment though, so I’ve enjoyed that. &&I'm pretty sure these ""Netflix has shitty movies and original content"" posts are just more god damn astroturfing from its competitors.&&Netflix: Okay *fine*, we can watch one of these 20 movies that were made for $15 and directed by a lobotomized monkey instead.&&It’s about “a certain individual with a funny haircut” apparently.&&They're good movies, Bront.&&There'd be no content if we were able to click not interested.&&[deleted]&&well it's part of the problem. no studio wants another studio showing their movies.&&Netflix is a victim of its own success in that regard, they're not doing anything wrong, it's just that they're so successful that every big media corporation is trying to copy them and start their own streaming service, causing them to pull their movies from Netflix and put them on their own service instead.  &&[deleted]&&Nextflix original does not only mean produced by Netflix. It means content Netflix has exclusive rights to air in your area. 

Or rather 95% other content and 5% Netflix flagship shows. &&Them removing the rating system didnt help this. Unless I hear something about a Netflix original--I just avoid them. Maybe I'm missing out on something great, but having to worry about how much crap you have to filter through to find that great show is not something I want to do.&&20% hit

50% miss

30% who the fuck greenlit this

their business model now is to have like 4-5 shows people like and then fill out the rest with a whole load of shit to look impressively filled out. The only new show of the last year I like is the Dragon Prince animation show. &&So far every Netflix original that is my flavor I’ve loved.

Like for example I don’t give a shit about 13 reasons why or a lot of others but stranger things, altered carbon, dark are all good&&I'm 2 episodes into Norm MacDonald Has A Show and I want him to just go back and do his podcast without Netflix involvement &&Counterpoint:  they're actually bringing back the mid-budget movie, the kind of movie that has broad appeal but doesn't necessarily target specific ticket-buying groups, so they don't get made as often anymore.  Pretty much all theatrical releases nowadays are either blockbusters or indie films.  And the handful of studio comedies or rom coms we do get are generally just as bad as your average Netflix fare, Netflix just does a *lot* more of it.  And I don't care how much average crap they churn out (nobody is forcing me to watch it) as long as they still produce and own stuff I want to watch, which they do.  And they make a ton of great tv shows and are lately starting to come out with some pretty fantastic movies (there's a very strong chance they'll get a best picture nomination and quite possibly even a win this year), so I'd say their quest for original content is going pretty well.&&I suspect they're going with quantity first to give the impression of a vast library.&&I enjoyed Annihilation, though Netflix merely distributed. That movie about Robert the Bruce with Chris Pine looks dope though. I think their movie side will pick up, but for now, TV shows are what snatches up subscriptions. &&Beasts of No Nation was pretty great. Same director as season 1 of True Detective&&I personally enjoyed What Happened To Monday a lot &&I've heard good things about 'Okja' but I haven't actually watched it.&&I really enjoyed Bright&&I enjoyed ""The Fundamentals Of Caring""&&Netflix has tons of data on what people will watch and it's probably not the best quality stuff. Paying through the nose for the best or biggest movies is probably not the best business strategy. 

If they're smart then the stuff they're making it the stuff Netflix subscribers are most likely to watch, or something they think will attract more subscribers. Nobody has the precise viewing data they have. 

I know people that just watch the same half dozen shows on a loop. I'm personally more interested in documentaries and indie films than some blockbuster I've probably already seen. Netflix has more to offer than just the ""best movies.""

&#x200B;&&Mudbound was nominated for four Academy Awards, and I Don't Feel at Home in this World Anymore won Grand Jury at Sundance. That said, it seems like we would be seeing more popular movies from them like we are seeing shows. Amazon occasionally releases original movies in theaters, so it's weird that we haven't seen much of that from Netflix.&&I've never even heard of Filmstruck before...&&Filmstruck has The Criterion Collection. Hulu used to have it, but they dropped it.&&I've never even heard of Filmstruck and Kanopy. I would automatically disqualify HBO because they crop damn near everything to 1.78:1. 

I just think it's weird that people want Netflix to stream everything. There was a time where they could stream a lot. That time has passed. &&i haven't bought a DVD in like a decade.&&Most of those movies shouldn't be making money any more anyway. Most of them are more than 30 years old. Copyright law was meant to allow artists the chance to make money of their art long enough to make more, not allow shareholders in companies that didn't even exist when the work was made to keep making money in perpetuity.&&HBO is actually is going to have an issue soon because a lot of their high quality stuff comes from their deal with 20th Cent. Fox, which was semi-recently bought by Disney. They also have been stepping up their creation of HBO Originals. 

I think the biggest thing is that HBO has made it easy to look at their whole library vs Netflix which obscures it.&&Yeah it makes my blood boil that Car 3 is on Netflix, but no Cars 2. Like wtf I’m just trying to enjoy my beans man. &&\> movies like black and white dutch production about woman having a 3,5 hour mental breakdown while buttering the toast and some shit  

&#x200B;

It wasn't that bad.  I liked the surprise ending.  &&Fuck! Gonna be another 23 years before I see Casino&&Well it's a list made up of public ratings, not a critically-compiled one.&&Yeah, why can I watch Guardians of the Galaxy 2 but not Guardians of the Galaxy 1?  I actually wouldn't mind catching up on some of these marvel movies, but I'm not going to watch Thor 3 without having seen Thor 1 or 2.&&[And here it is](https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom)&&The Room is a real Hollywood movie. Tommy Wiseau would never give the rights to some small, Mickey Mouse streaming service like Netflix&&Oh, that's very interesting story, when I moved to San Francisco with two suitcases and I didn't know anyone, and I have, I hit YMCA with a $2000 check that I couldn't cash.&&They do have ""Room"" though...&&I see nothing wrong with this, we need more cases of actors spontaneously busting into a song and dance in the middle of a movie scene&&[deleted]&&They can't buy what studios aren't willing to sell.&&The studios don't want to give Netflix distribution rights. Most of the studios either want to sell them to Hulu (who they own stakes in) or think they'd be better off with their own streaming service&&Studios don't really have any incentive to bolster Netflix's digital library. Sure they could be getting some money for things that might be otherwise be bringing in nothing but ultimately they'd be better off choking Netflix and forcing them to have a mostly garbage library and produce their own shows/movies. 

Netflix probably doesn't want to pay a whole lot for streaming movies anyway since their DVD rentals are still a thing and fairly popular.&&But that involves like, going somewhere.&&I was about to cynically post “Shhhhh keep the libraries a secret” but more taxpayers should discover and benefit from our local libraries. Honestly, if ISPs weren’t an oligopoly, local municipalities could launch their own streaming services and content distribution platforms and negotiate contracts on behalf of their community.&&the public library is awesome. utilize their online catalog and place holds on anything in their system, then pick it up when it's ready. New releases at my library can be checked out for 3 days, and all other DVD's can be checked out for a week.&&They need more interns to search through the $5 bins at Walmart.&&The mail service was spun off into a subsidiary, with its own name(DVD.com), its own separate headquarters, its own management team and corporate staff(they don't even have the same benefit package as those at Netflix proper), its own subscription fee etc

In other words the company is structured in a way that Netflix can jettison it relatively easily the second it's no longer profitable. And rumors are that projections have that happening within about 5 years. 

That's likely why they're not bothering to load up on tons of Blu Rays and also not replacing discs when some titles run out of working ones. They're going to refresh inventory enough to limp along, but they're basically starting to hit wind down mode.&&But why add content when you can add different thumbnails for the same old choices so they don't look familiar at a glance?&&Sky is a dinosaur and hopefully it goes that way in the next few years.

Ridiculously over priced.&&They have exclusive first-run broadcast and streaming deals with most of the major movie studios, which leaves very little for any other TV/streaming service. &&So........it's Morphin' Time?&&Every season of power rangers? Why do you even need anything else?&&For now.&&If you're going to use a VPN to access content, just pirate the content. It's the same difference &&Kind of sad because I watched the Criterion Collection on Hulu but won't get the FilmStruck because honestly there's not enough that I want to watch to pay for another service. When companies start their own streaming service they really need to think long and hard about their content and whether or not they have enough to support a streaming service or they'll fail miserably. I see people talk about Disney's future service and not wanting to buy into another streaming service but Disney and what they own can support it and between 20th Century Fox, Touchstone and Disney they have the ability to pile up a better library than most services.  Unfortunately this means that everyone else will try to 'copy' this and doing it terribly. &&Which is going to be a big pain in the ass and lead to a failure of streaming services. People are going to go back to pirating stuff because they don't want to subscribe $10 a month to 20 different streaming services.&&I said this to a friend recently. I would probably be willing to pay Netflix up to $40 a month if they actually had everything. 

But no way in hell will I pay 4 different services $10 dollars a month just to be able to watch everything.&&I'd be a lot happier if they categorized stand up as stand up and not just as comedy. &&Easy to produce, low cost, decent entertainment, wide and niche appeal.&&I finally set up a ""Junk"" profile. If I watch anything remotely outside of my typical tastes I switch over so it doesn't ruin my recommendations for the next 4 months. Granted the recommendations are terrible and 95% Netflix originals to begin with...&&I share a username with my friend's little brother since she just said it was cool to use her account on that name, so now the suggestions are  like -*Bob the Builder, Blood Sport, Full Metal Jacket, My Little Pony, Moana, Predator, Shrek*&&Kinda like buying car parts on Amazon when they start suggesting items for your new headlight assembly collection.&&I’m annoyed how all the good movies are gone in like two weeks. The Dark Knight was on for barely two weeks and when I wanted to watch it again, it was out. 

Not to mention 99% of Netflix is garbage Tv shows &&I watched that 36 Chambers kung fu movie and now Netflix thinks I want to watch Japanese reality shows.&&I mean, you DID watch 3 nature documentaries &&you watched ""planet earth II"" would you like to see a different show about prisons from every single country on the planet?&&Partially, yes. Netflix is taking the billions its earning and using it to produce dozens of their shitty original shows. They’re going all quantity over quality. Say unlike HBO, which only releases 1-2 new shows a year, most of them hits. And has good movies to boot. &&Seriously, I went like 25-30+ rows down that list and I'm still seeing good options.&&No one gets Prime for their video service lol. You get it so your packages arrive as soon as possible. The video service is just gravy. I don't think Netflix has another business model&&Which is why I'll never subscribe to a streaming service besides Netflix. You can't show the owners that it's viable to run their own service. If they don't make money from their service, eventually they'd be induced to return stuff to Netflix just to get *some* money (hopefully).

Everyone who gives in and picks up additional subscriptions is just aiding the Balkanization of streaming content.&&Nailed it. Cheers for actually having an understanding of the game instead of being butthurt Netflix didnt pay a billion dollars to license your favorite flick. Keep being awesome.&&another way to look at is this: if you rent two movies per month on iTunes/Google Play/Amazon Prime/POVD, it's about 4.99 per movies so if you watch two movies per month on Netflix, your even.&&Batman might not come back. DC is launching their own subscription service. I heard it would have the animated series.&&Batman TAS is on DC’s service now in a remastered version so I wouldn’t expect it to come back &&I've been saying this for a few weeks now.  It seems like every day there's a huge anti-Netflix post getting thousands of upvotes on this sub.    And there's always quite a few suspicious accounts encouraging people to cancel Netflix and switch to Prime or Hulu.    
  
At least now more and more people are seeing it.  &&You have not seen the movie recommendations from Amazon Prime after watching RoboCop.  It's like every F-level movie that's remotely scifi or Kung Fu filmed on a Nokia&&I watched a great show last night.  It was an original called ""Car Masters : Rust to Riches"".  Itsa a reality show in a mechanics shop.  They take shitty cars, fix them up and then trade them for more valuable garbage until they get something they can sell for six figures.  It was actually pretty fun.  They built an IRL Hotwheels car. &&Because you watched Big Hero 6:

No Country for Old Men

Patch Adams

Hacksaw Ridge

Paw Patrol

.......¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&&I don’t mean to get all hail corporate and I really don’t know what the answer is, but I feel like smear campaigns against Netflix are going to get more prevalent as Disney, WB and other studios hold their content behind their own platforms. It is consumers best interest to have them all under one roof like Netflix so that we aren’t paying for a dozen different streaming services a month, but it seems like we won’t be able to avoid it if Netflix can’t get its hand on good material. 

Idk, the whole situation sucks. &&Or you can just fire up your old pirating machine that's been gathering dust since the last time we went through all this bullshit and make your own digital library.  Again.  This time you don't even have to burn a single disc because storage is super fucking cheap and you can access it *anywhere, anytime*.


Yarrrrr.&&but then I gotta go buy a new laptop that can play DVDs since the big advantage to netflix is I can just put my laptop on my chest, put a movie on, pass the fuck out, read the wiki page for the movie the next morning, and spend all day talking about how much the movie actually sucked.&&That and studios like Disney are making their own streaming services. &&Except this is why Netflix started doing it. People started pulling their shit and making unreasonable demands. Then they started competing. So what Netflix did is they took alot of money and made their own shit. That way they might have a leg up on competition other than Hulu. Which is kinda different. Both are valuable in different ways. Hulu can pay studios a premium cause ads. And they generally target tv shows and are able to the TV shows as the come out. Then fuck Amazon prime. Mostly cause the shittyest UI they can do(webwise, not bothered with their app much but I don't remember it being better) and refusal to add chromecast support.&&Everyone wanted to start their own, but Disney/ABC, NBCUniveral, and 21st Century Fox decided to just own Hulu.&&Exactly. Netflix had amazing foresight. With Disney and everyone else starting their own streaming site, can you imagine how fucked Netflix would've been if they hadn't invested in original content? It was all part of their plan. Start with streaming other people's content and invest all the money back into being self-sustainable. They now stand on their own feet.&&The Expanse is a ""Netflix Original"" in most non-NA regions. They release the episodes many months after they come out, have no marketing at all, don't communicate when they will release them and when their NA-distributor stopped ordering new episodes Netflix didn't want to buy them anymore either and now Amazon bought the rights and it suddenly stops being a Netflix Original and will stop being on Netflix.

So Netflix Original means absolutely nothing.&&That sounds pretty misleading. I came across a copy of an Australian show called Wanted that had been taken from Netflix and uploaded elsewhere that had 'A Netflix Original Series' pasted on at the beginning. I was like 'It fucking isn't. I saw this on Channel 7 two years ago.'&&Check out Ozark. Flew under the radar, but it's phenomenal. Good Place too, though it's not really an original.&&> Unless I hear something about a Netflix original

In that case, if you haven't seen it I suggest watching *What Happened To Monday* at some point. It's a good dystopian Action/Adventure/Mystery film. A solid above average film.

💙

As for the lack of non Netflix original content, that irks me... I really want them to get more stuff back on the service. Hell I'm considering getting their physical disc plan if I ever get a new computer.&&I think HBO has proved that's not what people want&&I read the book and really liked the movie as well! :D&&It was actually, but with a budget of just $6m it doesn't really fit the profile of a big budget film. So it does make you wonder where all the money is going. PLus it was actually made in 2015.&&I went into that movie knowing absolutely nothing about it.

It is actually *really* good.

A solid screenplay, great casting, and the aesthetic is fun and heavy at the same time.&&I thought it was pretty decent. Kind of strange and unsettling though - not really a movie I would watch multiple times.&&I enjoyed Bright's setting more than the movie itself.&&I really enjoyed most of Bright but toward the end they were losing my interest.  Was like great build up with a mediocre payout.  Just my opinion on it.&&It is a newer streaming service launched by Turner Classic Movies in partnership with the Criterion Collection. It hosts a lot of classic and art house films that are usually outside of the mainstream, so basically it's a streaming service for huge film nerds like me.&&I buy DVDs (well, Blu-rays) all the time. For me, it's infinitely better to actually own the media, and not have to worry about if the Internet's down, if the service is down, if the movie is still available on the service, etc. I'm not dependent upon a third party. I can just stick the Blu-ray disc in my player and start watching.&&Haven't bought a DVD in my life, but watched hundreds of movies on Blu-Ray or DVD by borrowing them from public libraries.
Gotta make the most out of the tax dollars.&&Yes, although a lot of the best Netflix content is *also* Disney. I think Disney's platform is going to give Netflix a serious run for their money. &&That's because there's no such thing as Cars 2, mate. &&""THIS NIGGA EATING BEANS!""&&It was ""I can't believe it's not butter"" the whole time!&&Have you seen Goodfellas?

That's why they're ""pushing"" the content. The market is there.&&Yes.

Every month on Instant Watcher it's 30 Hollywood movies and 75 Bollywood movies. 

I watched KRRRRISH 3 recently... It's not awful. &&There's quite a few Indian immigrants and families in the USA, they're just another niche market.&&Also whatever is currently locked in a contract with a competitor. Lots of companies are trying to get into the streaming video game, so demand for streaming rights has gone up, so the price has gone up.

Whether or not a shrunken Netflix library means it's worth its subscription price, that's up to each individual to decide.&&Fair point. The studios starting their own streaming services thing is probably not going to work out how they want it.&&For real though, I cant tell you how much money I've saved over the years by doing it. Hell, im currently playing the new Spiderman game, for free. I'd rather drive the 10 minutes to the library and get a free game than spend 60 dollars on it. And when my rental is up, I can get a new game to play or grab a few books to read.

Libraries are still incredible to this day and I feel like almost nobody uses them. I live in a pretty big town right outside Boston and the library is quite big in my town, and has everything you would ever want. But theres only like 10 people there at any given time, and its usually moms with their children.&&**DISGUSTING**&&Yeah, they should really focus more on their NowTV service. I'm surprised the UKTV group hasn't made itself a proper streaming service yet &&That's 25 years worth of TV right there.&&Pretty hard to block all vpn. Just a matter of how much the better ones will end up costing. &&The reason Netflix was successful wasn't that it streamed, it was an aggregate of all sorts of things for one subscription fee. Now that every producer is going their own way and making their own subscription based streaming service, I fully expect piracy to go back up. 

I haven't torrented anything in 3 years but I'm not subscribing to five different sites to watch things. &&It'll be cable all over again.&&Yup studios got greedy once they realized people stopped pirating. If they take it off Netflix we will just go back to piracy. We are all willing to pay for this stuff, just not willing to get shafted.&&Not all of the individual studio streaming platforms will be a success.  I bet what happens is that the ones that don't survive go back to making licensing deals with Netflix, Hulu, and Prime in some form.  However, I think we are in for half a decade of extremely crappy streaming options for the big three in the near future.&&Id be a lot happier if their user interface wasn't designed by complete morons.&&Yeah I've been crying about this for a long time. I love stand up, but they have their own section for stand up AND they get put in the comedy section too so I have to sift through all that shit twice. &&That sounds like the opposite of a problem.&&I can just imagine your account being flagged and shared with the NSA.

Yes thank you Amazon that's just what I need&&Oh shit it's already gone? I was planning on watching that again soon. &&Netflix saw itself live long enough to become the villian.&&HBO has a large catalog of quality shows they've been producing over the years that they can provide as options.

Netflix has the 3-5 good originals they started making like 5 years ago max. They just don't have the library that HBO has and they need to build up before they lose the licensing on the other third party studios' shows.

They need to go quantity over quality, otherwise users will only see 50 options on their landing page (already they kind of do this to make it seem like their library is bigger than it actually is by putting the same show/movie in multiple lists).

That said, I completely agree with you. The quality of a good number of their originals is absolute crap. They would do considerably better to cut some of the chaff and actually spend money on a smaller number well written shows.&&>shitty original shows

house of cards, orange is the new black, stranger things, the crown, a series of unfortunate events, 13 reasons why, Ozark, mindhunter, altered carbon, lost in space, the punisher, santa clarita diet, bojack horseman.  I'm sure I missed a couple.  I get it they are mostly ""miss"" but they definitely have some ""hits"".&&1. Individual, expensive cable packages with no end in sight
2. Glorious Netflix era with endless selection
3. Individual streaming services with no end in sight (jk, yar-har)

It was fun while it lasted&&Balkanization might be the best description I've ever seen for what's currently happening.&&Yeah everyone complains that they want to cut the cord and how they want ala cart channels. All that is going to happen is cable companies will raise the prices of Internet only and the context producers will all have their own subscription service for X amount per month. At the end of the day you’ll be paying the same or more than you were before.&&Well, I don't think they're being butthurt necessarily - they just don't think Netflix is still worth what it used to be. That might be true for some people. And I think it's interesting that other content players are competing with Netflix instead of allowing one large technology player to dominate the space. 

That said, it's pretty clear that the future is studios streaming on their own services or on services that they stood up as a cabal to take on Netflix. It's also clear that their main aim is to protect the sweet margins on physical media by requiring it to be purchased to access content on their streaming services. There's something a little gross about the way that the big four studios are competing that probably deserves some level of antitrust scrutiny.

No one can be blamed for the positions they're taking in this - there's too much money involved for there to be some kind of moral right or wrong. If Netflix's original content and increasingly meager licensed content isn't good enough to justify your subscription, so be it. I can't tell people that they're somehow wrong for not wanting to support a service they won't use. It does pain me to think about where this is probably going, though, because I know I don't want to have to have a Sony subcription, a Disney subscription, etc. And I sure as hell don't want a wall full of plastic discs anymore.

The most probable outcome - a widely fragmented, relatively more expensive content market - is never going to satisfy the people that constantly hop into these threads like ""durr I'll just pirate now."" But then again, nothing will. The entirety of the real problem was always price and that's going to go up from where Netflix was taking it, even though if you consider it holistically most people will spend less on average for more content.&&😢
&&Jesus Christ. Everybody is starting their own streaming service.

I'm going to start my own streaming service with Blackjack and hookers! I'll call it... Plex. &&> encouraging people to cancel Netflix and switch to Prime or Hulu

Which is funny, because those services also have awful movie libraries and less quality original content.  The only difference is that Hulu and Prime don't pump out the same volume of crap OG content.&&I was looking through horror movies last night and Menace II Society popped up.  &&Battle Beyond the Stars was in my recommendations.

Can't wait to see Ryder from Paw Patrol team up with Anton Chigurh to wreck some Nazis. &&I don't think it's Netflix who's to blame. Studio execs want the the money from streaming. All of it. And this has to horribly backfire for them to learn their lesson. Unforunately video game publishers show us time and again that this actually works. But only for them.&&That's illegal. Definitely don't do everything that you said and add that to a home brew plex setup that will let you stream your pirated library to all your devices. Definitely don't do that.&&That really irks me, too. I don't want to have all these subscriptions. I have a feeling this will hurt the streaming segment.&&The temporary solution to this, as a consumer, might be to always have one streaming service active and rotate them bi-monthly. If they're all around the same price, use Netflix for two months, Hulu for two months, Disney's thing for two months, etc. 

It's annoying, and not convenient. But if there's shows you want on all of them and you don't want to spend a million dollars, that might be your best bet.&&Also Hulu is owned by a few of the top TV networks. That's a big reason for their content.&&[deleted]&&Amazon prime video sucks but it’s not the reason anyone subscribed to amazon prime so I find it hard to complain about a bonus &&I tried Amazon on my Samsung TV and it was absolutely atrocious. Their website it downright usable compared to it.&&Agreed. I still use Prime for the shipping, so the streaming service is just a nice little bonus. Also a convenient way to rent something that isn't available elsewhere. Hulu has the best library of the three major services as far as I can tell. Best UI too. Also Netflix's UI just gets worse and worse all the time. Like it's slowly devolving into Amazon's UI. &&Better Call Saul is marketed as a Netflix Original pretty much everywhere except US and Canada. Fargo too in a lot of countries.&&I can't get past the color grading on that show. Everything is blue. &&What happened to Monday might be called, 7 Sisters, depends on where you live. &&They blow an insane amount of money on their TV series to see what'll stick. Sense8, Marco Polo,and The Get Down were very expensive mistakes for them.&&The casting of Will Smith was a huge mistake, especially since he seemed about 20 years too old for the role.

The script wasn't awesome either, but did have incredible world building.

Personally I hope for a sequel or a series set in the world with an actually good and compelling story.&&Yeah, I don't really care for Max Landis's writing. He had some decent lines in Bright, but it was mostly just people yelling ""fuck"" a lot because he couldn't think of anything interesting to write.&&That's kind of cool. The prestige factor also means they likely are able to get a much better deal from rights' holders than Netflix. &&From what I Disney's new subscription service won't have rated R content. That will all be moved to Hulu.&&I think as long as Netflix still keeps making its original content (especially the Netflix TV shows), they’re not really gonna be too worried. But the moment Disney starts making their own original content for their streaming service, and they turn out to be really good, then we’ll see Netflix really start sweating.&&That ""spoof movie"" fad in the mid to late 2000's was such a bad time, every single year there was a new barely-made spoof movie that seemed to be worse than the last. 

They also always somehow did well in the theaters, and I had friends who would go and see every single one of them, it drove me crazy. &&CEO of Lehman Brothers saw it and went running out of the theatre screaming, ""Tear it down!

But there are two Mike Myers movies, surprisingly, with how amazing the Wayne's World and Austin Powers franchises are.

EDIT: Two, apparently Going Overboard is an Adam Sandler movie.&&At a glance it seems like the worst movies are sequels nobody wanted, parody movies, movies starring people who aren't actors (Example: Paris Hilton) and movies by Uwe Boll.&&Paris Hilton's in the top 10 twice. &&That's cause Adam Sandler is Netflix's bottom bitch.&&My BF and I were both mostly unfamiliar with The Last Airbender and we watched that movie as sort of an intro.   
What a mistake.    
I only hate like 8 movies but that is definitely 1. &&Oh, they made an ATLA movie?&&Agree. It was a pretty crappy Mario movie, but as a weird fantasy/scifi movie about guys from Brooklyn who go fight dinosaurs and save a princess, it's actually pretty entertaining!&&[deleted]&&I’m with you. To be fair, I understand why some of my favorites like Birdemic are in here, but I enjoy them nonetheless. Meanwhile some garbage escapes. What can ya do?&&Honestly, Master of Disguise is a masterpiece.&&Saw the Emoji movie is on there.. I know that's a widely disliked one. &&Because this isn't a list of lowest grossing movies, it's just ratings.

EDIT: No I don't live in a big city, I'm envious every day of the New York public library's access to classic films. A lot of libraries don't have video games and extra services beyond books and DVDs. Stop rubbing it in :(&&Where do you live that your library has video games? I would love to have that at mine!&&How do you go about getting this stuff? This honestly sounds very appealing. &&I’m with you. I use the library for all my audiobooks. I just don’t understand why anyone would pay a subscription for something like Audible when the library is right there and totally free. Heck, for ebooks and audiobooks you don’t even need to go to the library, you can just download an app on your phone!&&We use the shit out of our library (we're in New Jersey).  Books for the whole family, lots of movies (new Blu-rays are $1 for 3 nights I think).  The only thing we don't have that I'd like is video games.   That'd be sweet.

Libraries are one of the few instances where  I can say ""my tax dollars at work"" without sarcasm.&&Everything about Sky is broken and archaic, frankly NowTV included.

Sky: HD *still* not standard, £10 a month, and even then it's 720p, not 1080p (STILL, IN 2018). Sure, you can get 'UHD' on SkyQ, but that's another rung higher. Packages stacked with pre-requisites. Highly priced packages, still laden with adverts.

Sky Go: Same HD issue as the core platform. Ancient device management with crazy limitations on flexibility versus the competition.

NowTV: Same HD issue as the core platform. No on demand access, even during your access period - miss it for any reason, and you've wasted your money. Edit: for sports at least, I stand corrected that on demand is available for movies and TV so congratulations Sky for having at least a pinky dipped into the 21st century pool.

Sky is everything wrong with 'old' media and honestly I hope their greed causes them to fall on their own pitchfork and die.&&I don't think that'll happen for long.  Anyone without the content to back it up will crash and burn or group together to form bigger services. I think it'll end up with about 10 major services and a bunch of fringe ones with most people subbing to 3-5.&&>  I fully expect piracy to go back up

I posted another comment that got the numbers for various services.  I left this one out because ultimately it didn't seem on-topic for that comment... but just to add to it:  
Yo-ho-ho: 214 / 240 titles  
( I'm sure I can find the remainder if I consulted more than just 3 major public indexes )&&I haven't pirated anything in about 4 years but last night I queued up about 100gb of movies that aren't on Netflix.&&Cable Inception wins, we all lose...&&[deleted]&&Wait until the packaging happens because the individual streaming services realize it's not viable for them to just sell their own content.

""Buy our premium package starting at $60 a month and get over 80 streaming services!"" &&Gabe Newelll claming ""piracy is a service problem"" is the most true statement regarding copyright law in history&&[removed]&&I have Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime.  If you could point me to a UI better than Netflix's, I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm not saying it's amazing, but its the best I've used.&&I would be happier if trailers didn’t start within three seconds of hovering over a title. The unwanted sudden sound is annoying for browsing. &&You must be insane.

There's no way you'd want a trash movie like Predator cluttering up spots where Bob the Builder can be.&&I don't know. After watching Requiem I certainly needed something light hearted to make the bad thoughts go away. &&Swiper No Swiping!!! Swiper no...... uh... Swiper?... what are you doing with that long hotdog thing?&&It's my friend's account that she lets me use. Her family has all of the user names taken, so she said I could use her little brother's to watch stuff if I want to use Netflix at my house.&&I definitely think someone rolled him. &&You could save a nickel on that exhaust if you set up a subscription where Amazon will send you a new exhaust every month. You sure you just want one exhaust?&&Exactly, HBO can fall back on stuff like the Sopranos (1999) while Netflix has had to throw money into the production of stuff like House of Cards (2013) and Orange is the New Black (2013).

To be honest though, I think most viewers prefer the series format vs movies these days. So while the number of movies may diminish, I think the viewers are getting a better value for their money with the Netflix original series. For instance, Netflix spent about $200 million on the original 60 episodes (seasons 1) of Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, the Punisher (I think?), and the Defenders. That's $200 million for about 55 hours or about 3.6 million per hour. Compare that with Thor Ragnarok (currently on Netflix) which had a $180 million budget for 2 hours. Yeah, I know Netflix didn't produce Thor Ragnarok but if they were to do a similar movie it'd have a similar budget.

So while cinephiles may not like it, I think Netflix is taking the right approach to their streaming library.&&The quality of their original shows is very high. They have a number of shows that are popular among both critics and audiences. Bojack Horseman, Black Mirror, Master of None, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards (well, the first two seasons were good), Glow, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, The Crown, Making a Murderer, The End of the Fucking World, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Mindhunter, Narcos, Stranger Things, Daredevil, and Jessica Jones. Plus a few others that aren't as well received but are still good for a watch like Altered Carbon and Luke Cage. That's a pretty great catalog of original shows there. Now if you want to touch their movies, that's where they have their problems, since the only thing they have made that people give a damn about is Beasts of No Nation. &&Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Defenders, Big Mouth, Disenchantment, Arrested Development (exclusive extension), Master of None, Hannibal(?), Narcos, Black Mirror (exclusive extension)&&and those are only the famous ones, there's a LOT of other things that are fun to watch yet people never give them an opportunity and go ""hurrr they're bad"" 

&&Wouldn’t everyone outing up their own service be the a la carte service they want? Otherwise Netflix is just another cable provider(except it’s streamed from the internet).&&I mean I don't know how, Netflix pushes out more content both originally and licences then both Amazon and Hulu.

Out of all the major streaming services Netflix is still by far king. When it comes to content.&&I can still get discs for almost everything.  So with what they can stream vs. what I can get shipped to me on a disc it is still pretty great.&&I mean, I don’t need licensed content. I used to get upset over the offerings, but in hindsight I watch so infrequently that what Netflix offers is more than enough. I have zero reason to seek out the other services, I just don’t care. I will keep paying Netflix until they literally stop their service.&&Netflix is the McDonalds of Streaming. &&It’s greatness lies in having gathered so many actors into one movie at the lowest point in each of their careers.&&I remember watching that in like the early 80s and thinking it was pretty bad even then.  


It's no Ice Pirates&&I haven't seen it, but generally with those shows the first seasons great, then every season after becomes more and more produced.&&Today they gave Insatiable a 93% match and the first Godfather 85%...

I find each one gets stale once I watch the good stuff so the breaks make it feel fresh when I go back to once since new content has been added.&&It’s still better then cable. The streaming services are all cancel anytime. So if you don’t like one, cancel. If you want to only watch game of thrones, subscribe when the season is over, binge watch, and cancel. 

I would absolutely rather have 10 streaming services to choose from then be forced into a cable service contract with a shitload of channels i don’t watch for a much higher price. 

It’s much more consumer friendly. &&Top TV and movie networks.

Hulu is owned by Disney, Fox, NBC (owned by Comcast) and Warner (owned by ATT). Soon Disney will own Fox, they already own ABC. The big holdouts I can think of are Viacom, owner of Paramount, and Sony Pictures, and of course CBS which previously owned Viacom. They all have content on hulu though.&&[deleted]&&I have problems with them calling Black Mirror an 'original'. It started on Channel 4, they just bought the rights to make it themselves&&Localized names also irks me, but you are right, it was originally *What Happened To Monday* then *Seven Sisters* then when Netflix stepped in it went back to *What Happened To Monday* in the states at least.&&I loved both Marco Polo and The Get Down, but when I saw their budgets I can see why they weren't continued.

Edit: $90,000,000 for 10 episodes of Marco Polo and $120,000,000 for 12 episodes of The Get Down. Yikes!&&As a European, I'm pretty sure all this shit is gonna mean I'd have to go back to piracy to watch stuff without paying 200 euros per month.&&Not being combative, generally curious, what does Disney have besides animated movies, family movies, Star Wars, and Marvel (if the Fox deal doesn't go through)?&&The original Scary Movie was great though, I liked Not Another Teen Movie too.&&Nowadays the terms ""parody"" and ""spoof"" are basically synonymous with crap, at least in the context of cinema. And that's a real shame, because it wasn't always that way. Some of the funniest comedies of all time are spoofs - like Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs and Airplane, to name a few. Hell, I'll even throw in the Austin Powers series, which, even at its lowest point, was leagues funnier than anything Friedberg and Seltzer came up with.&&Not another teen movie though brah! &&Two freshly-sucked thumbs down&&They were 32, which is kind of weird given that context.&&Not really that surprising, he can be really heavy on the miss in 'hit and miss.'

You also gotta consider the last time his face was in a noteworthy movie was Baby Driver.&&Nah, Going overboard is on there too&&50 first dates and Happy Gilmore are still good, that doesn't stop Sandler's newer stuff from being the way it is.&&> Going Overboard

Stars: Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Zane

The poster tag line is such an 80s cliche&&> Going Overboard is an Adam Sandler movie.

Worst movie ever. I know because a long time ago, before Netflix, my dad watched the movie. It was utter, terrible garbage. I remember someone flips off someone at the very end of the movie and it felt like they were flipping off the audience for being gullible enough to have ever watched it in the first place.

Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever watched, makes any Transformers movie look like an award winning movie.&&Did you eventually watch the show? It's fantastic in every sense of the word. Multiple excellent character arcs.&&You should give the series a try some time, saying the movie doesn't do it justice puts it mildly. Even if the movie wasn't terrible, you're going to lose a lot trying to jam a 20 episode season into one movie.&&No. No, they didn't. 




^^^^Sob&&Around the half way point of that list it started hitting ""so bad they're actually funny"" movies like The Room and Master of Disguise. Niche tastes to be sure, but still.&&Hell I was actually in one of these films. (Pluto Nash).

Yay for me I suppose?&&You are tearing me apart Lisa !&&It'd just be a Geocities page with every video he could find embedded into an infinitely scrolling, single page.&&Also theyre pretty much viewed across the world, especially in asia. Ive even heard people as far as africa tell me bollywood is popular in their respective countries&&“The whole world has 10,000 people!”&&Nah, people will just pirate it all again.&&Well I for one do not plan on subscribing to numerous streaming services. Netflix and whatever comes with Amazon Prime is just going to have to do. &&Some big libraries near me started having video games 20 years ago. It was the future in 1998.&&I used to get video games from the library on 5 inch floppy. We're also living in the 80s! Which is cooler than the future!&&They had it at my small hometown library for a while with Xbox360 and PS3 when those were still pretty new and I think there was also a small Wii section. The program had to end after just a few months because they were having to replace half the games to damage/theft every couple weeks. &&Just check your local library's inventory. OP's sounds very well funded, but there are some that only carry VHS and maybe DVD's in their entertainment sections &&Dude.  It's the library.&&[deleted]&&> I queued up about 100gb of movies

So 2 blu-rays?&&Piracy is weird. I’ll be doing this, but just openly telling people to commit a crime is...odd. Right?

edit:  The cognitive dissonance of many of the replies I'm getting is quite amazing, I must say.

edit2: you guys...please stop. This is asinine. Pirating is stealing content. I don’t give a fuck if you think it’s not the same as stealing a car because you aren’t harming the creator. You are stealing. It’s wrong and it’s illegal. 

I get it. I get you don’t want to be in the wrong because you feel like content providers aren’t doing enough for your money. I get it. I have streamed stuff illegally as well. I’m 100% in the wrong for doing so - it’s theft. I didn’t pay for it, so I shouldn’t be able to enjoy the fruits of the creators labor. That simple. But I did, but at least I recognize it’s fucking wrong. &&At least Hulu’s “keep watching” tab is always in the same spot and always has your shows in order of what you watched last &&I cant.  Which is sad.&&Plex, or kodi have better uis&&I think you are absolutely right and I think Netflix got even more gunshy about dropping money on another big budget movie after the spent 100 million on Bright and everyone shit all over it. Its in their monetary interest to keep green lighting unproven comedians and writers to try their hand at a season of TV. Its way cheaper to make and write off if it tanks (Joel McHale show etc.) And way more profitable if it hits (Big Mouth).

Its just that the name NetFlix is a misnomer now days because its more likely you'll find a show to try out then find some obscure underappreciated film.

Thats why Prime rocks to me, they have become the garbage disposal of terrible movies and I love them for it. Where else could I find the Stamos classic ""never too young to die""? &&It's also worth noting that you're only listing stuff created mostly for western audiences they have a slew of originals for different demographics. Voltron/story bots/ spirit etc for kids. A bunch of bollywood stuff. starting to dabble in Anime with some success.  


They have a much larger breadth of content over HBO, with HBO if you're not into adult oriented drama's there's basically nothing for you.&&People assume they're shit because of abundance&&The reason you can get discs for everything is that Netflix doesn’t have to worry about copyright claims for those. They can buy as many physical copies of any movie that they want and rent it out as much as they want. But since streaming is by far the most popular medium to watch on these days it’s cost prohibitive for Netflix to get a license for every tv and movie studio.&&And Hulu is the getting punched in the balls after paying the don’t get punched in the balls fee of Streaming. &&I'm fascinated by Insatiable. It's SO CLOSE to being one of those amazing, colorful, bizarre, heightened reality dramadies (Pushing Daisies, Popular, GCB, ahh why can't I think of more) and it has so many of the same ingredients, but it just comes off as so creepy and uncomfortable instead. 

(Also if anyone remembers the show Popular, can we please talk about it?)&&They need to be more picky about shows they greenlight, they cancel everything i like. I dont even care about the marvel stuff anymore....well punisher....nothing else&&And if you sign up for that,  it doesn’t count against your data cap. 4K is going to make 1tb caps go very fast. &&That's exactly what's going to happen and there's nothing we can do about it, sadly.&&Yarr-har-har and I go back to not giving a fuck.&&And it will be the ISPs like Comcast, Charter, and AT&T who bundle them and dont count against data caps when you access it through their app. &&If Disney owns Hulu then why are they making their own fucking service? Fucking Disney owns everything. &&The studios that let that 'Netflix Original' term slide must be kicking themselves now. It's allowed Netflix to associate themselves with so many quality shows that most people firmly believe we're made by them. 

Nobody I've ever spoken to knows the difference and even after telling them it's produced by someone else the show is forever associated with Netflix in their mind. So much so that there are more seasons of shows like Peaky Blinders and The Expanse that are not on Netflix in my region but nobody even realizes because they're waiting for Netflix to produce more.&&Whoa. How can a drama about the rise of disco cost $10m an episode? 

I've never heard of it, just looked up the description. Did they build a full size replica of NYC?&&Yea all these deals will just fuck Europe over as we don't get Disney or hulu platform. Or whatever service will come next in usa&&Those are just things under the Disney label. If they include all the shit that's made by a company they own there's a lot more. For example, I don't know if this is still the case but Miramax used to be owned by Disney. That's a ton of movies like Pulp Fiction and Clerks that would be there if they still own them. If not they still have a lot of other companies that don't put the Disney production card in the movie.&&Hell Scary Movie 3 might be the best one&&I thought I wouldn't still like ""Not another teen movie"" since I last watched when it was fairly new because the reviews were pretty bad. I remember loving it in High School. Turns out it was still hilarious for me. I think i just love good spoofs.. Not another teen movie, Don't be a menace in South Central while drinking your juice in the hood, Walk Hard.&&Not Another Teen Movie is amazing!&&I never understood who came up with the idea to spoof Scream, since it's already a parody of slasher movies.&&I love how Airplane was so spoofed that they bought the goddamn rights to the movie.  


ZAZ had a talent for spoofing shit.  &&Don't forget men in tights with guy from princess bride which was a spoof of robin hood. &&I got really confused because I was pretty sure Mike Myers wasn't in Baby Driver. And then I looked it up and saw that you were talking about a mask lol&&> You also gotta consider the last time his face was in a noteworthy movie was Baby Driver.

Wait two months for Bohemian Rhapsody and that will change.&&So are Airheads, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, Punch Drunk Love, Click, Reign Over Me, and Funny People.&&Yeah, I didn't have unreasonable expectations at all. It was more like seeing if we were interested in the world. &&That's good. They'd probably put a twist in it, like changing all the characters names by a syllable for laughs or something.&&And Troll 2 which is amazing!&&Haha what a story mark!&&Can confirm, lots of Bollywood on Netflix here in South Africa&&It's very popular in portions of the Muslim world also. I have friends from Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt that all love it. &&Can confirm, am from Germany and know many that love/like bollywood. :p&&Lots here in Canada too. &&When I was a kid in Ireland I'd watch the bollywood channel, it was mad. I can still remember one scene from some 70s Indian movie that had the more zoom shots of faces I thought physically possible. I loved it. &&Exactly. Widespread piracy is a symptom of poor availability. The rise and fall in popularity of P2P file sharing and torrents has already proven two things:

1. If the price studios or music labels want to charge is higher than what people are willing to pay for entertainment, they will embrace difficult and risky new technologies and risk jailtime instead of paying.
2. If people have access to a streaming service that is simple and affordable, they will stop pirating in favor of the easy, risk-free option.

In the next few years, as networks and studios splinter the market to where streaming services cost as much as cable does, we'll see most of them fail and more and more people will return to piracy. We're all about to watch Hollywood making a very expensive mistake and then blame us for the hundreds of millions they're going to throw away on ghost town streaming services, and billions of projected revenue that will never materialize.&&1998 was 20 years ago already? Fuck...&&It's all about finding a library that is in a large loan network. My local library is tiny but is part of a huge group of libraries that shares their collections. It takes 2-5 business days to show up, mostly 2.&&Lmao were literally in a time where people are asking how libraries work.&&Lol for real 

""It's at the library!""

""Li-Bra-Ry? Hm it's very intersting? what is it? is it like a potato, which I have also never heard of?""&&It is...kind of. 
I have the entertainment package and kids package. Started in January and still haven’t paid for it, then last month they gave me 12 months of the kids package free. 

I digress. 

You can watch a lot on demand but it comes and goes rapidly and is not an entire back catalogue. 

For example there’s only season 18,19,20 of South Park available. 

Other shows you know are on certain channels sometimes do not have a on demand section, walking dead for example. 

Or your watching a show like Silicon Valley for example and by the time you get to the latest season they’ve removed it. Only the latest season. All the others are still there. 

Or when I first signed up I though I could finally watch game of thrones. Sadly it was not on there until July time, with an already expiration date of sometime late August. That changed and is still there. But the point stands that one day it could be there and the next it’s gone. 

If I had to pay for it I would be pissed. &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Laws can't  keep up with technology and aren't interested in protecting consumers just companies. If my government won't stand up for me I will stand up for myself. I am not here to rob anyone of their hard work, I simply demand to be treated fairly. Provide me a product that is accessible and fairly priced and I will buy it. As is I am now paying more for subscriptions than I ever was cable. When I can instead have the same product in higher quality and without commercials or navigating some ridiculous UI, you can guess which option I will choose.

I think of it like a consumer boycott. I will harm your business until you treat us all fairly.&&Yes but then you use the search function on Hulu and realize that they’ve tagged movies by some mythic system that brings up random shit that has nothing to do with your search. &&I loved Popular! I would watch all that WB network junk!&&I’ve been shopping around for internet and it seems like AT&T is the only one who has a data cap. I don’t have Comcast in my area so I can’t speak for them but Spectrum and Frontier said they have no data caps at all, whatsoever. I’m curious if there is throttling though but I haven’t come upon anything like that. AT&T is specific in saying that they charge for every bit of data that goes over 1 TB in a billing cycle.&&Caps should be completely illegal and how they’re still a thing is completely beyond me. Why can’t we make these companies accountable? If they’re unable to provide the service without caps(they are) then I want to see some seriously scrutinized evidence while they stand in court. 

For once. Just once.  &&I mean, there totally is something you can do about it. Vote with your wallet. Don't sign up to 10 different streaming services.&&Yeah, if/when streaming becomes total bullshit, people will just go back to the high seas. The only reason streaming has done so well is because it's been slightly more convenient than piracy and *relatively* inexpensive. If I have to juggle a bunch of subscriptions that all end up costing more money than I'd like, then I'm just gonna get rid of em.&&Exactly. Why don't the industry recognise that piracy has been reduced a substantial amount since the likes of netflix and Spotify.   By making people lose choice and having to subscribe to multiple services from different companies to get the selection they want it is just going to be the same as cable /sat TV and will ultimately drive the people who switched from piracy to legit, back to piracy again.   I know that most of the people I know will.&&Because Comcast(via NBC) owns part of it, and Disney's biggest competitor is Comcast(Universal Studios). So Disney has to share Hulu with major competitors, which they don't like. &&Disney does own everything, and hulu is where a lot of it will stay. Their streaming service is going to be targeted at children but also have their Marvel and Star Wars stuff. It is a brilliant move because they have so much popular content for kids, I don't think any other studio could pull it off in the same way. I don't think many people are rushing to CBS All Access. Hulu will still have their more adult-oriented things, R-rated films, etc.&&I think they just hired a ton of talent. Writers, music consuktanys, etc.&&It's about the rise of Hip Hop, in opposition to Disco. It's got great production values, it really it looks like they built a copy of NYC that's crumbling down. I think the problem is Baz Luhrmans style can be a bit tiring when you're binging through episodes.&&[This gag](https://media.giphy.com/media/CILGGl6sizxVC/giphy.gif) deserves an Oscar. Still makes me laugh every time.&&I watched that movie so many times &&""The last thing I remember, I looked down and... Yahtzee!""

lol

That movie is one of the best dumb comedies of all time. Actually, IMHO the first 3 are all pretty solid. 4 is where they started to lose me, tho even that had it's moments. (The car door scene was the best).

5 I'm not sure I really even remember... And I'm not quite sure if that's the drugs, or I'm just actively blocking it out...&&Scary Movie 2’s “*Take my stronggg hand*” and the Butler shoving his deformed hand into the turkey at dinner were hilarious to young me and all my friends. &&The waynes bros were so good at spoof movies tho. &&Scream was more of an homage than a parody and relaunched the Teen Killer Thriller trend that the Wayans and co. were capitalizing on. Scary Movie also heavily spoofed I Know What You Did Last Summer, Blair Witch, Scream 2 etc. &&I got really confused too because I was pretty sure that Adam Sandler wasn't in Baby Driver.&&Thank you for clearing this up for me&&I ain't fartin on no snare drum.&&Mr. Deeds is my favorite Sandler movie, fight me. &&I swear to god Bulletproof never gets the respect it deserves...&&Don't forget the good ones that didn't make it to Netflix, like Little Nicky, Big Daddy, and Eight Crazy Nights! &&The Waterboy is a classic.&&How dare you not mention The Waterboy&&Punch Drunk Love is a great movie.&&Watching the movie adaptation of Avatar to see if you like the world of the show Avatar is like eating literal shit in order to test if you like the taste of chocolate. Yeah, there’s a vague resemblance, and hell, some of it might have been made from the source material itself, but no, you just shouldn’t do it. 

&&You can say that again.&&Here in Kenya too, they even got dubs&&1998 was 20 years ago today. &&Popular was sooo weird compared to all those other shows. Do your remember that episode where they installed talking scales in the fancy popular girls only bathroom, and Nicole and Mary Cherry spent the whole episode basically having alarming laxitive diarrhea to see who could lose more weight? The later seasons went completely off the rails and it was amazing. &&Have Comcast, have data cap.

It's aggravating because they didn't tell me about it until 2 months into my service. What a terrible company.&&The exact behavior the government was trying to stop when it broke up the monopoly in the 80s&&Cox has a 1TB data cap. 

They also offer gigabit internet so you can hit your monthly cap in the first half of the first day if you get aggressive with the downloads - lol. &&As much shit as Spectrum gets, I only pay $45/month for 100mbps, no caps (I didn't even know internet companies have caps). I can easily stream any 4K content without skipping a beat. I have 0 issues.&&Spectrum throttles. Games, streams, all of it. They throttle. (I have spectrum and i saw articles about them throttling League of Legends)&&The real answer is torrenting and put everything on a student Google Drive account with unlimited space and invite your friends and family. It's what I do. &&This. I realize that most people don't want to give up their TV and their favorite shows. But, that's the only way you're going to affect change.

I've been without cable for several years and I don't miss it. I thought I would when I did it though.&&Okay. I'll sign up for the bundle then. &&Yeah and Netflix your paying it for the whole family where even the kids get to watch it. It's more convient than piracy in that way.&&I mean as long as they don't start locking you into year long contracts. You've binged everything you want on Netflix? Cancel the account until new content is available, nothing on HBO at the moment? Cancel your HBO Go, same with everything else. As long as it stays ala carte and you're not forced to pay for a bundle it's still way better than having to pay for packages and get things you don't want. &&Music consuktanys are hella expensive. &&I know their weakness! They’re powerless without their heads!&&[Video quality is very bad but the audio is oaky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOL5UF5WSX4)&&We’re not so different after all. *pees from finger*&&i dont get it lmao&&I thought 2 had several hilarious gags.

""Anton Chigurh, sir.""

""OK, let's do that one.""&&That's the dark Phoenix we need. &&He's a guy who genuinely doesn't care what critics, comic book fans, or casual fans think. Which is why he's absolutely perfect for this role. 

Jared Leto showed what happens if you go too much into ""oh, the Joker is this legendary character"" Joaquin Phoenix will just treat it like another part, so he won't get weighed down by expectations.&&Glad to see Javier Bardem expanding his acting roles to psychopathic killers!&&That hairstyle in that angle gives off some Anton Chigurh vibes. &&I mean, I'm still not sure about the whole ordeal, but you can see classic Joker in that face. Just paint him white and there you have it.

Didn't read much about this, but I guess it will basically be an extended version of Joker's origins as told by Alan Moore's The Killing Joke right?&&Eh looks good to me. Set video looked solid as well.&&I have no doubt he will be absolutely great as the Joker.

But I don't think a good actor is enough to make a good movie...&&The problem is, the best actor in the world can't save a poorly written film. Suicide Squad was oozing with talent, and it fucking SUCKED.&&
Don't forget the WB is a mess and needs to reboot.&&What's wrong with the director? People hating because he made The Hangover? Not his fault the studio wanted unneeded sequels. People gotta work.&&It's strange that people say that the Joker doesn't need an origin, when one of the most acclaimed comic books about him *- The Killing Joke -* deals with his origin. It's an unreliable narrator, yes, but who's to say the movie won't have that as well?

Maybe it's bad, maybe it's good, but it being an origin story is in no way against the spirit of the Joker as a character.

*Edit: the above is with the caveat that it deals with his origin in somewhat the same way the comic did. I agree that an origin for the origin's sake is not necessary for the character.*&&> The Joker doesn’t need an origin.

My only argument with this one is that every time they take a mysterious, sinister character and decide to explore his background and give him an origin, the loss of mystique is usually damaging to the character.

Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter come to mind. Other than the tidbits of exposition that we're fed through the movies, we're left to fill in the blanks ourselves. And as any good horror writer will tell you, there's nothing scarier than our own imaginations. The manchild on the hill who lives with dead mother's corpse, or the supremely intelligent, charming cannibal - those characters were absolutely chilling.

But once they peel back the onion and show us Hannibal Lecter in college, or Norman Bates hanging out at the movies with his friends, they lose that scariness to me and they become far more human and relatable. 

I like the idea of The Joker just appearing, and just being evil, ""just because"". I don't need to see him as a 12year old being grounded by his mom, or his first date at the multiplex going horribly wrong, but maybe that's just me.

As much as I loved Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and consider them to be masterpieces, it was also a shame to see Batman dissected with so much rationality, realism and logic that even the ears in his mask had a functional reason for existing. Burton's ""less is more"" worked better when it came to maintaining the legend.&&Overall the resume of the director makes him a perplexing choice for a movie like this, but War Dogs was pretty good. He seemed to be headed in a more serious direction with that, so I'm definitely open to seeing what he'll do with this.&&A lot of people seem to blame DC for what’s happening to the DCEU. Remember that they have no real say in what happens. WB is in charge of the final product that goes out and owns the rights to the DC IPs.&&> I’ll watch anything Phoenix does. 

He truly is fantastic though. I've not seen a movie with him I didn't like.&&Looks like Glenn Fleshler is the clown.&&I'm getting a ""Batman Begins"" vibe looking at those pictures similar to the first pics of Bale as Batman in what seemed like a factory and that's a good thing. This might be an unpopular opinion but I've always felt like TDK and TDKR strayed from BB's ""vibe"" a little too much. It had so much potential as it was and somehow I think this could be a retaking of that atmosphere, I certainly hope so.

Phoenix definitely looks the part, at least the pre-joker phase as a down-on-his-luck dude who finally snaps.

I don’t see any reason to doubt him.  &&Clearly you've never seen the blacklist.

Why can't the movies?&&And honestly, it wasn't the direction that was the problem with The Hangover's sequels. Mostly the writing (and well, he is writing this, but, hopefully this is a passion project and not a pay cheque like the latter two Hangovers were). &&My biggest problem with this is that, much like Venom, the Joker is so uninteresting without Batman. His whole character is structured as a foil to Batman. I don't give a shit about the Joker if he's not trying to mess with Batman. Their relationship is why he's such a great character. Give him an origin, I don't care (although his lack of a concrete one is part of what makes him so compelling) but if he's not fighting Batman I also don't care.&&I think it's more in relation with Batman that his origin is unnecessary. We prefer a Joker that comes out of the blue as the Batman becomes a major problem for criminals.

The Killing Joke story was great tho.&&I would absolutely love it if the whole thing ended up being Joker's backstory as told to Harley Quinn.&&Well, Alan Moore explicitly said he didn't want it to be canon and DC agreed.

Also, no offense to Moore, but his origin was lame as shit.

The more exposure and the more involvement, the less scary they become.&&Yep. It's one of the things that ruined wolverine.

It seems like leaving their origin mysterious and ambiguous from a business stand point would also be better.

The thing his, Hannibal is an excellent example of a villain whose origin can be done right.  The Hannibal TV series was, for the most part, across-the-board superb and enriched the character of Hannibal Lecter far beyond *any* of the movie adaptations.  

The TV show presented Hannibal Lecter worked well to build a complex character as well an almost mythological presence, and he was far more interesting for it.&&>> The Joker doesn’t need an origin.

That's what happened to the Xenomorph. What started as a painting done by a strange, charming, talented and dark Swiss man who looked like Walter Koenig - with broken English- turned slowly into a fantastic sci-fi horror movie.

And then from that horror movie it became a series, then a franchise, then a comic book, a plastic figure.... That's when you know you should stop. The scary space monster has run it's course. Kill the Alien. Long live the biomechanics of Giger.  

I long for the day when something new is done but still taking inspiration from H.R Giger's paintings. I'm looking forward to that game, Scorn. Hope it won't turn out like Agony.
&&It’s not even the human characters where this happens either! Look at the Xenomorph and the Predator Aliens. It’s scary because we barely knew anything about either of them. The more these films go and investigate their history and what makes them tick, the less interesting the aliens get. 

I get that Prometheus, Alien Covenant, and Predators have groups of fans, but it started going into the creature(s) and what brought them out and tried explaining them, and for a lot of fans of the series, it just felt wrong. &&If it's not that great, he's usually still great in it.&&I love a Fleshler.

I agree that the Joker feeds off the Batman, but if he successfully killed Bats, I think he'd just laugh and keep going.

""And they were just telling me that there are serious problems with the script. And that the executives I was having dinner with were complaining about people who work on the Batman movie. And they just said they went to the studio and they said, ‘Look, the script is … Here’s 30 things that are wrong with it that we can fix.’ And [the executives] said, ‘We don’t care. We don’t really care. The amount of money we’re going to make globally, I mean 70 percent of our audience is not going to be seeing this in English. And it doesn’t really matter, these things that you’re bringing up about the flaws of the script.’ So I do think global concerns play a big part in how movies, and what movies, are being made, obviously.""

Is it confirmed whether or not Batman will appear in the movie? After all, even though it is centered around the Joker, The Killing Joke featured Batman as well.

I love TDKR but that part always seemed off to me. I also think the Joker might have been depressed because he didn't get the chance to kill the Batman before he disappeared. It might have been different if he had.&&He looks like a meth head soundcloud rapper.&&Idk man... Lex has always been sophisticated and genius. I never read a comic or watched any of the cartoons where he was creepy and crazy. Even in Superman Red Son, where Lex kills all his employees... he still had some method to his madness. The dude from the bat v sup movie kinda just seemed like he wanted to see the world burn. Maybe Heath Ledger set a tone that DC thinks all their villains should follow?

A modern crime boss in the sense I'm referring to would be a part of modern gang culture. It could mean many things, but prison tats (that aren't utterly ridiculous ones), drug trade culture, and a more ""lean, shark-like survival instinct"" type of demeanor rather than ""cultured, honorable Sicilian-trained gangster"", would be one way to do it.

I think Leto made an attempt at this, but he (and the writing, and the character design) botched it up in a bunch of ways, making it more silly and annoying than believable.&&I agree, I think gangster ink would be totally appropriate for the concept, but the specific tattoos they went with were atrocious.&&They fucked up by killing Ares&&Wonder Woman 84 is obviously set in the 80s.

I love how people saying anything that isn't a part of a cinematic universe is somehow new and experimental when that was basically every comic movie franchise before Marvel started their cinematic universe.&&To be honest I don’t give a shit about DC’s ‘canon’ at this point, as that ship sailed in terms of quality long ago. They’re not Marvel and they need to get over that. What they do offer though is individually strong films, many of which are far more experimental and game-changing than anything Marvel has to offer (i.e. their Dark Knight trilogy). They should focus on that.&&I’m all for them dumping the shared universe concept. Don’t get me wrong, I love what marvel is doing but that doesn’t mean everyone should be doing it.

Definitely, though a product of being raised by the pedophile who murdered Caligula’s family at his pleasure palace. But mad and delusional? I don’t believe so.&&I agree 100%.

Please, never, ever, in a million years, ever. Let Jason be his own thing, or stay dead. Don't make him the Joker. Yes, I know, the Red Hood was originally yadayada, but, it's really not the same as literally painting his hair and calling himself the Joker.

Let Leto-Joker just be a copycat or one of the Three Jokers. &&GET UP ON THE HYDRA’S BACK&&[Put your hands down Kaminsky, you look like a West Texas cheerleader at a damn pep rally.](https://i.imgur.com/d5Ivpwq.gifv)&&Is Joker still immortal in canon, like Crazy Quilt said during New 52?

2) Happened during Darkside War

3) The chair is space Wikipedia.  You just have to ask any question and it will tell you the answer.  To test it out, Batman asks: What is the identity of the Joker? And after receiving the answer he just says: ""Of course"".  Presumably, the chair asked him back: the identity of which Joker? New 52, Pre-crisis, or The Killing Joke's Joker?

Having 3 Jokers is part of a larger mystery that retcons New 52 from being an editorial mandate to an in-universe manipulation by a higher being [Dr. Manhattan](#spoiler).  This being is responsible for expelling characters from the DC universe and removing them from everyone's memories.  Essentially, everything that was lost between Flashpoint to New 52 was because of this being. 

edit: clarity, hopefully. &&The chair doesn't force all knowledge on you. Batman asked who the joker is and the chair responded, informing him that there are three.&&[deleted]&&Sit in the chair.

Having Tim Burton and Christopher Nolan make Batman movies, with a decent amount of creative control, was the smartest moves made regarding DC movies. &&Apparently they clarified that isn't the official name.

It's explained in a DKR graphic novel that the Joker was the only person not able to escape Arkham. I may be misremembering so someone help me out pretty please.

*OH-OH-oh-oh*&&Superhero fatigue is REAL!&&Because everyone wants to fuck elasti-mom&&What I don't understand is why this movie? Even with adjustments, Frozen seems like it would have made at least twice as much as Incredibles 2. Not that this wasn't a good movie, I just don't understand what makes this one extremely profitable to this extent, when most of the reactions (including mine) to it are lukewarm.

At least, this pretty much can confirm them making a third movie, which I wouldn't complain about.&&To bad it didn't live up to my expectations at all. It was funny at times, even if the humor felt forced. But the story felt so rehashed and pales in comparison to the first film.

It cemented the idea in my mind that Pixar just struck gold with Toy Story. Three great films.

Super hero fatigue is just silly.

Maybe I don’t go to the box office but I’m buying the early release on the tv. I don’t buy dvds any more but will purchase the movie on cable. 

Netflix should have a purchase new movies section. Like dvds at Walmart, but it goes into a permanent folder that you can save the files offline on your computer or phone to watch with no internet.&&I feel like the fact that some superhero movies go into different genres as well (GOTG & Thor Ragnarok are comedy; TDK, TDKR and Daredevil (TV Show) are crime thrillers, etc.) takes away most of the fatigue, at least in my opinion. &&People like quality movies, that's all there is to it.

It has truly pushed the MCU above and beyond where it started from and it helps make solid movies.  But then you get the corporate side of it like with Gunn and how they swing their big mouse dick and push small theaters around.  Along with this Pixar and Star Wars is coasting mostly on sequels and nostalgia.  Incredibles 2 would not have done as well if not for nostalgia and that’s what sucks.  I mean it was a good movie but it is no where near record breaking good. But this industry is run by money.   Then you also have the MCU which is at the top because it is just that good.  I just watched infinity war while on a flight simply because I was excited to watch it for the 5th or 6th time.  &&I mean zootopia also broke a billion dollars&&When has Disney ever needed a break?&&Something something Shadman.&&People really wanted to see Elastigirl's&&I'm a gay lady, and before I saw the movie, I read that creepy New York Times review where the guy spent a large chunk of the review implying he couldn't concentrate because Helen was just so dang thicc and he had a boner the whole movie.

Then I saw it. And I understood.

I think it's highly unlikely, but not impossible.&&I genuinely have no idea what Frozen 2 is going to do. I feel like we're in this weird place where Frozen could well have reached a kind of saturation point already, without another movie having even hit the cinemas yet.

I was so surprised to see how angry people were at having to sit through a new 20 minute Frozen short before Coco. I assume Disney had positioned that short there over concerns Coco might not perform that amazingly without it, but people showed up for Coco and fucking hated that short.

Was Frozen just a thing that happened at precisely the right time and with precisely the right age group? Will it end up like Alice in Wonderland, where the first makes crazy and unexpectedly huge bank, but the sequel flops as all interest had since fizzled?

No idea. But if I was going to put money on it, I would say that I don't think Frozen 2 is going to perform as well as the first without something very novel being offered instead of just more of the same.&&We're running out of space in the title.&&Oh god... we're gonna get an Incredibles-MCU crossover movie in the future aren't we&&I feel like this is a shame for the Dark Knight&&Not surprising though. It's made more then the first film. Avengers IW didn't include Antman and unlike the Phase 2 films, Antman could ride the wave since he wasn't in IW.  That set of films would probably be more successful after the 4th Avengers film.&&I'm almost afraid to ask how much Disney made on MCU so far....&&I loved the second Ant-man, too lol. &&And all 4 of those were Disney. Jesus Christ.&&There’s debate in the industry about how to account for releases that span year end.  They keep two sets of record books, for top film grosses per release year and top grossing films in the year. &&Don't forget the merchandise. Domestically, these have all easily made Disney $1B each. &&Dreamworks&&[deleted]&&Pixar has been part of Disney before Disney got greedy &&~~Dreamworks~~ Universal, Fo- oh wait...&&[deleted]&&I thought The Incredibles 2 was great when I first saw it, but now that I look back on it, it's really just underwhelming. The villain is terrible and predictable, the climax is boring (all they have to do is turn the boat around), Dash has nothing to do, Mr. Incredible forgets all of the lessons he learned in the first movie about treating his family as capable equals, Honey and Edna Mode are both signficantly worse than in the original, the plot makes no sense (the public went from being completely against superheroes to wanting them to operate again in just a couple months at most just because Elastigirl did like 3 heroic things), and characters constantly make stupid decisions (For example, why don't Violet and Dash take the masks off of the generic mind-controlled side heroes after beating them?). The animation is better than the animation in the original, but nothing else is.

Edit: And I forgot to mention my biggest problem with the movie. Unlike almost every other Pixar movie, this movie has no hidden darkness. Toy Story is a movie about two toys being captured by a sadist who plans to torture them to death. A Bug's Life is about a plague of grasshopper tyrants. Toy Story 2 is about Woody wrestling with his own mortality. Monsters Inc. is about an entire dimension that runs on the screams of children. Finding Nemo is Taken but with fish. The Incredibles has superhero genocide. Ratatouille has the rat poison shop. WALL-E is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie. Up is about struggling to rebuild your life after you've lost the only person you love. Toy Story 3 has the toys almost burning to death. Inside Out is literally about depression. Coco is about death and Alzheimer's. In contrast, The Incredibles 2 is just a light-hearted superhero comedy with almost no darkness anywhere. It doesn't feel like a movie that's made for both adults and kids.&&Tomorrowland was a mess, but it felt like a mess that was a result of too much studio interference over a misstep on Bird's part. The usual story of Disney saying they want one thing, but then deciding they want another when production is underway and demanding changes and rewrites on the go. Especially as it was based on one of their precious branded theme park attractions and they wanted another Pirates of the Caribbean in that regard. 

It's the only movie Brad Bird has done that's felt like it was stitched together from a handful of unfinished ideas and themes, completely unlike his usual narratively tight, visually majestic, and mature work.&&But that means that Bird is how stuck only doing animated movies for Disney. This will just make Disney more averse to giving him non-animated projects.&&Bahahahauaha!

Son, that money goes straight into the budget for Thor 7 and Black Panther 3. And some for the cryogenic warehouse.&&Source? Do you know how much they actually make?&&Superhero + Nostalgia bait.

Basically prints money&&I would say it’s all due to the nostalgia. I’m a teen and personally love Pixar movies and a lot of Disney films, but I know most people my age wouldn’t be into it anymore. Pretty much all of my friends went to see Incredibles 2, though. They had all seen it as kids and couldn’t wait for the sequel after such a long time.

Frozen, however, was just another Pixar movie, so people in that age range at the time weren’t as likely to think twice about it. I think afterwards, when all the music started spreading, it got much more popular and people began to watch it on DVD, TV, etc. Frozen 2 will definitely surpass the first I think because you’ll get all the kids who saw it the first time it came out, younger children like 5 or 6 that saw the first one later on, and the older people who viewed it after its initial release. &&I do agree that Incredibles two wasn’t as good as the first, but I think it’s still better than finding dory, monsters university, cars 2 and 3, the good dinosaur, and brave. It’s like middle of the road. My favorite Pixar movie if recent times is Inside out, because it was creative, emotional, funny, not a sequel, and overall really well made

Edit: Cars 2 and 3, not 1&&I liked it but it felt quite unnecessary and I don't see any artistic reason to have returned to this series after all these years.Twin Peaks season 3 or Fury Road this is not.

Action is amazing though, we need more animated superhero movies cause it's host a better fit.Always was,always will be.&&Third act was dismal and had no real scale of drama or stakes. &&Finding Dory was pretty good imo.  Not better than Nemo, but good.  

Generally, you are right, though.   &&I felt like the actors’ introduction was kind of an apology, like sorry this is what we came up with after almost 15 years but we hope you like it anyway&&Yes that's exactly how I felt. I was expecting a lot more from the sequel than what we got, but it was more or less just a retread of the first Incredibles. Outside of Toy Story 2 and 3, I feel they have yet to produce a sequel that that outshines the original.&&I find it funny you reduce Incredibles 2 to the sum of its parts and dub it a ""rehash"" when you can easily apply the same thinking to the Toy Story movies. They are, when boiled down to their bones, essentially telling the same story over, particularly the second two. But, like the Incredibles, the events, the drama, and the characters are far more important and enthralling than the entire originality of each of the movie's plots.&&It's what happens when nostalgia is abused with monetary ends.&&Aren’t like majority of sequels in general worse than the original films?&&For inflation, ticket prizes and total size of the market.&&They are at Box Office Mojo&&> **with my toddler**  
  
Holy hell and I thought the 7 year olds who were crying at the scary parts (most notably the ***gimpmask flashing seizure fest cube fight scene***) were gonna have problems sleeping.  Just for reference does ""toddler"" mean ~2 year old? :/&&200 million dollars, same as Black Panther, Last Jedi was 317, Infinity War 316-400 by no means are these movies very cheap.&&I mean, they kept Black Panther in theaters until last month to hit 700 million domestic. They like round numbers&&They did the same last year with Finding Dory even though it wasn't near a milestone. It's to get a boost from labor day. &&It's Labour Day weekend and it's standard practice for Pixar films as they did the same for Toy Story 3 and Finding Dory 

It would have done it without the expansion anyway, just would have taken a bit longer &&Disney keeps doing this. I feel like this strategy is becoming part of their brand. &&I mean, I pirate as much as the next guy, but I don't think piracy would cut into cinema sales as much as it would DVD/Blu-ray sales. The theater experience just can't be replaced, unless you have an in-home theater which most don't. Plus, the good torrents aren't out until the DVD and Blu-ray releases are out so if you want to see it while people are talking about it, you kinda need to see it in theaters. &&You may notice that inly Disney is operating at these kinds of numbers.&&The Mouse goes a long way.&&Why would she make it r rated?&&Most of the movies Disney churns out are, at worst, 'okay'. They also have excellent marketing and consistently ensure that their ""kids movies"" are very watchable for adults as well. 

Fuckin' Emperors New Groove is the best comedy ever made, don't @ me.&&- Rise against&&I appreciate this &&Exacerbated by the fact that’s it’s syntax is highly complicated &&As you can see, I am not dead! &&I think that the idea of superhero fatigue really originated after Age of Ultron. There was so much hype around it leading up to the release, but then it turned out to be not quite as good as the first one. And so people started forecasting the demise of the superhero genre overall. Luckily, some of the best Marvel has had to offer has come after Age of Ultron.&&I mean, it's not an imaginary concept. One could easily become tired of superhero movies. The term mostly gets tossed about from James Cameron using it, who didn't say that it had manifested, so he wasn't referencing bad movie fatigue. He was just saying he thought/hoped that it would manifest soon.

Clearly, society as a whole does *not* have superhero fatigue, but that doesn't mean that the concept doesn't exist or refers to something else.&&Marvel is capturing familiarity in a complex universe while humanizing the characters.  

DC is trying to do ""what Nintendon't"" and it's painfully cringe worthy.&&As a big DC comic fan it hurts me to say this but you're right.  Man of steel, s v b, and Justice league just weren't very good.  Here's hoping Shazam will change that.&&Except wonder woman, the other movies are just plain bad. &&Lindsay Ellis had a recent video on musicals which were the superhero genre of their time. The parallels are worth considering. &&I think this is an even better example of bad content causes fatigue. The most recent zombie craze has been filled with such low quality stuff that it's not surprising that people would be tired of it. &&I am definitely sick of zombies. At least I still like Tony Stark's crazy antics.&&Zombie fatigue? I thought the whole zombie thing ended 6-7 years ago. It's beyond ""fatiuge"" now, it's a damn dead cow.&&We'll get tired of superheroes and zombies just in time for the Marvel Zombies arc to hit theatres at peak fatigue.&&The problem with that is that Westerns partially fell out of favor because people started realizing the problems with mythologizing the Wild West. I think a better comparison would be the decline of musicals in the late 60s and early 70s.&&Say that to Blade Runner 2049 

:-(&&I really hope Shazam doesn't suck because that trailer looked great.&&[deleted]&&For what it's worth, when it comes to the quality of the films I think Disney takes a mainly hands-off approach, which explains the difference in quality between the MCU and Star Wars, for example.&&You have been banned from participating in /r/the_mouse&&I don't really have much of an opinion about Disney's output, but they are spearheading the monopolization of media. Once they swallow up the 21st Century Fox, it's goodbye competition.

Then again, since regulators aren't going to do anything to keep competition alive, consolidation is all the rage in all businesses, not just media.&&>  Incredibles 2. . . was a good movie but it is no where near record breaking good.

I mean, the point of this post is that it literally broke a record.&&Ahh shadman. A monument to degeneracy&&If you don't know who he is, this is either something you really want to google or really don't want to google. 

I can't say what type of person should or shouldn't google it, but if you do so, you'll know more about what group of people you fit into. &&And all this time I thought she was voiced by Jodi Foster. &&I'm still waiting to see a cut of that scene where Elastigirl is like bent over moaning in the cockpit, tripping balls due to oxygen deprivation.

They're remaking The Lion King? &&It better tell the true story with Timon and Pumba and not just be boring and dramafilled like the Jungle Book.&&I know that lion king would be easy money but it’d be like an all cgi version of beauty and the beast and jungle book and only have technical brilliance. I hope they make live action Atlantis or Treasure Planet. Unlikely I know, but who wouldn’t want to see those movies &&I think it depends on how much live action stuff is in it. IIRC they changed the rules to make it so movies like Avatar wouldn't be nominated for Best Animated Picture&&Can someone explain this remake to me? I kinda got the live action Jungle Book, because it's a human with expertly animated animal, but there are no humans in Lion King. Besides fulfilling a 2010s fantasy recast, what's the appeal of this?&&That’s gonna be shit though. Why remake Disney’s best movie? It will never be better than the original. &&The Frozone solo movie is just the next step in the Incredibles cinematic universe.&&You’re not alone&&Road to El Dorado 2 >:(&&They have a TV show I think&&I just want a Monsters vs. Aliens/Cowboys vs. Aliens crossover.&&I feel like a lot of the ""Frozen Fever"" built up *after* its theatrical run though. It obviously grossed a lot, but I remember many people dismissing it when it first came out.&&I definitely disagree. Frozen was a big hit when it came out but the popularity of Elsa and Anna among kids has only grown since then. It's certainly a much bigger property then the Incredibles. So I think that as long as Frozen 2 gets good reviews and good word of mouth its popularity gives it a good shot to match Incredibles 2's nostalga dollars.&&Big Hero 6 is a Marvel property that Disney animated. It's not likely, but it could happen!&&No, but I bet we're going to get an Incrediverse.

Maybe one more movie of the Parr family so it's a trilogy, then Violet, Dash, Jack Jack and Voyd will get movies (together or separate).&&They can join the MCU and name themselves the Fantastic 4.  Wait a minute...&&Do it like Roger Rabbit where the Incredibles are still animated in a live-action world.&&The Dark Knight is still the highest grossing non marvel superhero movie adjusted for inflation. &&Yeah expecting Ant Man to do anywhere near those movies is pretty unrealistic, he is nowhere near as popular as those characters nor does he have any cultural or nostalgic factors backing him. &&Suffice to say Marvel has been their best investment so far, potentially only rivaled by Disneyland.&&Closing on $20b&&A bit less than $17 billion because Paramount owned some of the properties before and Spider-Man: Homecoming all went into Sony's pocket believe it or not. No money changed hands. Disney said let us make this money for you and the workers at Marvel Studios got paid for making it but Sony got all the profits 330 million domestic in exchange for Disney being able to use him in Captain America and The Avengers. &&Ant-Man and the Wasp wasn't bad, it just didn't really build upon the trends of Phase 3 and felt a lot more like a Phase 2 movie. Not to mention it came right off the heels of Infinity War, and let's just say, following up one of the biggest movies of all times did it no favors. People just weren't interested in a silly adventure about saving the main character's mom after seeing half the universe wiped out, and that's understandable. Honestly, the main reason why I went to see it (besides the fact that it's a Marvel movie and I traditionally go to see every single one of these in theaters) was so I could see how it would tie into A4. &&And all 4 of those were Disney. ~~Jesus Christ~~ Mickey Mouse. 

FTFY&&Soon to shut down? &&Dreamworks is Universal. &&So much unrealized potential.&&I agree. It wasn't *bad*, it was *disappointing*. It could have been so much more than *Escape to Witch Mountain: Disney Parks Ride Edition*.&&People complain all the time when the stakes of every hero movie is to save the entire world by stopping the giant sky laser or any number of other tropes.  Why can't movies have tangible, smaller-scale threats that are still large threats to the characters personally?

Then the heroes are about to ruin their lives and livelihoods due to mind control, and once they escape that, about to be responsible for ramming a giant cruise ship into a city and killing a lot of people, possibly including themselves... and the complaint becomes the stakes are not big enough?

I thought the finale was great and the threat was certainly big enough for it to be captivating.  And there was no sky laser.&&Haha you are just having a case of “typical /r/movies 360”. Only when a movie crosses certain metrics for success is when people on this sub start showing symptoms&&Where do you get the idea that the public was completely against heroes at the start of the movie? It's been 15 years. Surely the attitudes are not equal to the time they were outlawed.

The public were not consulted during the 15 years. They were just used to the status quo. The brother character feels that the time is right to put on a public relations campaign. If the hatred was equal to what it was 15 years ago, he would hold off.

They save the city from the Sydrome bot. So far so good. A setback with the Underminer, but they were trying to help. Then like 3 positive outcomes in a row for Elastigirl. All after 15 years of nothing. People that were kids at the ban and loved the heroes or have no memory of them, now are old enough to have a say in any referendum.&&I feel like you are pretty spot on (with the exception of Edna Mode, as I loved her in this movie), in pretty much all things related to story its not as good as the first. But I still love it because of the action. To me it had some of the best action set pieces I've seen in a while, particularly the train and helicopter scenes featuring Elastigirl.&&I was the other way around. I saw it the first time and liked it, then I went back and rewatched it 3 more times and I picked up on just how much nuance, both visually and in the text there is. It's genuinely amazing just how much themeing, call-back, and layering has been worked in.

1) Dash didn't need an arc, he is an interesting character as-is and he got a resolution to his problems at the end of the first movie. Violet didn't though, which is why it was her arc that got focus this time around.

2) I completely disagree the villain was bad. The Screenslaver was genuinely scary as a fake ruse villain and, although the reveal was not surprising, it wasn't really meant to be. Evelyn was probably one of the most nuanced and interesting sympathetic villain-but-not-really-villains Pixar or Disney have written in a long while. There are so many layers to her as an actual person, and her being revealed to be acting out of a sense of directionless unresolved grief and misplaced anger over any real megomania was genius I thought.

It gave her the opportunity for some really complex head-butting with Helen that elevated it above the usual punchy-fighty, as it became clear the two women did both like each-other, but couldn't except each other's viewpoint. I LOVE narratives where both the villain and the hero can be seen as correct, and Incredibles 2 did it as flawlessly as I've seen any animated movie do it. 

3) We have no idea how the public perceives superheroes at that point. Only that government officials still consider them a nuisance and that the media is invested in portraying them in a negative light. They very clearly set up the idea that civilians do actually still like the idea of superheroes, even if some still fear them.

**4) Incredibles 1 isn't about superhero genocide, it's about the strength of family. The same thing the second one is about. The themes that run not only through the Parr family's struggle this time, but also the villain.**

Both of the Deavor sibling's entire motivations stem from their deep love for their parents and neither of them having got over losing them. Evelyn grows bitter and sees supers as responsible for her family being torn apart, Winston becomes more childishly enamored with them because he associates his feelings of nostalgia with his parents still being alive. The conflicting actions of both set the plot into motion and turn the tables on supers being illegal. THIS IS IN THE TEXT!

There's also some excellent implications that Winston not listening to and supporting his sister is what enables her to end up going down such a dark path alone, where the Parr's learning to support each other's needs and failings only makes them stronger.&&The death and Alzheimer's were not the dark side of Coco. What about the guy who murdered his friend/co-songwriter in cold blood because he wanted to go to go back home and see his wife and daughter? &&There was a whole rant by Screenslaver while Elastigirl is tracking his broadcast signal that pretty clearly points out what the dark theme of the movie is about: screen addiction.

The whole movie had a blatant message that being obsessed with our screens is bad. It's one of the only Pixar movies that has pretty direct commentary on a negative part of society.&&I was kind of iffy on it when I first saw it. Some things were great but it lacked the charm of the original in so many ways. I’m sure if I rewatch it, I’ll like it even less. But to be fair, it’s not exactly like Syndrome was a great villain. In fact, he’s one of the worst movie villains of all time. His plan was beyond terrible. The family interactions were what was so great about the first one. I just felt they could have done much more with the family dynamic with this one. Dash truly had nothing to do in this one, and everything was focused on Jack Jack. Violet’s crush on the boy was somewhat well done, but no one really changed much.&&It came out im our cinemas just now. (SPOIOER AHEAD? )

But my question, lingering there since watching the movie, was *that* supposed to be a plot twist? It was so cheap for this movie I dont even know if they were trying to make it an actuap twist or not.. ?&&And some for the child-loving circles of trust.&&Cars 1 is a great movie that I do not understand the hate for. &&The biggest downfall, to me, of the film was the way it was presented in theaters (and even advertisements,) as well as the fact that I never wanted a Finding Dory or Monsters University. Finding Nemo and Monsters Inc. were as perfect as it gets, and so because I had 0 expectations I went in and thought ""Yeah, this is pretty average. The original was better."" And moved on.

But The Incredibles, other than Toy Story, seemed like the most logical and perfect series to, well, turn into a series.

When I sat down in the theater, I watched five minutes of the actors and directors patting each other on the back for their hard work and dedication to making this film happen.

Followed by the short film, Bao; whether you like it or not, I personally found it to be offputting. But that's a whole other discussion.

Then the film... Elastigirl shouldn't have been dumb enough to fall for such a clear as day scheme. Mr. Incredible was a washed up superhero desperately holding on to the glory days and anything remotely associated with them. It makes sense he would fall right into Syndrome's plan. He was blinded. Luckily, his wife was there to help.

But this film just didn't do it for me. I found all the characters lacking in development; Dash had maybe two lines and didn't have any cool scenes or displays of his powers. And Violet had the exact same arc as the first film. It may have been funny at times, but like I said, the humor from the first film felt so natural. This one overall felt forced.

I could go on, but basically because I had such high expectations for it, it just hurt so much more when I left the theater being rather disappointed.&&It definitely rubbed me the wrong way when it happened. But I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they really meant it, you know?

But by the end I was like wow... they were either delirious, lying, or sucking their own dicks. I was so disappointed. Even if it was funny at times, and looked beautiful, the plot and villains were stale and unoriginal. Such a let down all around.&&Terminator 2 and Aliens are basically the only two sequels that live up to the original. Cameron can make a mean sequel. I hope his Avatar sequel is half as good as he's saying it's going to be. &&Completely agree!&&For being 14 years in the making, the movie just feels rushed. The sum of its parts pretty much are all that is there. It feels jumbled and very rehashed.

Toy Story 2 and 3 introduced new elements while never feeling cheap or like a retread. For a while they even did good not turning it into a cash grab (sans Toy Story 4 most likely, and the minor spinoffs.)

The events of Incredibles 2 were just not as good as the original and didn't really add anything new for me. A few months from my watch in theaters and I can barely remember any scenes other than the obviousness of the villain and how dumb Elastigirl was for falling for it. She, and all of the characters, really deserved better writing.

The Jack Jack stuff was funny, and the one scene with Violet at the restaurant was great. But other than that it wasn't memorable.

If you told me to pick my favorite Toy Story, it would be insanely hard. Each one feels like an important chapter of the overall story.

Incredibles? Hands down, the first one every time.&&This list takes all of that into account: http://www.filmsite.org/boxoffice3.html

They’ve also managed to make each movie unique and tie into something else. The fatigue hasn’t come I feel, because each installment is telling a much much bigger story.  It leaves fans without a resolution. When that story ends and the movies fall into the “get it out to make more money” phase we will see people getting tired.  &&A lot of ""Phase Two"" in general inspired that concern. Iron Man 3 was a disappointment for a lot of people, and many still consider Thor 2 to be a candidate for worst MCU film. Winter Soldier despite being well-received is thought to have slightly underperformed, doing a half billion less than IM3 and barely doing better than Thor 2. Guardians was a surprise hit, but it's not really a ""superhero film"" which made a lot of people wonder if the desire for superhero films was waning. People were also lukewarm about the announced upcoming solo debuts for Ant-Man and Doctor Strange. 

Phase 3 really turned a corner. Civil War got incredible reviews and maybe should've been called an Avengers movie (and Age of Ultron maybe should've been Iron-Man 4); it got people excited about the MCU again. Strange and GOTG2 did well, and then Marvel blew up the spot with Homecoming, Ragnarok, and Black Panther all outdoing peoples expectations. &&judging history since superman in 1938, we have never not loved superhero media. there have always been comics, tv or movies about superheroes and they have been popular since then.&&And they were all directed by Zack Snyder.&&[deleted]&&To be somewhat fair, I feel like zombies is a much narrower theme than superheroes, and people haven't done badly with it while it was popular.

Probably because it took place pre-IW. So we still haven't seen a MCU movie deal with the aftermath of the Snappening. And Captain Marvel takes place in the 90s. I wonder what MCU film is supposed to be set after IW (except A4)?&&Does.. this put a smile on my face?&&I was a huge Tomorrowland apologist the year it came out. I was the guy in the office telling co-workers that ""it wasn't that bad.""

I recently watched it again, and yeah, it's pretty bad. The marketing led me to believe that a huge chunk of the film was going to take place in this crazy, futuristic utopian city. That was maybe 10 minutes of the film. The other two hours? A surly George Clooney has an awkward, passive-aggressive romance with a robot that looks like an 11-year old girl. 

I admire the progressive message that the film tried to convey, but it was outweighed by so much sloppy filler.&&Exactly. And Incredibles was always first and foremost a family drama. In the first movie, Buddy was also acting out of a sense of personal betrayal and a need to exact a very specific kind of vengeance. The stakes were only as big as his effect on the Parr family and other supers, and his rampage at the end was nothing the city hadn't been dealing with already for the past 15 years supers were gone.

Evelyn by comparison was far more complex and certainly more redeemable/understandable than Buddy. But setting up a genuinely scary false villain like Screenslaver, then revealing an emotionally unstable grieving woman as the real threat behind that was nothing short of brilliant imo. Tying together the themes of family being a motivating force, for good or for bad.

The stakes were based in the relationships between the characters, like the first one. And I adored it for that. I genuinely can't sit through another superhero movie were the villain is a big overpowered muscle-dude who wants to destroy the universe, or an big red portal in the sky climax.&&The problem with the finale is that the a relatively slow-moving cruise ship doesn't feel that threatening and the villain herself is a a completely normal person without any powers or gadgets that she's using herself. Sure, skybeam climaxes are boring. But I at least want a decent fight with tension at the end (and fighting the mind-controlled heroes who had almost no character development and were poorly animated was not decent).&&Plenty of people raised those problems at the time.&&Even while watching it I felt like that though.  It was good, but if it wasn't a sequal of a movie I loved I would have not liked it very much.  It was entertaining, but forgettable.&&I didn’t like it from the get go&& Shouldn’t that be 180°?&&Like they did with Infinity War and MI Fallout. Oh wait, they didn't.&&Even if the young people supported superheroes again, I really don't believe that there'd be enough support after just a month or two for an international summit to legalize superheroes. That's just not how public opinion works.&&There's also that. Coco is really dark.&&Except that’s never touched on anywhere else throughout the movie. The entire philosophy of the Screenslaver was just a cover for Evil Endeavor.&&How in the world is Syndrome one of the worst villains of all time?&&Syndrome's plan was stupid, but he was a charismatic villain with cool gadgets and a cool design. Evil Endeavor has none of that.&&[deleted]&&I think Reddit either never liked Cars for some odd reason, or they experienced so much shock from Cars 2 that its spoiled the first one.&&Reddit polarizes hard on most movies. Cars doesn’t have enough devout followers to defend it, so all you hear is the haters&&Ya Dash was so fast I didn’t even see him in the fucking movie&&The voice acting sounded way off to me as well. as if the actors weren’t together when recording them. &&The biggest problem with the second movie is that it immediately undoes whatever team building happened on the island. The first movie was them realizing they need each other and can function as a family. The second movie completely undoes that. 

Even though the first one had some heavy issues it was an uplifting movie overall. The Incredibles 2 was a downer the entire way through with an obvious twist that had so much foreshadowing it was like a joke. 

It's too bad. They created such a fun world with the first and just wasted the potential with this. &&now that's a legendary run.&&>Same thing with A Wrinkle In Time

I was gonna say, it must've taken a while to hit a nice round $0 profit.&&In that case, it had to do with getting certain TV rights. 100 million gives incentives in some way.&&I went to see BP at least 5-6 weeks after it hit theaters and the theater was freaking packed by the time the movie started.

Same with Ant Man and the Wasp ... it was at least 4-5 weeks out and the theater was filled.  

I'm not surprised theaters are keeping them for so long if it's still filling seats.&&Any ideas what they are going to do with that mall?&&They likely lose a bit of money by upping the theater counts at the end of a run, for the sake of pushing up the recorded box office. They did it so Winkle in Time could go 100m, Black Panther 700m, and now Incredibles to 600m. Probably several other recent examples as well. If it were just milking their products for profit, they would close down movies earlier or keep a low count and let them fizzle naturally. This move is about boosting the image of their products while displaying dominance in the market. &&Tfw a less subtle version of my joke is upvoted more :/&&Thats a funny way to say Atlantis: The Lost Empire.&&It is tho&&Also Atlantis &&Might not be the best, but it's definitely my favorite&&I tried watching Treasure Planet recently and was really looking forward to the experience, but was quite disappointed. Maybe I should have gone in with low expectations. &&I thought that was Lion King?&&People at Dreamworks in the early 90’s were working on two films at the time: The Prince of Egypt, and Shrek. People who couldn’t keep up on Prince of Egypt (the “highbrow flick”) or for whatever reason, were cast out and sent to work on Shrek.

In comparison, Pocahontas and The Lion King at Disney were being made at the same time (or close enough), by two separate teams. &&I thought it got made because all of their other attempts to get the story working failed so they said, “fuck it, let’s go nuts.”&&There is a good article on the history of the movie here:

https://www.laughingplace.com/w/leg/?legacyasppage=news-id115140.asp

&&The only disappointing aspect of that is the exclusion of Yzma's [villain song](https://youtu.be/374xW4zZbZA)&&Fuck yo couch&&Actually I think it's simpler than that.  They've kept the characters and stories pretty true to the comic books.  For an example of how it fails when you try to ignore the source material see Man of Steel or Batman v Superman.&&*Spoiler Alert* 

Yup. I’m still super looking forward to see the next avengers movie. Especially since ant-mant ending. I went to ant mant, fully expected something like that after credit but for some reason, it still got me supper emotional and excited as to what will happen next.&&That's interesting. Age of Ultron should've been Iron Man 3 since it was so Stark centric. That would've been great.

Civil War becomes Avengers 2.  Then Cap can take on the Mandarin in Cap 3.&&What a weird repainting of history.  Thor 2 outperformed the original vastly.  Iron man 3 was the highest grossing solo superhero movie until black panther (and didn’t feature characters from crossovers like that one).  Cap 2 did way better than the original.  Gotg was a marvel movie and people saw it as a superhero film.  And many were excited to see something different with ant man and strange going into magic and wired superheroes&&I don't know enough about how movies are made to be sure about this, but I think that removing Perlmutter from Marvel Studios seems to have made the difference; Age of Ultron was in 2015, the same year that Feige took over complete control. Superhero fatigue really could have happened if Disney hadn't made the switch, I think; I hope history doesn't repeat itself with the whole GotG 3 drama, they should just trust Feige to have complete control for as long as he wants to make the movies, they'll keep being good and they'll keep making money.&&Certainly, but they've never dominated the forefront of the blockbuster movie scene like they do now before. The American audience is not generally a universal ""we,"" and ""we"" have not always loved superhero media. Superhero fans, of which there are plenty, have always loved superhero media. Only now are we forming the idea of the American audience being a ""we"" that loves superheros across the board, because that's what's happened. Superhero media is no longer something that sells to superhero fans, it's something that sells to near *everyone*. 

That will not last *forever*, although it won't go away as soon as Cameron thinks and it certainly won't set in as soon as Avatar fatigue most likely will once the sequels get underway. But at some point, like every genre of film that comes to dominate at any point in film history, it *will* fade away from being the face of blockbusters. Superhero fans will still love superhero media, and that won't go away. But cultural consciousness is never permanent in its forefront obsessions.

Also, I'm sure there are plenty of people who have currently grown tired of superhero movies, they're just in the minority. &&Usually when people talk fatigue they mean ""how often will people come out to watch,"" so even if a certain genre of film remains successful it doesn't mean people are interested in watching it annually. One example is gangster movies. Some of the highest rated movies of all time are gangster movies, but people can get fatigued on them real quick and stop watching.&&No, it was always more of a fringe thing.

They didn't have a cohesive story for this trilogy, they didn't give their directors a unified vision, and they didn't follow in the MCU's footsteps of giving the fans exactly what they want to see, with some really good surprises, while basing their story off established media.

The MCU picked the best things from the comics and made amazing movies. Star Wars should have picked the best parts of the EU, games, Clone Wars, etc. and used those in the movies, just like Marvel down the hall. Infact, outside of he Saga films, Star Wars is doing particularly well with just that. Thrawn is a fantastic example of a EU character used in the new Canon. And the Anthology films are doing it to a smaller degree as well.&&You misread my comment, Disney appears to be taking a hands off approach, which is to blame for the lack of direction in the sequels.&&How did it take me this long to see a pun between ""firing"" and ""Gunn"".&&I thank the cinema gods a little everyday for what A24 is accomplishing&&Life is about growth.

But the first point is very valid. 5-12 years old in 1994-95 means 29-37 next year.

It is a very good film, and one of the best from that era of Disney, but it's not The Lion King or Moana. It's not a cinematic masterpiece. It's just a very good family film that was received *so* poorly that people feel the need to defend it.

I love it. My kids love it. But it's nobody's favourite.&&The Lion King was Disney's B-team. The A-team was focused on Pocahontas haha.&&I read that about Shrek lol. but that's DreamWorks so Idk. &&No, shrek&&Prince of Egypt was better tho^^^pleasedontkillmeIlikethemusic&&**DARKNESS EVERYBODY, DARKNESS**&&Actually, I think some of Marvel's most ingenious moves has been in deviating from the comic books (e.g. changing Thanos to have a better motivation than love for death, or changing Hela's backstory to be a daughter and partner of Odin with the goal of bringing Asgard back to its former ""glory"").

Also, some of the issues I've heard with Batman v Superman come not so much from them not adapting the batman from the comicbooks but only adapting the batman from the comic books that are most critically acclaimed (e.g. Batman Year 1, The Dark Knight Returns, and the Killing Joke).  If you only looked at the most critically acclaimed batman comics and based your adaption on them you'd get a very dark and very violent batman, which is precisely the skewed interpretation they went for.

Finally, some things always have to change and the source material isn't always infalliable.  For example, can you imagine the uprising if they'd adapted Batman v Superman directly from ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and kept in characters like Carrie Kelley/Robin, while not including Wonder Woman who was the best part of the film.&&I'd guess it's more of the execution than the source material....Suicide Squad was pretty close to its source; I think it took most of its stuff from Assault on Arkam animated movie. BvS has got the Frank Miller look to it, but it couldn't tell the story that it was supposed to be in the comic books. 

DC's cinematic heroes can't seem to turn their powers off it seems. It's as if their power defines them, and they are useless without. MCU seems to have gone another direction; Most of the characters are relate-able; you understand Cap's desire to help everyone, Stark's feeling of shame for what he has done with all the weapons, Thor's (eventual) realization of him being a protector, Quill's just a kid that lost his parents and stuck with a bunch of thieves, and Peter Parker is just a kid that really wants to help make his neighbourhood a better place. These are all qualities that make them human.

Nolan's Batman made it look real because Nolan gave us the time to understand Bruce's struggle and the conviction to become the dark knight, BvS just throws you in the middle of the conflict and no real build up those those character. If you tell me BvS is the culmination of Man of Steel and the Dark knight series, then BvS is bullshit in that regards; it's not bad, but it has no coherent context. It's like watching any of Avenger movies without seeing any of the other preceding MCU films.

Sorry for the long post...

TL;DR: MCU characters are more human, DC's films don't live up to the depth of character the comics portrayed. &&I don’t really think that’s entirely it though, it helps I’m sure, but a lot of people don’t know anything about the comic books yet still love the movies. &&Good points. Yeah, I guess I'd do something like this if I could restructure it all:

* Erase Iron-Man 2 altogether, it adds almost nothing, it was just filler leading up to Avengers 1.
* Iron-Man 3 now becomes Iron-Man 2, and ends with the implication that he's going to stop being Iron-Man altogether.
* Age of Ultron becomes Iron-Man 3. Creating Ultron is a natural extension of his starting to play with unmanned drone suits in IM3 (which is now IM2). It also forces him to return to being Iron-Man, creating a better arc for him overall. 
* Civil War is now officially Avengers 2.&&It'll take something like gratuitous parody/deconstruction for superheroes to fall out of vogue, like what post-westerns and spaghetti westerns did to the dominance of the western during the mid 1900s.&&Superhero comics were among the most widespread children's media in the country in the 1950s and 1960s; children's TV didn't yet have dedicated channels, and video games didn't yet exist. Comics were selling hundreds of thousands (in some cases millions) of issues per month, we're talking like 10x as many comics as what sell today. Superhero comics were mainstream entertainment until the crash in the 90's, which also overlapped with the massive rise of video games and cable TV.

Talk to just about anyone over the age of like... 50 or so and I can all but guarantee you that they or their siblings bought and read comics as children.&&This sums it up pretty well. There was different content they could have taken and expanded on that fans would’ve loved to see. But just picking a whole new trilogy wasn’t the whole problem with it, as people were generally excited for that anyway. Like you said, the problem is the two new sequels have their moments, but it’s been confusing as to where the trilogy’s plot and characters are really going.  As opposed to the MCU, where they had a basic frame for where everything was gonna lead and flow together from the start.&&#her perfect posterior&&To be fair they straight up have said they wanted a completely different Genie for the movie, because they realize no one will be able to compete with Robin Williams.

It never really made sense in the animated version in the first place.&&A lot of millennials may have even skipped seeing it in theaters because they couldn't find the time or (like me) are waiting until they can watch it from their couch. 

Kids, on the other hand, are a lot more impatient (and excited!) so their parents will make sure they get to see frozen 2 in theaters. I have no doubt frozen 2 could top the 600 million.&&[deleted]&&It should be 4 hours and every MCU film forwards should be built on it.&&Exactly. Between merchandise, TV shows and cartoons, comic books (ironically the least profitable among all of these) and, of course, the gigantic, monumental success of the MCU, aka the most profitable movie franchise in history, Marvel has outclassed both Pixar and (Disney-owned) Lucasfilm in every way. &&They aren't complaining about the stakes; they're complaining that it wasn't exciting to watch. Those aren't at all the same thing.  


I disagree with them, very much, but they aren't objectively wrong.&&It is when you think about it, but visually a boat heading in the general direction of a city isn't a threatening image.&&Be it fans or brand management firms you can be sure that you are unable to give a level headed critique and have it anywhere near the top of a Disney movie in initial discussions on /r/movies


However a single line from the film or generic platitude about it being good. well strap yourself in bucko you're getting showered in upvotes. &&Every movie has flaws. It's been on Bluray for a while now. People have re-watched the shit out of it and still love it.&&Fucking hated it&&The last couple years have merely reinforced my point that young people supporting something won’t lead to old people quickly changing their minds.&&I loved the first 2 acts and felt the movie had so much momentum that just fizzled out when it reached the third act. 

All the pieces are there for a great finale but it doesn't really do a lot with any of them. Like it's such a step down from a giant fucking robot terrorising the city. Like yeah, that boat would have done some damage but not like a giant fucking robot could potentially. Furthermore, the Omnidroid is set up as a climax from the second act of the film where the boat is just kinda thrown in. 

I get it's meant to focus upon the dynamic of the supers as a team but that was also achieved in fighting the Omnidroid and then once again with Syndrome. Plus, Evelyn just goes out like a punk, barely a fight there. Call me morbid but I would like to see a Disney/Pixar villain die again. Once again, it's meant to show that Helen doesn't want to murder anyone but most Disney villains die of their own hubris anyway. I guess it means she could come back for a future instalment which would service her character (similar to Solomon Lane in Mission: Impossible) but I think it's part of the reason Incredibles 2 lacks the maturity of the first.

I still really like the movie but pretty much all.my issues stem with the final act. &&Maybe they forgot about it and accidentally made $100m?&&And Forrest Gump was called “a bomb”
by the studio in order to screw over the author Winston Groom ( who was supposed to get a cut of the gross) .

Counterpoint: My burd
&&Big problem with erasing Iron-Man 2 is that without it, there isn't nearly as much connection between Tony and Howard that goes into Civil War. I know a lot of people seem to remember Whiplash, but it seems absolutely nobody remembers the plot point of Howard literally saving Tony's life.&&IM2 introduced war machine though&&Watchmen just came out a few year too soon. Still great though.&&The thing is that the current wave of big superhero movies *is* to some extent a deconstruction of the less successful previous wave. It doesn't help that they are a product of a generation where irony and deconstructions are themselves in vogue. 

The mcu deconstructs by being more self aware, leaning into goofyness and campyness in a tongue and cheek way, subverting tropes and letting it just be fun in opposition to the way that movies like the raimi spiderman movies or the X-men movies never did. Those movies always held on to a kernel of seriousness a bit too tightly, while still having goofy outfits and plots in a way that came off as campy to general audiences.  

One of the big signature moves of the MCU is that *everything* is funny, to the point that it has become a criticism. Examples are [The dance off in guardians, the gag with thor spinning around during the exposition speech in the beginning of ragnarok, 'puny god' in the first avengers movie, etc.](#spoiler) this kind of funniness keeps it from feeling as campy as early superhero movies did, but also prevents the movies from being able to really dig into emotions or anything serious for too long because they are scared that it will turn people off.

The successful DC movies (mostly just the nolan batman movies) succeed by being a deconstruction in the opposite direction, removing as much campiness as possible and telling a story about superheros while using as few genre conventions as possible, no colorful outfits, no fun at all. trying to sell superheros to people who are too cynical for them.


Both extremes exist as a way for creators to point out that they are aware of the cynicism that general audiences have for traditional superhero media, and as an attempt to distance themselves from convention either by mocking it with goofy self-awareness or by shunning it altogether.

I think the real deconstruction to come is when someone can do a straight up superhero movie, without every scene being a goofy self-aware quip afraid to engage in real emotions, and without being a ***GRITTY***^TM genre filp, but facing the cynicism straight on, and actually making a solid film that stands up to it. I think something like a more faithful watchman reboot could potentially fill that role, but so could plenty of other things. &&Fucking Elvis dressed up as Shazam Jr&&I beg your pardon? &&Instead of a manic Genie I'm just picturing a ""HAH HA.

It's difficult to see the speed and really get a sense of momentum until we have some other reference at the very end.

To me the interesting thing is that we don't seem to be very interested in origin stories anymore.  Instead of the whole ""protect your secret identity and hide who you are"", we have transitioned into stories about how these characters interact with each other as heroes.

(((( MEGA EDIT ))))

 Well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour.  A few comments.

a) I don't hate Netflix in general.  People saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous.  I even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great.  I just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least).

b) I think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that I don't.  None of your suggestions work for me, or seem available.  Probably depends how you're watching Netflix.  I'm using a Sony smart TV.  Maybe I truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist.  But I don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure.

c) I'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"".  Uh, what?  I'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared.  If we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it.

d) As for the ""don't get so excited"" posts.  Well, firstly, alcohol.  Secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response.  I dunno, I thought it was funny.  Certainly didn't think anyone would care about it.  What's really interesting is how pissed off people get that I even posted it in the first place.  Oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd Marvel sequel here).

e) Some of you don't sit through the credits.  That's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do.  

f) If you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad.

g) Weirdly, the thing that set me off was *Blue Thunder*.  I loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when I got the end I'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then I get there and BOOM it's like NO MUSIC ONLY TRAILER.  And it made me thought of other times when I wanted to just relax and think about what I'd seen, and popped.  Er, half-popped.  ","I just wish the My List and Continue Watching sections actually appeared consistently. They go AWOL all the time, lost in the myriad weirdly specific genres Netflix has decided to make up that day.&&People missed out on the end-credits scene in Disenchantment because of that.

Netflix-only show, Netflix skips the scene.&&Let's go into recently added.

""Bojack Horseman season 4."" 

Netflix, I already watched this. Also, I did that, like, a fucking year ago. It's a great show, but it's not recently added. Jesus. &&Netflix need more settings for their users, like this and random episode. I hope that will happen with the other streaming services becoming competition for them.&&They should really just have a ""Skip Credits"" button like the ""Skip Intro"" button, rather than doing it by default.&&They have a bunch of new features that are pissing me off, and a few things they removed that really made me mad.

I've always hated the new rating system and the fact that they removed user reviews. The new browser layout makes it unbearable to browse in peace; I have to be mindful of where my cursor is which is bullshit. I am on mobile 99% of the time and I am enraged that they removed descriptions of titles. I want to meet the idiot who thought that was a good idea. It makes me less likely to watch something new. Also, why can I no longer see how far I am into whatever I am watching? If I want to stop at 20 minutes in, I have no way of knowing. Audible implemented that same thing and I fucking **hate it!!**&&Also fuck off with the spoiler fullscreenshots from the middle of the episode I'm trying to watch.

The last episode ended with a character being shot and me not knowing if he's dead or alive. Start next episode and the loading picture is him standing with a fucking arm sling. Fuck you Netflix.&&I agree, but from a different point of view. I work in animation usually the credits for the actual animators are near the very end of a credit scroll.  I was trying to flex my dick for my GF showing her something on Netflix I worked on, just when my name is coming up netflix cock-blocks me by shrinking the credit scroll to a minature fucking box up in the top right corner, reducing my name and self worth in that moment to maybe 3 pixels. I swear to god in the  silence If you listened really hard you could hear the universe whisper ""No one fucking cares about your credit.....""&&I hate fucking hate at the end of a TV series how it give you like a 5 second countdown and you have to scramble for the remote and try to hit the right button combo under the deadline when I just want to sit back and meditate on the show and listen to the credits music for like one single fucking minute.

EDIT: folks, I'm saying when this happens at the end of a *series*.  Like you just watched the last episode of the whole damn show.&&It's worse for TV. BoJack Horseman has an original Grouplove song that perfectly encapsulates the series that plays during the credits, but sometimes there's an entirely different song designed to set the mood. After an episode I usually need time to absorb what just happened. I don't need the next episode to start in 5 seconds. Jesus fucking Christ Netflix.&&On an unrelated note, I hate how shows in different countries have different subtitle languages available.

As a non-native English speaker expat living in Germany who doesn't speak the language that well yet, I really don't want to watch Peaky Blinders with German subtitles thank you. And there are NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES available, although if I were to watch in a different country, they would. The whole content licensing system that we've come to adopt is simply terrible for consumers.

So the most idiotic thing ends up happening - I have to go on dodgy Russian websites to view the series that's available on the platform I PAY FOR, just because they simply provide better service with correct subtitles. Fuck.&&Netflix needs a full 100 point restoration. This shit is out of control. Playing trailers during the credits or when lingering too long on a title, the disappearing queue and continue watching catagories, the insane suggestions because I watched this one thing, the repeat titles across multiple catagories, the handful of good original content amongst a plethora of mediocrity, and the sparse selection of licensed films and shows that I'd actually want to watch (which, coincidentally, DON'T show up in my ""because you watched this one thing"" catagories)...if I actually paid for Netflix I'd be pissed, but since I just use my brothers', I'll settle for being mildly malcontent.&&Netflix gives zero shits about the cinematic experience, art or quality. They just want you to shove more at your face and keep paying them.&&

&&Yes, I hate it when they scale down the credits to show a poster for a ""recommended"" serie or movie. I also like to think about the movie during the credits. And since I'm somewhat in the CG field myself I'm sometimes interested in how big the CG teams are.

Other things that need improvements:

- Thumbnails scaling. Please let us have a list to scale down thumbnails or even add a ""title"" only view list. It's sometimes so hard to get a nice overview of all the available titles.
- Grey out thumbnails from movies/series that I already have watched.
- Be consistent with the way you show lists. The lists flip around all the time.
- Don't make Sci-Fi and Fantasy as one category. Because of this 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Aliens' are in the same list. It doesn't make sense.
- Let us have more favorite organisation tools. Let us create our own playlists. (I want to create lists like ""comedy"", and put all the comedy movies in there that I want to watch later). Something like Spotify does... but with movies.
- Show a list that tells us what titles will be removed soon.
- We need an ""average"" button between thumbs up and thumbs down. Some movies I don't think are worth a thumbs up, but a thumbs down is also not fair.
- Please read Reddit and customer feedback. So I don't waste my time typing this message.

Yay other people like to do this! Reflection is important to me, even in cinemas I'll stay through the credits most of the time and try to block out the noisy staggered departure of the other patrons. I'm always wondering if the employees waiting to clean hate me or love me for wasting a little more of their time on the clock :P&&You CAN still watch the credits. Press the up arrow, then enter, to pick the little inset where the credits are still playing.  They will come back to full screen.&&I feel like it's super disrespectful to all the people involved in the making of the film too&&can't you just click the little box that keeps showing the credits?  
i always thought you could click that and it would bring you back to the credits.&&In the settings you can turn off autoplay. As a result the ad won't play until the movie or tv show or whatever is completely finished. &&Go to Account > Playback Settings, then uncheck ""Auto-Play"" 

&&I was actually thinking about this the other day. I was watching this new Netflix makeover show and I absolutely loved the music and sound mixing. I really wanted to know who these people were, but unfortunately kept getting cut off by these trailers :/&&I hate when it starts playing that preview thing of a show automatically when you’re browsing.&&I personally don't care about the credits and would probably just skip them anyway but they could at least give people the option to watch it.&&I lost my shit when this happened after watching Coco. An absolutely amazing movie with a wonderful score and I was excited to see what they played for the credits. A few seconds in I was torn from my post cinematic bliss and thrust into a fucking stupid ass Insatiable trailer. At least give me the option to not see trailers for your terrible content Netflix. &&Thank you!! Easily my biggest gripe with Netflix! I had to buy the blu-rays of Breaking Bad because I was so tired of Netflix ruining the post episode come down. Especially after the last episode, but several others too. Going from that scene with Walt and Jane to a trailer for a show I'm never going to watch anyway completely took me out of the moment.&&Yup. 2 years ago I decided to call and complain and the girl seemed shocked that I didn't want 

1. The credits cut off.
2. The opening theme song skipped. 
3. The next episode to auto-play.

She could only help me with #3. But eventually, with price increases and a less than pleasant experience for serious movie lovers, I just cancelled my account. 

I like opening theme songs. I want it every time. I like ending credits. Nothing better than sitting there, contemplating the movie while the music plays.

I'm sure all of this is market tested so most must be okay with it. I took an informal poll with friends and coworkers, all either didn't care or hadn't noticed. But I know what I like so I cancelled my account about 1 year ago. I don't miss it. &&If I see Ali Wong's face advertised to me again one more time I'm cancelling for a month just to take a break from it.

Not sure if it is on the app versions, but then you can just click anywhere and it will keep the credits rolling.&&Did Netflix hire Comcast's old designers and* developers? The shit UI, a rating system that could only be loved by cowards, the rigged search algorithm that always shows the same 30 or 40 titles for each category you're forced to scour the internet for those fucking search secrets that you always forget when you need them.

Without this feature I'd never figure out how to play videos on this thing!"" -- literally no people&&Oh THIS so much!   I work in the industry and enjoy watching credits till the very last one rolls by. Every movie I watcha few seconds, then it gets small in the corner and the countdown starts that they are going to play something IDGAF about.

Grab the control, navigate to the credit window, click it, try to rewind a bit, it rewinds back into the movie, I fast forward, the movie ends, credits roll, AND IT GOES TINY UP IN THW CORNER AGAIN!!!!!! AAAAAARRGHHHHHHH.

I hate all of netflix's autoplay the next thing crap.&&As someone going into the industry It's not just the music, those people worked damn hard on that movie and need some appreciation!&&People are getting mad at you but actually it is an annoying experience that epitomizes recent problems with netflix as an experience.&&They're turning into cable TV, quite quickly. You know how, after a movie finishes on cable, and it goes to the credits and then minimizes them to the bottom of the screen and immediately starts playing something to catch your attention?

  


It's all an effort to keep you watching as long as possible, to grab your attention quickly before you lose interest from the credits.

  


Oh, and now the whole ""ads"" thing too.&&And please give me an option to turn off the skip intro button, i like intros and that button is annoying to see.&&You know you can just hit “Back” on the screen and it will take you back to the credits........&&Agreed so much, I worked at a movie theater for 6 years so I heard of lot of end credit scores or songs and enjoy those minutes to reflect on the movie.
Netflix doing this just pisses me off, along with their shrinking selection of movies from the 80s-00s compared to 7 years ago.&&I sometimes have to reload the movie and scroll back to the credits.

It's just disrespectful, honestly.&&It's ridiculous they don't have that option.&&I just finished watching Gran Torino and needed a moment to process everything that happened in the last 20 minutes of the film.
So naturally an advertisement for the Bert Kreischer special immediately popped up to spoil the reflection/mood.&&while there at it, they need to sit down and think long and hard about their UI. Holy shit is that thing unusable.

And just when I'm ready to see my name in the credits. BLAM trailer for Orange is the New Black. FML.&&Not only that but coming from someone who works in TV/Film it’s taking away from the people who worked tirelessly to bring that content to your screens. It’s disrespectful. &&This BS with the ads for their own shows between episodes.

No. Can't say I do.&&I’d love an option to not skip opening and closing credits. Without them it feels like a bookshelf with no bookends to neatly tie it all together. 

I also think it’s quite ignorant to think that no one wants to watch the credits, and honestly a bit insulting not to show credits to the people that made the content they’re streaming.&&I used to be able to press Back on my remote to stop the autoplaying bollocks.

I also wish they'd make little curated groups like ""Halloween episodes"" and just pile all the Halloween episodes from The office, Parks and rec, That 70s show, etc into one group. 

I'm never going to look up which episode is the Halloween one, click the season, then find the episode and hit play. But I'd binge watch an entire list of them. I'd probably even watch shows I don't normally watch. &&> [insert application] needs more settings for their users

FTFY

Unfortunately, it's moving backwards. As someone who's been on pc's since DOS 5, my biggest complaint is how watered down and option-less EVERYthing has become.

Unfortunately it's the way things are going, as companies realize that it's a LOT easier to support much fewer options with relatively little push back from the majority of customers.

Some days I like to blame Google and Apple for it, some days I just bitch generally about mobile-first development.

What Netflix or ANY of these companies needs to do is create a robust API that they can license out to people. I'd happily pay $30+ a year or $70 lifetime  for a 3rd party app that does all the things the ""power users"" (and I use that term loosely) wants them to do.

Of course that won't happen either. As so many people have pointed out, it would make it too easy to compare content across services and not have it push their own content and ads onto the users.

But, I can dream.

edit: also, I can understand this to some extent, too - having an app that has to be supported on 50 different platforms isn't easy; you can't just port things over in many cases and have to rewrite the code from scratch. It's why a 3rd party guide option would make this sooo much more efficient.&&Playlists in general would be great. Including randomization, I’ve always wanted to simulate a block of tv by playing a random (or the next) episode of a few diffrent series in a row. &&Also, ""reset viewing status"" on a given show/movie would be nice and ""always skip intro"" would be a godsend.&&I want the ability to playlist my shows and see the episodes in order but with which show im watching on shuffle. I like binge watching but not the same show over and over.&&Toggle auto play preview would be nice. &&Just being able to add individual episodes to a playlist would be huge and is way overdue.&&I just wish we could see EVERYTHING that’s available on Netflix in a list from A-Z. The search function is shitty. I hate scrolling through the same 15 movies over and over. &&[deleted]&&Mine skips the intro and I can't figure out how to stop it.&&I get a ""keep watching credits"" button on my iPad.&&Speaking of the ""Skip Intro"" button, there needs to be a setting to disable it. If I'm bingeing, say, *Stranger Things*, I want to watch the intro every time, and the bright little button brings me out of the experience.&&I have an older smart TV at home that doesn’t let us update Netflix anymore. Because of that none of these changes came through and I spent the last decade in the same bliss that it started with when Netflix started allowing smart tv apps. 

Then we used our inlaws. Then I understood the seething rage. &&I don't even open Netflix any more to browse as it's just painful to deal with all the ""trailers"" while looking for something to watch. I used to spend all sorts of time browsing through their titles, now I never open the app. I've probably watched more Amazon video and Hulu this past year than Netflix.&&agreed with all of your points. especially about the rating system. The first biggest change, from 10 stars to 5, was so that good movies would seem better and bad movies would look less bad, and then they axed user reviews on top of it so that you can really never know the true quality of a film now. As if they are trying to trick you into watching bad films because their library size keeps shrinking, thus leaving you with less options.   


They intentionally make it hard to browse their store so that you can't tell how small their library actually is. And they make finding your my list and continue watching playlist hard to find now so that you are forced to dig through their ads and new release section first. I have really grown to hate netflix and I used to fanboy them hardcore.&&The thumbs up and down are so stupid. To paraphrase Bill Burr:

>I really hope they don’t change to that thumbs up, thumbs down system. Not everything is equally thumbs up or down. Think about it. Stubbing your toe? Thumbs down. Hitler? Thumbs down. There’s a big difference between stubbing your toe and Hitler.&&A lot of those changes were implemented right around the time they lost a bunch of licensed content. They knew that if your whole front page was 20% rated euro-twilight clones and ""transmorphers"".  They fucking suck. There is no justifiable reason to change the ratings, and the fact that they wrapped it in the insulting lie that they were only giving us what we wanted... Fuck Netflix.&&This stuff basically exists because people have to justify the existence of their jobs at Netflix. This UI/UX stuff is just needless tinkering that they will undoubtedly reformulate. Just moving the stack of papers to one side of the room and back again.&&I absolutely hate that they removed descriptions. I learned the other day that you can turn them back on though. Go to Account --> Test Participation --> switch it off and descriptions come back.&&You can't see how far you are into what you're watching? I still can...&&This, I hate this. Why can’t they just leave a thumbnail of the movie poster or something.&&I care about your credit. That's pretty cool.&&What series/movie is it?&&I worked on Annihilation and tried to pull the exact same move. I feel ya.&&You could just click on the little box and it turns big again.&&Like when Bart worked on the Krusty Show&&Worse is when they show you a clip from the next episode. You try not to see it, but you spot some character or location, or they pick just the right soundbite to spoil all the important details.&&What sucks is some shows aren't actually over when it decides to start counting you down to the next episode. &&You can go into your account settings and turn that off.  Can't do it through the app, you can do it through their website.&&I mean, I like the feature, but 5 seconds is too short, specially bad for people like me who uses the PS4 controller as a remote, so first I have to turn it on, and then do what you mentioned, so pretty much impossible to do it in time.&&You know that you can deactivate the ""auto skip to next episode/movie"".. right? Did this since the day I subscribed to Netflix...&&Turn off Autoplay then. It's even worse on Hulu.&&BACK IN THE 90S I WAS IN A VERY FAMOUS TV SHOW&&Glad you mentioned BoJack! In general, I'm happy credits are automatically skipped and I can binge. BUT, BoJack is an exception! I always looked forward to that ending music, but it would always cut at the best part.&&Turn that setting off then.&&My biggest gripe specifically to them doing this to Bojack is it killing the joke in season 3 when his one night stand asks if he’s more horse than man, or more man than horse. If you’ve never listened to the end credits the joke feels like a weak play on his name, rather than a reference to the end credits song that always plays.

It also ruins anytime they use different music in the end credits. &&Yeah, there are a lot of shows that I've had the same issue with, namely Californication and Ash vs. Evil Dead. Both shows tend to use nostalgic but relevant music at the end of each episode to help digest what happened/amp you up for the next episode, but Netflix always cuts it off.&&Oh, that's really annoying. I am a native English speaker, but I have auditory issues that make parsing dialogue hard for me at times, and on that show especially the accents are sometimes hard to pick up as well. I have English subtitles on by default on everything I watch. &&It doesn't really make a whole bunch of sense to me.  Me watching another show doesn't make Netflix any more money, I've already paid for my subscription.

Wouldn't customer experience be more important than pushing as much content as possible?

Edit: not saying I know better. Just have never been able to understand why they prioritise customer experience so low compared to their marketing tactics. &&The worst thing they did was remove the community rating system and replace it with “matches”. Fuck you, Netflix. Let me see what everyone thinks of this before investing time in watching it.&&[deleted]&&Sounds like binging&&In general, I think the majority of people are happy with skipping the credits for the majority of shows and movies.  I am very happy with skipping credits and I also like it when the next episode in a series starts automatically.  If I want to watch the credits for some particular reason, that is a rare thing, and I'm okay with having to hit a back button to get the credits to come back.  I think you are being way to dramatic.  &&As if there is another worthwhile service we can turn to opposed to netflix. Makes no sense &&That is something I noticed. The quality on some shows/films is  terrible, even tho I have the full hd subscription. I tried to watch Edge of Tomorrow the other week and the resolution looked worse than 720p. Googled all the tips to try and improve it but nothing worked.&&Yeah, why was this removed?  If a subreddit's users are upvoting content that is not illegal, just leave it.&&Did something happen to my post?&&Exactly. Sometimes the credits are as much about decompressing as they are respecting the crew that made that necessary &&Some shows only give you literally five seconds to take this action once the credits start rolling. If you just finished something heavy, it can ruin the mood.&&am a people involved in making movies, can confirm this is super disrespectful. I totally understand if you don't have time or interest to watch end credits (in theaters, at home, wherever) I get it, until I started doing this, I didn't watch them either. BUT when the very platform that is showing them - and in Netflix's case, often producing them - does this by default it's really frustrating&&I just wish autoplay meant it would never play the preview at all. :/&&OH THANK YOU! IT'S A LOT EASIER NOW!&&The ending is still forced into a tiny corner in the Web player.&&I mostly watch on my TV, and there are no settings for anything.

The auto trailers really make looking for new content unpleasant. I'm constantly moving the cursor to avoid a new trailer starting.

I have complained twice, but I don't think they listen.

I don't care if they want to add these features. Just give me a setting to disable it.&&It depends which platform you are on.  It may be an easy one click to go back to see the credits  on your platform, but on others it may require 2 or three clicks, or even restarting from the beginning and fast forwarding .    Which is fucking ridiculous, since Netflix could make it easy to toggle this setting.&&as an anime fan, the intro and outro are too long. i always skip them&&Because you watched “friends”&&Gritty Dramas Featuring Female Leads With Scoliosis Who Bake Their Own Bread And Drive A Nissan Sentra&&And somehow there's like 10 shows...&&TONIGHT ON CAKE BWOSS&&\*Scroll down 1 category\*

The only way to get them to go away is to delete all evidence that I ever watched them, but I don't really want to do that.&&I miss the button that was like ""not interested"" from the dvd days.&&This.  It's so fucking annoying.  You typically have to watch a show all the way to the end of the credits for it to leave your ""Continue Watching"" list.  I have so many shows stuck on there with like 30 seconds left.

Same with shows that you started, hated, and no longer have any interest in watching.  They stay on your continue watching list forever, even if you rate them thumbs down.  I know you can technically just open them and skip to the end to get rid of them or open your history under settings and remove them that way, but that's a hassle.&&You can always remove them from your viewing history.

The movie ends and cuts to the credits and a preview started playing for some awful looking comedy movie. It totally wrecked the end of the movie. Where most normal viewers would want some time to reflect on the movie and gather their thoughts, Netflix decides to play an awful trailer.&&My favorite is when it's something like ""Because you watched Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and they recommend stuff like Divergent and Spy.&&Ngl I would watch that 100%. It's just Midsomer Murders only instead of Midsomer it's just the same ice rink. Every 4 years they have a Winter Olympics special. It's just like 20 episodes of Patricia and Irene, two Winter Olympians from Nova Scotia who fell in love after drawing a Curling game in the Nova Scotia Curling Invitational of 1979.

 Donald Sutherland will play the role of Patricia's dad, who's also head of the Nova Scotia Police Department.

 Theme will be Gino Vannelli covering Foreigner's Cold As Ice. The series starts in 1983 and it goes on from there. Stana Katic and Wendy off Red Velvet play Patricia and Irene respectively. 

Again we're going the Midsomer Murders route so there's no fornicating but they do share toast and like give each other a peck in the cheeks from time to time. Like they're characters who just so happen to be lesbians and not two characters who's only defining characteristic is that they're gay.

 Nathan Fillion and Ryan Reynolds can play Irene's Father and Uncle.

I've never been to Nova Scotia so it's not going to be stereotypically Nova Scotian. It's just going to be filmed there and stuff.

Midway through the first season Irene and Patricia both get their arms broken by the main villain so this puts their curling career in like dire straits.&&Ah. I love Parks and Rec.  &&How To Make a  Manic Pixie Dream Murderer&&So did you have a particular CW show in mind?&&Samsung lost my money once they decided they'd put irremovable ads on their TVs home page.

For episode without post credit scene, Netflix has that ""countdown for next episode"", but for episode with post credit scene, Netflix plays that countdown **after** the post credit scene.&&Netflix (or mainstream streaming services, really) and anime is another thing...

I’m living in Germany (and have my whole life) but couldn’t care less for German subs or, god bless, the godawful dubs.

Yet I am forced to wait until everything you could possibly dub/sub into anything is done before they actually bother to release it. I know Violet had simulcast(ish?) going, yet Fate Apocrypha released her when the second season was already airing in Japan!

All I want is the orignal voices with English subs, probably the easiest and fastest way to bring these shows to the west, but they are holding back to go the extra, extra mile because some people might look at it and see “oh that’s not in my language” and skip it for good.

*MAKE A DISCLAIMER THEN FUCKING HELL*

I hope Netflix are adopting simulcast more, Amazon apparently haven’t heard of it and have even bigger issues with their licensing going on. Is Made in Abyss legally watchable ourside of the US yet? Last thing I hard that even Canada didn’t get if because the anime channel Amazon prodives (the specific one that has the shows people want) is US exclusive for some reason.&&Right!? The song is always like ""no one ever watches the credits"" but I WANT to, you keep skipping it on me! &&Yeah, that shows credits countdown felt even shorter than any other one. It was always a mad dash to the remote to try to get it to keep playing the credits each time. 

That being said: RIP that show. So pissed they canceled it recently. &&Just for the final episode&&I had no idea Venture Bros did that until I accidentally watched one sometime in season 3. And it's important stuff sometimes!&&Its a bit of foreshadowing.&&Yeah, I didn't know R&M had post credit scenes because I watched it on netflix ಠ_ಠ&&Any device that's slightly laggy is hell with netflix's autoplay.&&Yes oh my fucking GOD is the autoplay irritating.

Our new one has the new, horrible, 4/5 of the screen taken up with previews. Makes me crazy. GIVE ME MY SCREEN BACK!!!&&Netflix relies on data from its users on which previews they click. The reason autoplay previews and moving categories around happens is because user data is showing that it works. People are clicking on these annoying autoplay videos. Netflix is on the record they are not interested in user feedback, only the algorithm  matters. Netflix is steering users to their original programming and hiding that a huge percentage of their non original programming is now gone. &&This. It gives me anxiety when I’m browsing because I don’t want to linger on a title for too long and have a preview pop up. I have to mute it until I find something to watch. &&Yes. It is so fucking annoying. Have to constantly move so the goddamn autoplay won't engage.

In addition to that, I'd pay extra for some type of ""channel"" function where you could select a number of shows and have them play random episodes.&&It’s time we hit Netflix *hard* with a massive ‘delete Netflix’ campaign. They’ve grown complacent. It shows with the auto-play ads. &&[deleted]&&> my biggest complaint is how watered down and option-less EVERYthing has become.

It's been happening for decades, but the past 10-15 years have been especially egregious. My intuition tells me it was right about the time that companies switched from ""settings"", which implies certainty in selection, to ""preferences"", which is that god-awful, ""You can let us know what you want, but we have the final say,"" attitude that every corporation has these days.

Definitely a symptom, and not the root cause, but it's the clearest indicator of the intention of the menu itself and the loss of pro-consumer interfaces.&&This is what I wanted when my kids were little so they could have almost real Saturday morning cartoons instead of 8 episodes of Daniel Tiger or whatever in a freakin row if I didn't intervene. &&It's really annoying when you're watching a great sitcom or crime show, and you start to pick out the episode formula. Like criminal minds, I used to love it until I binged it. Or when you start seeing the inconsistencies. Like when I binged Supernatural and they kept changing how monsters could be killed. &&So simple but so wonderful.

How do they make user settings look so hard?&&It's the fucking worst. They'll skip the first three minutes of any show. It's like they don't understand that shows don't usually start with the opening credits.&&I tried to change the settings on that but those controls don’t exist anymore as I understand it. 

Although we got a fire stick with the updated versions and it does give you the option to skip intro and plays the credits all the way through, giving you a countdown timer to press if you want to skip the credits. 

It’s all annoying yes, but I still enjoy the streaming services more than watching live with commercials. Sure, the interruptions suck (buffering, needing to restart the router, etc) but those are still far less annoying than a dramatic reveal right into a mesothelioma commercial. 

Having said that, i wish they’d just stop fucking with it even though it boosts their numbers and such. I get the distinct feeling these services are like Uber; penetrate the market THEN figure out how to make money. &&Similar, got an older Roku where you can still browse in peace and it's great, but whenever I log in on my computer it makes me want to punch a kitten.&&On the other hand, I like the new menu bar on the left, since you can get to your saved or current shows there, instead of hunting for wherever Netflix decided to put them this time. 

But yeah, the new 'features' are more bad than good. Unfortunately, every device I've had or used keeps with the netflix updates, even if they're too old to really handle the constant previews and other nonsense properly. Hulu, on the other hand, won't update past their ancient UI on some devices, so no user profiles or HBO plugin, etc.&&You're completely right. I haven't browsed Netflix since the auto playing previews started, they're incredibly annoying. To be honest I'm pretty close to cancelling it.&&I’ve realized that purely on the basis of content I actually want to watch/haven’t watched already, the commercial-free Hulu plan has *wayyy* more quality shows and movies that are worth paying $2 less a month than you do for the current UHD Netflix plan. 

Never thought I’d see the day, but I actually cancelled my Netflix recently and only stick to Hulu/Amazon Video now. &&Exactly!! My 'continue watching' list is just jam-packed with garbage. &&I’m more pissed that in my iOS app there’s not a god damn plot description when I click on a show or movie.

Happened for the first time last night actually. My GF got PISSED. &&Thanks! Just did it...&&It's odd because the timer varies based on what device you're using. It's a 30 countdown when I watch on my chromecast, 5 seconds if I'm watching on my tablet. 30 seconds is perfectly fine, God forbid I can enjoy the end credits music for a bit &&Since /u/Fearless_Wasabi decided not to actually post where to do it, you sign in and select your profile, then click the down arrow in the top right corner.

The latest episode of a weekly show (common outside the US) also counts as the end of a series and also prompts trailers.

They really need to expand that settings menu to include an option to disable any and all autoplay in all versions of the app, both at the end of a series and while you're just browsing.&&On Hulu I'll fall asleep with 6 episodes of Bob's Burgers left, wake up and autoplay finished the series for me and is two episodes into Last Man on Earth. &&Barely gets to the end of the word show before going to the next epsiode&&Is there a new setting? I have tried. Where is it?&&I imagine something to do with word of mouth and new users? The more shows you watch the greater chance of coming across something and telling your friend ""Yo there's this awesome Netflix show you should check out!""&&I’ve never understood it either. I imagine the data must show that it increases retention to constantly shove content at the user; there must be a lot of people considering canceling st any given moment.

But man does it feel counterintuitive that creating a bad user experience could be the right call...&&The shitty customer experience made me cancel. It's the only thing they understand. &&I’m with ya. But I think the big logic there is really that they want to hook you on some Netflix Originals. As more studios pull content from Netflix and move to other services or their own services, the only world in which Netflix stays viable is if they have a mass audience that sticks around cause they have a few Netflix Original shows they’re attached to.

80% of the reason I have HBO Go is Westworld & GoT. Netflix wants a GoT. So they take every available opportunity to push engagement with their new shows. Keep this in mind and every shitty ux decision starts to make sense.&&It doesn’t make more money but it adds someone to the numbers of people watching their shows. So when they need to justify a new show they can say X amount of subscribers watch our other shows. Then they make more shows, and so now they have more to offer. Both to get new subs and prevent people from canceling. &&Hasn’t it been this way for 7+ years?

When I first started watching it was based on recommendations from star ratings you’ve given movies you’ve seen.&&I remember the rating system was the only reason I watched Snowpiercer.  It had like 4.8 out of 5 stars or something ridiculous, which I did not expect based on the movie description, so I gave it a chance, and I was glad I did!&&> Now I just pirate everything. It funny how people who steal content always get the best, no nonsense experience. I don't feel one bit bad for these companies, if they get to be greedy, so am I.

I agree. I think movies need to find a platform like Steam or GOG did for games, a central place to buy digital content that competes against piracy and makes it easier than piracy. &&isn't it possible to purchase digital copies of movies? i assume they'd be the same quality as pirated, except you'd be operating within the law and wouldn't need to rely on shaky reasoning to justify it.&&Your text was removed earlier for some reason&&Watched Heat for the first time and Netflix absolutely destroyed the finale ambience by autoplaying some inane trailer before I could get to the remote.

The first half of the season isn't very good but they start hitting their stride mid season and it ends strongly with the final two episodes. Go in with low expectations and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the end. It takes a little while for shows to find their footing. I think the series has good potential and is worth watching to get in on what hopefully is the next incarnation of Futurama.
&&It's good, not great. Has some kinks to work out, but I thought it was charming and thoroughly enjoyed it. A lot of people were disappointed in it though. The first episode in particular isn't that great, so stick with it.&&Lower your expectations first and you should be pleasantly surprised.

You know how the first few episodes of *Futurama* are kind of weird and awkward? Like how you can still see the show buried in there somewhere but a lot of the jokes don't land, the delivery is stiff, characters haven't been fully developed, and overall it doesn't ""feel"" like *Futurama* yet? That's the first half of the season. It definitely has its moments but it takes a bit to find its voice and get into a groove, and after that it really picks up. If you're expecting *Jurassic Bark* or *Godfellas* you're going to be massively disappointed, it definitely feels like it could reach that level some day but it's not there yet.

Also don't expect a true Futurama-style show. It seems to be going more for the *Bojack Horseman* style of cartoon, with much slower pacing, serialized narrative storytelling, and a lot of darker/reflective themes. It's definitely more zany and less depressing than *Bojack* but the tonal shift from *Futurama* and *The Simpsons* can be a bit jarring if you're not expecting it.

But man, I'm a huge fan and can't wait to see where it goes in the future. Once you get used to the different style, and once the characters start to develop it really does become something special. A lot of the naysayers seem to be disappointed that it's not at the level of *Futurama* season 4 yet, but that's just absurd, and after the initial stumbles it starts to progress pretty quickly. After just ten episodes it already feels established and familiar, with tons of lore and in-jokes, and well on its way to becoming one of the greats.&&The concept is good but I found the jokes fell flat&&I wasn't into it. Loved the futurama and have watched every episode multiple times. Watched all of the Simpson's up to maybe season 15 or so. A lot of the humour felt like things I'd heard from either of those series before rehashed with new characters. Wasn't particularly into it. Only watched 5 or so episodes but likely won't watch anymore unless the next season is better and people recommend I watch it. &&It's not all that story driven at first. But you get to know the characters throughout their wacky adventures. Give it a try, the first episode was eh for me. Trucked on through and by episode 6 I loved it.

I believe they used to make Netflix and Hulu apps specifically for devices, but now it seems they have a web based version so that they basically just need a modern web browser to run on the device to load their page. It would certainly explain how they update the apps without ever downloading anything, and how my Fire TV and Switch both get those updates at the same time and look identical. YouTube definitely does this with with their apps, you can see the page it loads here: [https://youtube.com/tv](https://youtube.com/tv)

I'm so sorry for doubting everyone.&&Ok that’s fine and all but give us the option to fucking disable it then.

Just like the traditional networks and how they kept making more and more reality TV because it was cheap and got more views in the short term... while driving more and more of the population towards the alternatives. And when they suddenly noticed they were fucked, it was too late.&&Using AB testing for literally every aspect of your UI is the worst thing to happen to UI development since ever.&&The hover preview for The Last Jedi is one of the climactic fight scenes.

Our interfaces are definitively on cyberpunk levels.

Usually if the show has a cold open like Freaks and Geeks, they start it at the very beginning, whereas if it’s just recap or opening credits like Shameless, they skip it, because if you’re binging you’ve probably seen it 2 seconds ago. I don’t think I’ve had a moment where it actually skipped stuff I wanted to see.&&Yeah it doesn't always catch cold opens. Especially for shows where the cold open is of varying length. &&I'm starting to think you people don't know how to use it because I have never encountered literally any of the problems y'all are talking about in this thread. I get that the trailer thing is new so it might only apply in the US, but I watch Netflix and Youtube exclusively and I've never encountered skipping cold openings, or cutting the credits of the final episode, or things disappearing off my list. Y'all either have imaginary problems, don't know how to use the app, or Netflix just decided to give a random Mexican their ultimate experience for no reason.&&Are you listening Netflix?

The best possible quality of TV is usually given to LG's OLED TVs but they're crazy expensive. LG's lower end models generally get outclassed by Vizio though, which seems to be a great value brand. If you need smart TV features, Sony might be what you have to go with for better picture quality in their TV's price range compared to competitors, as I'm not 100% sure that Vizio has a good smart TV set up.&&Also, I feel like the series needs to get comfortable with itself and requires time to develop the story.  This first season was really uneven in quality but I don't judge a series like this just on the first season.  I like where it ended and the opportunities it opened up.  Momentum is going and I'll judge the series based off of how they do this next batch of episodes.

That being said, gotta love the king.  Favorite character hands down.&&>what hopefully is the next incarnation of Futurama.

Oof I dunno. I’m glad to hear it picks up half way through the season, I’m a few episodes in and so far I feel completely indifferent about it. Like I don’t hate it, but I can’t really say I’m enjoying it either. 

Futurama had me at the first episode. Honestly the first few episodes of futurama were some of my favorites. That whole first season is gold. 

Disenchantment feels like it’s missing something. Kind of like how most of the new simpsons episodes feel like they’re missing something. Honestly at this point I think I prefer the current simpsons to disenchantment. But hopefully that changes.

The Simpsons and Futurama were two of my favorite shows ever, and between Matt Groening, John Dimaggio, Abbi Jacobson and Eric Andre I had pretty high hopes for Disenchantment, maybe I was just expecting too much. &&That's good to hear.  I wasn't really impressed with the first three episodes.  Didn't feel like keeping going.  Maybe I'll come back to it.&&Oh, I might revisit it so! Watched the 1st episode when it was released & was completely underwhelmed.&&Seconded. I think the show has a lot of potential, but it's definitely not Futurama level in this season at least. Still a good show though and I think Groening has a vision for what it can be. &&I think it was great, but I'm partial to the cast of The Mighty Boosh, and 3 of them do voices for the series. But yeah the first episode I didn't enjoyed as much.&&Futurama never felt weird and awkward to me; it was interesting, creative, and most importantly - hilarious from the first episode.

I think Disenchanment had a much worse start.&&There were a few times where they’d make a nice, subtle joke, then they’d ruin it by explaining it.&&Jeez...thanks for that. Why would they cut that out of their OWN show?!&&#SPOILER

“Besides the fact that both are considered great movies, “The Wizard of Oz” and “Silence of the Lambs” don’t have much in common. One is the story of a girl from Kansas who’s transported to a magical land where animals dance and sing, and the other is about a serial killer who eats his victims. You wouldn’t necessarily expect people to have similar reactions to the two movies.

But it turns out that, for whatever reason, they usually do. Those who love one tend to love the other, and those who think one is overrated generally think the other one is, too.”&&> I can't follow their jumps in logic sometimes.

There's no logic. It's not like some algorithm said ""these actors and these themes appeared in this show, and they're in this show as well, so check it out""

What they're doing is looking at how you watched *Legends* - did you binge? How quickly did you watch each episode? Did you hit the button to jump to the next (i.e. were you actively watching and engaged)? 

Based on that pattern, they look for other viewers with a similar viewing pattern and shows they've watched you haven't seen. 

This is the reason they still have profiles - it's most definitely not for *our* benefit. &&I mean, Kid Flash and Minion Bob kind of look alike if you squint hard enough. &&I love all 3 of his characters!&&True Crime Documentaries About People Who's Names Rhyme With A Type Of European Cheese&&Kung Fu Musicals Starring Polynesian Lead Actors with Cerebral Palsy Who Are Going Back to College in their Mid-40s&&>Gay drug dealers that get the attention of an alien race called the daves

I hate the fucking auto previews. &&Exactly. UI design is often misunderstood to mean ""make the user's experience as pleasant and pain-free as possible, period."" That's *very often* the goal, but there are definitely times when you need to do something that isn't ideal from the user's standpoint, but which benefits the organization. 

Case in point: I'm the Web director at a college. As anyone in a similar role will tell you, one of our primary goals is to get prospective students into our admissions pipeline. We can't do that unless we know who they are, so we're constantly encouraging website visitors to sign up for mailing lists, open house events, whatever.

As most people know, web users hate long forms. The completion rate for any given form will go down for every field you add. *But*, our admissions department demands that I collect quite a bit of information from new prospects. (This is a constant battle.) So looooong ago (2005-ish) I stumbled upon a sneaky solution (which you've probably encountered because it's more common now): Start the user with a mini form, which when submitted goes to a longer form pre-filled with the info they've already entered and a message like ""You're almost done! We just need a little more information.""

I'm sure the users groan and get a bit annoyed, but then they finish the form anyway because they've already invested a little time into doing so. We've A/B tested this against giving them the full form right away, and it's no contest - submissions drop by more than half if they're presented with the full form first.

Good for the user? Nope. Good for us? Yup. &&It just pisses me off. Doesn’t cause me to watch the stuff I scroll past. If I don’t know what I want to watch, I go through the actual genres sections. Anything else is like digging through a discount bin of dvd’s at best buy. &&I think it's pretty stupid long-term. Yes, it's driving people to new content Netflix wants them to watch *right now*, but people really do have a finite amount of bullshit they'll put up with before they finally say ""fuck it, and fuck you, I'll go somewhere else"". Amazon and Hulu are also getting pretty good original programming, House of Cards isn't the juggernaut it was (even before the Kevin Spacey thing it was losing steam), and while they have some great shows, nothing has made the huge waves that House of Cards and Making a Murderer did. 

Both Amazon and Hulu have their issues with ads, so I don't think you're going to quite see people move away from Netflix in droves, but I think Netflix is getting a little complacent with being on top and if the other services take notice of it and decide to make a change towards being more user-friendly, then Netflix could be in trouble. Hell, the only reasons I'm still subscribed right now are Ozark, Mindhunter, and because my wife watches Netflix constantly. I have to imagine that if she didn't care about Netflix, the first two wouldn't be enough to keep me as a customer simply because of the UI issue. I fucking hate being treated like a goddamn sheep to be herded. &&It's not user unfriendly, it's user *hostile*. Unfriendly could be an accident, this is calculated.&&> I don't want to scroll through all the Thomas the Train crap

(Obv not talking about direct subscription service channels like HBO, Skinemax, and Showslime)&&You know losing the stars pissed me off, but I got through it. Now they've removed user reviews. It's already stopped me from giving possibly interesting new shows a chance because I have absolutely no idea what I'm going into and don't want to waste half an hour.

Seriously, why remove the reviews?&&They have. It's literally people's jobs at Netflix to watch the content and timestamp the intro and credit start\end times so the skip intro and the next episode features work.&&Honestly it might just be trailers, I'm usually scrambling for the remote and going to the menu before I get more than a few seconds into it.&&It plays a trailer for shitty Netflix originals after skipping the movie credits.&&Because these companies know that no matter how annoying this is to a lot of gamers, the majority will still want to play their favorite AAA content no matter what.

Until the next Battlefield, GTA, or Elder Scrolls games take a significant hit in sales due to customers complaining about having to sign up with Origin, Rockstar Store, or Bethesda Store, then they will continue to do this type of thing.  They make way more money selling on their own storefronts as opposed to giving Valve a 30% cut of profits to be listed on Steam.

It sucks for gamers but to the bean counters at the game studios, they don't notice any blowback from moving all of their product to their own proprietary platform.&&if anything, it would be better for them to slow episodes down, so it takes longer to burn through their content, and keep subscribing.&&""A/B testing shows users with playback speed defaulted to 1.2x use 12% less bandwidth, reducing expenses by 3%. We're now rolling this feature out.""&&Not at 2x. There's evidence of some networks airing repeats with a 5-10% increase in the speed. It's not really noticeable, but you might feel like something is off when you're watching it. It allows them to squeeze an extra 60 seconds of ad time out of a half-hour slot.

It's nonsensical to think Netflix would ever start doing it, though.&&[deleted]&&>But it turns out that, for whatever reason, they usually do. Those who love one tend to love the other, and those who think one is overrated generally think the other one is, too.”


I'd say there's a good chance that represents contrarian types, and/or those who are automatically more skeptical of widespread acclaim. 

Both also feature a strong female lead. 

I get that some of the connections may be harder to spot... But they're there.

*Just saw the trailer.&&I like Ferrell and JCR.
I love Sherlock Holmes stories and pretty much every version that’s been done recently.

But Holmes and Watson as idiot man-children just isn’t going to do it for me.&&Bad design honestly. I saw this months ago and only because of your post do I now know it's not called ""holmies"" lol. Not hating on you for posting though to be clear&&This is gonna suck&&I wonder if JCR knew he was signing up to be Will’s sidekick for over a decade back when they made Talladega Nights?&&Looks like complete and utter garbage.&&What is the point of this movie. Why. Just why. &&Sherlock Holmes becoming part of the public domain is one of the worst things to ever happen to him. &&This is going to be pure shit. &&I'm pretty tired of the ""dumb confused man child that shouts a lot""

both actors are funny.  I wish this were played a bit straighter.&&This is going to be a terrible movie. &&What about the RDJ one?&&Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson went out camping one weekend. In the middle of the night, Holmes wakes up and nudges the good doctor. He says, ""Look up Watson. Tell me, what do you see?""


Watson looks up and says, ""Why, it's a gorgeous night and I see millions and billions of stars!""


""Indeed!"" Sherlock replied. ""And tell me, what do you think that means?""


Watson thought for a second and said, ""Well, I think it means that with millions and billions of stars out there, surely a lot of them will have planets. And it stands to reason that some of those planets will be very similar to ours and at least a few of *Those* must have life on them, if they are like our planet. And *That* means, if some of them do support life, they could very well support **Intelligent** life. Ergo, I think it means that we are not Alone in the Universe...""

Yes, there should be a little bit of quirkiness, but full out stupidity? No.

I hope it's the latter. Sherlock is not supposed to be a bumbling idiot.&&The movie industry is 50% superhero’s , 40% remakes and 10% original content... ducking lame&&I still feel like Sherlock Holmes should be played by Benedict Cumberbatch&&How many more sherlock Holmes remakes will we have until we've had enough &&Sherlock Holmes franchises are so played out and over saturated, it may be the perfect time for a parody.

Without A Clue  is a great comedic film where Watson is the brains and Holmes is an idiot that Watson hired to be the face for his stories. Jeffrey Jones is Lestrade and I think Peter Cook is the publisher of The Strand. I used to have this on VHS (yes I'm old. It may have actually been beta now that I think about it).

Watson: ""Weren't you the one who once declared the victim was brutally murdered with a blunt EXCREMENT?""

Holmes: ""Can I help it if you have such poor handwriting?""

I wanted to do legitimate tourist things like hitting museums and seeing shows while all they wanted to do was visit New York bars and get drunk.

I wasn't a drinker, so I figured ""fuck them"" and got tickets to see a play my friends had performed in high school called True West. I tried and tries to get someone to go with me but they all chose to get their drink on. Even my gf at the time. So I went alone.

 The show starred John C Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman. To this day I like to remind them that they missed out on that show.&&I just watched the sisters brothers today because I was in need of some lighthearted comedy. Not. A. Comedy. &&I absolutely love Walk Hard. Such a knee slapper.&&He’s a fantastic and criminally underrated actor. &&You don't want no part of this shit! &&I really loved him in Chicago&&Go watch The Lobster!&&He deserves every bit of fame that will Ferrell has received in all their movies. 

Walk Hard is easily one of the top 3 comedy movies of all time. 

Edit:And it's a shame that walk hard got buried by releasing around the same time as Superbad, because walk hard was so much better than Superbad. 

Superbad was the greatest movie ever pre-release, the impression the trailers gave made it look fantastic. Then it came out, was pretty funny, but honestly forgettable. I read think that movie only took off so well because of how hyped it was from promotions(which Walk Hard should have got)

The wrong movie took off!&&I always feel sorry for him.  He plays a lot of roles in the shadow, and often the foil of, Will Farrell. He’s a hilarious actor in his own right. Walk hard was brilliant. &&Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story.

And you're a curly headed fuck&&Should’ve just been a Stepbrothers 2 &&Sherlock Holmes gets remade constantly in all media forms because his heirs are not picky at all about licensing it out. On top of that a lot of it has gone out of copyright and is now public domain. The characters have essentially grown into cultural icons or legends more than specific IPs that are owned and controlled by a single corporate entity. The benefit is that everyone knows what it is and the framework is already in place for the world and personalities, so it's a lot cheaper and easier to write the story and market the product.  As for this movie I'm hoping it will be a farcical Airplane!/Naked Gun style flick, but I doubt it. Either way I'm sure it'll be worth a laugh during dinner on Netflix in a few months.&&My total guess is that it is like Austin Powers&&What is the point of any movie?&&[deleted]&&Copyright doesn’t prevent someone from making parody&&At least the rdj movie was good&&I agree, because everything is all about Holmes now, but this? It's just lowbrow humor. It's always been there. Sometimes it's fun to take something serious that's been done seriously a million times and just be stupid with it. 

I'll judge it when I see it. &&There were rip-offs and parodies and unauthorized ""fan-fiction"" of Sherlock Holmes stories being  mad while Doyle was still writing the original stories (or taking a break from writing the original stories).

There have been all sorts of very bad adaptation of the character and the stories over the decades while the stories were still under copyright.

Recently with all of it having fallen into the public domain we got Robert Downey Junior's Sherlock Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes and Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock Holmes all of which have their flaws but certainly are all among the better adaptations of the characters that are out there.

&&Is that what's happening!?  &&Completely disagree. Not every Holmes interpretation is great, but it’s a wider and more interesting net than you’d get otherwise. 

As a counter example, look at James Bond, quite stale and playing it safe IMHO.&&JCR can play straight really well, he does that in more serious movies. but with movies like this he really lets out his other side and i think that's fine. it's not like he acts that way in every movie. &&Watch ""stranger than fiction"" to see WF in a non adult-child role.&&Honestly didn’t expect to see this opinion as far up. I love me some Farrell and JCR, but inserting this comedic style into every movie they’re obviously casted together for is kinda shit. I feel like it’s gonna be Stepbrothers that fight crime. It’s a heavy type-cast by now. &&If you only take one in every few years it can remain enjoyable&&The whole premise is exhausting. We know what it’s going to be. It will squander two actually great actors for a period piece remake of Step Brothers. I want to be wrong. I really do. I love JCR in tons of his roles and I really enjoy when Will Ferrell explores new stuff. I jut don’t think this is going to be that. &&I’ve just never found either of them funny at all. There’s maybe 2 movies I’ll watch Farrel in. They both just always play exactly what you said. Giant man children. 

Steve carrel is the other one I can’t stand. The general consensus on them is something I’ll never understand. But that’s just my stance. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. &&Yea we need a 3rd of that.&&There's been Holmes comedies and parodies before.&&>the reason we had to go darker for Bond was because of austin powers

I'm kind of glad. I loved the old novels, and they read more like Austin Powers trying to be serious. But the new style bond with Craig is just it's own, new thing. I love it AND I love old bond. <3

Would have loved another Austin Powers movie, maybe with him in his old age like Nigel but with a son. 

Also rip ~~VT~~ Verne Troyer. :( 

Edited for clarity. Sorry lads. &&The new RDJ film is in pre-production. 



Other factors may effect BBC Sherlock, but I doubt this will.&&I was about to say, wasn't this poster released weeks ago?&&Because it's easier to write a comedy where the audience does all the heavy lifting.

The thing is, Will Ferrell is kinda funny. Kinda. In a get-high-with-friends-then-go-to-cineplex way. Not a OMHG COMEDIC GENIUS !@! kind of way. 

I can respect that. &&Per your edit, Adam Sandler hasn't even always been doing that. People choose to forget that he's been a hugely influential comedian.

You say that like it's a bad thing!&&To be fair, sometimes I want to smoke and get drunk and watch a stupid comedy. I didn't go to see stepbrothers to see an Oscar contender&&“Walk hard” is one of the funniest movies I’ve ever seen and it’s starring John c Reilly. &&Obviously you’re entitled to your opinion but Steve Carell has a lot of range imo.

Some of their stuff is ok, but I feel like they're a little before my time. I was more in the time of Seth Rogan, who I'm also sick of.

I'm of the opinion that comedians, like telling the same joke, can only last so long. After a while, that same joke, that same style of humor, just gets tired. But that way it made you feel remains, so if you first experienced it during an influential time in your life (often high school/college), you still find it funny enough even though the joke/comedian has played out.&&Steve Carrel is great in comedies with scripted and crafted comedy, like The Office. Rather than impromptu manchild comedy.&&Doesn't production start this or next year?&&And there were many bond comedies and parodies before,&&Daddy?&&Two factors I can think of that would effect BBC Sherlock

But I don't think you meant it like that.&&I think Stuhlbarg did it this year (in addition to the excellent tb series The Looming Tower), but you're right other than him I can't think of any other actors/actresses whove done that. &&https://media.tenor.com/images/37744b5ce0dd4fc68463f4c5ef6e4e77/tenor.gif&&[deleted]&&This is a circlejerk. He’s loved across the board &&He’s not exactly a household name I don’t think your average person would say ‘oh yeah I know who John c Reilly is’&&His most famous pop-culture roles are usually ‘silly’ ones.

Anyone familiar with his career knows how awesome he is.&&Shoulda been my name&&When you eliminate the impossible, YEP!&&Check your pocket &&Look in your right hand.&&if by awful you mean ""this is probably a terrible movie but will ferrell and john c reilly are in it, also some other cameos by some rather famous people, and it's definitely still going to be a shite movie but i mean re-read what i just wrote about who's going to be in it and stuff"" then yes, it's going to be awful but we're all still going to watch it and somehow enjoy it aren't we&&I'm torn.  I feel like it's just a bad commercial.  These guys are too good to fail, but it does feel slightly Adam Sandler-ish...&&I feel like they're ramping up the random 'autistic' behaviour in Step Brothers to 11, which I'm not a fan of tbh. I think their comedy chops are so much better than that and a more subtle script works better. But what do I know.&&It has Ralph Fiennes in it though, so I'll have to see it anyway.&&I said the same thing when I watched the Step Brothers trailer for the first time. I'm going to remain optimistic.&&Where is Adam Scott?! He is hilarious and I think he compliments them well. &&What do you mean? The screaming and poster remind me of Step Brothers! I gotta watch this now cause they were hilarious in that! Good thing they reminded me in the trailer. (I did love step brothers but this looks terrible)&&I expected nothing more. &&BRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUN&&This part made me cringe so hard I threw my back out holy *shit*&&Really liked that one. Other than that, it's a typical WF comedy and I can't stand them. Not my type of humor &&That was the most subtle joke (reference to the Holmes opium/cocaine thing) and it was the only one that got a laugh from me. I’m not saying obvious humor doesn’t make me laugh but maybe it’s because that kind of thing is the best kind of joke for a Holmes/Watson comedy. &&Ugh I'm glad somebody else said it. I was honestly fine with the trailer but that choice of song seriously made me roll me eyes&&It's definitely true.  Trailers often go for easy, low-hanging-fruit jokes even in movies that do contain much better ones.  Especially since the best jokes in a lot of good comedies require too much context or are too long to work in a trailer.

Overall, comedies can be hard to judge by their trailers because trailers for good comedies tend to make the movie look worse than it is, while trailers for bad comedies often put all the best jokes in the trailer.&&How did you do that thing with the question mark and exclamation mark? &&It’s called Without a Clue, and is worth a watch. The humor in this upcoming one seems rather blunt. &&I’m going to put you in a home, you geriatric fuck!&&Is 3rd confirmed? Those are some of my favorite movies&&And original books! I'm halfway through the audiobook collection narrated by Stephen Fry (played Mycroft in second movie) and it's ridiculously easy and fun listening. A lot of bang for your buck. 72 hours of content.&&Elementary is actually really, really good. &&I think it will be. Honestly I find his work far better than others in this genre of comedy like Sandler. 

Sandler just has fuck-you money and funds his own projects through netflix, and then gets paid even more because he was a majority backer with a huge stake in the production and creation of the films. It's actually quite genius. He's a remarkable artist in that regard-- few artists ever know their audience and capitalize so well on it. &&Dude, that book is daaaark. It is so good yet so disturbing.&&Seriously, he nailed that movie about living on his front lawn too.&&Honestly about the only movie I can stand him in. I dislike is typecast character he always gets and I was very happy that stranger than fiction was different. I just wish he would do more like that&&Just talked about both of these films. They're really the only leading roles where I enjoy WF. &&I did and I came out happy. &&Walk Hard is comedy gold, I quote it all the time at work with my buddies. My favorite comedy of all time.

It turns your bad feelings into good feelings.....its a nightmare!&&He's pretty great in Little Miss Sunshine as well however you might feel about that movie in general.&&Don't forget The Big Short.&&Seeking a friend for the end of the world was a brilliant film. His performance in it was too&&Yeah, I agree about not liking a lot of Farrell or Reilly’s schtick (my personal exceptions being Step Brothers, Anchorman, and Taladega Nights) but Carrell doesn’t belong in the same discussion. Foxcatcher alone shows how brilliant he is as an actor but I’m so glad you mentioned The Way Way Back. He just plays such a perfect asshole stepfather in that film and I hated that character and LOVED Carrell for that. To take a very likeable and well known comedian and make me see him as a rude ass of a stepdad...it was great. And I will always love anything which has Sam Rockwell in it. &&Dont forget Prison Mike&&I’m 29 so right on you. There are way too many comedians now a days that just stick to the one formula. It’s not that that hasn’t been the case all along for comedians in films. It just seems like now a days they are really, really, really sticking to the one character they played in their first big break movie and then never tried much else. &&It got green lit? awesome. Didn't know this.&&*DADDY DOESN'T LOOOOVEEE MEEEEEE.....*&&RIP Vine&&I'm not saying that Will Ferrel has put out anything good lately , but I know that Jack and Jill is much, much worse. &&Wharfs and wenches &&Every time I cum, I produce a quart.&&It’s a Spanish fighting chicken or something &&He really brings out the “weird and eccentric” part of Holmes

The movies aren’t as great as the show,but still fun to watch &&Much better than Bandersnatch Cummerbund.

Have you seen Check It Out? &&True but that's not what they said.

Get away Satan!&&It's full of spaghetti...&&I think you about covered it&&I feel like a lot of people are forgetting talledega nights wasnt a good movie. It was just fucking hilarious. This trailer had me giggling so count me in. &&There's films that aren't meant to be taken seriously but are still funny, well made and enjoyable. Then there's films that aren't meant to be taken seriously but are also poorly made and tedious to sit through, and the fact they aren't intended to be arthouse films doesn't make them any less shit. It's the difference between Happy Gilmore and Jack and Jill. This movie could definitely be heading the Jack and Jill route.&&Don’t forget the part where we quote the movie despite how bad we may think it is. &&If you think Will Ferrell is too good to fail then I don’t know what Will Ferrell you’ve been watching&&I've always liked Will Ferrell's stuff when he's playing a caricature. This movie doesn't seem to have it.  &&Ya I love dumb humor, I thought it was hilarious &&I'm not sure if it was meant as a reference to Holmes being a drug addict. I just thought it was a joke about how things like cocaine and heroin were used really commonly as medicines in the 19th century.&&It felt like an ad for a sequel.&&That fun combination is called an interrobang. Not sure how to do it on a keyboard but you can copy it from Wikipedia and set it as a text replacement on iPhone.. That’s what I did.&&Is Caine playing Holmes? Kingsley and Caine sounds actually quite hilarious...&&Think so. RDJ said he wants to. Google says release December 2020.&&Yeah, Warner Bros. announced a Dec. 25 2020 release date. Who knows if it'll actually come out then cuz a lot can happen in two years.&&Love this audiobook. It was cheap and Fry’s narration/voice acting is superb. &&This past season was fantastic, too.&&If you hadn't said this, I would have.

People on Reddit hate it because ""but it's not Sherlock!!!"" And also because Watson is a woman I guess????

I only half remember it, but i did a high school book report on it. &&I love the book and want to see the movie really badly, but no theaters around me are showing it, sadly...&&Everything Must Go. Ferrell was the first SNL breakout to prove he could do more than comedy, but (and this is an important distinction) he did a lot of comedy beforehand. When SNL alums graduate and go straight to drama, it really puts me off.&&""AND YOU NEVER PAID FOR DRUGS!""&&There's 2 things you need to know...&&Good call, he was great in that.&&Yeah, its supposed to come out on Christmas in 2020. So, there's still quite a bit of time to go. I'm just glad it's being made&&Yup, it's in preproduction. What we do't know is if they've managed to get Guy Ritchie back to direct. Early word was no, but allegedly they are still trying to see if they can get schedules to work. &&Daddy doesn’t care, PEACE&&Oars and whores&&That is offensive!&&I fucking love that line it makes me laugh my ass off every time&&The first one was excellent.

Yet the movie is fucking awesome so I'm hoping things will repeat itself here&&We'll see how many cheesy one liners from this film become common remarks among pretty much everybody. I certainly hope it's not a 'Jack and Jill' but nothing really surprised me anymore. I mean, Tyler Perry has more films that I don't understand the attraction but that doesn't stop him from making something like 8 Madea films. That being said, I have nothing but the highest of hopes for this film to become both a box office and cultural success. Because somebody once put their nut sack on someone else's drum set and this seemingly small event has since changed my life forever... even if the nut sackor still refuses to take credit for doing so. &&I can’t really think of a single character in a comedy that I didn’t enjoy&&Dude The Other Guys is such a good movie&&How dare you find something funny that Reddit doesn't.

I was expecting standard police procedural “final confrontation with the bad guy” and got something else entirely. Michael was actually just a red herring.

Those 5 films have an average Rotten Tomatoes rating of 24%.

And then he's made other crap like Land of the Lost and The Campaign. At this point he's probably made more bad films than good films&&You must have really love land of the lost, and get hard right?  &&He was not good in the office. Probably partly the character writing but it was hard to watch &&It gets out of that rut again. The first season of any season is usually the most meh. That’s when the show is finding its legs.

Civil War II?&&*his bad ones still have Michael Fassbender to kind of salvage them&&I'm not signing a release!&&I think there's also the fact that a lot of good comedies have humor that revolves around context or characters or takes place over an entire scene.  While there are great one-liner filled comedies, I think overall bad comedies tend to be more reliant on trailer-friendly one-off jokes while the funniest parts of good comedies often just wouldn't work in a trailer.&&That's just Land of the Lost for you though. As a big fan of both Will Ferrell and the Land of the Lost series it's a pretty weak movie. I feel like it somehow managed to be too comedic for a Land of the Lost movie and not comedic enough for a Will Ferrell movie.

(X-Men) Dark Phoenix Official Poster,45357,9j2gg2,https://i.redd.it/ib5zfx2m3lo11.jpg,3971,1537968218.0,,"X-MEN. IN. SPAAAAAACE!&&Plot from official website : 

In DARK PHOENIX, the X-MEN face their most formidable and powerful foe: one of their own, Jean Grey. During a rescue mission in space, Jean is nearly killed when she is hit by a mysterious cosmic force. Once she returns home, this force not only makes her infinitely more powerful, but far more unstable. Wrestling with this entity inside her, Jean unleashes her powers in ways she can neither comprehend nor contain. With Jean spiraling out of control, and hurting the ones she loves most, she begins to unravel the very fabric that holds the X-Men together. Now, with this family falling apart, they must find a way to unite -- not only to save Jean’s soul, but to save our very planet from aliens who wish to weaponize this force and rule the galaxy.&&Uhhh...doesn’t she already have The Phoenix inside of her based on the events in Apocalypse? 

[edit] a word&&I just hope this adaptation is better than X-Men 3.&&I know we’ve seen so many articles on the controversy surrounding this movie and the idea of it being “cancelled” or “scrapped”, but now seeing official promotional images from it, it makes realize how long it’s felt since Apocalypse. &&Quick question, when Wolverine returns to the present day at the end of Days of Future Past, the events of Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix had occurred, right? &&Also Hans Zimmer is gonna do the score for this movie&&So what color will the world-ending skybeam be this time? I'm thinking purple or orange.&&I feel really weirdly apathetic towards this movie &&I really hope they shoehorn Mystique in this as much as possible. /s&&My main man Michael Fassbender needs a hit after the demolition of his career last year. (Snowman in particular was close to a death sentence as a leading man)&&Also a teaser teaser trailer for the movie. The trailer is going to drop tonight on the Late Late Show with James Corden.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BoMKFhhHhF1/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=185obdnc5ev4f&&So how come they dropped X-MEN from the title?&&Is anyone else completely lost in the X-men movie world currently?  I have no idea where I left off anymore or what movie sequence is in actual order. Or if there even is one. Don’t get me wrong. I love the X-men universe. But I’m just confused as hell now lol. &&I hope to see more bald people getting blown to bits&&OS X Phoenix&&Unlike most people, I actually have hopes for this. By the looks of it, we're approaching an end of an era for Fox and the *X-Men* films, so I hope this is a proper send off.&&FINALLY AFTER YEARS OF SHITTY FIFTY SHADE OPENINGS ON VALENTINES DAY, ITS MY TURN TO DRAG MY WIFE TO SEE A MOVIE I WANT TO SEE THAT DAY! && Sophie Turner is a mediocre actress, one of the major reasons I am not too thrilled about this. 

Would be a task watching a movie that revolves around her character.&&How does reddit feel about Sophie Turner in this role? I was really unimpressed by her in Apocalypse (not sure if performance or writing) and frankly would have been just fine if they recast the role for this.&&I don’t hate her as an actress, but she’s an AWFUL Jean Gray&&Quicksilver is the most obviously broken character in the universe. His speed was calculated at a conservative 1% of the speed of light, depending on the material that exploded, to 10%. That is orders of magnitude faster than nerve conduction velocity. Literally faster than the speed of thought. Could have soloed everyone in the blink of an eye. &&Ironically it looks like this both generation of X-Men movies will end with Dark Phoenix.&&I’m still excited! For all the shit Apocalypse got, I still had fun with it, despite the weird pacing and bland villain. &&It seems really out of nowhere for the X-Men to be travelling in space, especially if this film is set in the 90's.

I'm aware they've done it in the comics but it just feels weird for this set of films.&&It's shocking how little I care. With that Feb release date I think the studio and I have the same opinion.  &&Neat. Hopefully this is better than the Last Stand.&&Spoilers: jean grey turns into dark phoenix and then they fight and then shes back to normal at the end.

There ya go, saved you a ticket price.&&It's about time.&&Goddammit. Do we have to sit through a couple of hours watching Sophie Turner do her best impression of a treestump/Bella_Swan/brickwall? Ugh.&&I really hate the Phoenix saga and everything that goes along with it. Not because it's a bad story at it's core but because it seems to be the most commonly utilized X-Men story and I'm sick of seeing it. I'm sick and tired of this arc continually being retold and re-adapted and always coming back in new and terrible ways to derail the plot for years at a time. There are so many more interesting stories in X-Men - why do they need to explore this one again.&&So sick of the constant Phoenix saga drama. Uhhhg. It's like the whole xmen universe revolves around it. Come up with something new please. &&Please just don't be Sansa Stark in an x-men costume and have some decent dynamic acting... please please please

&#x200B;&&I loved reading the Dark Phoenix Saga as a kid.  But I think it will make for a dumb movie.  X-Men 3 wasn't that good.  I doubt this will be better.&&Ooooo please be good. Please be good. Please please PLEASE BE GOOD

Phoenix is the saga that got me hooked on Xmen! &&X-Men = surprisingly good

X2 = great

The Last Stand = meh

&#x200B;

First Class = surprisingly good

Days of Future past = great

Apocalypse = meh

&#x200B;

Dark Phoenix = ?&&This would be a perfect opportunity to tie X-Men into the MCU via the Kree-Shi'ar War.&&♪*Set controls to outer space*♪

The Shi’ar!&&Wait I thought it was the the Phoenix powers that allowed her to mess up Apocalypse? I even remember seeing the shape of a bird when she ""letting go"".

So she didn't have the Phoenix back then? Man she'll be powerful&&> they must find a way to unite

**AGAIN??!!**&&fuck that's going to be a lot to cram into one movie&&I sincerely hope they don't screw this up by jamming mystique into the story unnecessarily... &&[deleted]&&Wait how the fuck are the xmen in space, its like the 90s isn’t it?&&Yeah that's what I thought too. Didn't she go ~~SSJ~~ Phoenix force at the end?

Perhaps she ""has had it in her"" and this space incident ""unlocks the full power""?&&The X-men films make a lot more sense when you stop thinning of them as part of the same series.&&That's why Aliens are coming&&Copied from my other comment:   
*Xavier introduced Jean to the astral plane when she was a child, and the Phoenix entity attached itself to her during a moment of astral projection, after realizing her potential.    
Xavier realized that Jean couldn’t control the power, so he erected psychic walls in Jean’s mind to protect her and everyone else.   
Later in life while on a space mission, her team is struck by a cosmic storm and the Phoenix Force once again takes notice. Jeans body is killed, but the Phoenix Force basically revives her and clones her mind.    
This new mental clone of Jean is far too unstable and this is where the Phoenix begins to unleash its true potential.*&&Yeah but if I remember right, even in the comics they foreshadow a bunch of bird stuff for her. Despite the fact the force is literally a giant space bird that comes to her.&&I guess that's why she is now Dark Phoenix instead of just Phoenix?&&Whoa, whoa whoa.

X3 has the best line ever.

""Well, Charles always wanted to build bridges...""

_Magneto lifts Golden Gate Bridge_&&could it be worse?&&I hope it's better than Logan, and I really liked Logan&&It’s an adaptation *of* X-Men 3, actually. 

This is the movie, that’s basically the result of, if somebody had watched The Last Stand five years ago, but only once, and then was forced to recount the entire plot while drunk to somebody else. Then that person writes it down, sends it to somebody else that speaks English as a second language, who then translates it to Spanish, and then sends it in as a potential new movie to Bryan Singer, who then gets it translated back to English, then emails it to Simon Kinberg. 

Simon Kinberg then says “this is awful, what the fuck did I just read,” tosses it, and decides to go forward with his reimagined, 90s set version of the Dark Phoenix story arc. &&[It’s fine. We just pretend it never happened.](https://media.giphy.com/media/cXrUCAiujGYyQ/giphy.gif)&&I believe this is the X-Universe where Wolverine went back in time to kill Brett Ratner, so we're safe.&&And this is (probably) the end of the 17 year old Fox X-men series. I hope they've spent their time wisely and actually made something good.&&One would assume, yeah. &&Dark Knight trilogy, Man of Steel, The amazing Spider Man 2, Wonder Women 2 and now X-Men. 

Freakin LOVE HIM!!!&&I'm thinking some weird green that Jean will turn to orange when she fights back&&Well it's the X-Men in (muted) blue versus Phoenix Jean in Orange, so, based on they ""Hollywood knows only one set of complimentary colors"" rule, it's gotta to be orange.&&Maybe they'll go with DC's Snyder route and just make it grey. &&Really the best way to put it.

Like, it's fine.  It's probably not going to lead to anything else.  The movie was already made when the merger started going through, so it wouldn't make sense not to release it.  It's just bittersweet because good or bad, this thing is over with after this.

I mean, we'll get New Mutants, whatever that is trying to do, but this is the last dance for Singer's X-Men.  It was a long strange roller coaster, and I hated a lot of it, but I don't feel happy that its going away because it's the odd separation between intellectual properties that I grew up with - I'm just used to it.&&Logan was such a fitting conclusion to the series that I actually kind of find it insulting that this is gonna be the last official X-Men film from the mess of Fox's continuity. 

&&I felt really let down by apocalypse, I'm not expecting much. &&When trying to remember why I disliked apocalypse Mystique is all I can really remember &&And let’s make sure she doesn’t look like Mystique the whole movie because our actress doesn’t want to wear the makeup.&&I have a theory that she dies during the space mission.&&Wasn't Jennifer Lawrence always trying to get out of these movies? How is she still in them?&&That script was just terrible though. You can tell he did everything he could to try and save it, but even an excellent performance isn't enough for a bad movie. &&Thanks for the heads up! &&Thanks for this. If you search for it right now, you just get bullshit results which are a rehash of this clip.&&Probably to make it seem fresher. If you are an X-Men fan, you know it’s an X-Men movie, but if you don’t you won’t be scared off by it being the 10th (12th counting Deadpool movies) movie in the franchise.&&Teaser poster. Probably the whole big crazy ""squeeze every character in"" poster will feature full title. Not like marketing is going to allow them to drop the X-Men title. &&There isn't one. There are many!

There's the OT: X-Men -> X2-> X-Men: The Last Stand -> DOFP


There's the Wolverine movies: X-Men Origins -> The OT movies(except for DoFP) -> The Wolverine -> Logan


There's Days of Future Past, which is a crossover of the OT and the First Class, but only seems to impact the end of the OT universe.


First Class, then is: First Class -> DoFP -> Apocalypse -> Dark Phoenix

And finally Deadpool, which involves exactly none of that shit and is just Deadpool -> Deadpool 2&&Continuity is not the strong point for this franchise, that’s for sure!&&So X-Men 1 2 and 3 all go together but everyone pretty much agrees 3 is pretty bad so you can skip that one, Origins is a prequel but is also pretty bad and since it always soft-conflicted with 1's Sabertooth and now directly conflicts with Deadpool you can definitely just forget it existed. First Class is a *different* prequel, except it's actually a *reboot*, except it's *not*, because Days of Future Past only makes full sense if you count both the first three movies *and* First Class as canon, but separate, timelines. The Wolverine technically goes between 3 and Days of Future Past, but is also pretty skippable, because Days of Future Past kind of jumps the gun. Next is Apocalypse, which I never saw, but it's a sequel to the First Class timeline parts of Days of Future Past, but has pretty much nothing to do with the future, 1-2-3 parts of Days of Future Past. Following me camera guy? Then you have Logan, which most people say is the best one yet, and it also follows the 1-2-3 timeline, *but* it seems to *ignore* Days of Future Past -- so now going forward and backward from 1-2-3, we have two alternate starts and two alternate futures. And now, apparently, we have Dark Phoenix, which is a sequel to Apocalypse and, oddly enough, could be considered a reboot of X-Men 3.

Seems fairly straightforward to me.&&Like others havre said, the continuity is screwed. For me, that's a deal killer. Continuity is what binds a saga or IP together when doing multiple films/games, stories etc. When there are minor mistakes, that's fine, but when there are HUGE gaping holes..that causes a problem. It's actually funny. I watched Frequency again a few days ago, and Caviezel's character talked about how he could remember 2 timelines after time was altered. That's how I am with the X-Men films.&&Eh, i get enough of that in pornhub. &&""Please, we need you to hope again.""&&Funny you say this because I saw something recently where Sophie turner said it’s meant to be the start of a new trilogy but we all know that’s not happening now &&I would not get my hopes up, even though I'm an apologist for the X-Men franchise. Anyways, *Logan* was already a perfect sendoff IMO.&&> we're approaching an end of an era for Fox and the X-Men films

I feel they've fundamentally mishandled the strongest aspect of this round, which is that McAvoy and Fassbender are great actors with great chemistry and they share relatively few scenes, and those tend to be the same argument at the end of the movie.&&Hahah. Last year had Black Panther and the year before that was Deadpool tho&&To be fair to her, she even said that she's not the best actress and a much better actress was up for likely this part, but she got it because of her social media following. &&Bring back Famke! 

:|&&She's the weakest link of the new cast, for sure. Making her the central focus is a risky move. &&[deleted]&&she is so bland, and emotionless, I haven't seen any other expression on her than the one she has from got for so many years&&She just doesn't have enough charisma and screen presence for a role like this. Shes more suited to a supporting character imo.&&I want to like her? But yeah, she's not a great actress generally and I'm doubtful she can deliver on this supposedly mental performance. The writing is what I'm worried about though. Hugh Jackman is a solid Wolverine but he can't work miracles if the whole script sucks. Turner can't even work basic card tricks. &&I'm a massive fan of GoT, but she is easily one of the weakest actors on that show.  I'm not sure if the people casting her and the others from GoT think they are genuinely talented or are just banking on the success of the show, but I feel like we have to go through a phase now to see exactly who is capable of carrying a movie or not.  I'm still waiting for them to give up on Emilia Clarke.  &&I really think that only cast her because she fit in the age range and had red hair. Her acting was definitely not the reason.&&I'm not a fan. Another comment was correct, she doesn't have enough charisma, and her American accent is terrible. She was very flat and lacked personality in the other X-Men movie.&&Most commemts I see about her says she was terrible. I just thought she was forgettable.&&Yeah if superhero shit was even remotely logical speedsters would never lose, ever. That's kinda why i don't really like Quicksilver, The Flash, etc. Like how the fuck does the Flash ever get hit by anything? &&Holy shit. 1% of the speed of light is (IIRC) something like 1,800 *miles per second.* He could literally run from New York City to LA in about a second and a half. &&Yeah, this was one of the reasons I preferred Marvel Studio's Quicksilver to Fox's.  I mean sure, the Quicksilver scene in DoFP was *amusing,* but it also pretty much meant they had bullshit their way into not just using him to solve everything.  It wasn't just the speed itself that was a problem either.  He didn't just *move* at relativistic speeds, he had relativistic perception and fine motor control as well.  

&&It's a good ending plot. It's big in a ""world ending"" kind of way, while simultaneously being personal because it directly involves Jean. &&I hated Apocalypse but I do hope this franchise ends on a high note&&Weirder than psychics battling it out during the Cuban Missile Crisis? &&Maybe it's just Earth's orbit, or not far from it. The rescue mission mentioned in the blurb could be an astronaut or something.&&Last Stand had Vinnie Jones as The Juggernaut. This one doesn't.&&I've been waiting since The Last Stand when we got a glimpse.  Then.... nothing. Shame they changed the actress though, however understandable. &&Not only that but this incarnation of the Phoenix hasn't even been around long enough for the story to even make sense.&&Of the stories that get brought up as *the best* in X-Men comics, this one is one of my least favorites as well. I don't like that it dramatically changes Jean Grey as a character and with it her relationship with Scott/Logan (hell even Charles). Once she's all-powerful Phoenix or Dark Phoenix....where do you go from there?

EDIT: In Apocalypse they killed a character that *never* gets killed in the comics because he's over-powered **with** a character that is equally over-powered.&&Totally agree.  I was getting sick of Jean Grey and all things Phoenix even before they were making movies.  Still gonna watch it though.  For context I was equally sick of Wolverine before the movies but they did some great things with him.  &&Imma go ahead and file Power Rangers in Space references under “things I did not expect to see today.”&&r/unexpectedpowerrangers&&Fuck *yes!*  Power Rangers in Space kicks ass!&&This is my favorite power rangers theme ever&&So part of the spaceship blows up and Quicksilver rescues everyone before they are blown out into space.  Probably played to a david bowie song. &&I really hope the Imperial Guard is in this movie&&Time for Xavier to get some love from Lilandra.&&But the Shi’ar wanted to stop the Phoenix force from killing everybody after they witnessed her casual genocide. I assume they’re combining the Hellfire Club storyline with the Shi’ar or something. Cramming 18+ issues of plot and character development into one movie is bold. 

Then again, Age of Apocalypse was like 35+ comic books? And that movie obviously was fantastic, so I’m sure this one will win an academy award or two. &&Leaks state that it’s actually Fox’s version of the Skrulls. Not the Shi’ar as originally believed.

Jessica Chastain plays “a shape-shifting alien”.&&Will we finally get to see Gladiator on the big screen?! The most formidable mohawk in the cosmos! Haha!&&Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't Charles have a thing with one of the Shi'ar noblewomen?&&Xavier introduced Jean to the astral plane when she was a child, and the Phoenix entity attached itself to her during a moment of astral projection, after realizing her potential.    
Xavier realized that Jean couldn’t control the power, so he erected psychic walls in Jean’s mind to protect her and everyone else.   
Later in life while on a space mission, her team is struck by a cosmic storm and the Phoenix Force once again takes notice. Jeans body is killed, but the Phoenix Force basically revives her and clones her mind.    
This new mental clone of Jean is far too unstable and this is where the Phoenix begins to unleash its true potential. &&My thoughts as well, thought it was already within her, and that possibly Apocalypse understood what it was, along with how outmatched he was, just before he died&&Jean Grey the mere 'awesome telepath' always had some phoenix symbolism around her character with mental avatars being the bird and whatnot.  But later on she meets a huge cosmic force that is... for some reason... named Phoenix force that heals her from near death. 

>!The phoenix force then makes a copy of her that thinks it IS her, while the original is shoved off camera for a while in suspended animation.  So in a way, everything that Dark Phoenix eventually does in not really Jean Grey at all.  Don't know if that's how they'll play it in the movie or not.  Phoenix storyline is really complicated and has lots of 'fake versions' of characters with bits of their minds swapping back and forth between the real version and the 'phoenix' version. From what I remember it was all horrible mess!<

edit: I put a spoiler tag just in case.  all that stuff is online tho.

edit2: I used the tag syntax from the side bar instead of the formatting help.  It's definitely better.
&&They are rebooting the universe with every movie.&&I think it's funny how you expect the X-men movies to follow a continuity.&&Don't try to make sense or plot of writing in the current Fox X-Men movies. The characters don't even age. &&The great thing about the X-Men movies is how they setup little details that they completely forget about in the next movie.&&This is their real super power. “We can always find a new way to unite!!!”&&Yap, welcome to X-Men 3: Age of Ultro... Phoenix&&X-12 X Men United Again&&Plot outline:

* establish family bond of XMen, maybe they do a mission together, definitely a kitchen scene or living room scene
* love interest angle where Jean and Scott fuuuuuuuck
* Oh shit space mission
* Great job team we're winn...what's that ahhhhh space force hit me. I did not see that coming *ba da tiss*
* No immediate effect. I'm okay, I just need to rest
* Something is weird. I thought everything was okay but ""MASSIVE INITIAL USE OF POWER""
* Holy shit what is going on. Professor X does some mind shit
* Prof X ""Uh, he mind is really hard to see...maybe I'll look at her *harder*""
* The power is too powerful
* Jean looses control and this thing starts going all over fucking shit up
* Oh shit, what do we do.
* Scott: We can't hurt her. She's my girl bro
* Everyone else: Bro...
* Scott has to try and kill that which he loves
* Fucking still sucks and can't
* Real man needs to do the job! Prof X comes up and OH SHIT! He can't either
* This is a job for a woman! Girl Power.
* Plot intensifies
* Either she keeps her powers for more movies as a villain, she keeps her powers but has then under control, she dies
* Either way she's going to live
* Fin.

Edit: I got a lot of comments saying I left out the aliens...maybe it's wishful thinking.&&Yeah seems a bit much. The plot read okay until they slapped in that last line about invading aliens...&&10 pounds of story in a 5 pound bag.&&Doubt they'll go the full Shi'Ar route (battle on the moon, Imperial guard). Probably just generic super-powered aliens who will replace the role of the Hellfire Club from the original story in helping push Jean over the edge. &&They're gonna Snyder it.&&she'll be the star, of course.  they're not paying all that money for one of the highest paid actresses in hollywood just to have her say, ""by the way, i remembered i'm a badguy and want nothing to do you with you silly fuckers.  i'm outtie.""&&I'm just wondering if Magneto will start good and finish evil, or start evil and finish good.&&X-Men 3's attempt at Dark Phoenix was hijacked by a mutant cure plotline.&&They did it extremely poorly, it wasn't the actual phenoix force. It was Jean Grey being the strongest mutant in existence, and she had a different persona that was willing to use all her power the ""phoenix"".

She gets killed by wolverine at the end. 

The pheonix force is what this movie will be able, and it's a extremely powerful cosmic entity similar to something like galactus. 

For example if it Pheonix Jean Grey was in MCU Thanos would've just been killed before he got all the stones. &&Everyone was in space in the 90’s. Like the Power Rangers, and Leprechaun.&&Super advanced X-Men technology developed by Beast and Professor X.  See? No problem.&&The X-Men went to space in the 70’s. Original Phoenix Saga was in like ‘76 or ‘77 I believe. Been a while since I read them. &&Ikr. Space travel hasn’t even been invented yet. /s&&From the comics/wikipedia:

>the Phoenix Force returned to Earth when it felt the mind of a human transcend the physical realm and resonate with its energy. A young Jean Grey had telepathically linked her mind to her dying friend, Annie Richardson, to keep Annie's soul from moving to the afterlife. In doing so, Jean's mind was being dragged along to the ""other side"" with Annie. Phoenix lent its energy to break the connection, and kept close watch on young Jean because it felt a kinship with the young mutant. Years later when Jean was dying on a space shuttle, her mind called out for help and the Phoenix Force answered and saved her, transforming Jean into the Phoenix.&&That probably it. This is the trigger&&I stopped thinning many years ago. &&This is how you write a movie&&This story sounds very ""X-men."" I know I shouldn't but I might slowly get my hopes up for this. &&Not exactly, she becomes Dark Phoenix, because the Phoenix experiences the thrill of committing evil acts and exerting its will on others.  The Phoenix has never experienced those thrills before, and realizes she enjoys doing those things.  Prior to that point, the Phoenix was a being of pure good meant to protect creation, but her being psychically linked to Jean’s Emotions is what causes her to turn from Phoenix into Dark Phoenix.  &&But the whole point of the Phoenix force is that it's a completley different entity to Jean. A bit like Spider-Man and the symbiote suit. It attatches itself to her and gives her incredible power, that's why she becomes Dark Phoneix because it is too much to control&&I'm sorry, but X1's

>'Do you know what happens to a toad that gets struck by lightning?'

is CLEARLY superior.&&And who can forget timeless quotes like, "" I'M THE JUGGERNAUT BITCH!""&&How did I just get that line... I thought it was like a hobby like how some kids love trains... I'm an idiot. &&... which is not the same as building one from scratch. There's yet another problem with this film right there.&&> could it be worse?

It can ***ALWAYS*** be worse.&&did you see Apocalypse?

&&Logan was really good. Patrick Stewart's acting in that was phenomenal. As someone who is currently witnessing their grandfather slowly losing their mind, it really hit me hard.&&I'll kind of be disappointed if it was that good, since the X-Men are likely in for a reboot with the Marvel purchase. &&I can't even fathom how this franchise could ever produce something better as a film than *Logan*.&&That's 100% not going to happen.&&I'm okay with this. &&But where do, all the extra, commas come in?&&Well the date is 2.14. No 3’s in sight&&I felt like Logan would have been the best way to end the Fox X-Men series. This just feels unnecessary. We want to see X-Men where they belong. As a prat of a comprehensive Marvel universe including Spider-man, the Avengers, and all the villains and alien and cosmic races that come along with them. &&Do **not** exclude Interstellar, you heathen. &&James Horner scored The Amazing Spider-Man, while Zimmer scored the sequel.&&>Maybe they'll go with DC's Snyder route and just make it grey. 

*JEAN GREY*&&Batman only works in black. And sometimes very, very dark grey. &&What's really saddening about this is that just a few years ago, after the release of DOFP, this series finally seemed to be on the right track again. And then Apocalypse came along and basically destroyed all of the goodwill earned by that movie. Everything basically fell apart right when the series was starting to become more experimental. These movies have definitely had their ups and downs, but this really feels like the end of an era. This is the series that started the superhero craze, and it makes me sad to see it go out with such a whimper. 

Also, I agree with what you said about liking the separation between the two universes. I think it forced both properties to get creative.&&I almost wish the merger happened sooner so that Logan could be the final film. 

I wonder if they changed the ending to be more conclusive with this one?&&> this is the last dance for Singer's X-Men.

The franchise is getting a little old for him, after all.&&Yeah, they should have just stopped after Logan like how they stopped after the first Matrix movie.&&She is supposed to die in this one. &&""Mutant and Proud.""

*[Just stays as Jennifer Lawrence 90% of the time.]*&&And don't even use her shapeshift power because our actress doesn’t want to be replaced by someone's else.&&Money is my guess. She doesn't have to do much with the makeup because she's either herself most the time or when she is mystique she'll be in the xmen jumpsuit. 

I also read she'll agreed to it bc mcavoy and fassbender also agreed and she said she'd do another only if they returned. Wasn't exactly a binding contract so that's why I think other star actors + money got her to come back. Just sucks for us fans bc she as an actress has completely destroyed the role she's playing just by fact of being JLaw. FOX writes her role for her a list status, and she can't wear blue makeup bc she's allergict to it. So literally not her fault but she should just leave superhero movies. She doesn't like them I think. &&Oh yeah, for sure. I'm not blaming him at all. I still think he's a top 5 talent in Hollywood but hasn't yet been successful at securing himself as a leading man. He's been phenomenal in supporting roles and very good in leading ones but those leading roles are in bad movies that he needs to avoid in the future. I actually read the Snowman and it's an excellent book but it cannot be adapted for a 2 hour movie; it's too complex and a bit convoluted. &&The X-Men franchise is so awkward in this modern day. When you go from reading the comics where everything is X- something (X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, Uncanny X-Force, X-Factor, etc), it's really weird to see things that are based on X-Men comics but can't use the brand due to rights like the shows Legion and The Gifted. Now we have a X-Men **movie** that isn't using the title. At this rate, I'm wondering if they couldn't release it as an X-Men film due to the deal with Disney.

&&*DOFP* = <3

Easily the series best imo.&&Before or after they reshot the ending?&&For Wolverine maybe, but the X Men as a whole? Nah, not in my opinion. It's too jarring and depressing: ""Through great effort, Wolverine and Pals successfully fixed the timeline, brought old friends back to life, restored the Xavier School, and everyone lived happily ever after.... until *everyone died off-camera 2 years later.*""

Logan would've worked so much better had they just set it like 60 years in the future, but they wanted to be able to use Patrick Stewart while he's still healthy. Problem is there's no conceivable reason why Xavier would live as long as Logan. So they gotta awkwardly cram it in right behind DOFP, while also explaining why the world is an apocalyptic shithole all of a sudden.&&Logan is a great film. I think DOFP was a perfect optimistic send-off to the franchise (and I suspect that Logan takes place in it's own continuity given a good number of details).&&Actually, this year was black panther and 2016 had Deadpool. Which timeline are you living in? :P&&Love that she’s self aware. &&This explains a lot.&&Damn, gotta respect her for that at least &&I wonder who the much better actress is? &&Do you have a source for this?  That's crazy if true&&She was such a good Jean Grey. You can say whatever you want about the old films, but you can’t say their casting was bad.&&Yes please <3&&The weakest links are the ones that are supposed to be strongest and best friends. Storm and Jean.&&I'm still glad they're taking another stab at Dark Phoenix before Fox is enveloped by Disney.&&I know what you mean, she sounds like she just needs to get in the habit of taking in a deep breath before she speaks. Lot of people do it, especially when they're excited or emotional&&> she talks on GOT it sounds like she's on the verge of crying

Somehow it worked for her in the first season or two. It made her seem more fragile as a young naive girl. Now that she's supposed to be mature and hardened by her experiences, it's awkward. She's a pretty woman and I have nothing against her personally, but she didn't grow into that role very well.&&I thought Emilia had one really great scene last season (end of Beyond the Wall, the ""I had to see it to know"" thing), but otherwise she hasn't really impressed me. She doesn't take me out of it, and I don't think she's notably bad, she's just there.&&>Like how the fuck does the Flash ever get hit by anything?

If it's the CW, because either Iris or the bad guy said something mean.&&I like how in the anime bleach, relativistic thought was actually a sentence to hell.

Basically a guy had his thoughts sped up so fast that he was paralyzed.  Imagine if moving your arm to scratch your nose required you to concentrate on just that for an entire decade.  He perceived the passage of time several million times faster than others, and thus was defeated by that supposed ""superpower""&&It’s essentially the Infinity War for the X-Men&&While true, I'm guessing that none of the studios planned to end the X-Men movies on that story line, yet it just happened.&&I didn't 'hate' Apocolypse, it was just aggressively mediocre when compared to Vaughn's First Class, and Singer's own DoFP previous.&&Or giant walking robots in the 70s? &&I'M THE JUGGERNAUT BITCH&&Famke Jannsen was kinda perfect as Jean Grey, and ridiculously sexy as Phoenix.  Looking back, that whole first generation of xmen movies had amazing casting all around.&&This is my contempt with Mr. Sinister. He's always chasing Scott and Jean around. Plus David Bowie isn't around to play him.&&♪*Ground Control to Major Striker*♪

♪*Take your mutant pills and put your helmet on*♪&&Don’t sleep on my space rangers either, that was the best season&&Why not link directly to /r/PowerRangers. It'll save everyone time... FORCE.&&Tie between this and Lost Galaxy for me.&&Better be 'Dancing in the Street' dammit. &&Are we still talking about the same universe here?&&If Gladiator makes an appearance I'll just die!&&She was very appealing to my 10 year old self in the 90s cartoon&&I can hear Xaviers scream from the 90's cartoon&&>And that movie obviously was fantastic


I *sincerely* hope that that’s sarcasm and I’m just too tired to tell.&&Well, that is horrifically disappointing. I knew Fox would find a way to Sony this up...&&Is that Fox’s attempt to beat Marvel to the screen with their Skrulls a month before Captain Marvel?&&Like Dr Strange astral plane?&&I like Xavier but Emma always does a more thorough job at what he tries to do.

Also, Jean wasn't dead, it was her body clone that the Phoenix made that died. Phoenix teleported the real Jean into the bottom of the (Jamaica?) Bay, and her mind erected a psychic cocoon to keep her safe.&&The clone stuff is confusing because it's all ad-hoc retcons so writers can tell their own stories without interference.

Which is fine, but makes following the ""continuity"" feel kind of pointless.&&Wait wait wait ...... Didnt the phoenix force rise when the whatever-their-name Club used illusions to take down Jean's mental blocks placed their by Xavier ?

In all seriousness though you can't be far off&&Stop they’re just gonna do exactly this &&RemindMe! 14 Feb 2019&&Wait I'm admitting I know relatively little about X-men but i thought wolverine kills Jean grey when she turns Into phoenix? &&Plot outline:

Like they read that line in the table read, during production and editing and no one was like ""That line is utter trash.""&&It was originally ""they croak"" but test audiences hated it&&The fact that that line didnt make an appearance in Deadpool 2 was SO dissapointing. &&It was actually pretty funny at the time, since it was an internet meme...but may that just hasn't aged well.&&Lol same question we asked when they rebooted Fantastic 4. &&^ Found Tommy Wiseau&&did you see Days of Future Past? That one was good&&Apocalypse while not great was SUBSTANTIALLY better than last stand&&Ser Patrick Stewart deserved a Best Supporting Actor nomination for that performance at the very least. The send-off for his Xavier character was gutwrenching in the best way possible.

Mangold should have won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for Logan too. Films like Logan, that can bridge a Hollywood blockbuster with a well-crafted, artistic, emotional, character-driven drama, need to be recognized by the Academy and encouraged to have more of them made.&&Patrick Stewart has been a role model to me my whole damn life with his acting roles. I still yearn for a leader like Jean-Luc.&&(4-2)+1=3. Its right there.&&The cross being turned to an X would have been an amazing way to just walk away from the series under Fox. A great capstone to a very up and down franchise. 

But walking away means less money and less money means not good so here we are. Hope Dark Phoenix is decent. &&Yup , it was a perfect high note to end on .&&[deleted]&&Do we? I mean, I know myself, if they made an X-Men in MCU movie I'd definitely watch it, but at the same time I prefer them separate. I feel the in-universe treatment of mutants is so different than the reactions to the other MCU characters with superhuman abilites and it would clash pretty bad in a movie. Comic books have all the time in the world to explain every detail of why and how all these people end up together but there's only so much you can do with a movie, especially one that has to bridge two huge franchises. &&I meant to state the Marvel and DC movies he's composed. I do know that he has done others.&&> This is the series that started the superhero craze, and it makes me sad to see it go out with such a whimper.

I wanted to interject with something interesting on this subject that was pointed out to me a while back. I know that X-Men is credited with starting the superhero craze...but that's really not true. You know how long the gap was between *Batman and Robin* (which is credited with killing the genre) and *X-Men*? 3 years. 1997-2000. And in those three years, a number of superhero films came out, including *Blade* and *Spawn,* which are of debatable quality in hindsight, but still grossed about $100,000,000 each. 

Superhero movies never really went away.&&They'll probably all get sucked out into space about to die together holding hands like toy story 3, then BAM! Leia Skywalker Mary Poppins them to the safety of a non air-locked door. 
&&Animatrix would like a word&&Finally.

Mystique is an overused character just because she's played by jennifer lawrence&&If she dies in the first five minutes I'll buy the dvd.&&Great time traveling film, an excellent philosophical rebuttal to First Class's rather pessimistic view of humanity, and just tied everything together so well (and a great send-off for the cast and crew of the original X-men films).

Not to mention that it contains one of my favorite pieces of music from a superhero movie - [""Hope""](https://youtu.be/MH4uuWITmgY)&&Was it set two years after Days of Future Past? Honestly asking, I don't remember. Or was it in it's own time line as another commenter suggested? Either way it struck me as being set quite a long time after any of the other films. 

But when all is set and done, you're right that it's mostly a send off for Wolverine. But then again, he's the main character of almost all of the X-men movies anyways. 

But I liked how poignant and tragic it was, and it also communicated the themes of X-men as well as any of the movies, so for me it packs the biggest emotional punch. &&It was Saoirse Ronan.&& “I auditioned for a project and it was between me and another girl who is a far better actress than I am, far better, but I had the followers, so I got the job,” Turner told *Porter,* per [*The Telegraph*](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/08/03/game-throness-sophie-turner-got-job-better-actress-had-followers/)*.* “It’s not right, but it is part of the movie industry now.”

That episode caused me to think about the living hell that guy was in, and I felt like I had a similar experience in my own brain.  It's honestly one of the worst fates I can imagine on anyone ever.

My other main point of contest with this movie is I want the xmen series... To feel finished. This feels like another one off so the overarching xmen Story, vague as it is, probably won't have a satisfying ending. It will just end.

&&Uh, the proper term is killbots, thank you very much.&&Or no one aging in like 30 years?&&Gene Grey you've really made the graaade&&The Emperor protects in every universe &&Yep. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard is a legion of superpowered beings loyal to the throne of the Shi'ar. They're badass and awesome. Edit: If you want a better understanding of them, the comic War of Kings deals with them, as well as the Inhumans.&&If Gladiator shows up, it’ll be a muscular guy in a black suit NAMED Gladiator who doesn’t say a word the whole movie, maybe has blue in his eyes instead of white, and gets taken out by Mystique.


I REALLY hope I’m wrong because I’m going in with high hopes based on the source material.&&In the ultimate switcharoo they got Henry Cavill to play him&&Oh shit, that's the guy from the end of the ""I'm the juggernaut bitch"" video, right?&&“AAAAAAAHH! WHOOOO AAARRRE YOOUUU?!”&&Correct. It’s sarcasm. I just assumed that would be obvious. Sorry &&Atleast Marvel would be able to introduce the Shi’ar via the MCU in a glorious fashion once the Fox acquisition goes through.

They are probably the most powerful alien empire in the comics. Imagine seeing the big three: the Kree, the Skrulls and the Shi’ar on the big screen (complete with the Shi’ar Imperial Guard, who I’m dying to see in a future MCU film).&&That’d be weird considering they’re about to be owned by the same company &&Yes, somewhat. There are different levels of the astral plane, and they are like alternate universes. Humans dream on the lowest tier of the astral plane. &&I'm getting a little stretched too.

But yeah, Mastermind - part of the Hellfire club -- messed with phoenix/jean grey.  That made her go crazy and she became dark phoenix and started doing bad things.&&I mean he summed up the Dark Phoenix arc in a nutshell.

Unless there is a massive plot twist or they drastically change something and potentially piss off the fans, that's the basic gist.&&For real. This is probably exactly how this movie will go &&Days of Future Past reset the timeline essentially, so Last Stand never happened.&&No, ""Jean"" temporarily becomes sane again but the X-Men have to fight some space good guys who are afraid of the stark power of the Phoenix (who also just genocided a whole planet) on the Moon.  At the verge of losing control of herself again she sacrificed herself after an emotional good bye to Cyclops.

It's complicated.&&Just in The Last Stand, but it's not really a set plotline they need to follow&&I though Huge Jackedman doesn't wanna do wolverine anymore. &&Yeah but they never try to Weaponize the Phoenix.  Sure they need it’s help when D’Ken threatens all of creation with M’Kraan Crystal, but after that they let Jean go of her free will.

It isn’t until after Jean loses her mind and destroys a nearby star system do the Shi’ar come after her, and this isn’t to weaponize her, it’s to straight up kill her.  &&That left such a bad taste in my mouth. Actually the whole movie did&&With Storm *and* Cyclops on the team, to boot.  The X-Men's most iconic leaders, taking orders from *Mystique*.   /vomits&&yeah, easier to have someone be like, ""where's raven?""  ""on the run from the law.  we've more pressing matters to concern ourselves with.""

or better yet, don't even mention she exists!

the fact that mystique has been in ALL 6 x-men movies is ridiculous.&&That's generous. &&It's almost as if the writers have no fucking clue how to keep this franchise alive.&&Literally Marvels comic book run right now. Black Panther! In SPACE!! Dr. Strange! In SPACE!!! Ghost Rider! In SPACE!!! Space! IN SPACE!!?!?!!?!?!!?!?!!??&&Also there were a bunch of similar one liners that Toad was supposed to make through the movie that Storm was supposed to be riffing off of, but they were all cut, making the lightning joke have no context. &&They hated that but loved the one we got? Wow. Where do they find these test audiences?&&Yeah I was really disappointed. That totally would be a line that fit in it even if it was Deadpool that said it.&&Made it to Dota 2 though, which is almost as ridiculous. &&Lol turns out you shouldn't put internet memes into your movies.&&Sorry did you mean fan 4 stic?&&How’s your sex life?&&Oh hi, Mark!&&I felt like Apocalypse was very bland, boring and completely wasted amazing characters.

Apocalypse and Psylocke being the big two. Psylocke is so goddamn cool and they did nothing with her.

How many scenes of well known buildings being destroyed do we need to see?&&It's been a long time since I watched X-Men 3, like, more that 10 years, and I don't remember it being *that* terrible. Maybe I should check it again, but it can't be worse than Origins: Wolverine, right?&&Really?  I thought Apocalypse was much worse actually.  We see Magneto lose his family again and kill people as a result of that again. After he's killed a bunch of people and caused billions of dollars in destruction, he's back to being friends with everyone at the end of the story.  The other three Horsemen were underwhelming and didn't really do anything during the movie.  

The Last Stand definitely had some issues, but I was entertained watching it, at the very least.  Apocalypse was just, ugh.&&I though high Hackman deserved a nom for his performance too.

The whole movie was gold.&&> Ser

Someone's a GoT fan&&Quick mafs &&I’m a 28 year old man, and I will not hesitate to admit that I cried like a little bitch when she turned that cross over. It’s the only time I have ever cried in a movie theatre, but the X-men movies were a HUGE part of my childhood, and that moment felt like it was truly the end of an era. I fully agree that they should have ended there. This Dark Phoenix movie just seems unnecessary considering this X-men universe is likely to be scrapped. &&I mean, it was high quality ending, but it's a real downer to know the whole series ends with Xavier's vision for mutant kind essentially failing and mutants being effectively eradicated. Kinda makes it feel like everything the X-Men fought, died and died again for was all meaningless.

That's really my only hope for Dark Pheonix: give us some hope for the future of mutants. Show us at least a glimpse of a world where things don't go to shit. Then I'll be perfectly content closing the book on this franchise.&&Yeah, in the comics they can just keep the xmen separate from the normal stuff anyway, except when they add wolverine or Deadpool to random books. They never really get to satisfactory place of balancing people in universe loving Captain America or the Fantastic Four, but hating mutants for, uh, some reason? Powers given by drugs or accidents are fine, but powers people are born with are scary and need to be rounded up in literal death camps or something.

There is a reason why the best xmen stories are in alternate universes or time lines. And why shit like avengers vs x or the like are garbage.&&You are forgiven. Carry on. &&Yeah I thought that was pretty clear, if anything the above commenter is a heathen for thinking your list desperately needed Interstellar but NOT also Inception. &&I would argue the credit still goes to X-Men. No one was really paying attention to super hero movies much at the time. They we're mostly fanservice for comic book fans. X-Men stood out a lot and got everyone's attention. Then when Spider-Man was released that sealed the deal for larger audiences.&&I’m Mary Poppins y’all!&&Big agree, I just wished they let Magneto kill her in DOFP.  Would have saved the timeline to.  &&I wish it was that early, funeral scene from the trailer probably happens midway in the movie.  &&I loved it for its sheer ambition and emotion: On paper, this movie seems like a colossal mess waiting to happen but it knows its thematic and character goals almost down to a T. Also, up until *Logan*, this was easily the darkest the franchise ever got. The Sentinels were the stuff of nightmares.&&Oh man I love ""Hope""! That scene gets me. That movie gets me. It really was the perfect sequel to First Class. Too bad they ended that ""trilogy"" with a meh film&&I think there's 5 years between DoFP and Logan. But I've heard theories that Logan takes place in the original timeline, without the alterations in DoFP.&&This is where things get a little muddy. I think James Mangold really did want to make an “alternate universe” movie, which wasn’t tied down by all the baggage from “canon” X Men. And more power to him. Problem is, you’re casting the same actors that we’ve come to know over the last 20 years. Pair that with the fact that the movie was framed as a sendoff to a longstanding character (and actor), and most audiences assume that everything is tied together - at least the general audience, which isn’t as familiar with all the weird “alternate takes” that comics often do. 

Fans and the press started pressing Mangold for more details, and, likely feeling backed into a corner, James relented that yes, Logan takes place after DOFP in 2029 (6 year gap, not 2, sorry). I just wish he’d stayed the course and maintained that this was a whole ‘nother thing - mainly because, if you refuse to do more “present day” stories with the original cast, then DOFP is the perfect sendoff to the series. Tying everything up in such a *great*, well thought out bow and then go “yeah no, they all died, you didn’t get to see it, and Charles killed them himself” just feels cheap.

Small nitpick: tying it in together does even more damage because the whole “no mutants born in 20 years” thing falls apart. There’s tons of kids running around the X Mansion in Future Past. &&Holy shit I didn't know I wanted this until right now, and I'm one of the 10 people in the world who actually likes Sophie Turner! Now I'm praying Saoirse is cast in the MCU version of the xmen! &&....wow.&&Perhaps a vocal sautee&&I'm not how that's an..

Say that again... &&Sorry did you mean fan 4 skin?&&sorry did YOU mean fanT 4 stic?&&Haha. What a story Mark!&&Is it weird that I felt nothing when that happened? All that destruction for some reason felt smaller than what Magneto did to the baseball stadium and the White House in Days of Future Past. &&Apocalypse, despite being iconic in the comics, is a really boring character from a narrative standpoint.  He's literally just 'ancient evil awakens to take over the world.'&&I think it was worse just because of the promise of X-Men and X2. It was just such a bizarrely directed movie that didn't hit any of the beats it wanted or needed to. I spent the whole movie expecting Cyclops to show back up at a pivotal moment because the way he was killed off felt like a setup, which means when we're in the denouement and they just show his headstone you just get this, ""oh"" feeling. Which kind of sums up my feelings about it. At least X-Men: Origins - Wolverine you can ignore. X3 means there was just no real satisfying conclusion to that group of characters (though DoFP made up for some of it).&&It's a movie where the two plotlines are an all-powerful mutant running amok and a mutant that stops mutant powers, and they *never meet.*&&X-Men 3 is just as bad as people say. It's BAAAAAAD. They do terrible things with all the characters, the plot goes to stupid places... The only thing I liked was when Wolverine kills Jean... but even then I was like ""This doesn't make sense, she can just vaporise him, but at least the movie is gonna end now"".&&You watch your mouth. I loved Origins, just not the Deadpool mess. Liev Schreiber was awesome&&>I don't remember it being *that* terrible. 

It really *really* is. &&I think people get confused, because while Wolverine Origins was a CGI nightmare and it did disastrous things with beloved characters, it was still a really decent movie with some great action sequences and a pretty good plot. 

Last Stand was both a poor movie *and* a poor adaptation of characters and plot, same with Apocalypse. I caught the final battle on FX the other night and I couldn't even believe my eyes lol&&I didn’t understand why they fabricated a new family for magneto just to kill them and make him evil. I guess they didn’t watch days of future past, he was already evil at the end of that one. Something about a stadium and propping it over the White House, didn’t he give a big televised speech on national tv about how evil he was? Next movie all that is forgotten and he works in a steel mill? &&Dude that fucking scene where Magneto killed the group that murdered his family with the necklace was better than Last Stand alone.&&Yeah the ending of Apocalypse was a poopy diaper. We're just supposed to forgive Magneto for nearly destroying the entire planet... AGAIN?!? Nah Charles, you gotta freeze his mind for the rest of eternity dude, what u doin? &&Not to mention they totally misused apcolypse (the villain) and a great actor. &&IMO, The Last Stand was kind of infuriating, while Apocalype was annoyingly cheesy. TLS pissed me off for killing off three major x-men characters (though Jean's death was sort of inevitable) in a way that felt so wrong to me.  &&Apocalypse himself was the worst part of the movie.  You could have just used superimposed clips from the cartoon of him and it would have been 10x better.&&For me it was the Prof. X scene that brought me to tears.&&Since time travel was introduced, Logan is only one version of the future.

So far we've seen three futures. Logan, Future past, and Deadpool 2 Cable. &&Biggest problem for me is that I can't buy that people would even care about super heroes in a world filled with mutants.

Basically every other person can tear a rip in the fabric of the universe, and you want me to believe that people would give a shit about Iron Man?&&Batman V Superman!!&&It’s not a theory Charles and Logan confirm it talking about the Statue of Liberty from the first movie &&Something something, blood for the blood god.

Edit: Jesus christ people, the corn flakes jokes.&&Beware the mutant, the heretic and the redditor.&&A Starjammers/GotG crossover movie would be the cinematic event of the decade. &&What if they just remade the X-men 90s cartoon!  They won't though, and I'm fearful this movie will be horrible.&&Could be a bit much to fit into one movie, but it certainly opens up more possibilities.&&There are *a lot* of almost sex dreams.

I bet the aliens that live on the higher planes and can go into them stop them just to fuck with people. &&Psh speak for yourself. I just woke up from some super awesome dreams.&&I think I deliberately try to ignore the existence of that movie sometimes.&&Which ends in a happier timeline than Logan.

They really play it fast and loose with continuity.&&He doesn't want the spotlight and wants to pass it on to the new kids.

If he's in this movie at all and it's not handled properly, it would overshadow anything else. Just like it did in Apocalypse.&&He's in DP2 as well. Pretty funny scene too.&&But at least people *like* Wolverine. I've never heard of anyone that likes Mystique. &&I mean ghost rider in space sounds freaking awesome.&&**SORRY DID YOU MEAN FAN 4 STIC?**&&Miles Teller stretched.&&It's boring because you already knew the world wasn't going to end. The only important character that died did off screen.

When the stakes are so high losing means the end of the entire franchise, you know they can't lose.

Also the last fight was just CGI vs CGI.&&He has a cool origin at least and his powers come from both mutations and alien technology.

They didn't even have him manipulate his size in the real world to have the xmen have to fight this gigantic monster. Instead it was just everyone shooting CGI at each other.&&I kept expecting the professor to come back too. Figured they were just banished to the shadow realm or something.&&The director was too busy doing coke and being who his is to bother to direct past competency. &&Holy shit I never realized that &&...damn, that's amazing now that you've pointed it out.&&Damnit! You're right! They should have thrown that kid at Jean!&&I like how his shirt vaporized but his pants didn't.&&Kelsey grammer as Beast was good, unfortunate that was his debut.&&Juggernaut smashing through walls chasing Kitty while she phased through them was good fun. 

The movie sucked though. &&I always interpreted it as she couldn't bring herself to vaporize him. There was lingering anger at Charles for what he did to rein in her power, but nothin' but love for Logan &&Right? Holy shit, Sabertooth was actually compelling for once. &&Liev is awesome. They did fucked up Gambit tho, even considering I didn't mind Kitch playing him.&&Sabertooth was the saving grace of that movie, I really enjoyed his interactions with Wolverine. I kept waiting for him to show back up in Logan, but alas.&&Cleaning that up in Deadpool 2 is one of the funniest meta jokes I’ve ever seen.&&I thought Origins was edited like a homemade movie, with lots of unnecessary and weird cuts, like Gambit gets hit in a face on the ground and then jumps off the roof a minute later.

Also, they ruined the only X-Men film with Gambit finally in it.&&I kind of wish nerd fans could separate film quality and adaptation accuracy. Yeah sure sorry Deadpool was turned into some weird amalgamation mutant thing, but was the movie any good??&&at this point I'd say the X-Men franchise just can't stick the landing. It's amazing they got TWO cracks at making trilogies, and they completely fumbled the third installment BOTH times. 

I guess they actually got to make three trilogies, and the only one that really worked out was the Wolverine one. &&Any Fassbender Magneto scene where he just murders shit is better than most entire movies&&Tbf that's pretty comic book accurate.  The amount of times Magneto has switched sides is too damn high.  Him and Dr. Doom.&&I thought the way they shot Jean goin' full-on berserker was pretty cool tho tbh &&“It wasn’t me!...”&&True, but none of those futures were bright, and the DoFP future was erased, as was Cable's I think? It's really more of a personal thing, but I just wish we'd gotten at least one ending that indicated a happier future. Maybe not a utopia of civility between mutants and humans, but a brighter tomorrow to imply Xavier's efforts were paying off to some degree.&&Ah, I see you're a man of bloodshed too.&&Milk for the khorne flakes &&Years ago I did a deep dive and successfully isolated the .wav file that plays a very specific Chaos Space Marine voice line; one of the random ones in the WH40k game that plays when you click the mob:

""It is as though a thousand mouths cry out in pain.""

It makes me laugh to this day, that that is the equivalent of Warcraft Orc Peon's ""What you want?""&&I'd like corsair to be smooth compared to quill's quippiness&&People are familiar with Cyclops, so tossing is father in for a little bit relatable stuff wouldn't be so far off. Corsair is directly involved in the comics and the Animated Series.&&Man, *fuck* those aliens!&&they literally wrote and produced a multimillion dollar film to do just that thing&&They really should just pass it off with a line or three of dialogue and leave him out of the franchise until enough time and plot has passed that they can reasonably recast him.

For instance - 

**Hank:** ""Logan won't be joining us.  We had an ... argument-""  

**Xavier:** ""Which resulted in the destruction of half the north wing of my school.""  

**Hank:** ""To make a long story short, he stormed off and said he was going on a three year drunk to cool off.  I don't expect he was exaggerating.""&&I loved Mystique in the comics and cartoon. I wasn't crazy about her in the first movies mainly because a big reason I liked her was her connection to Rogue, which they replaced with my least favorite X-Men character...

Current Mystique is a terrible character who makes no sense coming from a comic fan perspective, but even laymen have to be wondering why the universe revolves around her by now. It's gotten worse with every movie.

Xavier's surrogate sister, what?

Leader of the iconic X-Men team, WHAT? &&I liked original Mystique... Might or might not have been part of my, uh... Sexual awakening. 


... Might. It was might. &&[Ghost rider in space is raising baby Thanos.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2099/2991/products/STL096904_530x@2x.jpg?v=1532502782)&&[deleted]&&Fan Foreskin?&&WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME?!? &&Fant 4 Stic&&Are you stretching or are you dragging???&&There's also the entire aspect that apocalypse is shown to be so powerful, yet never uses his full strength when fighting against the people trying to stop him. Like dude you've shown you can just kill people with a thought, why do you give them a fighting chance?

It's a classic case of making your villain too powerful for the good guys to defeat so you have to make him be inconsistent with how he expresses his power to give anyone a chance. Overall it just makes you lose your immersion. 

Plus there's a good portion of that movie where I forgot there was even a bad guy. I forgot the film existed pretty quickly after watching it too and actually regretted spending money to see it. It's nowhere near as good as x-men days of future past and is even worse than x-men origins wolverine. 

At least x-men last stand was enjoyable and had a good balance of the bad guy being a huge threat yet still capable of being defeated. You didn't get a sense of jean grey being wishy washy for the sake of prolonging the story and giving the x-men a chance. I hope that's something they can replicate in this new movie. If Jean Grey becomes another Apocalypse where she willingly spares every main character yet vaporises all side characters in a second then I'll lose interest in this new generation of x-men completely.&&
>Also the last fight was just CGI vs CGI.

That's true of at least 90% of comic book movies, and I hate it. 
&&If I remember right, he ""comes back"" in an after credits scene. 

They have a throwaway lesson earlier in the movie about testing the consciousness of people in comas (or something, it's been a while since I've watched the movie).

Not really. It was all downhill from the intro montage.&&But origins and wolverine was bad only logan was good&&*My parents were from Dusseldorf.*

OK. LET'S GO.&&>Any Fassbender Magneto scene ~~where he just murders shit~~ is better than most entire movies

&&I want an entire movie of magneto just hunting down nazis and being awesome.  Inglorious bastards redo...now with magneto &&The best thing the Ultimate comics did was having him proportionately dealt  with when he went too far.&&Magneto's main draw for me (and all my favorite villains, really) is that his ultimate goal is more or less the same as the good guys - he just chooses the severe and uncompromising route instead of the patient and diplomatic method. 

Villains like this always have excellent opportunities to work with the good guys and be ""forgiven"" because their goals often align, even if their methods don't. Both sides WANT to work with each other and WANT the other side to just ""see logic"" but they are on opposite sides of the same coin. 

It's very political, if you think of it - very similar to how two opposing political parties can want the same outcome but their methods are so wildly different and frankly incompatible. Someone caught in the middle can go mad trying to figure out why neither side can just put themselves in the other side's shoes. Not very fun in real life but it makes a fantastic fiction. &&His name is Dr. Doom, for Christ’s sake! Get the hint super heroes!&&Well Dr. Doom isn’t a villain, so it makes sense for him. He doesn’t seek power for selfish reasons. He seeks power to save humanity from itself, it’s an entirely noble and altruistic motivation. When Bast, the Wakandan panther god and Black Panther’s patron, looked into his heart, Bast found his intentions to be pure.

Dr. Doom is lawful good. &&Meh.  When Khorne demands.  Which is always.&&#BUTTER

With how powerful Apocalypse is there were no other options.  The X-Men cannot kill him.  They can only foil whatever his plan is causing him to retreat and regroup only to be back down the road trying something new.

It was clear early on in the movie that Jean was going to go Phoenix, though.  They foreshadowed it.  &&This is why the Daredevil show was a breath of fresh air when it came out.&&I hate when it is just various beams being shot its so boring.

","The Matrix. I had an afternoon to kill during buisness trip to Melbourne. I think it was release week and I didnt know anything about it. Anyhow I watched the movie and felt realy pumped at seeing such a great flick - I couldn't wait to tell my friends about it. 

I walked out of the cinema into a street full of people heading home from work or whatever. It was like I walked into the movie. That moment was probably the most surreal movie reflection I had ever had.&&Dark City got me that 17 years after its release, when I first watched it.&&A good film should make you forget you're in a movie theatre&&The Matrix and Wall-E both did this to me, absolutely amazing worlds in both&&Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. On my better days, I am glad my mistakes will forever remain as mistakes. On the longer nights where my thoughts run themselves ragged, I wish I could forget. And maybe that painful subconsciousness that keeps bringing Joel and Clem back together could also work a little magic on me.&&Saving Private Ryan. It’s the only movie I’ve ever been to where when everyone left, it was silent. Completely silent. No one spoke. We all walked to our cars and some of us just sat there. Me included. I don’t know if I’d call it a “high”. But we were definitely shook. &&Blade Runner 2049.

The original is one of my favorite movies of all time. Was very apprehensive going in, just because of the amount of time that had passed since the first one, and didn't feel that a sequel was needed. 

All that being said, I was just utterly blown away by the story, the characters, the imagery, and the questions posed by the film. &&Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) did this for me. After the movie had ended, I just remember sitting in the theater feeling like my universe had been displaced. &&Mulholland Drive&&The Truman Show&&Whiplash blew me away&&Fight Club. I exited the theater, went to the Subway next door, bought a drink and just sat and thought about it for a while. The movie theater is about 30 minutes to an hour's drive away from my home, depending on traffic. It was late. I had work the next day. Didn't matter. Bought the ticket and watched it again. I've never done that before or since.

&#x200B;

Two nights later I saw Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead. Dammit, that was a good time for movies.&&After seeing Apocalypse Now with my Dad when I was around 15.  I felt as though I had gone into the movie a child and come out an adult. &&The Grand Budapest Hotel left me with this contented and happy feeling the first time I watched it. Can’t really say that about any other movie. &&Totally after watching Ex Machina &&The Prestige. Holy heck. &&Y e s. Inception did this to me and still does every time I re-watch it. Kind of miss the high it gave, because I've yet to have as strong an emotion post-movie since. &&Fellowship of the Ring&&Her did it for me, the whole film was almost dream like&&Arrival had a huge impact on me.&&Pan’s Labyrinth was the biggest one of these for me. &&Spirited Away was one of the movies which literally stopped the time around me. It shook me to the core. &&Children of Men. Plus Reqiuem for a Dream (for personal reasons).&&The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. After watching it, I just sat down there and thought about the true meaning of life. &&Blade Runner 2049 in IMAX.  I left speechless and couldn’t talk for a bit, I was almost tearing up.  The visuals and sound were overwhelming. My fiancé.... she said it was aight. &&The first Matrix movie. 

Bear in mind that the trailers had all pushed the mystery of the Matrix without revealing it, so going in everyone was talking about what the matrix could be. The line ""no one can be told what the Matrix is"" was featured heavily in the trailer. I remember walking out of the theatre thinking to myself.... Well, now I know! &&I had an existential crisis when I was younger and the first Matrix movie was in theaters. My girlfriend at the time thought it would be good for me to go see a movie and get out for a bit. We saw the Matrix and I walked out of there contemplating reality and if we were really possibly in the matrix. It fucked me up for a few days. &&Had a whole crew of like 15 people who went into 'Memento' with no idea of what we were in for. It ended and we were all silent for like 25 seconds. The entire theater was like that. A few hushed comments. Then all of a sudden my entire group just all broke into a million comments, questions, and exclamations. It was awesome. We were all talking to complete strangers in the theater. We all went to a cafe/bar and debated until 2AM. That was my introduction to this fancy new director no one had ever heard of, Christopher Nolan.&&‘Synecdoche, New York’, ‘Her’, and ‘Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind’.&&Se7en did that to me. After that ending I thought, “But there are still two sins left. Wait a minute... No way!”&&Memento broke my brain for a while. The gf and I went outside and sat on the curb for about a half hour and didn't talk. Just processed what we saw. Also, Donnie Darko. After watching that for the first time I had to go to work. I had the most serene, peaceful feeling all shift. It was amazing. &&There’s this movie called 50/50.

When i watched that movie I couldn’t get it off of my head for days..it was that touching to me.&&Blade Runner&&Interstellar &&Black Swan&&Grave of the Fireflies. My boyfriend and I just had to hold each other and talk it out.&&The impression I got from watching Call Me By Your Name last year was incredibly strong. I watched it in the dead of winter and the sweet, warm Italian summer was so beautiful in my mind. I had a movie 'high' for at least the entire next day.. &&After my first time watching the Departed I was blown away. &&Bladerunner 2049 and Logan both had me this way. Those two are masterpieces. &&Annihilation, it felt like a total out of body experience &&I had this feeling with Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies lately, The Florida Project - Damn that movie tucked on many emotions...&&
Donnie Darko. I had to sit for hours trying to digest what I just watched&&Fight club for me&&Cloud Atlas I was thinking about for months after I saw it in IMAX and watched it multiple times when it came out on dvd. Such a emotionally charged movie.&&Artificial Intelligence&&Mad Max: Fury Road. The only time I've been lost for words as I've left the cinema.&&For me it was, the fountain &&Moonlight, Children of Men, and The Witch. All stuck with me for weeks&&I know it’s widely derided on account of its relatively anticlimactic ending, but Contact left a 16 year old me absolutely reeling.&&The Game with michael douglas&&Life of Pi. For a while, the real world didn’t seem like it existed when I was in the cinema.&&Strangely, John Carter did that for me. Mostly because I was having a really rough week, and just went to the movies to indulge in popcorn, nachos, and some noise to drown out how everything sucked. It's nice to be reminded that there are still other worlds out there yet to explore, and a lot of other possibilities in life. &&Jurassic Park. Went to see it on release weekend in 93 (in the UK) and I wandered around shellshocked for an hour afterwards. 

It was at the old UCI cinema in the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, Dudley - which was a new (ish) mall around that time and the state of euphoria was intense...&&Her&&Big Fish&&Into the Wild. Didn't watch in cinema as it was not released in my country but felt absolutely legendary and absorbed watching it on home cinema. That ending music still feels great when I remember it.&&Annihilation did this for me 

One of the best sci-fi movies in the last decade &&Probably sounds corny and fuck I’m old, but: Fist Of The North Star (Anime movie, not movie. That live action movie sucked ass). &&The Adjustment Bureau. I left the cinema and it was nearly midnight. There weren’t many people around at all and it was eerily quiet because of the time of night. But then suddenly, a guy walks past me and towards the entrance of the cinema wearing a fedora. I felt weird as it is after seeing the film but seeing him added a whole other level of anxiety.&&American Beauty&&2001 a space odyssey.

The movie changed my entire conceptualization of existence.

It is a movie that touched upon so many futuristic themes it transcends generations. 

Although by todays standard the effects are very dated, I feel that the cinematography of the entire movie really capitulated the eerie nature of space and exploration. 

Furthermore, the overt presentation of evolution and technology masterfully hides the covert themes of god, existence and the afterlife.

People mentioned interstellar which I agree is a total head trip, but upon a proper viewing of space odyssey you’ll find that many of the themes are paralleled. 
   &&Dunkirk did this to me. I was the only one in the theater when I watched it, too, which was nice.&&Under The Skin had me mildly tripping for like two weeks.&&Actually, I felt that way after Watchman, but mostly in reaction to experiencing the comic on the big screen. The adaptation has problems, but it captured something I had pondered for a long time. If Superman were real, should he really be going around saving individual humans? He ought to be focused on creating peace. And what better way to do it then to make himself the common enemy for everyone to rally against? That's one way in which the movie improves the book. It points out that Veidt is *right* and has Manhattan agree to take the blame and maintain the charade.&&Call me by your name. It was my first time seeing a relationship in a theater screen that could have been mine. I was shook when I left the theater. Is that how straight people felt after romantic movies every time? Representation is so important.&&Avatar &&Yes! I get it all the time when I just wanna sit there and soak it in. Feel it the most in emptier theaters. I have felt it the most for Spotlight, Whiplash, Coco, and About Time. &&First time I watched fight club I literally had to walk out of my house into the dark of night and just ponder what the fuck just happened. Some movies have done that to me but that was by far the most ""eaphoria"" (I guess I would call it) that I've ever felt. &&Happens to me a lot. Since you mention it, Arrival did that for me. An old one I recently watched that did it was Synecdoche, New York. Most recent theatre visit was probably BlacKkKlansman, not for any kind of surreal feeling per se, but more just because it sparked a desire for conversation. It also helped that I saw it in Colorado Springs which did add a certain level of surrealism.&&Synecdoche New York has done that to me. &&After I saw Arrival, I just sat in my seat and cried for awhile.  Powerful movie.&&Amelie&&Infinity War. The mad bastards actually did it&&I came out from the theatre after watching Threads, and it was really hard to adjust to the sun shining, green leaves, birds chirping, people laughing and just going about their business. 
We really did think that nuclear war was inevitable, back then. 

Edit: perhaps this is more of a movie low?&&Not a movie but Black Mirror's Junipero episode&&The Diving Bell & The Butterfly&&It has been years since I saw this film but I remember Frances Ha left me feeling absolutely great. Same goes for Inside Llewyn Davis.

I suppose I’m a sucker for smart endings!&&I got that feeling when I watched *Up* in the theater. It was a deeply moving, exhilarating film to watch on the big screen. Granted, I was also high on mushrooms at the time, but I'm pretty sure I would have felt the same regardless.&&[deleted]&&Koyaanisqatsi&&Apocalypto.  &&When my husband and I saw Vanilla Sky, we walked out and drove home in silence. It left me feeling strangely detached from the world for a while. I wasn’t sure if I hated it, I wasn’t sure if I loved it, but I was sure it was both. Weird. &&For me it was Birdman. Had a psych essay due the next morning at 8am; was halfway through doing it but had no inspiration and motivation. So I popped on Birdman at midnight since I heard good things about it. Something about the movie just resonated with me, and I feel like i was in another world after the movie and was so much more enlightened. I felt so energised although it was probably 2/3am; continued my essay after the movie, submitted it and got an A! Also immediately after the movie I KNEW it was going to win BP, as opposed to my initial choice 'Whiplash'.&&La La Land. I was so enchanted. I wanted to watch it again and again for the first time to keep the feeling alive. &&Hereditary, and The Hangover

Different kinds of highs obviously.&&The Fountain. Every time I see it. &&""Into the Wild"" did this to me, stayed awake that night and thought about real meaning of happiness and life, and how it should be lived. &&Your Name.

Inception

The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&&I saw 2001: a space odyssey for the first time last week and it changed my life&&The Butterfly Effect, I was fascinated by chaos theory afterwards &&Sorry To Bother You &&ADAPTATION blew me away. The screenplay, direction and acting performances were top notch. One of the best movies I ever watched. &&I watched City of God in a 200 seat cinema that was almost empty and it was hard to really even construct an opinion on it for some time, I was thoroughly blown away.&&Annahilation.  That movie was a lot to digest.  The imagry, the music, the ending, just so much to process.  Tried to give the soundtrack a good listen, but one of the tracks is so foreign sounding that it sets me on edge every time.  Great experience.  Glad I got to see it in theaters.&&The end of ""The Mist"". I was literally so angry confused and sad. Iv never felt so ""wtf"" in my life. So kinda high.&&The Dark Knight.


Its ending was pure enthralling. &&Hell yeah mate, thanks for reminding me.

First time was The Great Escape as a child.

Then Pulp Fiction at 16.

Last time it happened was Donny Darko....

Wow, it's been a while :( &&Got this after watching Her. Walked around in the snow for an hour thinking about life and relationships&&Fight Club blew my mind in the theater. &&Gone Girl fucked up a friend of mine in a big way.  I've never felt so euphoric as I did coming out of HTTYD.

Guardians of the Galaxy 2 was a tough one for me.  I was raised by my stepdad and never really got along with him.  I was a pisspoor excuse for a son and used ""You're not my real dad"" against him an unfair amount of times.

It took he and I a very long time to really see eye to eye.  And I didnt learn all the little things he did to be a good father for me until long after.

He did all these weird little things to be strong for me so I knew I could count on him even though I really didnt deserve a lot of it.

Guardians 2 made all of that come crashing down on me and made me profoundly happy-sad for a long time after I stopped watching it.&&The movie that affected me the most and just left me completely awestruck at the theater was Boogie Nights. I remember just being astonished by it. It came out in the late 90s and I had never seen anything like it before. The ending where Dirk is just sitting on the drug dealers couch staring off Into the distance.... that was me. 
&&Blade Runner 2049, Arrival and Interstellar totally gave me this otherworldly feeling. 
There seems to be a pattern here. &&I walked out of the original Matrix in 1999 to fireworks.

I was across the river from Louisville KY, and every spring they have a fireworks show to start the Kentucky Derby season.

We sat on the hood of my car, leaned back against the windshield and talked about the movie for the next 30-45 minutes.  

Was good.&&I thought it was just me that got this! I had it big time after Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri most recently I think.&&Arrival did this to me
How to train your dragon soundtrack brings me back every time &&Der Untergang. I'm German. 

Rarely felt so connected to this horrible part of our history. A weird mixture of dread, guilt and relief that this time is over. Definitely needed a bit to work through these emotions and come back to the present.

Even though these feelings weren't pleasant ones it was an amazing experience.  &&Yes. For Mad Max: Fury Road. Had to just sit in my car for a little while after. &&Happened to me when I saw the original Matrix in the theater.  I was a teenager. &&Cloud Atlas affected me to the extent that it felt like my brain had been altered, in a good way. The definition of great art to me is something that makes you see the world differently.&&Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me

Under The Skin&&Hereditary for me too, sat for like 5 minutes after the movie wondering what the fuck was my life&&Annihilation &&Looks like Matrix is back on the menu boys!

Seriously, I'm going to have to rewatch tonight.&&[deleted]&&and it was shot in sydney so u got a real surreal experience. spez: vr doh&&This movie fucked me up good when I first saw it. 

Probably the first time I really understood Plato’s allegory on the Cave. I was a teenager when it came out and it really did a number on how I felt about the firmness of my faith in perception. 

It was so groundbreaking at the time, and that’s kind of why the next two are looked down on I think. You can’t re-live that kind of experience. &&When you walked out onto the street from the theater and put your sunglasses on, did Rage Against The Machine start playing in your head as you started walking off?  😎 &&I saw it first on business as well, I had zero expectations  and just needed to kill some time.

I saw it in an inner city theater; primarily African Americans and the entire crowd was raucous and disruptive until the first scene where Trinity is spun around and kicks the guy.

Someone yell “that shit is TIGHT!”; it was on, the entire crowd went from disruptive and barely paying attention to just going crazy when they were meant to go crazy.  It was so much fun, with people jumping out of their chairs.

It’s the only movie I left high fiving people. It was the only movie I left questioning my reality.

I pretend they ended it there, seeing the second movie at midnight was one of the biggest let downs I’ve had in a theater.

&&This. If I had to pick one, The Matrix would be it!&&For next 4 days I was thinking about what is matrix.

For next few months I was wondering if I was in the matrix.

Crazy movie.&&I loved this movie in theaters but the original cut had a voiceover at the beginning that completely spoils the movie. Such a tragic case of not trusting your audience. Still a great film though. &&Dark City is really something. It gets me every time.

Check out Mr.Nobody.&&So true. And makes you want to stay after the credit rolls.&&What’s so upsetting is that the audience can sometimes be obnoxious and remind you that you’re in the theatre. This was the case when I saw hereditary and they kept laughing..&&Matrix for sure. It was just something COMPLETELY different from anything at that time. Changed what I thought a movie could be.&&Can't believe I had to scroll down so far to see The Matrix mentioned.

That was an incredible movie to see all those years ago for the first time. I came out of the cinema after that first viewing wanting to skip down the street! &&Wall-E did it for me too and it was especially effective because I was in my “cartoons are for kids” teenage years and my mom sent me to take my little brother to go watch it but I walked out of that theater a new person.&&Wall-E is such an incredible film. One of the best animated films.&&I saw this in theaters alone during a matinee showing and by the time the credits were going I was sobbing. The only other people in the theater - two little old ladies - came up to me to see if I was okay.

Man, that was so long ago but I remember it so clearly. Amazing movie.&&I love this movie. It's the type of movie I have to watch it by myself, though. And I get exactly what you are saying. Depending on the day, different things about it speak to me and I think about the movie often&&Joel:
Wait.

Clementine:
Why?

Joel:
I don't know. Just wait... for a while.&&There's one subtle scene from Eternal Sunshine that makes me ball my eyes out. In the waiting room where there's an older woman with her deceased dogs belongings waiting to have the memories erased. Gets me every time...&&That movie made me realise how great an actor Jim Carrey is. Having only seen him in Ace Ventura, The Mask, Bruce Almighty etc. I was blown away by how well he played such a stoic character.&&Was looking to see if anyone else said this. Agreed, watched this in a film class in college and left the class going ""wow..""&&You have to forgive yourself, my dude. &&It is my favorite love story. It fucking speaks to me. i can fucking relate so much to it. Plus the acting of both lead actors was perfect.&&I'm truly fighting the urge to watch this post-breakup. It's hits too close to home and pricks like thorns.&&Without a doubt one of my favorite movies and made me look back on my failed romances in a different light. The hard times sucked and you want to forget them but their worth it for the good memories and the shit one's are important for you to grow as a person.&&This feeling is basically Charlie Kaufman's trademark.&&It's been ages, but Schindlers List was that way too. Very grim, no one was laughing or chatting walking out of that one.&&That knife scene... mad&&I am an old man.  I am a Vietnam era veteran that by the grace of God never had to serve in a combat area. 
 Coming out of that movie surrounded by a bunch of old men, most of us trying hard not to break down and cry in front of each other, was surreal, it changed my heart in ways I can not describe.  

I'm silently crying as I write this, afraid my wife will wake up and think I am silly.  My heart just breaks that we old men send the young men into battle because we can't agree. 

&&I heard some veterans couldn't watch the opening scene because it was too vicersal and realistic&&Saving Private Ryan is by far one of if not the best movie of all time in my opinion. At the very least it’s the most immersive film for sure. That D-Day scene was so well done that it’s basically impossible to not feel the absolute chaos and helplessness of the soldiers.&&I cried watching the first scene,  the beach at Normandy.  Spoke with my mother a few days after telling her how much that movie affected me (since my grandfather was a WWII vet) she told me HE was on that beach too during that slaughter. I lost it all over again. How that man survived as a Scout in WWII and remained sane is a miracle.  He passed a couple years ago at 92, my hero forever. &&I went to this movie with my grandpa who also stormed a beach in WWII. He cried the whole time - he never cries. Afterward another movie goer asked him if he was a veteran. My grandpa just nodded. The man shook his hand, thanked him, and suddenly everyone else in the theatre was crowding around him to do the same thing. He was suddenly a hero and a celebrity. It was amazing. I’m so proud of both of my grandfathers for their service. But, I can never watch Saving Private Ryan again.&&I was living in France when that came out and went to see it with some French classmates. The French LOVE to stick it to America whenever they can, but after the movie they were all like “thanks”. 

Also when we got back to my dorm I ran into another exchange student from Germany and it was so weird to think that 50 years ago it would have been him and I trying to kill each other. &&As a young lad, I remember Glory having this same effect.&&Spielberg is good at making this happen. I was 13 when I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark in the theater. I went back to see it 8 times. I was definitely getting a high everytime.&&And the sound! Oh man the music and sound effects blasting from the theater speakers really moved me. I really wish I had seen it more than once in theaters.&&That film was a breath of fresh air for me. I am amazed it got away with itself in this current hollywood climate.&&Saw that one in IMAX. 
Left me absolutely speechless. 
The visuals.
And mainly the soundtrack.
That heavy synth roaring in your ears. It was blissfully awesome to a hardcore scifi buff like me. (Obviously i understood what was going on)

However, The scenes at Wallace Corp is hands down my favorite part of the whole movie. With those amber rippling lights, and the powerfull throat-humming....THAT part gave me the best ""movie high"" I have ever gotten in my 24 years of life....absolutely hypnotic...

My only regret, is not seeing it a second time...&&YES. 

I went out of the theatre with my mouth open and wasnt able to speak to my friends for about ten minutes. &&2049 is by far the best film I have seen this year, very well made and good references back to the original.&&Finally watched it last week. I'm SO incredibly disappointed that I never saw it in theaters. It blew me away. Even on my shitty TV speakers the sound was incredible. I can only imagine what imax was like.&&That movie is an absolute masterpiece in every sense. Still get a movie high just thinking about it. &&[deleted]&&Great movie. It’s beautiful cinematography and the story took its a time to develop the new characters their motivations. This movie deserves more acknowledgement then it received. &&A silent voice did the same for me. Both these movies evoke so much emotion &&I didn't see that in theatre but me and my SO watched it on my HT, after seeing some screenshots of it. That movie totally destroyed us emotionally. What a roller coaster ride of emotions.

I would also highly recommend 5 Centimeters Per Second, done by the same studio. Gives me such a feeling of nostalgia and a swarm of emotions, which is weird because I'm not even from Japan.&&Ah. When the lady on stage passes out! My mind was totally scrambled eggs at that point&&The diner scene jfc. 
How to do horror in broad daylight. &&The Club Silencio scene remains one of my all time favorite in all of cinema. 

Rebekah del Rios voice, Laura Harring and Naomi Watts crying, what the scene represents - It's beautiful and haunting.  &&Came here to say the same!
Afterwards I felt a bit paranoia and had this feeling my life might not be real at all, or at least not real in the way I thought it was. &&Came here for this exact film. 

A lot of Jim Carrey films have absolutely blown my mind.&&That movie was my tempo&&Same. Made me rethink my life. What am I sacrificing today in order to be great? Or do I not have the guts to put in the time to be great? &&That movie hit me in the face right out of nowhere. It’s for sure in my top five. The ending was troubling and amazing. &&Damien is a true genius. &&Oh man, that movie&&Same here. I watched it on a flight not knowing much about it. I kept pausing it to tell my friend sitting next to me, “you have to watch this movie!”&&I watched in on a flight. When it ended I just sat, unsure of what I was supposed to do. 
It's the only movie that I've sat and watched the entire credits because of how in awe I was at the ending. &&Movie hit me at a transition from highschool to College and absolutely changed my perception in life, like I just woke up to reality.&&'99 right? Yeah great year! &&I was under 16 at the time so I couldn't legally see it in a theatre, and a stupid teacher of mine said she hated it because it was too violent, so I didn't go in after buying a ticket for another movie, like a friend did. When I finally got to see it, on VHS, I had the same reaction as you : paused, flabbergasted, hit rewind and watched it again.

Edit: couldn't, syntax&&Fight Club and Gone Girl both leave me in an existential funk for awhile. Fincher really knows how to mess with my head.&&Yes&&I watched that for the fist time a couple of years ago, the redux version(almost 3.5 hours). Started watching at 11pm so by the time it finished it it was around 3am. I was in an absolute trance by the end of it, and coming back to reality took a while.&&Apocalypse Now is still my favorite movie of all time. The more I watch the more meaning I find in the scenes-it's one of those pieces of entertainment where everything feels intentional and carefully written. 

I find it almost impossible to watch with other people, though. I think a lot of people go into it expecting a Platoon or Saving Private Ryan experience instead of a Kubrick-esque mindfuck. &&Haha word. The atmosphere of that movie is so tense and unnerving. The score is eerie as hell. Every time I see it it's like a brand new experience. &&Grand Budapest Hotel is a fantastic film and does an amazing job getting you lost within the story.

Wes Anderson does such a great job setting up realistic grounded characters and motives but than allows the story to become fantastical and more dream-like as you get closer to the end.

For me the sled/ski chase scene felt like that moment when I was no longer watching a movie but witnessing some kind of wild dream.

[Here's the scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuFXISDZEYw) Extremely low quality. My google-fu was not strong enough to find the clip in better quality. &&This movie got me into Wes Anderson. Love everything he does.&&I was thinking of this movie. But I had the opposite feeling leaving the theatre. I couldn’t stop thinking about him losing everyone from the story. Which made me think how accurate that probably was for Europe during that time.&&I love that film, I’d give anything to watch it in a cinema theatre. Missed it when it first came out.&&My husband and I watched that before going to bed a few months ago. Four hours later, were still laying in bed, discussing it. That, to me, was the mark of a VERY good movie, that we could not sleep at all and just had to ponder every part of it. &&Sticking with Alex Garland films: Annihilation also had the same affect. Both are incredible&&There is not a single movie out there that has a more different first and second watch. I think only Memento might be comparable.&&The second Watch made me feel like such a dingus for not figuring it out in the first 20 minutes. They literally SAY the ending like 15 times!&&Same one for me. My friend fell asleep when we were watching it, and he woke up at the end credits and I was kind of bummed that he missed such an amazing movie. It's still one of my all time favorites. The book is incredibly good too, just in a different way. Christopher Nolan did a fuckin amazing job adapting it in a way that makes the overall theme way more emotionally impactful. Even the author of the book said he wished he had thought of some of the things that Nolan did. 

I think it's criminally underrated. And it's probably the best performance of Hugh Jackman's career, in my humble opinion. Though I haven't seen every single movie he's been in.&&Are you watching closely?&&Going to a movie alone really helps.
And try to avoid seeing one when it just comes out. Watch a movie alone and with little to no other people in the cinema is the best way to get the movie high.&&Inception is kinda like Matrix to me, movie that made you wondering if you're dreaming or not.&&Inception did this to me too. I’ve seen it often enough to know what it does to me now, but I remember catching myself “breathing” to the score near the end of the film after they’ve all made it out of the shared dream and Saito makes the call to clear Cobb’s name.&&Was home from college when I saw it in theater with a group of friends. Got there just as it started so of course it was dark. After that beautiful mind bender of a movie, lights come on and realize I’ve been sitting next to my college roomate, who was there with a different group, the whole time. Added to an already unforgettable experience. &&Have you seen the [Google Talk video about the Philosophy of Inception](https://youtu.be/ginQNMiRu2w)?

Absolutely blew my mind. It's by far the most well thought out movie I can imagine. It changed my view from ""Wow what a great movie"" to ""... I can't believe what I just watched"".&&I remember forgetting to breathe in some scenes first time I saw it. It litteraly took my breath away to see Paris fold up.&&Oh my god... I was a huge fan of the book and was so excited when they announced it, then it came out and it was beyond any expectation i had, i felt almost shocked coming back to the real world when it ended. The level of immersion those movies give is almost unmatched. They aged beautifully too.&&Greatest cinematic experience I've ever had &&I wanted it to continue so much after the ending of Fellowship.

It's such a massive cliffhanger: What would Aragorn do now that Gandalf, the beacon of wisdom, is dead? Are Pippin and Merry dead, or will they be tortured in unspeakable ways? Will Sam finally get the chance to blow his load inside Frodo? It was such a great film.&&I *embarrassingly* didn’t know there was going to be three films covering each book so I remember when the final scene came up with Sam and Frodo looking at Mordor in the distance and the credits rolling, I actually went “What!? That’s it!?” 🙈😅&&Watching a whole relationship between 2 people play out on 1 persons face (and eyebrows) was amazing. I'm also a sucker for anything about AI. &&Ahh I love this movie...The visual is just stunning and I wish I could live in a world like that.&&Didn't hear about it when it was running in the cinemas, but got the Blu-ray and watched it home alone. Having been through heartbreak myself at that time the movie really spoke to me on a deep emotional level. And even though it was set somewhere in the future, even though the portrayal of human, romantic, sexual interactions may seem odd for today's standards, I thought as a prediction for our future they were not off by much, if any. I thought it was a very realistic, depressing outlook into how things will be.&&I just watched Her the other day for the first time. That shit moved me.&&It was the first movie I saw after my baby born, so imagine the emotions.&&Arrival is the latest flick to have this kind of an impact on me, and I wasn't expecting it AT ALL.  Slight spoiler below:





I choked up big time when Abbott ""pushed"" them out of that room. I'm not sure exactly why I did, it's difficult to try and explain.  Will have to watch it again.&&Yeah I was thinking about that one for awhile after.&&I feel like a fool for it, but Avatar in 3D on a giant fucking screen left me feeling like I was coming off a mushroom high. &&This is the movie I watch when I'm ill. Feeling a bit spacey already helps to recapture the dreamlike state of watching it for the first time.&&Everytime I watch that I feel a certain type of way. That movie is so beautiful in so many ways, just thinking about it gives me the feels lol&&Most Ghibli movies do this to me. Especially my first time watching them. I'm just filled up with a surreal, void, incredible feeling. &&Hands down my all time fave! Every time I watch I get lost in the world and the characters. And 
Chihiros mission and dedication.😍😍😍. Thank you for mentioning this! It’s been a few months since I’ve seen it. (Opens laptop to watch spirited away) &&> Children of Men

the car battery gets me everytime&&Children of men was amazing. How that film wasn't showered with awards I do not know. Hell the film didn't even make back its budget.&&Children Of Men is an absolute masterpiece of cinema &&>Reqiuem for a Dream

Probably the greatest film I will **never** watch again.  
Man that movie fucked me up.&&This is honestly one of the most wholesome movies I’ve ever seen and very enjoyable.&&I got chills when I saw your response. This is my answer, too. Not only is the movie so wholesome and uplifting, but I saw it in theaters with my girlfriend at the time. It was around the peak of our relationship when everything about us and about life was just bliss. Life got really difficult for both of us a couple years afterwards and our respective situations drove us apart. It got really shitty. I've since recovered somewhat, but I feel so happy and nostalgic every time I think about this movie and that time.&&To see the world

things dangerous to come to

to see behind walls

to draw closer

to find each other

and to feel

That is the purpose of life


&&THANK you. No one I watched this movie with (happened multiple times haha) would appreciate the beautify of this movie. How tf are they not able to embrace the journey Walter is taking us on? &&Same here.  I actually worked with Steve Conrad (the guy who wrote the new one) on a film called The Promotion.   Shot him a drunken email that night gushing about it.  Lol.  He responded.  Such a good, down to earth dude.  &&Suspension of disbelief aside, this movie inspired me so much.&&Yeah, same.  It's one of my favorite movies now.  I was never as into the first one, but 2049 blew me away.  I saw it twice in theaters and am sad I didn't get one last theater showing in before it left.  It's a beautiful slow burn exploring one man's existential crisis, something about it just grabbed me and won't let go.  Adore it.&&Lol. Happens to me all the time with my wife. I will be realy pumped or emotionally engauged with a movie and she is like 'that was a nice show' or 'it was okay'.&&This comment makes me feel terrible for my boyfriend. He was beyond stoked to see it in Imax. We were going to go, but I got sick so we didn't and it went out of Imax at our theater almost right away. We were just talking about this the other day too, he still hasn't got over it. I don't think I'll tell him your reaction lol&&Ah, remember the good old days where you could watch a film trailer and be presented with a mystery instead of the entire plot condensed into 2 minutes?&&Yeah they did such a good job with that I didn't even go see it in theaters :( it was well after it released on DVD that my brother told me about it. I watched it and almost cried for not seeing it sooner. &&That movie will break your brain for a few days. My wife restarted it almost immediately to try to fix her broken brain, but it only broke it worse. &&Synecdoche, NY gets me for days afterwards &&Some depressing movies you got there, I love em.&&WHAT’S IN THE BOX!???&&This movie still sticks with me here and there.  The worst and the one that disturbs me is the dude he kept alive for a year.  OMFG&&This is my pick. I went with a party of 4. Including my husband's 14 yr old sister.  The lights came yup and the full theater sat in silence.  We got up slowly and just walked to the car. The only thing spoken on the ride home was ""sorry, sis"". She was very sheltered and hadn't been to a movie in a long time. 

We then sat at the house with our enlisted buddy and tried to process it until 2am.

Such a powerful movie. &&These's one scene from that movie that sticks out to me. When JGV is getting chemo with the older man. Something along the lines of...

He's like, ""so where's your girlfriend?""  

""Oh she doesn't like hospitals.""

""Well yeah, no one likes hospitals. You don't come to hospitals because you like them.""&&The scene where JGL is about to get surgery was one of the rare movie scenes that made me tear up. I could feel his fear of not knowing if he would wake up the next day. Damn that one hit close to home&&What I loved more than anything was the scene when JGL finds the book Seth Rogen was reading , idk why but that really does it for me. &&I watched it in an Imax, the effects the cinematography ahh how much I love this film...&&I have this happened only twice, once with Interstellar then with Arrival. Whiplash was kinda halfway there with that intense finale.&&Probably my pick too. What really immersed me was how almost everything they presented was actually feasible in some way. You really couldn't brush off most of the elements in the movie as just ""sci-fi."" When I left the theater I couldn't stop thinking about how far the human race has come and how much more we have yet to achieve.&&Yes. Interstellar had an amazing atmosphere. Ive never seen a big theate, like 400 or something people so. damn. quiet. everybody at the edge of their seats. An amazing experience that brought Interstellar into my top5 scifi movies. Seen it 5-10 times since and still get the feels.

&&There’s this one particular scene of their ship going through space that made me feel tiny and absolutely meaningless while in the theater. Something about the that movie man...&&I was literally awestruck after coming out of that film, couldn't piece together words to describe the movie for about 30 mins afterwards&&I felt like I’d forgotten to breathe throughout that entire film, that was so suffocating. Brilliant, but it took a while to shake off. &&Definitely GotF. This had me in a daze for days. In the moments I wasn't just dead then I had learned it's based on a true story, I kept flipping back and forth from sad to angry back to just dead inside.&&The empty tin of sweets...&&That movie really immerses you in that setting so well. It's unlike any movie I've ever seen in that regard. I saw it in winter too (opening night actually) at a 10pm-midnight showing with my sister and there was like 2 other people in the theatre and walking out it was dead quiet and I can't even describe how I felt.&&This movie made me so emotional, for like a week afterwards I would just stop at random parts of my day and think about it. For me there was no big emotional “button” that made me cry or provoked catharsis so it just lingered with me. The same thing happened with Ladybird, I had a very emotional Fall lol.&&The parent characters and their sympathy and understanding for their son was just so tangible. I loved every minute of that movie.&&It was beautiful but it took me a while to be able to see it for a second time because this time I know what's gonna happen and my weak heart just couldn't bear it. It's still hard to watch the last quarter of the movie without feeling absolutely devastated. &&This is the one I was looking for. Honestly, it’s 9 months later and I am still not over it in the least. My comment history will support this statement ha!

It’s such a deeply sensual film, and a mood I don’t want to leave behind...no matter how hard I try. I’ve truly never experienced a piece of media that affected me as much as this film has. &&I missed it in the cinema and so regretting it!
It wasn’t a big flick in Australia and only showed for like a week.&&Amen. Once I was transported to that perfectly realized time and place I couldn't get enough. I saw it in theaters four times just to experience that summer all over again.&&Oh definitely. I felt so betrayed for Leo's character&&I walked out of that film and had anxiety that I was about to be shot in the head at any moment.&&agree. I was left stunned and heart broken.  I felt at a loss for Leo's character, the lack of justice. I've refused to watch it since.

hotel Rwanda is another I'll never be able to watch again, my heart was destroyed, for different reasons, naturally.&&Blade Runner made me want to be in the film industry. BR2049 reminded me why I’m in the film industry.&&+1 for BR2049. Walked out of the cinema with a friend, checked the time.. 'well that's three and a half hours where I wasn't bored for a second..'&&BR2049 for me.  Wandered around the parking lot for 20 minutes meant impact.  Had to take a walk. Then saw 2 more times.  Never done *that* before.&&Saw Logan by myself, good thing as no one could see my tears&&Bladerunner 2049 is easily the best sci fi film of the last decade for me. Such a surreal experience to witness a film that somehow surpassed the predecessor. Dennis Villenueve is truly one of the greatest directors of our time. &&I couldn't breathe when that bear thing came in the room.&&I thought I unknowingly took some drugs and was high as a kite.

Was so good. Also watched Ex Machina to prepare for Annihilation. Did not prepare, but both strong e experiences.

Anyone know any similar ones?&&Best movie of 2018.&&One of the most immersive movies I've seen&&Me too. I couldn't stop jabbering on about it. &&after the movie I left to go somewhere and I had to get gas since my tank was low. I distinctly remember standing at the pump feeling like I had no idea whether my life how I view it was real or my imagination because of that movie. I was looking at everyone around me with a deep sense of sonder. What a great movie that was!&&Definitely read the book if you're down with the kind of messages the movie is throwing at you. The pacing is very different but you get much more into each narrative. &&Cloud Atlas had an interesting spread of reactions from my family.

I had your reaction. My wife liked half the timelines and didn't care for the others. Mom liked it. My sister *loathed* it and went home in a huff rather than stick around and get dinner.

&&The ending filled me with so many emotions.

It's truly a movie before its time.&&True true&&Holy shit, I came here just to say this.

It really is my favourite film, a helluva lot more profound than people give it credit for.&&Man that movie blew me away as a kid. I remember sitting and thinking for hours about the beings that were thousands of years in the future (that find David in the end).&&I love how that movie portrayed fairytales and felt like a fairytale in itself. &&I was hoping someone would mention this movie! I get the weird ""movie high"" when a film shows long stretches of time and demonstrates how short, and kinda inconsequential, our lives are. Other movies that come to mind are Interstellar, Big Fish, and Bicentennial Man. Eternal Sunshine too.&&I regret not going to see this in theaters&&Confession time: I was watching a pirated version of this movie online, got 30 minutes in and said, “I have to go see this in theaters!” Grabbed my coat and ran out the door and straight to my nearest movie theater. Was amazing!!&&If there's such a feeling as a pleasurable punch in the face, Fury Road was two hours of it. Easily in my personal top 3 of all time. &&Shiny...&&I had absolutely no expectations of that flick walking into it.  I didn't really love the original or thunderdome so I just figured it'd kill a nice afternoon with my lady friend. 

Jesus, I can still remember the tingling on the back of my skull when I realized what I was watching.  I mean I was trying to pick and pull the movie apart in my head for the first few scenes, it's usually how I entertain myself through bad flicks but once we got into that big rig chase going into the sand storm my whole brain just shut down with euphoria and let me watch it in peace.&&This'll sound like a circlejerk, but I sat in the car for a few mins before leaving the theater because I was worried I would get caught speeding after that movie. What a great theater experience. It was all adrenaline.&&You know how movies are sometimes described as a ""roller coaster""? Mad Max Fury Road was the first movie (probably only) that I've seen where I felt that was true. I found myself flat out grinning, edge of my seat during parts, especially with the flying guitar guy. It's one of those movies you just can't recreate at home because at the theater it's an experience.&&Okay, this was the movie I was scrolling down to look for. It came out a long time ago and it still gives me the chills. I wouldn’t even call it a high. It was the opposite for me, more of a low. It made me feel so depressed afterwards. Coming out of the theatre felt so surreal.  The music score had a lot to do with it too. I don’t think I have the energy to watch that movie again, but i play the soundtrack from time to time when I’m alone.&&The Witch was a *real* bad trip for me (i mean that in a good way, given the context)&&That is one of the few movie adaptations that's close to as good as the book it's based on. Mostly because Ang Lee does a phenomenal job of capturing that same ambiguity from the book. &&I think this film suffered for being such an old story, from a simpler time, that audiences were demanding layers of complexity and nuance it couldn’t deliver. It could have easily been rewritten, given a modern voice with a message for the modern age. But why not simply enjoy it for the timeless adventure it was, and is?&&It's funny because, despite how poorly received that movie was, my girlfriend and I both love it. Like, we've watched it multiple times together and enjoy it immensely. Holds a special place in our relationship. It's a real shame it was held up in development hell for so long, could have been a real classic if it had released earlier.&&I don't understand how people can't like the last 20 minutes of this movie. That was some of the best sound design and vfx I've ever seen.&&1999 was a great year for movies.  I’ve already seen The Matrix and Fight Club in the comments, both of which I saw in the cinema and both of which were mind-blowing.

But neither of them affected me like American Beauty.  The whole film was like a meditation and I was mesmerized by the music, fascinated by the characters, and immersed in the wonderful cinematography.  What a beautiful color palette!

And to top it all off, after the final frame of the film, to decompress and process the film while listening to Elliott Smith’s cover of The Beatles’ song “Because” was perfect.

My wife and I sat in silence as the credits rolled and quietly walked to the car.  Once we were in the car and I was about to start the engine, my wife began bawling.

I haven’t watched it in recent years, but I’ll be damned if Kevin Spacey’s indiscriminate diddling is going to ruin this movie for me.&&I don’t think I’ve ever felt weirder at the end of a movie. I had to process that one for a while&&I think its effects are still some of the best in history. I don't think it looks that dated at all except for maybe some of the color choices. The sets were awesome.&&2001 has long been one of my favorite movies, but I'd never seen it in a theater until the 70mm re-release this past summer. It was a fucking transcendent experience watching it on film for the first time, even though I'd seen it a million times before.&&Watched it with a friend, travelled over 120km to watch it in English without subs plus the best audio in the country. After it ended, I had to go to the toilet for like 15 minutes to cool down because I felt like my heart could blow up any minute... Geez, what an intense movie.&&That shot of the pilot with the burning plane gives me chills&&Dunkirk in IMAX surround sound really was revelatory. The sound design on that film is fantastic &&Sad I had to scroll down this far.  Not a great film storywise perhaps, but with the 3d and all, experiencing Pandora was captivating. I wanted to be there.&&Oh yeah, this one captivated me completely!
 I saw it at the movies in 3D. It was the first film I saw that wasn't using 3D to have things jump out at you, but rather use it to draw you in to the beautiful world that they'd created.
5/7.&&Yep.

I was somewhat relieved to find that I wasn't the only one experiencing crippling depression after witnessing Pandora, in fact it even had a name, Post Avatar Depression.&&Yeah, 1st and best 3D movie I've seen. I stopped going to 3D movies after a while because nothing came close to the Avatar standard.&&Can't believe how far down this is. I had my back against the wall of the theatre for an hour, wide-eyed, after my first watch in theatres.&&This one is way too far down the list. I had to see this one ten times in theaters. &&This. Only movie I’ve seen twice at the cinema.&&I love empty theatres and watching alone!
My friends think I’m weird because sometimes I avoid them and go to movie alone but this is all for a better experience!
I might be a bit selfish though haha.&&I saw this movie a long time ago and for some reason don't remember anything about it except the fact I loved it. I need to watch it again.&&leaving the theater thinking ""woah he actually won"" was the craziest feeling&&I'm still impressed that they actually went for that ending. That takes a lot of trust from the corporate heads. Warner Bros would never let anything like that happen in the DCU.

Prove me wrong, WB. Give me some Crisis on Infinite Earths.&&Did we just lose?&&I went release night. It’s pretty obvious that the snapped characters are coming back after the fact but I still didn’t think before the movie that they’d pull such a ballsy movie. Was so shook when it was over.&&I'd like to second this. I left that movie different than when I came in. Even if just mood.&&After watching La La Land I had a date for that evening. We finish watching the film, she asked me if I wanted to crash her place for the night.

Promptly said no.

I walked her to her car, open the door for her and closed it. Said goodbye.

Went into my car, drove to the beach and stood there for about 2 hours and then slowly but firmly started to cry like a little girl.

so many regrets.&&Walked out of the cinema and was humming City of Stars all the way home. Played songs from the soundtrack for a week on YouTube before purchasing it.  
It's playing right now and I got goosebumps from Emma Stone's ""ba dap dap da da daa... ""&&True Hollywood Magic. &&I watched La La Land for the first time on a long flight to Sydney, and the ending sequence made me cry in the open right there in my seat.  Oddly enough the small screen, headphones for audio, and Bundy and cokes only served to enhance the experience for me.  &&I so wish I could've seen this in theaters. Watched it a few months after that years Oscars, and now it's one of my favorite movies ever.&&O man Hereditary... That was a crazy movie. I was thinking about that movie for a week. &&So true lol.
After Hereditary the feeling lingers for weeks and I definitely didn’t want to soak in that kind of emotion...&&When I left the theater after Pulp Fiction, I wasn’t really sure if I liked it. Over the next few days, I kept thinking about it, and the more I thought, the more I realized how brilliant it was. &&HTTYD? &&[Three Billboards has the greatest line of 2018](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I3z_b4V6mZ8) &&What good is a car without a person you hate strapped to the hood going 110 on the highway?&&They just released it in 4k like a few weeks ago, check it out&&Try walking into Martin Place in Sydney where the red lady scenes were filmed. So odd.

&&Wasn’t the movie filmed in Sydney? Don’t know much about Australia but I wonder if the cities look similar?&&Same sort of feeling inception gave me after seeking it for the first time in theaters!&&It's not unusual for people from Melbourne to have their mind blown by seeing Sydney.&&I disagree that it *completely* spoils the movie.

In the director's cut, the monologue is put into a slow-paced scene about 3/4s through the film, with the main characters rowing a boat. At this point, the information in the monologue has context and puts a lot of pieces together for the audience.

In the theatrical release, the monologue is completely without context and leaves the first-time viewer with more questions than answers. While this is happening, a dark and foreboding shot pans down from a starry sky into the city, kicking the movie off.

I think it works better to front load this information so that the audience spends less time confused and trying to puzzle out what exactly is going on. This leaves a viewer to spend more time to consider all the other beautiful details, scenery and intrigue.

Disclaimer: I saw this in an empty theater when it first came out, and I walked out in a daze. I mourned the fact that it was obviously tanking, because that meant Hollywood was less likely to take risks on similar movies in the future.

If you've never seen it, I recommend the theatrical cut. If you're going back to it again, check out the director's cut. The added scenes are extraneous, but still lovely to watch.&&I had this ritual I used to do all the time at the movies, I'd wait for the credits, read off as many names as I could and write down a few of them, and then see what some of those random names have also done in the biz.

I always figured, ""one of these days I'll get credit for some inane thing I've done, and it will be forgotten"" .. so I realized well, all I have to do is see what other people have done, and remember them for a moment, and perhaps someone will do that for me some day.

Sure, it's a bit silly.  And I more often than not, could not find the people I tried to lookup.

Here's to you - you people who are named and in the credits, that you think nobody reads.  I did!&&Agreed. And THANK YOU for name dropping SEARCHING. So grateful people seem to love our film as much as we do. 🙏&&Its the only film I've ever seen more than once in the cinema. Saw it three times - absolutely amazing and still one of my favourite films.&&I mean its a stupid meme now but I think its where the modern round of simulation theory became popular.

People were literally questioning reality after seeing that movie.&&We are getting old and a lot of the Reddit folk were too young to get rattled by Matrix in a theater.&&I went to see The Matrix without reading reviews, didn't know much about it. There were maybe 20 people in the cinema. After watching the film I was walking across the road in front of the cinema in a simulation, the cars weren't real, no film ever messed with my head like that. I wasn't right for 10-15 minutes.&&My tired brain read this as manatee show, the first time.&&[deleted]&&I totally get this.  I need time to be in my feelings after this type of movie.&&Joel: I don't see anything I don't like about you.

Clementine: But you will! But you will, and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped, because that's what happens with me.

Joel: Okay.&&I enjoyed him in The Number 23 as well. Gotta love an actor who can play any character. I honestly haven't seen him in a movie that I didn't like. Maybe I'm biased. &&All of Charlie Kaufman's films are worth obsessing over, to be honest &&Thanks my dude. It wasn't anyone's fault to begin with, but the better days are outnumbering the long nights by quite a bit now!&&Hang in there. I first caught it a couple months after a five year relationship, and I came away with a new favorite movie of all time.&&I've never been in a relationship and the movie was just alright for me. It was good but not anything spectacular. Thought the concept was interesting, and the acting was good.  
After watching a movie I usually search it up on Reddit just to see what people think and there were a lot of people talking about their relationships.  
  
So I guess this is movie hits a lot harder if you've gone through a breakup. &&Except for Seinfeld, who used Schindler's List for a make-out sess.&&I still have this everytime I watch Schindlers List, which I do atleast once a year. Saving private Ryan has become a bit more ""normal"" I guess, but Schindlers List keeps giving me this feeling no matter how often I've seen it.&&Pretty sure I was crying at the end. ""this one pen"" that and all the survivors and descendants at the end placing a rock just made a grown man cry like a baby. Good for you, for keeping your shit together &&There's a couple scenes in Saving Private Ryan I just can't watch because they're too realistic and traumatizing.  The knife scene is one.  The other is when the Germans fire the big machine gun at the guys who are clustered around the tank and they all get shredded.  &&Fuckin Upham...&&The scene that got me was when they rolled out the Flak38 when the allies were on the Tiger. I lost all hope for them after that.&&Old men were openly bawling at the screen when I saw it, there was that much emotion.

One said to me its the closest depiction of actual combat he's ever seen put to film. &&My grandfather served in Vietnam, and he said the movie was the most accurate depiction of war he'd ever seen. He's never seen it a second time because it gives him anxiety.&&Sea Wall was an other worldly track. Ive also heard some fan mixes for the movie and they're awesome &&This, so damn much this. [Wallace's theme](https://youtu.be/z_JgOlGq6i4) is insane. Like, I had never heard an entire theater literally shaking when music plays until then and at the same time it's a music that reaches you deep inside figuratively speaking. I need to rewatch it someday...&&Nothing can get close to actual Vangelis unfortunately&&4 times here

&&Honestly Blade Runner and 2049 feel like two halves of the same film that’s how well 2049 captures the original. &&> What a roller coaster ride of emotions.

This really is the best way to describe Your Name, I was scrolling down looking for it and thinking exactly the same thing. After watching it, I spent almost two days just unpacking everything.&&Yeah that one scared the hell out of me! And captivated me as well&&on top of that. after they surprise you with that jumpscares. the film is suddenly distorted, as if we are in a vertigo. i thought i experienced it in real life.&&Felt the same way, but at the same time I thought, what if you were given everything you wanted in this ""fake world""?

We want freedom to be able to do what we want, but what if we were given whatever we wanted in this ""fake world"" how would it feel knowing you aren't ""truly"" free, what does that even mean really?&&Exactly.

Time to time, I imagine if my life is also staged too.

&#x200B;

Def one of the best movies ever. And always get back to this movie. 

His desire for freedom in the ""sea"" feels so surreal.

&#x200B;&&Were others movies rushing or dragging?&&And is the sacrifice worth taking? &&I’ve never had an ending make me think it was a happy ending for a few days then later realize, “wait, that’s actually incredibly depressing” &&One of the best movie endings of all time. &&Only thing i heared was that it is a 'good' movie and tbh, i expected some boring jazz stuff. Then it started like full metal jacket and turned into a wild ride. When it was over and the credits started, i remember, i was sitting on my couch with my mouth wide open &&My mom came down stairs right after me and my brother started the movie. She came around the corner saying ""Hey do you guys want to.."" then she looked at the screen and said ""Oh shit. You guys haven't seen this have you? Nevermind."" And she went on her way.&&On the same note-The Royal Tenenbaums. It's the only movie I've watched that when it ended, I immediately watched it again. &&Fight club.&&I’ll add shutter island too!&&Sixth Sense&&But that's the beauty of it too. When he tells his girlfriend how the bullet trick is done she even says that it feels dead obvious, but that's not the point. It's how it's done. The Prestige wasn't just great for the premise but how well it tells that story.&&That's part of the beauty of it.&&If you’re interested, Prisoners was an amazing movie with some phenomenal acting by Hugh Jackman.  Nothing against The Prestige, but I actually think his acting tops it in Prisoners.&&I couldn't agree with you more. That's exactly how I feel and people just don't understand. Thank you for this.&&[deleted]&&I remember being a little punk back then and thinking the movies would be lame after a neighbor told me. To be fair the most recent high fantasy movie before that was the Dungeons and Dragons movie which was just utter dog shit. I doubt many people had high expectations unless they read the books. I’ve never been so wrong in my life.&&I can’t imagine a film living up to the books as perfectly as the LOTR did. The films are fucking incredible, and still hold up incredibly well over 15 years later. &&I loved the other two as well, but there was just something so new and breathtaking about watching the Fellowship of the Ring for the first time.  I don’t think any film up to that point, even the great movies of my childhood like Jurassic Park or Independence Day had such a feeling of sheer immensity.&&I was 6 years old when I watched it for the first time in theaters. 

An I fell in love with the movie but the ending made me angry cry. 

I kept on pointing at the screen asking for more and why did it end. The concept of a cliffhanger was new to me. &&This is very funny to me. That last bit got me in tears. &&Yeah AI is so fascinating to me, which is one of the reasons why Blade Runner 2049 is one of my favourite films&&Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of ‘Life 3.0’ by Max Tegmark. It’s about, well, everything real-World AI related, and it’s a fascinating read.&&I completely understand , as a parent it makes you think and I believe most of us would make the same choice. &&Holy. Hell &&Yep. I had a young kid and one on the way. Watched it on a flight expecting a cool sci-fi movie.

Got off the plane and my coworker was like ""are you okay dude? You look like you were crying""&&I watched that shitty Disney movie about going to Mars (John Carter) in imax 3D. Tripping. Balls. I still have no clue what that movie was about, but it def left me feeling some kind of way. It's a solid 8.5/10 while on drugs in 3d

Also, if you Google ""shitty Disney movie about going to Mars"" the first results are John Carter. Ask me how I know.&&Avatar was great. I think people just think it’s cool to hate on it. &&Single take at the end of the movie during the battle and the fact that all the soldiers where old was what got me during Children of Men. &&To me it was the long take during the battle. I was GLUED to the chair.&&It’s one of my favorite films of all time, and while I didn’t understand why it wasn’t celebrated at the time - it put Curon on my radar.   Gravity was his next movie.&&The scene where he takes the big step/leap really stuck to me. &&Wtf, i also got chills. I love that movie, it inspired me to do a lot irl that before i wouldn't have done. &&I actually got this painted on a huge block of wood and mounted it in my living room. This movie changed my life and that quote describes how I want to live my life. &&That scene at the end where the little computer narator  is summing up his life and says something like ""what wasn't once a bright promising future is behind you now"" dear Lord I am getting that feeling now just from typing it. It's a truly miserable feeling. The movie isn't great imo, but it's ability to literally export existential crises is amazing &&Same here, and it was my first Imax movie experience. Not gonna lie, I cried with Matthew McConaughey&&Bravo Nolan!&&That movie was incredible in IMAX. I was on edge the whole time. No movie has ever so successfully conveyed the mood (in this case, perpetual fear of extinction and the weight of the responsibility to avert it) of the characters to me.&&Saw The Dark Knight at the Navy Pier IMAX in Chicago. It was so surreal watching such a vivid clarity of picture, then to walk around outside in actual ""Gotham"". We even found the street where the semi scene was filmed. Doubt I'll ever have a more all-encompassing film going experience. &&I was a new father to a little boy when I watched the finale of Whiplash, started crying when they showed his dad peaking through the curtains next to the stage in awe of his son. 

I get the same emotions when I watch Billy Elliot and his dad gasps when adult Billy leaps on stage as the lead in Swan Lake. This movie especially so as I’m from the same part of the world and background as Billy Elliot.&&I watched it on a 32"" tv with crappy sound and was mesmerized. Similar to 2001 a space odyssey.I can only imagine an imax with good sound.&&Was it the shot of the ship flying past Saturn?&&Saw the film with my sister. We didn't say a single word during the 30 minute ride home. When she got out of the car, she just said ""holy shit. good night"".&&That's so cool.&&Fuck yes! BR is my favorite sci find movie of all time. BR2049 is not far behind!&&Still amazing to me that they didn't ruin it.

Compare BR2049 with the Total Recall remake.

It's not like the original Total Recall was a benchmark in cinema but still..&&I honestly believe that film was more of an experience than a movie, sure you watched it for the story, but everything was perfect the sound pulled you in and visuals hypnotized you, I just felt I was there. It was just a whole other level of movie for me. &&I second BR2049 that shit knocked me on my ass for the rest of the day.&&Same! Went twice to see it in 3D. Felt like I was in that world for days afterwards&&I had to watch an explanation video for BR2049.. which blew my mind even more than it did when I went out of the theater.  Then I re-watched lol&&I wholeheartedly believe that Logan is the best superhero movie since the Dark Knight. TDK is easily still more iconic, the way that the first Avengers was - both movies set a new milestone and precedent for the genre; and Infinity War is definitely more *fun* than Logan.

But Logan is thoughtful, different, and entirely aware of where Superhero movies stand today and successfully tapped into the post-western tropes to offer a fresh and often bleak look into the genre.&&Same here. I held my breath as well. And then it mimics the other team members voice. FUCK NO.&&i was traumatized&&Sunshine and Dredd are both awesome Alex Garland Sci-fi movies that I can't stop thinking about. Especially Sunshine. It fundamentally changed me as a person.&&I went to watch it the 2nd week out. Thought it was so good I should see it again. By the next week it was already gone. How a movie that good only gets 2 weeks of screen time blows my mind.&&Tons of people think it's a piece of shit, which I don't understand at all. Even if you didn't like the story or acting, the production is amazing. Also the pacing is intense the second half of the movie. I think more people would like it if they watched it again.&&i think its a movie before its time in the sense that had it just been made a couple years later, it wouldve been a successful mini-series. its still a great achievement and i loved the ambition but i think it narratively overwhelmed a large part of the audience.&&Don't worry, they'll screen it again for its 20 year anniversary&&...and chrome.&&There was adrenaline, but there were also just enough pauses in the flow for you to reflect on what you just saw and feel, unlike a Michael Bay movie that is a single long action sequence which turns into one big forgettable mess of unconnected scenes and characters you don't really care about.&&It's ok, ^we're ^almost ^there&&It had the misfortune of setting up all the sci-fi tropes other films had stolen between the book's first publication and the movie. By the time we had a Jon Carter movie it felt unoriginal.&&Literally the most dated thing in the movie is the use of PanAm. (The continued 21st century cold war paranoia isn't an anachronism anymore unfortunately oddly in the actual year 2001 it seemed it would be.)

Though my younger sister watched it and it was completely lost on her that they were predicting things like Skype and iPads in the 60s, she took it all for granted. That is the true gem of the movie to me. It is one of the most accurate 21st century tech depictions from the 20th century&&Didn't the movie cause people to say that they got depressed after watching it because of how immersive and wonderful they thought it was?

I agree with you completely.&&I'm surprised Avatar isn't a top 3 comment in this thread. Immersion is off the charts for this one, dropping out of the film felt like I'd switched planets.&&I definitely experienced this too. I was fine mentally prior to watching it, then after seeing Pandora in 3D for the first time, real life just felt so monotone, dull and depressing. It felt very weird and unexpected that a piece of media made me feel like that, it never happened before or since. Avatar is the only movie I've ever seen in the cinema three times. Yeah, it was definitely nothing revolutionary story-wise and people hate on it, but it was the best cinema experience I've ever had, and it had a profound effect on me. I haven't seen it in years, but if they brought it back to cinemas I'd see it again in a heartbeat.&&Kevin feige can do whatever he wants and Disney won’t bat an eye.  Plus, the ending is canon to the comics.  There would have been more outrage with alternate ending.&&I saw the movie by myself in the cinema because there was no one else to see it with at the time. So happy that I saw it by myself in an almost empty cinema. It was wonderful.&&*Here's to Tittyfucking Your Dad*. Best film nominee from 2003. Kind of overlooked nowadays.&&Goddamn. shots fired. &&i know someone who saw it 12 times

he was in his early 30s when it was released 

blew his fucking mind&&There were a ton of existential stories before it, but The Matrix was the first one that really contextualised the story and made it relatable.&&It's funny, because it's basically the same existential crisis that Philosophy students have been having for centuries after reading Descartes' 'Brain in a Vat' thought experiment for the first time.

The fact that a movie did that to the entire public is pretty great.&&What if I told you the theater was just a construct?&&It's more than them just being too young to experience it in a theatre.

The Matrix has had a huge cultural impact.  What the Matrix did has been rehashed and abused in so many different forms of media that everyone born after its release has already been exposed to all of its interesting points.  If you show the Matrix to a 14 year old their reaction will more than likely be ""meh"" because.. been there done that.&&Or too old. I think movies and books affect you when you are a certain age which allows you to relate to them in a certain way. I’ll never forget how I felt after reading catcher in the rye when I was 16. Life altering. Reading it decades later it was powerful but in a much different way. I’m probably stating the obvious &&>8% on RT

You *may* be biased. Might give it a watch though.&&I would take that a step farther- the viewer has to have been on the receiving end of a breakup, and still needs to have lingering feelings for that person at the time of watching the film. I think, in that situation, ESotSM will absolutely wreck the viewer.&&I used to laugh at the absurdity of that scene... Then I made out with a girl on our first date at the movies. 12 years a slave was our choice of movie😓&&The knife scene and when the medic stars crying for his mother. Especially after he told that story about ignoring her and pretending he was asleep. &&They touched on that in The Matrix. I think it was Smith that was explaining the matrix and said they'd started it as a Utopia, but basically the human mind couldn't handle a world without problems. 

I could be wrong on the details though. I haven't seen the movie in years. &&Is the juice worth the squeeze?&&I might even argue that Fight Club doesn't have the subtle performances that The Prestige has. Yes, there's a lot to unpack with Marla's relationship with Tyler, but I don't find it as fascinating on rewatch as figuring out which Christian Bale ScarJo is talking to. The two brothers have distinct personalities, and parsing them is an enjoyable exercise. 

That said, I might have to double-back and still go with Fight Club. I've rewatched it close to 40 times and I rarely rewatch anything. Fincher is just a madman when it comes to subtle detailing, and I think Fight Club is worth a dozen rewatches just for it's Sound Design. The way Fincher uses Sound to pre-signal transitions is masterful. &&Especially when someone said it was being directed by the guy that made Meet the Feebles. &&Experienced this as well, but with the second movie. I thought LoTr? Lammme, that’s for nerds. Then a buddy took me with his family when I was hanging with them, that film blew my mind. It changed my perception on a lot of things and it was a very positive change in my life. &&The shire is just so bright, vibrant, and immersive.  I’d love to just lay on a hill and smoke a pipe with Gandalf and the hobbits.&&Seeing it for the first time with my dad is one of my fondest memories with him. &&Lets hunt some orc!&&At the end of the film, my wife had some questions about the non-linear timeline and I was so emotional, I couldn't even speak when I tried to explain. &&I thought John Carter was a great movie and was underrated. It’s a shame they can’t do a sequel. &&Google is actually really good at all kinds of things like that - typing in a vague colloquial description of some movie, public figure, etc, and having it come up with exactly what you meant. It's always pretty fun when that happens. &&There were so many intense parts to that movie. Opening coffee shop scene and driving through the woods were insane. I truly love that movie and how much detail they jammed into it.&&That is one of the single greatest scenes in film history from a perspective of pure cinematography. &&I always recommend that movie. That single take scene is one of my favorite scenes of any movie ever. &&The surreal part when they're walking out of the building and both sides stop firing and just stand there in awe...for about thirty seconds. Still, amazing work.&&The movie just hits so hard on a personal level. In our imagination, we feel like we're the heroes of the world around us, when in reality we may not be making much of an impact. Not that it's coming from a place of overconfidence or arrogance, just that we internally know the potential that we possess, even if its rarely shown (if at all) in real life.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a story of a man breaking through that barrier from being a hero in his own imaginative world, to becoming a hero in his actual life. Personally, I think it hits so close to home for me because I'm an extremely introverted person who believes I can make an impact on the world, but lack the courage to break through the barrier of my imagination into the world & people around me. &&The way Arcade Fire's 'Wake Up' builds into it really makes my heart soar.&&Not gonna lie, we postponed major life plans after watching this movie. Instead of having kids, we waited a year and traveled to Iceland. Best decision ever. &&The scene where he watches his son grow decades older through a series of video feeds....so damn powerful. Then that moment of silence and his adult daughter appears on the feed, I doubt I will ever be able to watch that without tearing up.&&Absolutely. It was the first and only 70mm imax for me. Driving home afterwards felt like I had reduced vision. A combination of screen size and the thalassophobia inducing movie just made me feel so insignificant. I cried the whole drive home. Damnit, TARS. &&The docking sequence in theaters had my ass sweating lol&&it‘s interesting, i thought of billy elliots dads reaction as awe in a positive sense and in whiplash it was a look of a father who sees his son go over to „the dark side“... more shock than awe.&&Has to be. And the size of an IMAX screen adds so much to that &&The sound was so far above and beyond anything I’ve seen before. I saw it in a theatre with Dolby Atmos, it really used that to its full potential. && &&In 20 years we'll be living on Fury Road.&&Yeah I was kind of one of those people.&&Why did I believe this for at least a split second&&We were a simple people.

Naw, I don't think it's the unreal world thing, as perception vs reality had already been done endlessly. TV sci-fi had been running it for decades.

What The Matrix did was nail every other aspect of film-making at the same time. It would have had an impact without the story at all.

And I think the people who say the effects don't hold up are delusional.&&""I think therefore I am."" Is how Decartes calmed himself when he got freaked out thinking about how we could all be brains in jars aliens control. Basically The Matrix without guns.&&Or Plato’s cave.  You’re absolutely right, this movie was built on a very, *very* old concept.

But that doesn’t diminish the creativity, or the way it made the basic idea so relatable.&&I still remember the theater and the awkward first thoughts I had walking out of first viewing of Matrix where I was fully in WOAH mode.  

Like... it could all be a construct. man.&&My friend got a hand job during Passion of the Christ. She was really into bondage and being whipped.&&That scene really hit me because as a kid I used to do this and I still carry that guilt. I always put myself in his shoes and I just cry every single time. &&Or Dead Alive. Or Bad Taste. Seriously, his filmography prior to LOTR is so weird. &&It was a very decent film, but terribly marketed. Also they should've just kept the original name of the Burroughs novel: A Princess of Mars. &&Well damn this hits hard. Probably why I liked the movie so much as well. &&It’s not normal for me to tear up at a comment but this so completely describes how I felt about this movie. 
&&Wow. I've had this film on standby, but never got around to seeing it. Your words really resonate with me. Going to watch it this weekend. &&Whenever I hear that song I immediately think of this movie &&I don’t think human brain is even designed to perceive such emotional impact. We are truly blessed that we can witness it through other’s eyes on the big screen.&&I have only ugly-cried during two movies, and it's probably due to very similar emotional beats. Interstellar [(the video messages scene and black-hole-bookshelves and death bed Murph)](#spoiler) and Pixar's Coco [(when old Coco remembers her father via song was probably the most intense bawl part) It's still incredible what an emotional experience watching that movie was for me](#spoiler)&&TARS, dial the emotion back to say...65% and please stop cutting onions. &&Dammit, now I'm sad I didn't get to see Interstellar in IMAX&&#VRROOOOOOM VRROOOOOOOOOM VROOOOOOM VROOOOOOOOOM &&Witness!&&Same. I watched that fucker like 5 times in theaters 3D IMAX. That shit is NOT cheap.&&The effects are still so good. All the Mr. Smith morphing and Neo's fighting look so good for what, 99?&&I did a presentation on the matrix and Descartes in Philosophy 101. This was only a couple years ago and literally none of the kids in my class had seen the matrix.&&If it makes you feel any better, your mom most likely knew. I know when my kids are doing this because I've non-creepily watched them sleep their entire life, so I know the real deal versus fake. And, to me, both are just as adorable, and it's amazing to be a part of their life, even when they're finding ways to become independent and want me to pretend I don't see it. &&I like that Hanks's character doesn't try to smooth over what that guy did. He just says ""I don't know why I did that"" without getting a reply and the scene moves on.&&And after. &&I mean, to be fair, it’s not like PJ wrote LoTR. He basically filmed all three together after getting a buttload of money to do it. Then cut them into a trilogy. They had finished filming Return of the King before Fellowship even hit theaters.&&Oh you really should, even though all the Critics hated it, it has made quite a Cult following since then.&&I think that's the beauty of the big screen & movies/tv shows in general. I'm reminded of the 'hold the door' episode of Game of Thrones when it comes to emotional impact&&Let’s hope they do a rerun :/ slim chance but even after seeing it in IMAX twice I’d give it a third &&Just see it in Orlando now - Animal Kingdom at Disney World has Pandora, [and](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/animal-kingdom/pandora-world-of-avatar/) [it is](https://youtu.be/FciaHToIQMM) [beautiful.](https://youtu.be/7dPmX53xjtM)&&After having watched all three repeatedly and ALL the content on the extended edition dvds, I can say that LoTR was really Peter Jackson’s life achievement and he knew it going in. He had the freedom to do with it what he wanted, and the money and time, and it shows. None of his work since has held a candle to it. &&I almost asked what ""hold the door"" episode, but as my brain sounded out/said ""hold the door"" I immediately felt sad and started saying HODOR! HODOR! HODOR!!&&Haha I rate it at the same level as 'Not Penny's boat' in LOST&&",2018-09-15 03:07:42
"First look at Joaquin Phoenix in make-up from ""Joker""",42193,9hs14a,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn_uihPAVhL/?taken-by=toddphillips1,4937,1537550040.0,,"[Screenshot of makeup for a direct look](https://i.redd.it/o53usl5gkmn11.jpg)&&Well, Joaquin, I'm sold, and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser. &&I don't know what they want to accomplish with this, but if it gives us a good movie and another masterful performance from Joaquin Phoenix, then I'm all for it. Fuck trying to build a universe lmao&&Oooooo boy I’m excited. Joaquin is crazy already, in the best way possible. This is gonna be good&&I'll give WB credit, the whole shared universe thing may not be working out as planned, but this elseworlds label has a lot of potential. 

&&Finally. Something different. I know it’s an homage, but I am honestly so relieved by the lack of edge-lord Joker. &&I am getting a John Wayne Gacy feel to that make up. Particularly with that color scheme. And that's deeply disturbing. So, job well done. &&Going for a look similar the Cesar Romero mask. I dig it&&Idk why but it's giving off this palpable sadness that I haven't felt with any former jokers. 
This has me excited! &&this is the real sad freak shit we need.&&Definitely confirms my theory this is Todd Phillips' big tribute to The King of Comedy. Phoenix is really channelling Rupert Pupkin in this.&&I really like the design of that facepaint, and Joaquin's mannerisms are spot on. &&This is so completely different from what I expected but I really like it.

I think making standalone pictures might be the way to go for DC.&&That mood switch at the end was pretty scary.&&r/movies isn’t shittin on it 


What a time to be alive &&It seems depressing as much as it does scary. Which is pretty refreshing for the Joker after the last couple of incarnations.&&Cant wait to see the 1000s of tattoos of this Joker&& The shot of him with makeup looks like it's taken straight out of a horror movie. If this delivers, I can only imagine what kind of crazy shit DC and other studios can greenlight in consequence. Fingers crossed.&&A reminder from Christopher Marc of Omega Underground:

> [""Nope. Test footage, and that's not the actual JOKER makeup... This was shot before Phoenix even had the role.""](https://twitter.com/_ChristopherM/status/1043189206045085696)&&Song: Laughing by The Guess Who

Link: https://youtu.be/XqZUzXKDVx8&&The change of expression at the very end is great&&Wow, that looked awesome. Very exciting and different. I can’t wait to see what Joaquin does with the character.&&So is it pronounced Joe-Quinn or Wah-Keen? I've never been sure &&""Joaquin, will you be in our Joker movie?""

""Only if it's guaranteed to win awards at Sundance.""&&I feel like this movie is going to be so fucking great. &&I'm guessing this isn't his final Joker look. In those quick flashes, you can see him performing on stage. I think he looks awesome, but I also think his Joker look will evolve later on in the movie after this. That look he gives at the end... so good!&&Love the single eyebrow twitch at the end, this is gonna be good.&&I’d want to see Jake Gyllenhall play the joker at some point, too. He’s proven his psychotic/sociopathic acting abilities, specifically in Nightcrawler. That movie was amazing, imagine if he applied that ability to a character like the joker.&&Love it. What’s the song?&&I might be on board finally. Christ, that's scary makeup.&&I love that DC is thinking outside the box for their reworked
Elseworlds label. Joker film seems appropriate but I wonder what's next? Injustice? Red son? &&Okay, this is BOTTOM TEXT&&I'm not really a fan of the make-up, but Phoenix certainly has that chilling, creepy smile nailed.

Very interested to see how this turns out.&&He's younger than I am, and looks at least a decade and a half older. Holy shit.&&He's an interesting actor, and so I am keen to see his take on The Joker.

I am guessing the character will be more laconic (with frenzied bouts of madness) but simultaneously much more creepy.&&That sad madness in his eyes. He is such a great actor. &&They should do a short of him Killing Jared Leto

&#x200B;

Edit Jarret = Jared&&Excited to see how this turns out for sure... hopefully really dark&&That eye twitch made me feel really uncomfortable .


Cant wait for this,  fucking brilliant. &&Love the tone they're going for, definitely excited now.&&Everyone is just one bad day away from becoming a juggalo&&Reminds me of the masks they wore in the beginning of The Dark Knight. &&And please WB, i don't want batman or any other character being in this film. 

&#x200B;

Make this self contained and a story in and of itself&&Wow. Didn't expect to actually like this, but he seems genuinely disturbed and unstable. Especially in the full video linked by OP. Past Jokers have all come across as putting on an act, even Ledger. This looks like a new kind of crazy.&&[deleted]&&It’s hard to believe Joaquin is only 43. He looks like he’s in his mid fifties.&&[deleted]&&This teaser is more nuanced than anything Jared Leto has ever done. Excited to see what comes out of it! &&This is before he becomes Joker, it's his make-up for his comedy act he'll do in the film.  &&The end gave me a Jack Nicholson Joker vibe. Love it.&&The immediacy in the change from laughter to stone-faced anger gave me chills. Joaquin is an incredible actor and am pretty optimistic that he'll make an amazing joker. Even if everything else about the movie sucks, his performance will likely make the final product worth it &&wow i like the look they’re going for! can not wait. my inner fan boy is erect&&With the amount of star power surrounding this and now seeing pictures of Phoenix on the set/in makeup I'm really hyped. My expectations for this are high.&&Now this is what I’m talking about &&""Man, fuck this guy""-Jared Leto&&A DC film I can get behind, perfect&&Looks like [Bill Murray](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/quick-change-clown.jpg?quality=95&w=650) from Quick Change&&A reveal like that this quickly means they're gonna be shooting scenes with him in full-makeup in public in the next coming days.&&Imagine a DC cinematic brand that focuses on weird one off stories that highlight sides of our heroes and villains that aren't the normal character arcs.

Put Batman in the Victoria era. Superman as a Soviet hero. This strange Joker film. Get us wondering if we really know these characters before jumping back to the main storylines in a few years. &&Maybe JUST maybe Joaquin can do something great with the Joker. Move away from the flashy sparkles of the past DCEU and go with good filmmaking! &&This is it Chief. &&Sold. Just, sold.&&Going for a bit more Cesar Romero look..i like it&&That's nice of you, but I'm not up for re-election for 3 years.&&this is killing me

&#x200B;&&That's very nice of you u/animatronicseaturtle, but I'm not in the movie for another year.&&Ditch the universe, go with standalones with top talent.&&Joaquin Phoenix is the fucking GOAT&&It's a really inspired casting choice. Phoenix is gonna kill it.&&Hyugh that eye twitch though &&He just looks so sad and lonely until he puts on the makeup, and then it's as if he's convinced himself that pretending is good enough.  I'm getting a real *One Hour Photo* sort of vibe from this.&&Yeah, hopefully they will keep making one off movies like this. I don’t think they would have gotten Joaquin if he had to commit to several different movies.&&Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect choice to kick it off too.&&They already did Gotham by Gaslight as a pretty decent animated film. But my god to I want a big budget Batman Beyond film. Just give me the world of Bladerunner 2049 with the God Damn Batman in it.&&Wait, this is going to be an elseworlds movie? You're telling me there could be a chance, however remote, for a Red Son adaptation? Because I would get working on having a first born just so I could sell him for a Superman Red Son adaptation. Preferably as a limited tv series though.&&> elseworlds 

Wuzzat?&&It's my favorite part about comics. You have these larger than life iconic characters and everyone is free to remix and do what they want with them. Fuck it, what if Superman's ship crashed in the USSR? Have Batman fight Jack the Ripper in a steampunk London. Even in the canon itself characters radically change appearance and personality depending on the artist and writer. I don't need one cohesive vision with the same actors in the same time line in one overarching plot. Get weird with it. &&D A M A G E D&&If I saw the trailer with John Wayne Gacy Jr by Sufjan Stevens I’d just assume it was a film about Gacy. This is going to be dark as fuck&&Yes! I was trying to figure out why I feel so unsettled and it's exactly because of the likeness to Gacy! &&Same, my first thought was that it looked like Gacy which makes me think they're doing serial killer joker. Which, holy shit&&That had to be the inspiration behind the makeup because it looks almost identical.&&and the angular coloration &&I don't think this is the final look, this is more like the ""Prototype"" look some superheroes have at the beginning of their movies (examples include the hoodie Spider-Man look from Homecoming , the bit where Bruce Wayne wore a ski mask in Batman Begins and Iron Man Mark I). I reckon the final look will be a slightly more chaotic&&That was my first thought too. It’s like they found a happy medium between Romero’s and Ledger’s Joker looks. &&Also same paint colors as John Wayne Gacy &&I’m getting kind of a Gacy/Pogo vibe.&&My guess is because he looks more real in some way. He looks like that comedian that only made it to a regional level. He looks like any middle aged man in makeup for Christmas&&He really looks like someone who's just snapped and given up on everything, like there's a relief in finally allowing yourself to go mad. I love it.&&> Idk why but it's giving off this palpable sadness

Because Joaquin has that&&It’s the music. Playing it silently, I got more of a genuine unsettling feeling, rather than sadness.&&I have no idea if this movie is a Joker origin story or what, but he is a tragic figure in one of the more popular origin stories. His wife is pregnant and he starts doing stand-up to make money, it's not enough money so he starts helping the mob during robberies, his wife dies and is forced to go through with a heist, Batman intervenes one night and he jumps/falls into chemicals to escape. But no one really knows if that's his true origin story or not, as shown in TDK when he tells a different story about his scars every time. But there's some truth in every joke, right?&&Agreed. The casting is perfect. &&Robert DeNiro being in this movie too seems fitting.&&I'm a huge fan of this movie. Its an amazing character study of a person who at first you think is just naive and funny but they turn out to be really deranged and out of touch from the real world. DeNiro was really impressive in that movie. &&The King of Comedy would be an excellent direction for this film to take. Rupert Pupkin was the realest version of the Joker that we'll ever get. &&That’s not a theory, the filmmaker has outright stated it multiple times.&&Thank you for saying that.&&David S. Pumpkins? &&Joaquin's mannerisms are always spot on, to be fair.&&Reminds me of the clown masks in the intro of The Dark Knight.&&About time they realize this.&&did you notice how he suddenly stops smiling for a split second? That sold me way more than the makeup. &&Yes. This was the best part. Just his resting face was so menacing&&Well, he doesn't have DAMAGED tattooed on his goddamn forehead. So that's already a plus.

&&Give it more time, I’m sure it’ll happen&&d a m a g e d&&Maybe they could finally green light that Red Sun movie after all these years.&&Well this is an Instagram from the director, so I'm thinking this is probably representative of what to expect.&&[deleted]&&> Christopher Marc of Omega Underground

Who is he?&&Yeah I'm going to trust the director of the movie over Christopher Marc of Omega Underground. &&I mean.. It was also said before that Leto's tattooed, slick back hair, and metal grill Joker wasn't the ""real"" look for the movie too and that it was just for a photo shoot.. &&Where's his source? Who even is this guy?&&I doubt that. Test footage, prior to an actual casting that matches the actually released set footage in terms of character design (sans-makeup)?&&This isn't the kind of test footage they shoot before they hire an actor. This is obviously an actually produced for release 'sneak peak'. &&Well that's disappointing, I really like this. But as /u/dbmma said, if they're promoting it, this can't be too far off &&That’s the most unsettled by a dude in clown makeup I’ve felt since 2008.

Whaaa, really? I always felt [this moment](https://youtu.be/vxF7IakrLjQ?t=126) was Heath's Joker at his realest. He seemed to have been supremely offended that he's being dismissed as a looney, rather than the genius who's ahead of everyone. &&If Ledger was the 00’s opiate Joker and Leto is the 201X Meth joker, Phoenix is the 80s alcoholic joker?&&When he smiles, watch his eyes. There is simply nothing there. &&Would you say he seems...damaged?&&Give up on the universe. They tried and failed. They should just focus on making good movies.

Can't wait to see what they come up with.  
I'm just tired of hearing ""The Joker doesn't need an origin story.""  
Then also hearing the same people claim their favorite Batman run was the Killing Joke.  
  
I say for for it.  
Go nuts. Let's see what they can come up with.  
If it's good, it makes you love the Joker more.  
If it's bad, makes you love Ledger's version even more.  
No matter what: More love for the Clown Prince of Crime.&&I've never seen this before.  I don't like it.&&Keaton as Batman for a Batman Beyond film!&&Nahh no, you dont understand.

It should be about stories and stand alone ones at that. &&[deleted]&&That was sooo weirdly satisfyingly good.&&Yes! That subtle single-eyebrow raise!&&Is this part of acting classes?  &&>.  I'm getting a real *One Hour Photo* sort of vibe from this.

Speaking of amazing movies and performances. &&yep. Just make this a self contained story...let marvel do all that crossover stuff.&&I heard rumors that he passed on Doctor Strange for that reason. Didn't wanna be a part of franchise and all the commitment necessary.&&yup, if they can attract hollywood's best and brightest to lower budget experimental films with well known characters, and the films work, WB/DC might have actually brought something completely fresh and new to the table. 

&&Yes yes and fuck yes, ever since i was a kid i’ve been dreaming of a Beyond live action&&People elsewhere keep saying have Keaton play old Batman for a Batman Beyond film, and I think I'd really enjoy seeing where that goes.&&funny you say that, the guy who directed kong skull island pitched it to WB back then. They passed on it, but it could be revisited, ya never know.

There's supposed to be like 52 universes (or infinite now?) which started when they consolidated all the D.C. heroes having the same name but being different characters. Like Alan Scott being the green lantern whose power doesn't work against wood or Jay Garrick being a WWII era Flash who is just super fast, instead of the modern Hal Jordan being a universal patrol officer fighting with the power of courage and Barry Allen Flash who is a part of the Speed Force.

There's really good stories like one where a young Bruce Wayne is murdered in the alley one night when leaving the theater with his parents, who then devolve into madness as Batman and the Joker. Another where The Green Lantern is a young woman who used her lantern as a pathway to allow the dead to finish their unfinished business. And the one mentioned In another comment, Red Son, where our all-American boy Superman lands in Russia instead of Kansas, US as a baby and is raised in the USSR, I think during The Cold War.

Damn he's good at it.&&oh my goooddddd&&I would pay all my money to hear Sufjan in the trailer.&&https://youtu.be/0FiXnRNEsG4&&Good theory. This could be him as an actual clown. The facepaint could distort throughout the movie.&&I’m hoping that it kind of goes back to the bit more clean cut joker. Ledgers joker despite being crazy was obviously extremely intelligent, perceptive, and a meticulous planner (despite him saying that it was chaos, it was planned). But I don’t like the dirty look. I’d like to see a Joker as Patrick Bateman. Well put together but ruthless like Ledger. 

So maybe we’ll see the makeup get cleaner (though I don’t dislike the unsymmetrical look), slicked back hair like in the comics, and a purple suit. I’d also like to see him do things like ditch the suit jacket and put on a tactical vest for when he decides he needs to get his hands dirty. I want to see a revenge driven joker. He’s been pushed down his whole life, his wife leaves him or dies, loses his job, and wants to get revenge on the system by taking what he thinks is his. But he’s also deranged. He thinks the system is a joke which is why he’s the joker. Batman fights fear with fear. The joker gets revenge on the joke of a system with jokes&&I thought this movie idea was so dumb, but I have a really good feeling about it now after seeing this &&Well that sure unnerves the shit out of me. This movie is more promising with every update&&That's also what first came to mind for me, with the blue color.&&The one time you see the joker without makeup in TDK he still doesn't look as weathered as this version here. I'm pretty pumped for the look and mannerisms portrayed so far. &&He looks like the kinda rough-living older guy you see riding the bus or train by himself wearing an old denim jacket asking people for smokes. It’s a really interesting take. &&my guess is because he looks like joaquin phoenix&&Yess. I kinda felt that! 
This better be good man, I'm cautiously getting hyped now. &&Madness is the emergency exit after all.&&That laugh at the end is so much the laugh of a broken man who can’t be brought to care anymore.

Source: uh, yeah...&&That face of silent rage the split second after he's done smiling sells it on the level I wanted this movie to sell me on. &&“Memories can be vile. Repulsive little brutes, like children I suppose. But can we live without them? Memories are what our reason is based upon. If we can't face them, we deny reason itself! Although, why not? We aren't contractually tied down to rationality. There is no sanity clause. So when you find yourself locked down in an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember: There's always madness. You can just step outside and close the door, and all those dreadful things that happened, you can lock them away. Madness... is an emergency exit.”

From The Killing Joke. I can’t wait for this movie && Going through a Trauma Conga Line IRL will do that &&Not to mention it's being produced by Scorcese himself.&&I watched it randomly because I just looked scorceses filmography up and decided to start watching ones I never saw. I was blown away that this wasn’t one of the most famous ones. It’s so gnarly good and try to recommend it to everyone I can&&[deleted]&&And those were based off a mask used by the joker in the Adam West show I believe!&&Which was an homage to a mask worn by Cesar Romano as the joker in the 60’s.&&Don't forget the DC Animated Universe, which if you ask me is on par with the Marvel Universe, and isn't afraid to put their chips on a standalone story like Batman vs Jack the Ripper or 1960s Batman vs Two-Face&&i think the eye twitch also sold me! &&When I first saw the make up I thought, *Well, I mean, ok*, but I watched the clip, and rewatched it, and rewatched it again. There's a lot to dissect from such a short clip.


We are presented with a man, kind of boring and plain, easily invisible in a crowd. But the projection over him, it isn't just the Joker standing there, if you watch, he's dancing with big flourished movements. The laugh when we get a full transition, the eyebrow lift and the half cocked/scheming smile that accompanies it, then the dead pan glare. 


We are shown a broken man driven mad, slowly losing grip on reality until he transforms into a maniac. It's Ledgers Joker, with the ability to be ""fun"" and terrifying at once, but with a little spice of something else. 


I went from *It's ok* to *Choo choo all aboard the hype town express* really fast. I have high hopes for Joaquin as Joker.&&Yeah, he looked like he was ready to kill at that last second&&But how am I supposed to know his mental state now&&3 weeks after release&&I don't care that everyone has seen this.

Whether he actually does or not I don’t know&&And also with a set, lighting effects (the projector,) and music.

I guess they could still do it tho.&&Old man Superman is best Superman&&Keaton has been the best Batman to date.

Honestly it’s getting played out. Part of what made TDK trilogy successful was it was it’s own thing. &&Don't give up on the universe. As other people have said. Do a soft reboot ala flashpoint but in the mean time do these one off one shot stories where you can take some interesting direction... you could attract big names for these smaller projects and ultimately spend less since it's usually a one time deal instead of signing on for multiple pictures... at first I was against it but to be honest this is something marvel isn't going to do at least not for a few years and it's perfect for dc&&Suicide Squad made too much money for them to just abandon that version of The Joker.

*^^^also ^^^insert ^^^Oscar-winning ^^^Suicide ^^^Squad ^^^joke*
&&[removed]&&No, no, you---you complete... Me...&&Did anyone else realize that at the fund raiser when the joker came in and batman jumped out the window to save Rachel he just left all his ""friends"" there with the joker. What kind of shit is that?&&Oh, thank God you’ve got a panic room ... Wayne?!&&*cue Joker interrupting mobsters*&&DC tried to reap the rewards that Marvel have without laying the groundwork. You've got to focus on the here and now, make interesting characters that we care about before you think about the big team up films. Without the pressure of a wider universe, this Joker film could be something else.&&Marvel didn’t get lucky, they gave their movies time and budget, DC just went “money me now” and released some half assed movies in hopes to catch up. &&I wouldn't call what Marvel did ""getting lucky"". They took their time and did it right. Establishing a universe and characters in it. Even establishing a huge threat. DC tried rushing it and just threw some crazy shit together real fast. Tried being edgy and dark for no reason. And basically flew too close to the sun.&&Did Marvel get lucky? I get the impression that their universe is *years* in the making and was built up very carefully and slowly. So many different styles of superhero films that were all mostly independent, but had subtle things tying them together at first. Like, when Captain America first came out, I had no idea that the tesseract was gonna be an infinity gem. And many of those films had unique styles, very much designed to function well on their own. Eg, the likes of technical and dramatic Iron Man is very different from the more fantasy based Doctor Strange and again from the very sci fi and comedy focused Guardians of the Galaxy.

Any there was so many movies before they were combined into the Avengers, then so many more in between Avenger films to further build up each one's character. Yet, most of the films were really strong on their own and all the titular heroes are well fleshed out (I feel like the not-fleshed out ones like Hawkeye are easy to ignore, anyway).

If anything, all I'm kinda disappointed with is how the Netflix TV shows (Daredevil, etc) feel rather disconnected from the MCU. There's the odd name dropping of a movie hero (half the time being a weird indirect reference where they don't use the hero's actual name) or of ""the incident"", but beyond that, all the Netflix characters are in their own little world. Somehow the likes of Spidey never notice the Netflix heroes even when buildings are being blown up or the whole city has an earthquake. And as far as I know, the movies aren't gonna ever acknowledge the TV show characters (even though some are actually Avengers in the comics -- Luke Cage certainly seems more powerful than half the cast of actual MCU Avengers).&&Except Phoenix is a much better actor&&Would you even put Phoenix on the same continent as Leto? No offense to Leto because he's fucking great too, but Phoenix is something else entirely.&&Jared Leto *could* be a really great Joker, though. If they gave him a script and movie which actually worked. If they wrote his character the right way, I think he'd do great.&&IMO Leto was hamstrung by poor writing.  Acting can only carry so much.&&Yes until the camera test came out with damaged written on his face. Leto could have been great if he had a decent director and script. &&For real, it's amazing that most people are not even talking about the makeup in the thread. Rather, people are pointing out his mannerisms because they are actually creepy.&&exactly! I actually liked the DCEU before JL but honestly even if JL was amazing, it still would just be a remake of Marvel. 

There's no more ground to get for the shared universe, mainly because besides making the team, breaking the team, and fighting the big bad, what else is there?

I think if they want to have a shared universe (they do), they should keep it self contained, with potentially small crossovers or references for fans. This way they can explore on the lore of each character (something marvel doesn't  do).

edit: i dont mean marvel movies aren't standalone or can't standalone. i mean we as the audience watch these movies waiting for [new character] to meet up with everyone else. We watch the knowing there is gonna be a big bad coming soon that everyone will need to be there for. And lastly, I think DC characters have a bit more lore to explore (i.e. speed force, themyscrara, atlantis, krypton, magic from shazam, lantern corps). Marvel charcters are more grounded for the most part and more human. This is a great strength for telling future stories and they utilize it&&> let marvel do all that crossover stuff.

I mean DC could do it to if they were actually good at it. &&Agreed. At this point I think Marvel has aced the summer-blockbuster-superhero movie. WB/DC should stop trying to emulate the fun, goofy style and focus on dark psychological character pieces.  &&Well the most exciting part is that Phoenix has been assuring people that this is a small, character driven story. He said what drew him to the project was the opportunity to explore the character as a person. That right there has something that the DCEU movies haven't had: a reason to be doing this.

I think a superhero movies that isn't about spectacle or action is going to be very refreshing, especially considering the staleness and oversaturation that the genre is currently facing. &&I have been saying that I wish Marvel could do this (not that they need to). Like really specific drama focused stories (Like Kraven vs Spiderman Last Hunt). 

They do this a little bit with the Netflix Marvel, but this may be better for DC. &&This video may interest you: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZn4YF5vpuY&&That's what Batman Begins was originally supposed to be. I think they wanted Keanu Reeves to play Terry with Clint Eastwood as Bruce? I remember watching it on the special features for Batman Begins forever ago.

Edit: okay so I’ve gathered that it’s Flashpoint. I remember seeing that title a while back in 2010/2011ish and know it sorta kicked off New52. 

So new question: what trades/arcs should I read before flashpoint if I want it too make sense?&&I know red son is everyones favorite elsewords supes but There was a elsewords i remember  where superman wasnt the only survivor  on krypton and the surviving kryptonians basically came to earth and conquered it and the story is basically about supes become a resitance fighter against his own kind with the help of an old very crazy batman who had spent his life fighting them and supes struggling with doing what hes knows is right and his loyalty to his family and own kind.   It was freakin awesome.&&That's a brilliant idea.  If they keep it that way.&&You mean.  Like a normal movie?&&> ""What if batman became green lantern?""

ftfy&&https://youtu.be/0FiXnRNEsG4&&Heath Ledger's did that.

I'm a little confused because he looks a little old but everyone's saying he's a perfect choice so we'll see.&&Same here. I'm feeling excited over the countless films that could be produced out of the normal DC standard. At this point, why not. Their tentpole planning has all but been a failure.

Nolan has said he's a big fan of the show, and took influences from it; The clown masks, Catwoman's look, Heath's laugh also being very similar to Romero's as he's falling around the end of the movie. &&Irrelevant to the joaqer, but that emmett kelly mask was also one of the options Carpenter and crew had for Michael's mask in Halloween&&Which was an homage to Julius Caesar in the 60's (BC)&&Was scrolling down to see if anybody noticed this.

Edit: [For those that haven't seen Hamm act in something - Mad Men Spoiler Warning](https://youtu.be/syacksXFOgo)&&>	Not everything needs to be a universe now. 

Agreed! But unlike all the other weird cinematic universes that Hollywood is trying to force, comic book worlds THRIVE on how interconnected they are. 

It really sucks that Warner/DC couldn’t get their act together. We could have had something as special as a live action Justice League Unlimited if the studio wasn’t so incompetent. &&Marvel did, they rock at it. DC tried, they suck at it. if DC wants to give the shared universe thing a try again they need to wait a few years and start fresh with a completely new cast&&>Part of what made TDK trilogy successful was it was it’s own thing.

so like most movies?&&I'm not a monster, I'm just ahead of the curve...  AGHLAJRBZLWBFCNNQLFBR&&He had to SHAVE RAYHJULH!&&[deleted]&&Everyone is all bent out of shape about the shared universe thing but that isn't the problem. They've had consistently bad writing and a misunderstanding or disregard for the characters. 

Personally, I'd rather have my superheroes in the same universe. It's part of what makes comics so interesting for me. What happens when the Punisher and Captain America are forced to work together? How do a bunch of devious bastards come together for a common goal with the Legion of Doom? 

Plus, can you really have a Joker without Batman? Or Venom without Spider-Man? At that point it's a parallel interpretation rather than an adaptation, loose or not. Do we really want to watch the Joker just mess with the police or terrorize regular folks? That would be like having a Batman movie where he only breaks up robberies. &&I've been consistently shocked with the bad writing and outdated, overused CGI in the DC movies. Everyone talks about how they jumped the gun on world building but really, they're just bad movies. &&I thought they were gonna build on the Christian Bale/Nolan universe. Everything was in place for a Joseph Gordon Levitt Robin movie and then they decided to make a bunch of shitters.&&Yeah, I agree. They even had some ups and downs and learned from them. The Incredible Hulk really doesn't hold up to rewatches, but they took the good parts and characters from it, improved the writing, and then we got Thor Ragnarok. &&I think Leto did a good job with that character and interpretation of the Joker. It was a poorly written character in a poorly written movie that wasn't helped by horrible editing, but Leto definitely committed to the caricature of the Joker they were trying to create. In the hands of a better production team, Edgelord Joker could have worked I think. &&Jared is great. The movie (Suicide Squad) was a dud at the start. He was trying to save. Reminds me of Depp in Wonka.&&Phoenix knows how to get the kind of weird that makes you afraid. Leto doesn't make me afraid.&&Right? Leto has acting chops but I feel like almost every actor to star in the DC/WB universe took a huge blow to their career doing these films, except for Gal Gadot. Been Affleck and Margot Robbie for example we're at the peak of their careers before coming to DC. There's plenty of talent acting wise but script/costume design/direction is all ass from there.&&In other movies too.  Joaquin is just kinda creepy.&&> what else is there?

Like 6 decades of comic book/graphic novel lore to draw from.&&>I think if they want to have a shared universe (they do), they should keep it self contained, with potentially small crossovers or references for fans. This way they can explore on the lore of each character (something marvel doesn't do).

.....What? This is exactly what Marvel does with most of their solo movies, and exactly what they did from the get go that allowed them to have large crossover movies like Avengers and Civil War that are able to neglect character lore and development and still be successful.  Almost all solo films are self contained stand alone films that explain how/why/what/who the hero is.  They add in some bonus references that excite people for having seen the previous films or having knowledge of the universe in general, and add in end credit scenes to excite people to see the next one.  None of which are critical to understanding that stand alone film.  I can understand why people might think at this point that Marvel is just one huge interconnected universe that thrives on its ""interconnectiveness"" or whatever, and I completely agree this should be the basis for DC to make good movies, but this is exactly the Marvel formula that gets people heavily invested in characters and allows for the huge event crossover movies to be box office behemoths.&&like they can still do shared universe stuff with the characters they have now, but still do these one-off/elseworlds 
 films on the side.

Imagine Keaton coming back to do a Batman Beyond movie. or even a direct adaptation of Dark Knight Returns with him and Nic Cage playing superman like Burton wanted. The possibilities are endless.&&This is literally the opposite suggestion that people had for DC when they continued with the darkness/grittiness of the Dark Knight into Man of Steel. I think that DC has just had terrible writers since the Dark Knight era (except for Wonder Woman which was generally regarded as a good movie). &&> focus on dark psychological character pieces

I think that's the direction they were probably planning on going until Zack Snyder got his hands on the franchise and said ""DARK, YOU SAY???""&&And they would have already accomplished that too, if only the director handling the dark stuff weren’t Zach “Darkness is a Metaphor for Darkness” Snyder.&&I think that's appropriate for some things. Honestly, they just need to know the tone to set for their individual properties. Superman does not need the same color scheme as Batman when it comes to film, and he doesn't need to be a brooding jackass.&&You’d like Logan. &&Maybe they'll do this in Phase 10 when they've run out of every single character to make a movie for.&&As long as the world aged out of it's Nightmare Before Christmas/Hot Topic phase, which would probably not be the case, since every Tim Burton movie visually looks exactly like every other Tim Burton movie.&&Have him played by Keanu Reeves for some reason.&&[deleted]&&Flashpoint paradox. It has a great animated movie.&&It's crazy that we've gotten to the point that one off movies made to be good films without respect/ties to other cross media properties is now a brilliant idea. We live in a weird time.&&Most ""normal movies"" aren't running along a huge franchise with pre-existing characters played by different actors.&&I think you've just created modern cinema.&&Hes held several different rings I believe (and yes... he fucked shit up)&&What if batman became a YELLOW lantern? Now that's a movie. 
&&Haha, no shit, right? &&There's also one where the Superman story is reversed. Earth is doomed and the Kents send baby Clark to Krypton, where he grows up and becomes a Green Lantern.

Another fun one was Superman: Speeding Bullets. Baby Kal-el lands in Gotham City instead of Smallville and is raised by the Waynes instead of the Kents... Batman with superpowers.

Actually, a lot of the Superman Elseworlds stories were based on his ship landing somewhere other than Smallville.

Batman, however, lent himself to more creative time pieces, like Batman and Robin during the Civil War, Victorian era Batman hunting Jack the Ripper, Batman as a Knight of the Round Table, Frankenstein Batman, pirate Batman...

[Full list of titles here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Elseworlds_publications)&&Are you one of them?&&[deleted]&&Nolan also made sure that Ledger's make up wouldn't be fixed when he was in a place where he couldn't fix it. So while captured the make up only deteriorates.

But if this new Joker is going mad, it'd be cool to see it become deformed. Sort of like those drawings from artists with worsening Alzheimer's.&&What about if they picked Kevin James&& I agree, but  I also think I have higher hopes with Joaquin Phoenix in general than I did with Ledger.&&My BIL worked on that film, hung out w Ledger.  Said when HL came on set without makeup first day they thought ""no way this Aussie sweetheart in love with his baby surfer dude could ever pull this part off"".  Then they watched his amazing transformation, every day.  BIL s been on set with every major actor in the last 25 years. Said HL was the best of the best. 

&&you say that but wait until they cast Kevin Hart as the new Joker directed by Tyler Perry and half the script will be other people making fun of his height.&&Nothing like an old sad clown &&I have to assume Joker being old is part of the story. Like, he becomes the Joker as part of his mid-life crisis, after decades of trying to further his career as a clown or a comedian. &&Does it really matter if he's old? I dunno, I've only read a few batman comics but I couldn't give a fuck about details like that. Performance, performance, performance. Also Nicholson's joker was old as well.&&And also Heath Ledger was a young handsome dude&&Yes! He went from a smile thats says, ""I'm really enioying this."" To a very grim stale face that tells you to stay as far away as you can from that person.&&Scorcese's production company is producing still, so he's still involved-ish.&&oooh. that guy!&&I really wished he would have gotten just a tiny bit of blood spatter on him in that shot. &&Not to mention how the entire series concluded with ""some days you just can't get rid of a bomb""..&&> joaqer

Lol that's perfect&&which, to be fair, was an homage to caesar salad dressing&&Caaaaaaaaaaarl&&Filmcow made llamas with hats, charlie the unicorn etc. &&He blinked constantly in Prisoners though, his character had that facial tic. &&Totally forgot about this bit. Really hope the revival series for Animaniacs is just as good if not better. The material they have to work with now should provide lots of gold.&&Goddamn you're a wonderful person! I've been quoting that sketch for years!&&Dc sucks because they went the complete reverse route as marvel. There’s no shame in copying their game. How did they expect people to care about the characters coming together if they didn’t have any experience with them solo first? &&I don't wanna kill you, you complete me.&&[Just head of the *ceurrrve* ](https://youtu.be/eFjFxgHedgM)&&I'm not a monster, I'm just streets ahead!&&Very poor choice of words.&&And then a wild senator Leahy appears&&No one says that joker or whatever should be isolated. No. You can have multiple takes on batman at the same time. It's pretty exciting.

I 100 % agree that DCEU sucks. No doubt about that. But this approach of DC gives a ton of flexibility to the filmmakers which can not be had in a shared universe. You can have a movie where Batman goes crazy and kills the joker and still have joker in other movies. This won't be possible in a shared universe. Also, allows you to have stuff like batman beyond without  change shit radically in the other movies. It could turn out to be a dud. But it's pretty exciting for me.&&The problem isn't the shared universe concept, it's that they tried to rush to the rewards of the avengers without any of the build up from the character pieces that come before it. They were too hasty and it fell flat as a result--not to mention DCs writing is godawful.&&I actually loved the ideas that Leto did for that version of the Joker. He was much more insane crimeboss than Ledger's Chaotic Evil and I think it was pretty cool, but the entire movie was just such a clusterfuck that it was hard to enjoy. &&I like Leto a lot and I couldn't agree more. I really loved the prospect of having a Joker like that. A modern day drug lord type gangster would have been really cool if they didn't fuck up the entire movie.  &&Leto is an actor that is committed to the idea of being a committed actor.&&Leto and Depp are, like, three tiers below actors like Phoenix.&&Commodus in Gladiator is still one of my all-time favorite antagonists (helps that the movie is one of my all-time favorites too)&&>  Leto doesn't make me afraid.

Then you're not a 15 year old girl at one of his concerts.&&Yeah he's haunting as fuck in You Were Never Really Here&&I feel like that's what happens when your parents are in a cult and you watch your brother die. &&I think they were speaking in terms of an ensemble cast. Much more lore for individual characters with small crossovers&&Elderly Batman has such potential. To me he's a more frightening character, the physicality is removed and all that's left is a lifetime of rage and violence and scars and knowing every dark secret that must be held and what that does to a man. 

*Especially* when reluctantly training a replacement.&&Keaton in a Batman beyond movie... Shut up and take my money!!&&Keaton as a older Bruce Wayne in a Batman Beyond film would be a damn good choice.&&> Imagine Keaton coming back to do a Batman Beyond movie

I will... later.&&But in DKR, Superman hadn’t aged the way Batman had.&&or Keaton coming back in a The Dark Knight Returns kind of flick, shit would be crazy.

Please no Nic Cage as supes ever please. &&Even Wonder Woman mostly succeeds on good performances and strong directing. The script was passable, but pretty lazy at times, especially near the end.&&Yeah, they totally thought their Jared Leto Joker was dark and psychological.  But the difference is like when somebody weird tries to act normal vs somebody normal trying to act weird, and we ended up with hot topic joker instead of dark joker.&&The funny thing about Logan is that it's *full* of action. But the writing and the acting is such an improvement over most superhero movies that it comes off as a more character-driven story than it really is.

More superhero movies should be accomplishing this. &&Or Tom Selleck!&&And it’s a Flash story, less so Batman. &&Yeah... DC probably could've had a better chance from the start if they didn't even make an attempt at the whole ""shared universe"" thing.&&Franchises are becoming the new normal though. &&Yeah, the big difference in Elseworlds stories is their emphasis on what strays. There's some event that goes differently, like Batman becoming a hero 150 years ago instead, and the story is about the things that change. Something like James Bond movies aren't in a shared cinemaric universe, but they're not meant to be totally alternate dimensions, either. Their relationship is besides the point unless they're direct sequels.&&Off the top of my head... Yellow, green, white, black, maybe red but I'm not sure about that one. &&Fun fact, in the Blackest Night/Brightest Day run, the ultimate embodiment of fear, inheritor of the yellow ring, was Scarecrow.&&He did get a Sinestro Corps ring once, but both he and the ring rejected each other: Batman because he wasn't going to be a soldier for a villain the League has fought, and the ring because Sinestro programmed the rings not to accept any former Green Lanterns(himself excluded of course). His body was possessed by a black ring, but he never got a Red Lantern ring to my memory... Not sure why he never got one, the red rings go to those whose rage is born from loss.&&Or Francis Bacon's screaming popes:

Like, those movies were part of his origin story. &&Gacy thought the same thing.&&I'm going to guess it is going to parallel the origin story depicted in The Killing Joke movie.&&Isn’t Joker kind of ageless? He’s never younger or older than Batman, he just *is*

Look old here isn’t really out of canon&&Also he was a young joker. This is clearly an older, more experienced Joker.

EDIT: I meant ""experienced"" as in he's older and has life experience, not that he is experienced in being the Joker.  I know it's an origin movie.&&And even the smile has this kinda of sinister sadness behind it. I just keep watching it, Phoenix's ability to portray emotion and information with a few slight facial expressions is amazing. &&Always the guy we love to hate.&&Hwacker &&[deleted]&&Which in and of itself was a reference to clothing.&&Which is indeed an homage to Little Caesar’s Pizza.&&There it is!&&This kills people Caaaaarl&&Maybe the article means he uses conscious control of his blinking as a technique then&&Prisoners is one of the few films that genuinely had me fucked up by the end of it&&That's not the only reason. 

The main reason they suck is they hire people who don't understand the characters. 

Did executive interference make Suicide Squad worse? Sure. Was it a terrible idea to hire a music video company to edit the movie? Absolutely.

But fix those mistakes and you still have a terrible movie, because David Ayer does not understand those characters. &&WHAT WOULD DO WITH OUT YOU, GO BACK TO RIPPIN OFF MOB DEALERS!&&That’s kind of the impression I got. Leto was much closer to the organized, comic book crimeboss joker. The movie just didn’t give him the material to be great at that &&I think a lot of the hate Leto got was his antics behind the scenes.&&I'd say one tier, but I'm definitely in agreement that if you need a character to give you a huge array of real human emotion, Phoenix is in that group. I think he's in the grouping of Hoffman, Cranston, Oldman. Did I commit sins in that? I'd argue that Joaquin has enough virtues to put him that category. Maybe they weren't the ones you value for your own personal top ten, but he has virtues none-the-less. Sadness is a virtue. Depressed smiling is a virtue, in the right setting. &&Leto in Dallas buyers club. 

Put respect on his name. &&'He enters Rome a conqoring hero... But what has he conqored?'

I like the idea of bruce walking terry through interrogating someone and suggesting some brutal stuff to get answers that make terry take a step back like ""old man, what have you seen or done to know this?""&&I agree with this completely. I also feel like an older batman is a much more tragic character. He never defeated his demons. To me an aged Bruce is a far more complex and interesting character. There's a lot of things they could do with that even if they don't decide to do TDK. And it wouldn't need to be high budget either. &&Let's just get Keaton to play himself in [Batmens] (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2ymwfp/my_pitch_for_the_greatest_movie_of_all_time/) with everybody else. &&He was pretty healthy looking in Batman Beyond as well.&&> or Keaton coming back in a The Dark Knight Returns kind of flick, shit would be crazy.

Warner Bros., pls.

I'd forgive you for *Batman v Superman* and *Suicide Squad* and *Justice League* if you actually did this.&&Nic would make an awesome Bizarro though.&&That would be pretty interesting ngl, I like Keaton &&Guess someone skipped Teen Titans goes to the movies&&Hot topic joker.. Perfect description. &&He was a perfect fit for a random member of the joker gang from Batman Beyond. &&I dunno. I actually respect what they tried to do with the Joker there. He represented a different kind of crazy, and I think it had real potential. I think it would have been better if you *only* saw him in flashbacks, though, with him being a lingering threat in the shadows.

It was a completely different style of Joker, and I respect that. No one will be able to do Jack Nocholson's Joker better than he did, and I doubt anyone could do Heath Ledger's Joker better than he did. They went with something completely different. I would say the end result was less successful, but I appreciated them not trying to copy someone else's style.

Also, whatever happened to that theory that Ledo's Joker was actually a past Robin, but got messed up by the *actual* Joker? I loved that theory, not because I hated Leto's Joker, but because it just added a really cool facet (and also explaining why this ""Joker"" was played by a relatively young heart-throb, and also why Harley Quinn fell in love with him).&&I liked Leto's character in Bladerunner. Though that may be more Villeneuve than Leto.&&Or Burt Reynol...... Fuuuuuck.....&&For sure, but it did reset the DC Universe so it's kinda everybody's problem&&Can't blame them for trying. They saw what Marvel was doing with far less marketable/known superheroes than the DC powerhouses. But yes... You can absolutely blame them for the horrendous execution, too.&&Yeah it sucks. &&Only because Batman passed on it, iirc. He wasn't down for the whole *face your biggest fear* test.

And it was just a yellow ring, not a special one or anything. &&Funny enough, Jack Nicholson stops one of his goons from destroying a Bacon painting in *Batman*.&&[MFW](https://giphy.com/gifs/optical-illusions-asap-science-aZ3LDBs1ExsE8)&&""You wanna know how I got these stretch marks?""&&The Blartiverse if you will.&&Pretty sure he thought 'nothing like a young sad boy'&&Live action Killing Joke-esque movie starring Joaquin Phoenix. Oh god yes&&Except as Mel Gibson's younger bro in Signs&&Which was an homage to Little Debbie.&&I had zero expectations going into it and was absolutely floored. Such a powerful movie that turned my assumptions of the title completely on its head.

Couple that with Sicario, Arrival, and BR2049 and I'm now totally smitten with Villeneuve. &&Not all of the comics have the “crimeboss” joker. A lot of them do very much portray the joker as an insane agent of chaos with no real motives aside from sowing discord and destruction.&&I wasn't aware of any antics behind the scenes, interesting.&&I don't think it's ridiculous to put him in that group. He goes toe-to-toe with Hoffman in *The Master*, and he might give the better performance. And Hoffman was one of the greatest actors ever, period.&&I would not put Cranston in the same category with any of the other names there, no disrespect to him, he's very talented, but definitely not on the same level.&&""AM I NOT MERCIFUL!?!?!?""

So fucking *good* man. Love me some Joaquin Phoenix.&&Yup, they were Children of God members when the kids were little and IIRC, the kids performed on street corners for money. &&I'd love to see Kevin Conroy himself as an elderly batman, but if that doesn't happen, Keaton does sound like a pretty awesome choice&&I think there's a Batman Beyond animated movie scene where Terry interrogates a criminal and gets good info and old man Bruce with a cane says, ""let me try"" and goes off into the background.

And then you just the guy all panicky ""OKAY OKAY I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING"".

And Terry asks someone with superhuman senses what he said and they just have a blank face, ""you.....dont want to know.""

Edit: what they said. I conflated two different scenes. The point is Batman is scary.&&Precisely right. Probing the line between good and evil is what makes Batman interesting.

Cops do unsavory things every day in pursuit of a more important and altruistic goal. This is the thrust of Batman's appeal.&&Who would be a good Terry alongside Keaton?&&I want Joel McHale as Blight.

Also, I want Donald Glover as old Static Shock. Shit, I just want Donald Glover as Static Shock.&&[deleted]&&He’ll never be more sinister than his role as Ray Kroc in The Founder&&>If you make keaton as gruff as Bruce was in the series I'm totally here for it. I like the idea of bruce walking terry through interrogating someone and suggesting some brutal stuff to get answers that make terry take a step back like ""old man, what have you seen or done to know this?""

You mean [this scene?](https://youtu.be/8w6pnWnqzWE)&&I say Keaton as Batman one more time, then Batman Beyond type old man status. An older, wiser Batman would be fantastic portrayal.
&&Basically Keaton could play a slightly less evil Vulture and it would be perfect.&&That's the short and curlies of it: no matter how much good Batman does he can never satisfy his drive for vengeance or vindication. There can never be enough criminals taken off the streets to bring his parents back.

And I agree, a low budget Batman psychological thriller would be amazing.&&Especially a revealed batman - where the world knows who he is. Instead of giving up the fight, he gives up being Bruce. He goes all-in. &&One of the best moments to come out of the DC mess was Bruce Wayne taking a moment to reflect upon Robin's costume. What a great standalone movie that would be - just hit the ground running since we know these characters already, and tell us how The Joker and Harley killed poor little Robin, fucking destroyed Batman but he still keep his shit together enough not to kill them.

Who knows what they think they are going to do with Batman now. Too bad he's not Marvel ;)&&My ONLY gripe about wanting Keaton to return in Batman Beyond is that The Joker is long dead in that story line. And I desperately want to see an older Joker, too. Except I don't want Nicholson. Not a chance. I want Mark Hamill. More than any actor there is. Hamill deserves to get to play him on screen. 

I guess if Hamill deserves it, so does Conroy. But the difference is Conroy isn't a prolific screen actor. Even though he would be fine. You need names to sell it. Hamill is a big enough name.

So what if we retcon the Burton films, but give Keaton the Batman role? And just pretend Hamill was The Joker all along and he didn't die in Batman 89? Then you can go all out by getting a big box office draw to play Terry. I'd be all in on this, except I wouldn't want Burton to come back as director. His best work is in the past. And I have a sneaking suspicion he would find a way to cram Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in there, and that would kill any credence the film would have for me. Also, Burton's Gotham would look so stupid on screen in 2018. It's something about modern filmmaking techniques. City sets in studios are so obvious now. Look at the Justice League reshoots. God that scene SUCKED. Hell, even The Narrows in Batman Begins is quite obvious. &&I too liked Leto's Joker, like you said, it was a Joker that suited Harley.  In reality the Suicide Squad Joker is the kind of person that might actually get a sit down with a cartel boss.  Besides, no matter who tried first, they were following Ledger's swan song, he set the bar too damn high.  Joaquin is fortunate that someone else broke the ice, now we can all go back to accepting the fact that other actors are going to have to play Joker.&&>I dunno. I actually respect what they tried to do with the Joker there. He represented a different kind of crazy, and I think it had real potential. I think it would have been better if you only saw him in flashbacks, though, with him being a lingering threat in the shadows.

My primary issue with Leto's Joker is that it reduced Joker to a run-of-the-mill kind of crazy. Joker is not a psychopath. Psychopathy is, likely, one part of his composition, but there's a lot more. In fact, it's one of his defining features that his criminal behavior defies conventional and well-understood archetypes.

I don't blame Leto for this. I think with a different script and different character concepts, he has the acting chops to portray Joker extremely well, and be regarded highly even in company such as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger.

It's just poorly thought out. Joker had no reason to be prominent in it, and should have been just sparingly shown solely in the context of Harley's character development, growing to understand how she's in an abusive relationship where her sole value to Joker is being used as a tool to antagonize Batman. They made the mistake of trying to flesh out too much of Joker instead, and used unnecessary fillers that don't really fit.

This is also one of my big concerns with this upcoming Joker movie. Joker, as a character, is meant to be understood in the context of his relationship to Batman. He doesn't really have an origin story. He frequently makes shit up about his past as an unreliable narrator, and that's a canon feature of the character. There is a recent Three Jokers story that is starting to explore this in interesting ways, under the idea that there have actually been three distinct individuals under the Joker persona in Batman's past. To do a Joker movie that is set at a time long before Bruce Wayne became Batman doesn't seem like it can capture what needs to be captured. I'd love to be proven wrong, and obviously I have full faith in Joaquin Phoenix to do a great acting job, but I just worry that the material he's given to act may be bad in and of itself.&&Relatively young? Leto is pushing 50&&I haven't [used this](http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/) in a long time.&&But it happens because Flash fucks the timeline...&&They went too fast.

In the countless times I've seen the movie, I don't think I've ever seen the extended edition. I'm pretty sure I need to change that.&&Keaton would be the best of any. You see that edge when he was the Vulture, and how he effortlessly went back and forth to nice dad to murderous psychopath. &&Batman Beyond with Conroy/Keaton as Batman and Hamill as the Joker. Take all my goddamn money.&&It's a justice League episode where they go to the future and younger batman meets terry and then older batman https://youtu.be/PETk8eBbfN0&&You mixed it up a bit. Older Bruce interrogating a criminal (Ghoul) was from The Once and Future Thing Part II. Everyone saw and heard what he did. Younger Batman had to play good cop in that situation. Turns out dangling someone over a ledge by their leg one-armed doesn't get the answers needed.

The thing with Batman's quiet threat was when the League needed info from another different villain. Batman separated himself from the others and quietly said something to the guy in question. He very quickly and loudly said he'd talk. Wonder Woman asked Superman what Bats said and he responded ""You don't want to know.""&&According to Kevin Conroy, it was “I know where you live.”&&WB: Nah, let's just have him start killing people with hardly any explanation.&&There is that comic where Wonder Woman use here lasso on herself, Superman and Batman. They go around tell each other their real name. WW- Diana, Supes Kal-,  Batman says ""Batman"". 
&&Thats the main point, right? The Joker is a direct counterpoint to Batman and only “makes sense” when lined up beside him. Trying to break Batman is his core motivation.&&Good points all of them.

It's kinda like dog years.&&Dat babyface&&Or Jeffrey Dean Morgan again&&Absolutely. I'm not saying it isn't a Flash story&&In DC's defense, Marvel needed those 6 movies. They were working with mostly second-tier heroes (in terms of mainstream popularity) and had to establish them. Batman and Superman on the other hand are the two most popular and successful comic book characters ever. I think jumping right to Batman v Superman was a fine decision in and of itself, it was the in-movie decisions that were bad. &&Probably. But I I think they could have gotten away with a crossover simply because everybody is very familiar with Batman/Superman. And they had a decent set up with Bats being pissed about what took place in Man of Steel. But there were so many things that were wrong with BvS. They introduced Wonder Woman too early, she should have had her solo debut first, Lex was awful, Doomsday was completely unnecessary, the whole thing was just so bloated.  &&Technically he wasn't but that's a whole other story &&It's been years, and that story was one hell of a crazy ride.

At 0:38 we see Nick Fury with a ice bag on his left side of his face(lost eye side).&&I admit I was turned off by Larson’s voice in this too, but then I was reminded of Spider-man’s reveal in that Civil War trailer (the most unenthusiastic sounding one liner possible) compared to how he was in the movie and I got high hopes.&&Any trailer that has Brie Larson punching an old lady in the face is a good trailer by my standards. &&Kinda digging that ""BWOOOOOOOOOO"" noise in the background&&r/movies: ""Don't spoil the movie in the trailer""

Also r/movies: ""This trailer doesn't tell us anything!""

Bitch bitch bitch.&&If the trailer is accurate and the Kree seemingly tied Carol to a machine and wiped her memories essentially, then it'd give her plenty of reason to turn on them once she realized what colossal A-holes they can be.

\*punches an old lady in the face\*&&""Hey, hon, what're you watchin?""

""It's the trailer for that new movie with Bree Olson, coming soon""
 
""Ah, Captain Marvel, I know .. wait, who's Bree Olson? You mean Brie Larson, right..?""

"" (ahh, fuckfuck) Yeah, yeah, her, that's what I meant""

""But who's Bree Olson..? Nevermind, googling it""

""nooo^ooo^ooo""&&Is it just me or are all her lines delivered super flat? It’s like she’s just reading them or something &&Pretty whelming trailer. If I knew the character more I think I might be more excited about it but it seems pretty by the numbers from that alone. &&If this movie takes place in the 90's, does this not contradict Fury saying in Avengers 1 that the presence of Thor ""confirmed"" that there were extraterrestrials?&&The mohawk!!&&This movie seems to have less action and more drama. More of a spider man homecoming tone, than guardians &&Samuel L. Jackson leaning hard into the ""aren't you Laurence Fishburne"" joke with that hair and sunglasses! &&I was expecting Pulp Fiction look of Samuel Jackson....but he looks nice like that

Also, young Coulson looks dope.&&Yeah, average person doesn't know Skrull are shapeshifters and they don't say it in the trailer, so you're left thinking she actually went and clocked Meemaw.&&You have any idea how much courage it takes to sock an old white lady in the jaw in suburban Arlington?

Not all hero's wear capes.&&TIL I'm a hero&&""How did you know she was a Skrull?”

“What’s a Skrull?”&&Punch enough old ladies, and eventually, one will be a Skrull.&&There should be a sequence of trial and error where she'll just randomly sock people in the jaw she suspects of being a Skrull until she gets the ""tells"" down pat.

&#x200B;

That would totally be worth the price of admission to see her punching old ladies, priests, children, etc.&&The reason she's not on Earth for the snap is because she literally killed 5 innocent old ladies.

Edit: please reread the statement. She wasn't on earth because she punched old ladies. It's a joke. Not that she avoided the snap. Not that the snap only affected earth (I don't feel so good). Literally just a joke that they kicked her off earth for beating up geriatrics. &&Put on the glasses or start eating that trashcan Fury!&&The last time he trusted someone, he lost that eye.....trusting his roommate to move the coffee table.&&Kinda like *Hot Tub Time Machine*. I love it.&&I honestly think this is exactly what's going to happen, except without the comedic ending of course. The scar above his eye already hints towards that.&&He once said, [""the last time I trusted someone I lost an eye.""](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/42e698d7-fb68-4e11-a2bf-bc2731848204)

So I think he'll lose it in some sort of betrayal.&&This happened in Harvey Birdman attorney at law when they had an orientation video with his boss who wears an eyepatch. It was hilarious.&&[Kinda like this?](https://youtu.be/xh4k8nFQpGM?t=85)&&""I can do this all day!""

*punches 4 other grandmas*&&Hitting old ladies isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But this... does put a smile on my face.

Amazing.&&I hope the entire last third of the movie is Carol and Fury punching random people in the street while X Gonna Give It To Ya plays in the background. &&The antagonists of the movie are shape-shifting aliens, I think, so that's what she's punching.

Or maybe she really doesn't like the elderly.&&[Our hero](https://imgur.com/gallery/Nndo1gO)&&i hope we see more of her just punching random people in the face.&&I maed dis https://i.imgur.com/7wjqLG1.gif&&I wanted to bully myself for laughing and knowing that the old lady is most likely a Skrull.&&I can already see that shot being 2019's biggest meme.&&> Everyone’s saying that the old lady is a Skrull, but what if “Captain Marvel” is a Skrull in that scene and the Skrull is trying to ruin Captain Marvel’s reputation?

Then that Skrull had better make sure to kick some puppies and stick a few cats up in some trees while she's at it.
&&I'M LUKE CAGE!&&Cant just pack the beginning of the movie with origin stuff, it gets boring.

Holy fuck boys... lets all get in line for Twilight: The Last Stand.&&Exactly what I thought. I feel like it was just poor editing for the trailer. Most of the lines didn't seem natural and were kind of forced &&Not as flat as that old lady's face after that super-punch. &&and then she punches a granny, that's what makes it great.&&Don't know her but is she the type of demigod like Thor that her powers are sky high without magic stones or weapons?&&All I needed&&As someone said on /r/shield: ""He looks like Tintin.""&&The fucking record scratch!&&Rob Schneider is *A Carrot*!

Hopefully he has a good 10-15 min role. But I'm seeing it for Coulson too.&&Clark Gregg has got to be a lot cheaper to de-age than Jackson. The fact that his de-aging seems to be 90% hair and makeup gives me hope that he’s going to have a lot of screen time. I love Jackson, but I just don’t see him pulling off the emotional scenes of helping someone regain their humanity the way Gregg can.&&Found the /r/shield subscriber&&It's actually Maria Rambeau: Monica's mother.&&I hope she finds out and JOINS Carol on the crusade against old people.&&yeah, I always imagined her voice as a little bit, idk, gruff when I was reading the comics &&Bad dubs/cuts it looks like. There was probably some music or something playing in the car scene that disrupts the flow of the trailer music so they just had her voice over the lines. The words hardly look like they're coming out of her mouth. The other lines sound like they're mostly taken from a title roll (like Spiderman talking about how he's not an ordinary guy to the audience before the film starts), because they're read in a weirdly detached tone. 

&&I'd give my left nut to be as good-looking as middle aged Jude Law with a receding hairline.&&No streaming service UI will ever match the wonder of aimlessly wandering around Blockbuster. I would often walk out with a movie that was not a new release, just seemed interesting upon meandering around &&Well, just a tip then: the new *Girl in the Spider's Web* trailer spoils the entire plot. 

This Captain Marvel teaser was just fine. Give me the tone of the movie; show us the characters we know and some powers.&&They are very stilted. &&I think it's more of what has been until now called a teaser. Here is Nick Fury doing the voice, here is her in the suit and some of her powers, Blockbuster and his face tell you it's the 90s, seems like she doesn't remember much from before her powers, here is Phil Coulson with hair. &&Isn't this what people always ask for though? Don't spoil the movie. Especially when this is just a teaser trailer, not even the real trailer. But I do agree, nothing about it made me think wow I absolutely can't wait for it like the feeling from seeing the trailers for the first Iron Man way back in the day. &&Yeah, the coolest thing I got from it was Sam Jackson's vibe (surprise surprise)...sounds like a griseled cop who's set to retire.&&It was just a bunch of one-second blipverts of standard movie “cool” stuff. Here’s a scene of a character dramatically removing sunglasses.  Here’s a dolly shot behind a character walking down a narrow hall. Here’s a clenching fist. Here’s like ten clenching fists. Here’s standing in an almost superhero pose and looking around slowly. Here’s eyes glowing and some vague fire looking cgi coming out of them. Here’s blowing hair. Here’s snappy one liners. Here’s some anachronistic cultural references. 

It’s paint-by-numbers filmmaking. Or at least trailer making. &&Same as I feel. Know nothing about the character, trailer was fine. Not really swinging either way on this.&&I actually didn't think the mohawk would be featured in her first movie. So glad it is.  Super badass.&&I know it’s a skrull, but just the juxtaposition between the two is really funny to me&&That is why you’ll discover what makes her a hero; you think she clocked Meemaw, but she she actually saved the Earth.&&I'm sorry, Skrulls are coming to the MCU?

Depending on what is, origin stuff can be pretty interesting like Captain America's and Iron Man's, whose origins were the most captivating parts of the movie.&&This is very different from Spider-man on every level. Most audiences don't know shit about her for starters. I'm okay with an origin story as long as it has stakes, is interesting, and just as action packed. Spider-man at his core is just a high school kid going around and hanging without his powers. Captain Marvel is a badass cool pilot who is flying experimental tech and doing dope shit in planes. If you can't make that origin story interesting then you have no creativity.&&I don't think Spiderman is a good example, mainly because we had two origin stories and the general audience kinda knows spidey's origin.

I remember when I was in the movie theater and Brie started singing, I made a mental note to remember some lyrics so I could Google it later. 

Edit: Whoops, I meant movie theater.&&I believe Metric themselves have said they prefer her version. Pretty much Edgar Wright and Brian Lee O'Malley wanted a Metric sounding song for Clash at Demon Head and Metric were like ""We wrote this song that we felt sounded too much like Metric even for Metric so we haven't released it yet. You should use it"". Then Metric released their version along with the movie &&For comparison, [Metric](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obV-OL3TwXo)

Basically, the comic's origin story is that the Kree (same race as Ronan the Accuser) are in an eternal war against the Skrull and she gets caught up in it and genetically modified by a biological weapon of the Kree.

The tweak is to explain why Carol Danvers would have amnesia.&&Like Green Lantern?    &&I always like the scene in origin stories where the super hero first uses their abilities.

The thing with their old movies is that the trailer tended to play up the charisma of the character. There is no hook, and they didn't actually give you anything to like about the character so there is just nothing to go on with the trailer. &&[deleted]&&Isn't Hulks power limitless (in theory)?&&I can't stress enough how important it is to introduce these elements to the general audience for Marvel.

For starters, other than the fact that it's sending an emergency signal into space... pagers from the 90s wouldn't have pixel art.&&Fake hues.&&Pretty much. It's part of the reason why bigger TV's have what is known as input lag when playing games on a console. It's when you move the stick or hit a button that there's just the tiniest delay between your character doing it on the screen and when you input the command. The tv is running calculations on the image that it's receiving from the console to try to make the framerate smooth or to upscale it to 4k so it takes just a tiny bit of added time to show you what you pressed is happening.

 Most TV's have a gaming mode now where it completely disabled these features and just shows raw video from the console, so at least they got it mostly sorted out&&It sucked.&&yup and the suit&&Not true, John Hamm is so handsome that he gets everything he wants and ends up being really bad at it but he thinks that he's an expert because no one wants to tell him that he's bad.

Report: Netflix apparently shut down its user review platform because of the increasingly bad reviews its original programming received for years,40420,9dvska,https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/netflix-user-reviews-originals/,3574,1536336511.0,,"Big thing to note here is this is not proven. The original article is not very long, does not show where the data came from, and makes wild accusations. Is it possible Netflix did this to hide bad reviews of their own shows and films? Oh most definitely. Is it proven? Absolutely not

And for anyone who says they don't like serious Bateman but liked Breaking Bad you're insane. Do you remember Hal in his underpants as a stressed out dad with shitty kids.

All the shows I am currently watching are mixed around in the list with no rhyme or reason. Worse yet the pictures for said shows will randomly change each time I go back I have to play where's Waldo again.

For like one week I noticed the shows I was currently watching would be at the front of the list and it was great. Then a week later it went back to randomly placing them all over the place again. I don't know if that was intentional or not but simple changes like that would make Netflix much better for me.&&I definitely hate that they added the auto play mechanism. It is really obnoxious, let me hit play trailer if I’m interested. The UI is quite a bit better than Prime though, Prime feels like something from an early 2000’s start up before they make it big and get polished.&&Yeah but have you tried Hulu's&&It's fucked for me. On my TV it always puts ""continue watching"" at a random place, so I have to scroll forever to find it :(&&Netflix use to have a really good UI, then they adopted this bullshit ""mobile on desktop"" bullshit.

If I try to browse sci-fi, for example, only love 25 movies are displayed. Wtf. It should pop up a reel of all the sci-fi movies so I can scroll through. &&That autoplay shit is going to make me cancel my service, after years of subscribing. Give me settings, or I quit. &&I love the generic ass music that plays with no relation to the actual programming.

&&I've learned most people have figured out for recommendation systems that almost everyone treats the recommendation systems as a binary scale (ie you give something good ratings (either 5 or 4 stars) or bad ratings (1 or 2 stars) and just reducing it to 0 or 1 normalizes the difference between people's understanding of what 5 stars means vs 1 star vs 3 stars (which almost no one uses). Additionally binary categories often allows the matrix factorization to work better. Basically don't blame Netflix blame idiots who don't know how to rate things&&Works ok on Pornhub.

They say pretty explicitly that this is just speculation. &&Just confirming what everyone already knew, really&&Don't offer anything in this category: bollywood. &&They probably got rid of that button for the same reason.

I still don't rate as often, but when I do, this is how I do it because I refuse to use thumbs up/down.&&Idk if MoviePass is the right comparison. That was a ridiculous gamble.

Netflix is getting too complacent about some things like Blockbuster did. You know that company Netflix murdered.&&You'd think Netflix going up and up would mean they could see everything and reach far but it appears the only thing that has went up at the Netflix headquarters is heads up asses..&&>how Netflix is getting more and more abrasive to the fact that customers exist. 

I agree, and the *horrible* user-unfriendly interface of their app/website is only adding to that general feel.&&When you stop seeing customers as people and start seeing them as ATMs.&&They'll be trying to force advertisements on people every six months until people quit bitching and let it happen.  Getting rid of user interaction on the service is just the first step to making sure people can't complain together.&&Their path reminds me of Steam. First it was a revolution in digital distribution for video games and created a platform for games outside of the mainstream. They were cool and new. Steam did crazy insane cheap sales and community alternate reality viral marketing, Netflix got rid of all the hassle and ads from tradition TV and brought back Arrested Development. Remember Max? The little game that helped you pick something to watch? How fun and original! They ""got it"". Then they became a giant, and they grew colder. What started feeling like something special became a machine printing money. And like Steam I think they'll stay one of the big dogs, but as it rests on its laurels they'll slowly lose their dominance and goodwill of the consumer. They'll be utilized simply out of precedent as customers grumble and grumble a little bit more under their breath. &&Tbf, they can't just buy already-run popular shows for relatively cheap anymore. There's the Netflix-Amazon-Hulu competition, the shows are already spoken for, or other reasons. Plus, for every Office/Parks and Rec bought by Netflix, the TV networks had a ton of stinkers they had to develop. I think this is just what's happening to the streaming services making their own content.

Of course, this doesn't directly address them taking down public ratings, but may explain why there's a perceived change in quality. I'm just waiting for one of them to pick up The Fresh Prince. &&Then the rest of the dominos will fall like a house of cards.

Checkmate.&&Bojack, Ozark, Punisher, Disenchantment, Stranger Things, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Castlevania to name a few! 

They've got some real bangers on there. I think they've done a decent job of populating their original programming line-up with at least *something* that nearly everyone can enjoy. &&Do people not like Narcos?&&Bojack Horseman?!&&Give The Ritual(movie) a try. Not into horror movies so i put it on the other day to fall asleep and ended up watching the whole thing. Really good movie imo&&Stranger things, and altered carbon were pretty good&&You fell in the trap.

""Netflix Original"" simply means that Netflix has exclusive streaming rights in your country. It does NOT mean the show was financed and/or produced by Netflix, and it does not mean ""original programming"" in the sense that everyone usually means.

For example, Star Trek Discovery is a CBS show available exclusively on CBS All Access (CBS lame attempt to have its own streaming platform.) In the US and Canada, that is. Elsewhere in the world, Netflix has the streaming rights. And yet, Netflix advertises this show as a ""Netflix Original""

But Netflix also produces its own series (ranging from meh to pretty good) and movies (mostly mediocre), and also calls them ""Netflix Originals"", so they're confusing everyone on purpose, probably for the same reason why they shut down its user review platform; to make it looks like they have better original content than they actually do.&&Godless is worth a watch &&Everyone forgets about Narcos. That show is damn good.&&Not even Stranger Things reddit circlejerks about?&&God, I tried to as well, I think I lasted two episodes.  

A new level of awful.
&&I have a friend who insisted it's good. Couldn't make it through the first episode&&I think it's just the ""throw everything at the wall and see what sticks"" approach...

They've had quite a few winners:

Punisher is fantastic,

Stranger Things is fantastic,

Mindhunter is fantastic,

First season of GLOW was pretty good,

American Vandal was fantastic,

Series of Unfortunate events was pretty good at times,

House of Cards *was* really great, but I haven't liked the more recent seasons as much,

Master of None has some good episodes, and some shit ones,

Orange is the New Black started out really great as well but has felt a little tired in recent seasons,

First 2 seasons of Narcos are awesome,

Bojack Horseman, the Crown, Manhunt: Unibomber...

They've honestly had a *lot* of great content, they've just also had a *lot* of terrible content as well. 

Edit: Getting a lot of replies so I'd just like to add that this list is totally opinion based! I forgot a bunch of stuff for sure (Ozark being a big one that I actually loved) but overall it's good that everyone likes different stuff! I think the main take away is that by throwing *so much* stuff out there, they are bound to find some stuff that works for different kinds of audiences! They definitely aren't batting 100% (or even close to it) but they also aren't throwing out 100% trash either, and that's an important distinction. I hope they get a little more selective going forward, now that they've established they *can* produce some great content. But overall I think the strategy has been working for them thus far.&&Have you seen their latest adult cartoon Paradise PD? It's pretty horrible.&&I’m pretty sure that was because Amy Schumer’s special tanked and had a 1/2 star rating&&My mom never updated her smart TV and still has star ratings.

Don't know how new shows have them, but they sure as hell do&&The star rating was a rating of what Netflix thought you would think about it based on your other ratings, it wasn't a cumulative user rating. If Schumer's special had half star it's because according to other things you watches you were unlikely to enjoy it. I'm not defending her special just pointing out the stars didn't work like many people posting think they did.&&But, does particle man get wet, or does water get him instead?&&Is it, though?&&""Netflix, you're greenlit""&&It’s almost like... they are producing a lot of different things to see what interests their users have. There are a lot of shows that everyone boosts up that I think are just plain stupid. &&They answer the phone “Thank you for calling Netflix, you’ve been greenlighted” &&The Leather Special.  And I watched it with my GF and tried to have an open mind, but it was just terrible.

There were jokes about her weight, but they were like complaints about people on the internet making jokes about her weight, so it was hard to know when it was supposed to be funny (whenever it was, it wasn't).

There were jokes about her having sex, and how it's effected by her weight, which again was kind of weird because it's like she wanted to be self-deprecating, but also wanted to make fun of the people on the internet making fun of her, and I couldn't tell where the joke was supposed to land.

I was going to continue but I think I covered everything.&&Bill Nye certainly didn’t save the world, and definitely didn’t save Netflix Either. 

And then Death Note. &&Which one?&&Mistake 1: make any show related to Amy Schumer. 

&#x200B;&&I can't even tell whats an original or not any more because they slap their logo on anything they acquire exclusive streaming rights to, regardless of if it's been on tv for 10+ years. Unless I hear really good things about specific originals (like disenchantment) I just scroll right past em every time.&&You mean like trying to cram ""Father of the Year"" into the ""Critically Acclaimed Historical Drama"" section? 

They totally fuck their preference algorithm when it comes to their bullshit originals. At least make them actually in the genre&&Same. In fact if Netflix promotes something I automatically assume it sucks. &&If only they had a better selection&&Amazon, in 2018, has absolutely no excuse for being such a shit-tier streaming service.

So many foreign films for example, don't even have the option to watch them subtitled! I'm not talking about just anime (although that does piss me off), but even stuff like Kung Fu movies. I wanted to watch Kung Fu Hustle with a buddy the other day, PAID for it off Prime, only to realize there was no option for the original chinese language! It was shitty English dub ONLY. No fucking excuse! Both options are on the DVD for fucks sake.

To add to that, they refuse to play nice to Apple so you can't even purchase their content through Apple TV like you can do with *literally every other god damned service*. You have to open up your damn laptop and rent the movie off the internet site, then hope its available now on Apple TV.

Soon we will enter the third decade of the 2000s, and we have such amazing technology that, as usual, continues to be fucked up by dumb greedy corporations.&&And the Netflix original stuff.....lets be honest, it's not that great. Some of it is ok.&&This article is not talking about the star rating, it is talking about actual written reviews.

The fact that nobody even knows there were written reviews is probably a hint as to the real reason Netflix is removing them (which is just now happening).&&Most people wouldn't have noticed they were gone at all if it hadn't made the news.  They were pretty hard to find since the star ratings disappeared.&&...Football Cream&&Nailed it.&&Apple sauce &&Beer me, Tuna. &&It amazes me how often people overlook how incredibly dumb Andy can be. He has some of the dumbest moments of anyone on that show, even before they all started to get heavily Flanderized. &&Ever heard of it?&&It's spelled Colonel, it's the highest rank in the military&&where'd you go? Cor-NOT university?&&It's pronounced Colonel and it's the highest rank in the military.&&I know that it’s pathetic to re-live your college years, but cut me some slack, Okay?

When I got the nickname ""Boner Champ,"" that is when I became me.&&Aloha and... hello&&Nifty gifty&&The best part of that is it completely works&&Beer me. It gets a laugh like a quarter of the time. &&It has gotten even worse than this (at least on my amazon fire). Now not only do they keep getting moved around but you can only scroll in one direction. So if the show you want to watch is in the last spot in your queue you can't just go left once you have to scroll all the way through everything to get to it.&&Shouldn't shows your currently watching be in the 'continue watching' section? For example you finish episode 1 of Stranger Things, then stranger things should be in your continue watching section which is listed chronologically from the last time you played that show.

It doesn't fix shows you want to start but haven't, but once you start a show you should use continue watching instead.&&The search function is also pretty useless. It shows you movies/shows with the terms you searched for, *plus* ""related titles"", whatever the hell that means. So basically you search for ""Keanu Reeves"" or whatever, and it shows you the titles with Keanu Reeves plus... a bunch of other shit. With no indication of how, if at all, Keanu Reeves was involved with the title or which ones are just thrown in randomly/algorithmically.&&They could at the very least separate series from movies.

Maybe a way to browse by categories. This movies looks interesting but I'm looking for a nice comedy right now, not this Hungarian tear jerker about the holocaust. &&[deleted]&&I subscribe to both prime and Netflix and I still watch a lot of my old pirated shit on Kodi because the UI is so much better.&&No kidding, anyone who doesn’t like nexflix must have never tried to navigate the horror show that is Hulu’s newer ui.&&What, eight clicks to get to a different episode of a show you're in the process of watching isn't enough?&&No. There is no possible way they have, unless their device is from the bizzaro universe. 


The Hulu app is so bad. It's so fucking bad. I thought it was bad prior to the current interface. I didn't think it could get any worse. Holy shit was I wrong. It's almost impressive how much worse they made it.



There's part of me that hopes it was on purpose and upper management knows. Like, they enjoy frustrating people so much that the app secretly records you when you're trying to use it. Then they listen to the recordings in a board room where they all cackle about what they did. 


I hope that's what's going on, because it makes more sense than how much of a piece of shit their app is. &&No kidding, it’s like opening the fucking Necronomicon every time I want to watch an episode of the damn Golden Girls &&Yeah at least on Netflix it's just randomly changing position, on Amazon the Continue Watching is missing half the time.&&Yeah, I find myself sort of not rating things because it's not totally terrible but it's not good either. I wish there was some sort of system that allowed more nuance like maybe odd number of celestial objects, maybe seven moons or thirteen meteorites. Maybe someone will work out the kinks sometime and put it in.&&Also known as a “floor effect”&&I mean, they're both zero stars in a five star system, too.

&&45% match *because you liked similar surprises*&&Using Netflix. Two stars.&&Two stars is too high. &&In their defense, blockbuster tried to do a streaming service, they weren't QUITE as daft as everyone thinks... They partnered with a huge company that definitely had the power to get something like that off the ground. That company... Was Enron.&&> Netflix is getting too complacent 


Netflix is facing a problem they saw years ago. What it takes to run a Netflix service is easily attainable by any major studio. Why license your shows and movies when you can offer your own service and have full control?&&You’re becoming the one you swore to destroy!&&Same for Amazon. They have huge profits but continue to cut the value in their prime membership including shows.&&[deleted]&&Still better than hulu so they don't care&&Netflix's culture is ""data-driven"".&&Foot in the door technique. I've been saying this for years like an old man yelling a cloud. And like so everybody says shut up old man Netflix is bae they won't betray us.&&Ya know, Steam is garbage as a discovery system for games now, but its core service has been unimpeachable almost.  They've never eliminated a feature I highly valued, moved or hid my library repeatedly, shoved annoying autoplay crap I can't get rid of everywhere, force me to stop a game mid play for no reason, etc.  Netflix has gotten worse over time, Steam is just mostly stagnant.  &&Honestly though, what's so bad about steam nowadays? I've personally never had any issues with it. Genuine question.

On the other hand Netflix has actual problems like terrible UI, auto playing videos on everything when you're browsing (god I hate this so much), increasing cost for less content, the list goes on.

I really have no major complaints about steam. In fact I really like it.&&""Have the boy lay out my formal shorts.""

&#x200B;

""...you! You lay my formal shorts!""&&Literally just came from watching the domino brick-laying video.&&When I'm in charge, EVERY mission is a suicide mission&&I've found that their shows are vastly superior to their movies.

I can't remember a good Netflix original movie I've seen.&&The Crown!!!&&House of Cards was great for 2 seasons.&&Ozark is fucking awesome&&Castlevania literally has 4 episodes and came out a year ago, unless something changed recently... *Edit:* New episodes in October! Cool!&&I honestly think Big Mouth doesn't get enough love, I really liked it. &&Is Devilman Crybaby also exclusive? That's good too &&What about Love? Love is a really solid dramedy&&Mindhunter was fantastic.&&Disenchantment has potential to be good, but it's not there yet.

For a serialized Groening show, it's very inconsistent both internally and in production quality.

Hoping it finds its stride in part 2.&&Bill Burr's original, F is for Family, is hilarious and a dark look at 70's Americana. Gender roles, racism, worker's rights, child rearing, politics, drug abuse. It has so many interesting criticisms, I highly recommend it. Definitely an underappreciated show. If you like Bojack, it has similar types of criticisms, but with a distinctly different flavor of comedy, and aimed at a different time period and setting than modern Hollywood.&&Trailer Park Boys.

I get they bought it rather than created it from scratch, and a few of the *Netflix* seasons are fairly inferior to the original stuff, but overall it's a great show and improved a lot in the last two seasons  to bring it a bit closer to the feel of the old stuff.

I don't know where it goes from here having very sadly lost one of its main/best actors/characters in John Dunsworth, but even if someone's just going back and watching the old stuff that Netflix bought it's really worth it.

It's not for everyone I'm sure, but, it's a wonderful show that really grows on you and early on featured a lot of great, subtle stuff mixed in.&&Disenchantment is pretty shit&&I almost never see it mentioned in these conversations. The show is so damn good.&&Had to scroll pretty far down to see Narcos, really immersive probably my favorite Netflix original&&It is excellent.  Especially the first two seasons. &&I loved it. I also loved Ozark, Mindhunter, Daredevil, Punisher, and Peaky Blinders. I'm sure there's others I can't think of at the moment. &&i am ready to get emotionally destroyed again&&Season 5 in a week!&&Back in the 90's I was in a very famous tv show...&&You put on horror movies to fall asleep!? What kind of bad ass are you? &&Haven't watched season 2 yet, but Ozark is really good. Then there's the Marvel shows, but I'm not sure if those count.

Edit: Forgot Disenchantment. That show is great.&&Stranger things is great.  Altered Carbon is one of the prettiest shows I've ever seen but the acting was bad, the story was bad, the writing was bad, the dialog was bad (perhaps a reason for the acting being bad?).

I hope the second season is better.&&to be fair, [Netfix fronted most of the money for Star Trek Discovery Season 1](https://youtu.be/jLl17YXrAZY?t=3m12s)&&Yeah. Netflix has a lot of ""Netflix Original"" anime which just means that they currently have the only distribution rights to air. Netflix has partially funded some anime, but not nearly as much as they'd like you to believe came from them.

For example, the really great show Aggretsuko is a ""Netflix Original"" series. Except that its a Sanrio / Tokyo Broadcasting System Television / Fanworks production. &&Even networks do that too, though. Not sure which shows off the top of my head but I think FX or AMC had some Canadien shows but they were marketed as AMC (or whatever) originals. &&That was good I was just disappointed that it was only one season.&&Don’t forget Ozark! &&No love for season 3 of Narcos? I thought it was just as good as the first two seasons.&&Additionally they try and make stuff for many different audiences.  Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean someone else won't love it.&&I think Glow is being undersold on this thread. The second season was even better than the first.&&Bojack Horseman and Stranger Things are outta-the-park good.

&&Plus Kimmy Schmidt is pretty good&&>First season of GLOW was pretty good

Yo don't do my boy Marc Maron dirty like that. Both seasons are excellent. &&Honestly, this feels par for the course. There are no content distributors out there who are batting 1000. Networks come out with shows that don’t even make a 13 episode season because ratings are so bad. &&First off, Master of None was great. Period. Also, season 3 of Narcos was also impressive. &&I loved Altered Carbon&&Bruh, Black Mirror!&&I have really enjoyed Travelers. Been a fun show if it's a bit cheesy sometimes.&&The innocents is good. Requiem is really good. Dark was amazing. I absolutely loved The OA and it’s been signed up for 5 seasons now. Love was really good. Seven Seconds was good. Bloodline was amazing til the ending (something about being rushed because florida changed their tax laws?), 13 reasons why was good. They have a crap ton of good quality shows. &&Disenchantment is pretty fantastic too. Takes a bit to gain momentum but it's good.&&Don't sleep on Daredevil!&&Many of their exclusive comedy specials are great. &&lemme just throw my hat into the ring with castlevania being pretty damn good, this coming from somebody that went into it expecting to be disappointed. Looking forward to the second season.&&American vandal is basically summer heights high. Worth a watch if you haven’t seen it. 

&&I think it's the ""maximum return for minimum investment also here's good stuff cause some of you like that too"" approach&&Despite a lot of hate, I really enjoyed Bright also. &&Ozark, Narcos, Bloodline...

There's really quite a few awesome series.  I will admit that I don't really jump into a new show without first having it recommended to me, because, as you said, this is also a lot of shit.&&Kimmy Scmidt is a GOAT imho.&&Daredevil?&&Black Mirror!&&I saw the trailer and was thoroughly whelmed&&The one I saw last night was good. The one where the black cop shoots himself and then it gets plastered accross the new channels. The others so far have had some good moments but mostly just good for background noise. &&Hahahah.  I liked the star rating. &&And then she blamed the bad reviews on the alt-right. Because it obviously wasn't the fact that it was an hour of Amy Schumer making jokes about getting sexually assaulted by homeless people and her ""pussy"" smelling.&&Wish it had a 0 star rating &&I thought this was a myth? I heard there were talks of removing the 5 star rating long before that special came out.&&I tried watching it with my roommates and we all agreed to change it after about 15 minutes.&&Well that's their fault for hiring her to do it in the first place.

“Great what do you say we start you off with 2 million”&&Seriously -- Two and a Half Men was absolutely *terrible* (IMO) but immensely popular when it was on, but I don't complain when Netflix makes those types of shows because I know they're not for me.
 
And I'm willing to bet that the types of people who made these reviews were also not the types of people who would even like those shows to begin with, so I don't blame them for removing them.&&I agree with you. I think Master of None is absolute trash but plenty of people seem to really enjoy it.

I think I had read that Netflix spends over $7bn on content a year and it's only increasing. When you have that much money to throw around there's no reason to be picky.

Use the shotgun effect then produce a second season of anything that sticks and cut everything else. Rinse and repeat.&&I would have thought the sort of people that complain about this the loudest would be exactly the people who sympathised the most.  Like, you can't *still* be angry at fox for cancelling Firefly, but at the same time wonder why netflix makes a bunch of shows that only have a niche appeal.&&She's always been about self-deprecating, but it's way easier to do that when you're a mildly successful drunk rather than a global superstar.

But if that's the case, I would definitely rather wait several seconds more for the page to load than have to spend a minute or two navigating to the show I was watching.&&Kinda seems like half the reason this exists is to make their library look bigger than it is (in a way that I guess could legitimately help you find new stuff), but the other half is so they never have to show you a ""Sorry, we don't have that movie"" page, they can instead show you ""We don't have *that* movie, but here's 15 other movies that aren't the one you were looking for!""&&It's just designed to get you to scroll the content so you'll see something you might want to watch and add it to your list or start watching it.

Spectacular has some better fight scenes, but I like older Peter in the 90s show, and the villains and storylines just seem a lot more fleshed out.  Entire seasons devoted to a singular purpose (for example, season 2 was the ""Neogenic Nightmare"" storyline where Peter was transforming into Man-Spider).

I love all the Marvel cameos.  X-Men, Blade, Punisher, Captain America, Red Skull, Fantastic Four.  Hell, in one episode Spidey even dropped a Submariner reference.

(Also, I apparently learned that the 90s show was only released on DVD in PAL regions.  And because it was the 90s, PAL things like shows and video games had slightly different pitched sounds compared to NTSC due to 50hz vs 60hz tvs.  Thankfully the file I found of the 90s show includes dual-audio which pitch corrects it to sound exactly like how it originally did in North America.)&&When people talk McGuire vs Garfield vs Holland, they're all wrong.

Even then, Netflix streaming wouldn't take off in a meaningful way for another couple years. If Blockbuster actually cared about streaming video, they had all the time in the world to implement it. They just didn't care.

Not using Amazon search. It's deliberately terrible. &&My customers value data above reality as well. There’s this entire reliance on data as the main source of proof in industries that completely forgets the human element which is literally customers and they’re preferences.

I weep for the future &&That’s exactly what annoys me when companies go public. They become so scared about short term loses that they just play safe and don’t take risks anymore. &&This isn't necessarily a failure or shortcoming of data. User satisfaction is still data, they just aren't measuring appropriately or aren't accounting for it in their decision making.

My suspicion is that they are fully aware of user satisfaction and have concluded that the current dissatisfaction is acceptable for their current business plan.&&Yep.  I read some quotes form them bragging about how their godawful autoplay interface reduces user ""confusion"" and helps users find something they want to see faster.  And I'm like, no, the reason people spend less time ""wandering"" the library is because they're all like me and absolutely can't stand the autoplay crap so now they pick out what they want to see before ever opening Netflix, and then just go straight to the thing they want as fast as they can.  


Browsing titles on Netflix used to be fun, like browsing in a video store, but now it's like running a gauntlet of XTREME sports fans throwing screaming knives and chainsaws at you.  A friend of mine just quit out of annoyance at the autoplay videos and I'm pretty close myself.  They're deriving entirely the wrong answers from their data.  &&Steam isn't stagnant anymore. They are finally making changes that people have been asking for years. For example, now you can ignore specific games or games with specific tags and they won't appear anymore on your searches.&&The major issue is bad customer service. Besides that, I see criticism for sales bring lackluster these days. Nothing that bad, really, but some of the customer service horror stories I've seen are really scary. &&Kif! I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.&&If you are into horror or Lovecraft, I would recommend The Ritual. Great story and an even better monster that doesn't disappoint &&Beasts of No nation nuff said&&Siege at Jadotville was a great movie imo&&> I can't remember a good Netflix original movie I've seen.

And you just opened yourself up for hundreds of unsolicited Netflix movie recommendations. Enjoy that. &&Set It Up was pretty good for a romantic comedy. &&i don't feel at home in this world anymore was super fun (and occassionally scary) with elijah wood being a surrealist goof as per usual.&&The Fundamentals of Caring was great. I also liked Okja a lot but I don't know if anyone else cared for it. &&I watched the first episode months ago and thought it was a bit of a meh Breaking Bad rehash. finally gave the second episode a chance on Wednesday and now I'm halfway through season two. It gets real good real fast&&Season 2 in October.&&A full second season is coming out soon.  The four episodes were more of a prologue/experiment.&&And those 4 episodes were better than most of their shit. Full season 2 coming next month! &&Can't agree more. The date reveal video was nice too. &&I just broke up with my girlfriend yesterday so this couldn't come at a better time. &&I'm sorry, WHAT? This just made my day &&It's soothing.  They drown out the horror and screams when I close my eyes.  It's like using a fan for tinnitus :)&&If anything, I find horror movies infuriating, but the beginnings are always super slow, set the pieces, etc, so i fall asleep. I find them infuriating in the sense that characters are always cliches that make the absolute dumbest decisions, they don't develop, and the movie outcome itself is extremely predictable. 

The Ritual got me really into it from the get go, and i enjoyed it the whole way through. It isn't perfect, but i loved it&&Ozark season 2 has been pretty good from what I’ve seen so far. It’s gotten a lot darker though. 

It’s kinda weird watching that while re-watching arrested development though. &&Lots of people have been giving Disenchantment shit but I thought it was delightful. The secret to finding it enjoyable? Stop comparing it to The Simpsons and Futurama and let it stand on its own merits. But I get why that's asking too much of people (considering they do it with ANY project created by ANY person with previous projects).&&Yeah Ozark is a good time. A little bloated and the plot feels a bit too convenient at times, but overall really good. Haven’t finished S2 yet. &&Altered Carbon was good while it was still a murder mystery concept. Sure not everything was great in the earlier episodes but when dudes sister jumped into the equation and hijacked the plot it made everything stand out so much more. 

&#x200B;

Also wasn't a fan of how dude's random act of kindness to save the guy's daughter ended up being a huge piece of the plot in the end. It's like damn, cmon.&&The story was not bad, the writing was hit or miss, and the acting was tolerable. I really enjoyed this show, but I love Cyberpunk/dystopian sci-fi stuff so much. 

Also Poe was the coolest sci-fi character I've seen in a long time.&&I liked the story up until the end. Netflix shows seem to run out of steam pretty consistently in the last third or so IMO.&&> but the acting was bad

Joel Kinnaman to me is the worst but most popular actor out there right now, i'm constantly shocked at how much work he gets. &&This is how it is with a *lot* of shows, the networks don't actually make them. They're made by a production company who sells the show to the network, which is why a show canceled by one network can be picked up by another network.&&Part of what makes it good is that it good a story from beginning to end. Even movies these days are setup for a sequel half the time. I really appreciated that when the show ended all my questions were answered. &&Love this show. &&I'm just surprised how Narcos isn't always mentioned with the top Netflix shows. It's the best Netflix original IMO. And yeah, S03 was amazing! &&I was skeptical about S3 of Narcos but then it blew me away. They picked a great direction for the show to keep it fresh for a while.&&Some would even say better... &&I actually thought it was better than s1 and 2.

The Cali cartel was really interesting, and I also didn’t care much for Murphy or his wife.&&My girlfriend loves Insatiable for the trash that it is, so even if *I* personally dont like it that doesnt mean theres no audience for it; shes gotten like three other people to watch it too, so clearly there is a market for guilty pleasure shows

edit: just to be clear, Insatiable has great charm/acting its just ridiculous junkfood-esque television - I think its melodramatic and insane, but I *get* what people like about it&&It was like night and day. 

The first season was alright because I like wrestling and the cast and the characters a lot and it was enough for me to see it through. It was slow and a little tedious but the last two episodes were very good. 

The second season, though, took off like a rocket and I couldn’t finish it fast enough. It was more fun AND more emotional and all believable. Fantastic stuff &&Kimmy is top drawer imo. First show that has managed to scratch that 30-rock itch even a little.&&Sad that they’ve ended it. Where will I get my Titus Andromedon fix???&&The first season was great, second season was fantastic.&&Yeah there’s definitely a perception issue because Netflix isn’t having to pick winners and losers due to a limited number of time slots. All of their content, be it popular or not, stays on the platform.&&Yeah I must have missed these episodes of Master Of None that were ""shit"". &&you can't think so because the book is way betterer! - says someone for every film adaptation of a book ever made&&Dark is a show that needs to be watched by more people. &&Netflix has been pretty amazing for standup fans recently, at least I think so. I imagine it's been great for comics as well.&&Yep, I went in expecting it to be horrible based on people's reviews... But I actually really enjoyed it. It's an interesting, fun buddy movie&&I miss stars. I liked searching for the lowest rated shit possible, panning for so-bad-it's-good gold.&&Everyone did.&&Also might be because she steals a lot of other comedians material, people who are aware and actually care about something like that would make her a major turn off and people to see her negatively, despite for whatever reason they still keep putting her in movies....&&Ew&&I  find her funny sometimes but that leather special was horrible and not funny at all &&>my Schumer making jokes about getting sexually assaulted

I thought that was her special where she told the story about how she raped a guy in college&&Nah - negative stars.  She actually owes us stars.&&Triangle man, Triangle man...&&Yeah. I think Stranger Things is stupid and boring as hell. Yet it’s one of the most popular Netflix shows. &&I used to think she was really funny. But her comedy went from self-depricating to ""lol I'm gross and I'm slutty!"" and it's just not that good. &&I think it's because her behavior doesn't really make sense, self deprecating humor works really well if you keep the tone consistent. It also helps if you vary up your comedy a bit. Honestly it's a big part of why Jim Gaffigan's ""Hot pockets"" works so damn well.   


The fact is she doesn't understand humor&&Christ, dude.  

Uggghhhh that’s top tier cringe just reading it. &&I didn't like any of it. It's like an adult science show that turns into a talk show how they bring one person from the opposite side and then have 5 other people berate him. Yeah, thag person may be wrong but this is by no means a formal or informative discussion. &&[deleted]&&> best anime crime thrillers

I feel like I'm not in the target audience for that particular genre, but a large number of vocal people are and if you're going to do an adaptation with such a razor thin and dedicated audience, be sure to get it right.&&They didn’t even need to write it as a new IP.  If they had written it as the story of an American getting the Death Note, perhaps 5-10 years after the events of the anime, it would have only needed a few changes to be a solid B-movie.  Instead, they took names and characters with a lot of baggage behind them and just ran them through a blender so they could fit the United States mold.&&Tbf the three scenes with the...shinigami?...were all really cool. &&Cue forced laugh track&&Pretty sure they pay part of the production cost of BCS so it's partly a netflix original. But they have a Netflix logo on Peaky Blinders aswell which confuses me as it's purely BBC.&&Ditto to Star Trek Discovery, Orphan Black, and who knows what else. &&The title is so unremarkable, I thought they were talking about the Robin Williams movie. What was that, World's Greatest Dad? That one was pretty good.&&Yeah Happy Madison is a huge golden goose for them somehow, and I am sure Sandler et al are cheap as dirt compared to hunting for other production teams every time. 

People get high and watch the movies in droves, or keep hunting for feel good comedy (hit and miss style) so something about it must just work&&Why the fuck does Amazon make each season of a show a different listing? That's annoying as hell for navigating the content.&&Pinot noir caviar tell me who your real friends are!&&Poison gas&&Apple pie &&GRAY POUPON&&It’s pronounced “Cornell” and it’s the highest rank in the Ivy League!&&This is maybe my favorite line in the entire series.&&Did Broccoli Rob put you up to this?&&Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon &&what’s funny is once you scroll to the end of the list it takes you back to the beginning but then you can’t scroll back if you saw something you like at the end &&I've noticed sometimes they hide the ""continue watching"" section above where it loads you, so you have to scroll up - sometimes even up above the search option.&&So just like, all the streaming apps suck at UI design, then? Haha. 

I mean I agree. But what’s going on here it’s 2018. We have UIs for our refrigerators someone out there has to be able to make something functional. &&""Neutral isn't a stance, only good or bad.""

And then the blockbuster movie with the nine-figure budget decided their take on the saga would be ""It coincidentally lands five feet away from Peter and makes him dance like a douchebag.""&&> Man that alien suit saga was my shit. Must have seen all 3 tons of times

Hands-down best interpretation of the symbiote saga in any media (so far). Spectacular trails in second.&&This has to be a fan parody, there's no way this actually aired as the official finnish dubb, right?

Edit: asked a Finnish friend of mine. He said it's real.&&Can you find me this full episode? This sounds like they just pulled an unenthusiastic Finnish dude off the street and offered him a piece of sushi if he would read this out loud.&&Those cross over cameos were the best. Especially Secret Wars, where he flat out recruits a bunch of Marvel characters to help him fight the ultimate battle of good and evil&&It’s both amazing and *incredibly* dated.

I have extremely fond memories of the show, never missed an episode repeat or not, but it’s completely unwatchable for me now.&&Wait. You can't even thumbs up/down anymore?!

Edit: I just looked. It's still there on the browser version.&&I know it's supposed to be the dramatic sound but my first thought was the price is right ""failure trombone""&&Don't forget game fly!&&They had the opportunity to buy Netflix outright and it would have been less than half of their revenue just for late fees for the year. &&Yeah, that too but the idea that block buster didn't try to compete with streaming services at all which is the implication when someone says Netflix killed block buster is false. &&Oh shit, were we supposed to stop? &&And now my internet is 500times faster than 10years ago and the movies are only 20times bigger.&&More than that, this is why I’m not comfortable with the idea of physical media dying. At the very least, I need a personal digital library that plays offline with no DRM. I don’t like the idea of relying on a service that could die, cut out, or lose its media rights at any time. This is why stuff like Netflix and even Spotify has never been more than a supplement to me. I still hold on to physical media and personal digital copies for my favorite stuff, because unless it’s physically stripped from me, I’ll never lose it. And for music at least I have a cloud back-up too, so even that wouldn’t cause me to lose it. Multiple things would have to catastrophically fail at once to lose it all.

Going full streaming is to surrender all control and personal ownership over the stuff you are paying for, in the hopes that companies will not jack up prices, lose or remove content, or just decide streaming is no longer sustainable and end the whole thing. In which case, congratulations, you’ve paid every month for purely temporary use and nothing to show for it now. You rented the media, it was never yours. Again that’s fine if you understand what it is, but so many people seem to think it’s a total substitute and it’s really not.&&Exactly.

When every company has their own streaming service we’ll basically be back to the old school “channels” again, only you can curate your somewhat specific content on the specific channel you tuned into.

Netflix, HBO, Showtime, Amazon, Hulu have their stuff and soon Disney and probably WB, 20th Century Fox and Sony will follow suit.

Disney will have Disney classics, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and Pirates.
WB will have Christopher Nolan, DC (in addition to the DC streaming service) and Harry Potter.
Sony will have Spider-Man universe stuff
Fox will have X-men


How many of these streaming services are you willing to pay for?
&&The preorder bonus was started specifically to choke out Best Buy. When Best Buy's program died, no reason to keep the Amazon one going.&&> There’s this entire reliance on data as the main source of proof in industries that completely forgets the human element which is literally customers and they’re preferences.

What it really does forget is actual data science.

The *vast* majority of ""data driven"" management decisions in business are not backed by solid data science. Solid data science is expensive, time-consuming and is actually still very limited in what information it can give you.

More often than not, data is used to confirm pre-conceived notions, entrenching them into the status of definitive truth because a 25-year-old analyst put together a ""data report"" full of cherry-picking and bad statistics that his boss signed his name to and presented to management.

Source: this was my job for a few years, and I have a dear friend who's still in the field. Each day he despairs more about just how little his bosses understand or, worse, want to understand about actual data science. They just want the magic reports man to give them what they need for their political battle inside the company. And he works at a huge, household-name business, the kind that you'd think has the resources and management quality to avoid this idiocy.&&This happens in video game development too. A lot of games are being designed with data in mind rather than feel and the games are suffering for it. Developers need to take a step back and ask ""what is fun to play?"" rather than ""what is the data showing people play a lot?""

There are lots of shitty games out there that people are addicted to but that doesn't mean they are good.&&Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so -- Oh, I'm sorry. You're crying, like a woman.&&I've always heard it as ""made it with a woman""&&Kif! Open up comms in preparation for my victory yodel.&&I'm not sure why the other comment pointing this out was downvoted, but that was not a Netflix original movie.

Netflix distributed it (as they do with literally everything on their platform), but they were not involved in the production.&&Yeah&&It's kinda Breaking Bad-ish. Even has a female Jesse Pinkman, to Bateman's Walter-White-ish character. But not everything has to be completely original and it's a really really good show.&&[deleted]&&If this is a lie, you will make me cry so bad you will probably feel it from here.

every time I saw the hilarious 8-bit title card for it, I quickly checked to see if there were new episodes. Nope. It lied. &&IIRC season 1 was originally meant to be one of several movies, which is why there's only four of episodes (and why the pacing is a tad wonky in an otherwise great show).&&I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you recover as quickly as possible. You're a swell girl and I'm sure you find someone. Keep you chin up and keep playing.&&Oh man. Season 2 gets wild. Just finished. Was a tad disappointed the ending a tad. But don’t want to give anything away. &&I've been loving it while viewing it in comparison to The Simpsons and Futurama. There's no trick to it at all. Futurama had similar middling reviews for most of its first season (and into its second) and both shows took a while to find their groove. Same thing with this show. People are judging it when it clearly found its way at the end of the first batch of episodes. &&I enjoyed Disenchantment, but found my laughs to be more chuckles than true laugh out loud hysteria. &&I think it is because humor has evolved a lot since the 90s, and Disenchanted is just classic Matt Groening. People don't understand that it is hard making good hearted comedy like that. Not everything has to be meta joke-a-second slam you in your pussy Rick & Morty.&&My absolute favorite is when he finally wakes up from that virtual reality torture simulator, threatens the attendants to let him out, and then goes on a rampage.&&I loved Altered Carbon enough to watch it twice, mostly because of the setting. Plus I love gritty detective stuff which it kind of dipped into. 

Also Poe rules.&&I love cyberpunk/dystopia/sci-fi as well but everything about Altered Carbon felt off to me. &&Which is the worst place to run out of steam.&&I first really saw him for any length of time in House of Cards, and I thought ""okay, he's probably a fine actor, it's just that his character is horribly written, is a complete stereotype, and is totally stiff.""

I mean, that is still true, but it turns out that he also isn't a very good actor.&&I live in Missouri and frequent the Ozarks and I love it, even if it paints us in a “bad light”. My parents are from ABQ, and they are the same with Breaking Bad. &&By a distance too, I think.&&If you ever wondered who watches those midget reality TV shows the answer is my wife.  I cannot stand that shit.&&I quite enjoyed Insatiable too. It had a lot of issues, especially in the back-end, but it was a solid enough series.&&Insatiable was a guilty pleasure for me.  It has a certain charm for just how ridiculous it is.&&For sure. And I loved how they worked the ""other"" girls into this season better. Season 1 emphasized Ruth vs. Debbie. While they're obviously the top-billed stars, I thought Season 2 spread the wealth well, from Welfare Queen to Beirut to Justine, etc.&&Thank you. It gets no love and man, it’s so good. It’s just right up my comedy alley, the bizarre semi reality, the scripts that pack every square inch with gems of punchlines that they never just sit on for easy laughs, the move on at a break neck pace. Carol King is incredible. The show really really helps the pain of missing 30 rock. Maya Rudolf as Dionne Warwick makes me laugh out loud, every time, even just thinking about it.&&Wait are you telling me it can fill the void left in my soul agree 30 Rock finished?&&And speaking as someone who definitely isn’t otherwise a Maron fan *at all* (just not in love with his stand up or podcast, not for lack of trying), I thought his work on GLOW was riveting, career defining and more than Emmy worthy.&&I’m reading the book now. It’s definitely more in-depth, but the show was amazing in its own right. Came for the cyberpunk, stayed for the great acting by virtual unknowns and absolutely stunning effects and cinematography. Especially Poe. Hands down my fave character because of the actor.&&The movie had good imagination and it broke a lot of tropes. Beyond that yeah it was a good buddy cop movie. I’m on board for more from the universe it’s in also. &&But by the time stars were done they were reflecting what Netflix thought *you* would rate the show, not what the average viewer rating was.&&It was funnier before she was actually gross&&There is not a level on which it isn't bad:

- Bad music
- Bad singing
- Schumer comedy
- Condescending morality preaching
- Poorly representing their own message, or just getting it wrong:

    - Sex positivity = sluttiness? *Give someone new a handy, Then give yourself props*
    - 'It's ok to be however you are' mixed in with 'the right thing to do is screw everybody at least once.'


- Poorly strawmanning critics with the dorky interlocutor.
- What seems to be a waaay out of place 'Rachel Bloom is a New York Jew' reference.

To top it off this song immediately follewed, [this sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46h-LfNWPn8), which if you start [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46h-LfNWPn8&feature=youtu.be&t=1m41s) is just a pile of sexual harassment being presented as right and just.&&> It's like an adult science show

It failed at being an adult science show. It really showed that Bill Nye was great at explaining science to children but not adults.&&But it's so Oh Oh Oh!&&Followed by 2018s salute to abortions. &&The two Japanese live action Death Note movies were better but still not great.

Those two actually tried to perserve the cat and mouse game of it all but it was rushed even though they stuck to the first half of the series. Everything after the first half was bad, anyway. There's so much that happens in Death Note that it'll never cleanly get down to 3 or 4 gours without cutting out a lot.

I just don't like how much the Japanese movies changed the story. They changed Light too much. Also, I get why they changed the ending. It made sense from a self contained movie plot standpoint. As a fan I'd say that overall the Japanese movies are ""ok"". I saw them in a theater and I don't regret it.&&>Queef forced laugh track

So when you're filling out the surveys, you feel pressured to rate at 5 stars if the service/experience was positive overall.

But it boils down to a binary choice between ""terrible"" and ""perfect"" despite there being 5 stars from which to pick.&&Worked OK for Switzerland so far&&Shit out of hug?&&I didn't know that emoji was supposed to be a hug until now&&So you're telling me that 13 Reasons Why is a sequel to World War 2? &&Seems Sony and Fox like to fuck up alien power sagas.&&I'll honestly defend that emo spiderman dance until the day I die. 

It makes him more confident and do what he thinks cool is. He isn't cool and has no clue how to be cool, so he ends up embarrassing himself.

Spider-Man3 is far from perfect, but in world the symbiote made Peter act exactly as he should have.&&I would write that sound as:

Wuoooooooggggghhhh&&Womp womp? &&I think you have that backwards. Blockbuster closed stores and tried installing those vending machines long before streaming was the typical thing. &&It's proven that if media is **easily accessible** even at a modest fee, it gets pirated less.&&With HEVC they actually got smaller again.&&Finally somebody who echoes a sentiment I've had for a while. This is why I'll stick to buying physical. I *like* physically owning the stuff I watch and I can share it with friends how I like. If I go overseas I can take the copy with me and a player and don't have to worry about international licenses. No company's going to rip the discs out of my hands. And the discs are great for archiving in the highest quality to tape for the hardcore. Super consumer-friendly.

FYI what you're complaining about is that ""first sale doctrine"" can't really be applied to digital as it can for physical because of, well, the nature of digital. This is what's led to the licensing clusterfuck we've got today. Vastly disappointed in our generation for darting to streaming and treating media as disposable and taken for granted. A lot more I'll have to say on the topic regarding labor but I'll keep mum for now.&&I mean, I know.

I seriously don't get the Netflix hate on this sub.   
  
There are tons of good films and shows on the service.  &&It is not a lie. It will come near Halloween :)&&To me the best humor in that show came out of the background. Not what the three main characters were doing, but how the world reacted *to* what the three main characters were doing. Like Elfo saying ""Scribbidly Scrabbidly **Screw** the code!"" and an elf somewhere in the background going ""oooooooh!"" or the way the Jester always screamed ""Oh no!"" whenever he got ejected from the court. American Dad uses a lot of the same humor: people's facial expressions or eye movements during or after another character's actions. It's a subtle humor and one you actually have to watch for. With these kinds of shows, watching it for background-tainment is doing it wrong and you're going to miss a *lot* of the subtleties. &&Same, like it felt like they were trying to be deep like Ghost in the Shell but it turned into mush.&&I was glued to the screen the whole time. I wasn't crazy about [the sister and most of her screen time](#spoiler) although I do love that actress. That might be the only part of the story that I wasn't crazy about.

But the symbiote is supposed to have its own desires and want to bond with Peter permanently, and is furious when he rejects it. It finds a kindred spirit in Eddie, who also wants revenge on Peter, and they bond, but secretly the symbiote still wants Peter and would take him back in a heartbeat if he ever expressed willingness. It's his bitchy ex who can't move on.

We get none of that in the movie, it's just Magic Douche Slime. I realize that with three villains they couldn't devote too much screentime to each one, but if they had put in less ""Peter's an awkward prick now and it's funny"", maybe they could have found room for some actual story. Or at least a better way for him to get the thing than ""of all the places it could crash, it' just happens to be right next to Spider-Man"".

That being said, I swear I'll go see Venom ten times if there's a scene where he dances like Emo Peter.&&Rewatching Spider-Man 3, the only major problem I have with it is pacing. As far as the weird tone and goofiness, it's a Sam Raimi movie. It's the exact same thing that happened with Army of Darkness. The movie having a baker's dozen villains did more harm than a silly scene where Peter fucks around in a jazz club.&&I disagree. The symbiote is meant to amplify his darkest emotions, not make him act like an idiot, and regular Peter would know acting like that was absurd, but by your point he wants to be like that but just has no confidence, and Peter never showed the smallest inkling of wanting to be that way.

The animated series did it perfectly imo, he displayed all the things he wanted to do but never did because of his sense of responsability. He became selfish, he wouldn't take shit from anyone, and he acted only for himself. All of that was stuff you knew was inside him but he never let out, and the symbiote did. 

The Venom saga in the animated series was amazing, the horror and dread you feel when Venom is around every corner stalking Peter, Seeing him get close to MJ and his aunt, knowing for a fact that Venom was stronger than him. Fuck that show will forever be the definition of Spider-Man in my eyes.&&[This version with ""realistic audio""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ron-Ikenfc) really drives your point home.&&Brilliant onomatopoeia, my dude &&I'd say something more like ""buh buh baduuuhhh...

That's the best kind of correct!&&Nothing made me laugh harder than watching the retarded prince pull the sword out of his head&&They had like three different full stories in the show. There was the thing with his sister and his girlfriend, there was the murder story about the rich guy and there was helping out latina cop. The show just didn't know what it was doing.&&Yeah I thought the first 2/3 of the show was a lot better, before she started playing such a huge role.  Also before the forest episode.&&That's when they diverted heavily from the books, so that makes sense to me.  Felt the same way.&&The writers legitimately should have removed that character. They were a dues ex machina. It's one of my favorite shows of all time, but it's almost hard to recommend, based on their terrible performance, and the even worse writing given to them.

Edit: The other actors, like Poe, Officer Ortega, Tekashi (Asian and Caucasian version) did a great job. &&I’m not sure! It’s definitely known as a party location, lots of bachelor/bachelorette parties and it’s reasonably priced. But in the summer the lake is always booming and it just keeps getting bigger. It’s actually a bit nerve wrecking how many boats there are. As a result, the water is really choppy and dirty but we still love it.

Also the ""We have to sedate him...give me 20cc's of Brick.""&&Really? I thought they diverted heavily in the first episode when the Envoys were rebels instead of government troops.&&It’s not.

Probably my least favorite change, followed by making the villain Kovac's sister, not having the double-moment be a surprise, and adding a love story with Falconer.

Everything up to and including him breaking out of the torture facility was superb, though, and Poe was an original piece added that I quite enjoyed.&&Yeah Missouri sucks.

Instead, Carter’s stereotyping presents Lee with an opportunity to give him the slip. Lee takes advantage of Carter’s ignorance, letting him believe he doesn’t speak English and then ultimately escaping his watch when Carter embarrasses his country by taking the Hong Kong detective to Chinatown. The joke is always on America. On its complacency or its undignified manners or its inability to think about any country other than itself.""

Is the only time the article uses that term.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Nobody knows what it means, but it's ~~provocative~~ a movie blog&&*A kidnapping during rush hour&&YOU SEE?! YOU SEE HOW HARD IT IS? JUST TWO WORDS&&So first of all remember that this article is written by a UK paper so it has a wholly foreign perspective of America.

""American Complacency"" is the idea that America being the worlds last superpower and without any major threats post fall of Russia kind of went into DGAF mode about anything not directly related to america before 9/11. And operated with a ""we got this we don't need your help and we know best"" mentality to the rest of the world (The theory of American Complacency has a post 9/11 chapter but thats the general idea).

Specifically related to Rush Hour is the fact that the plot revolves around the UK withdrawal from Hong Kong and that because that isn't directly related to America the Americans have no use for including the Hong Kong/Briitish perspective in solving a kidnapping case that ends up being solely about that. It also shows that they think they can handle it without Jackie Chan's, or Hong Kong's help.

More on the nose is the fact that Chris Tucker's character doesn't treat Chan like a serious character, instead he takes him to chinatown to go sight seeing instead of allowing him to do his job. Chan then uses that complacency against Tucker when he pretends to not speak english to slip away.

&#x200B;

It's probably an unusual criticism for Americans because we don't view ourselves as a foreign entity like everyone else has to.&&Because it’s a really good sequel. Even better than the first imo. &&I've seen Drunken Master and Rumble in the Bronx. His stunts were crazier back then, but again, he was also younger.

I think Rush Hour and the subsequent movies were a natural evolution. Can't be jumping off helicopters forever.&&The guy literally broke every bone in his body from those days. I'm sure he was fine making a comedy like Rush Hour. &&[Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ) did a really interesting bit on Jackie's style and a lot of it just seems to be differences between Hong Kong and Hollywood in the way action is filmed and edited.

Also doesn't help that the dude was in his mid-40s when Rush Hour came out.  After a while, you have to imagine he got over risking life and limb for his films.  &&""Hello? Yes, we are filming! *You are wasting our film!*""

Jackie Chans broken English and Chris Tucker is just naturally funny and has an incredible vibe in everything he is in.&&I really loved these as a kid. Like you also got to see Jackie perform his stunts and see how complicated they are too. I felt it gave the movie more light in the end and I love even seeing the actors/actresses who are the villains just have fun and smile since throughout the movie, they had to be all serious. One in particular I liked was when the clip fell off the woman’s gun who was one of the main villain’s in rush hour 2 and everyone just had a laugh. &&My daddy ona-caught-a bullay with his bare hands...no bullshit!&&""gafilka"" fish?!&&That was Don Cheadle!!?!?

Good film, solid reboot. Just the name... &&[deleted]&&Call it *Rush Hour on Jump Street*   


Carter and Lee team back up but need help so they bring in the jump street boys. &&I think they should just keep crossing over 21 Jump street with more and more franchises until we get 21 Jump Street x Rush Hour x No Country for Old Men x The Avengers x Lego Movie x Sesame Street&&As bad as I wanted to see the MIB crossover, I want this too. In fact, put all three together and I think I'd be in heaven.&&I would say the original Rush Hour definitely beats out the sequel. Even in Rush Hour 2 the focus seemed to shift more towards comedy rather than semi-dramatic character development moments. 

Lee and Carter sharing stories about their fathers while eating Chinese food, teaching each other fighting moves while War blares out from Carter's car, these were all moments that really lent a proper emotional core and heart to the movie, which I think is lesser in Rush Hour 2, and almost completely absent in Rush Hour 3. 

Plus I think the original Rush Hour had more creative comedy. 

>""20 million in fifties....20 million in twenties....and 10 million in tens. You want any fives with that?""

&&Man nobody understands the words comin’ out of your mouth. &&Bad boys 2&&And Rosalyn Sanchez &&I’ll give you lethal weapon 2.

&&Xmen2&&Spider-Man 2 and The Godfather part 2 as well!&&I agree. I do think that even the first RH is a pretty good example of this, with the stars essentially being Chan, Tucker, Elizabeth Pena, and Ken Leung.

It’s not often now that a popular movie would make American culture, even overblown stereotypes, the butt of the joke.

It works because Rush Hour celebrates the “idiot American” and makes him an action hero. Which everyone secretly (or not so) wants to be. &&> The joke is always on America. On its complacency or its undignified manners or its inability to think about any country other than itself.

I think it's perfectly balanced (no Thanos reference here) in both aspects. The comedy works because of the chemistry and history of these characters, and the drama work because of the stakes and investment in each other. 

>Has to be the best pun I can think of in any comedy movie straight up.

That is a good example. What I love about the balance in Rush Hour 2 is shown in how the filmmakers use drama and comedy to improve each other together. At the end where Lee has Ricky at gun-point, we, as the audience, don't want to see the relatively peaceful Lee enact his vengeance by shooting an unarmed man, but at the same time, we're angry at the grief and misfortunate Ricky has caused to Lee (including killing his father). Rather than being the traditional moment where he's the angel on his shoulder telling him not to do so, Carter immediately jumps to being the devil (both he and Ricky encouraging Lee to shoot Ricky) when Ricky insults Lee's father. It gets to a point where the tension and comedy can't get any higher in a duel for attention, that Lee yells at Carter, only for Ricky to take this moment of distraction to get the gun, which is made all the funnier because it seems like due to the framing of the cinematography, editing, and lack of reaction from Ricky and Lee, it seems like Carter is just being ignored the entire time, until Lee yells at him. Carter's comedic moment saves Lee from doing something he can't come back from ethically. Ricky attempts to shoot Carter only for Lee to kick Ricky back in defending Carter from Ricky, and Ricky falls back out onto the street. The brilliant moment here is that the drama is saved by the comedy, and in turn, the comedy is saved by the drama, and allows us to see the end of the antagonist without the protagonists sacrificing their dignity to do so. [It's a brilliant scene and one of the best ""antagonist ends"" I've seen in a movie](https://youtu.be/fYYIwAq_yb8?t=5s)&&Rush hour 2 is definitely the best sequel to the original Rush hour, not including Rush Hour 3.&&No, not me, you&&the fucking jokes in these movies are so pure i can't even describe it

Stanley Kubrick’s '2001: A Space Odyssey' - All 611 Shots,37037,9d5d5n,https://i.redd.it/zj59h7e9hek11.jpg,1386,1536145069.0,,"611 shots seems really low for such a long movie&&611 shots, huh? That’s like the first 2 minutes of the last Transformers movie. &&2001 definitely makes for a very interesting version of this layout. For one it's great to see the color palette change throughout the film based on where the story is. Also really interesting to see how many of those shots are just of HAL. He's often thought of as the prime example of the Kuleshov effect, where you derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than just from one. HAL really is just a light and a great emotionless vocal performance. But somehow you can almost tell when the light is jealous, angry, vengeful, and afraid because of the editing. But you look at it here and yeah it's just a light, the meaning comes from the construction of the story. 

Pretty cool stuff!&&Someone should put these all together in a video.&&I found this on Twitter, not sure if it's been shared here already (tried to look for it, didn't see it).

Here's the author's [website](http://vashivisuals.com/2001-a-space-odyssey-all-611-shots/), where you can find this [same photo](https://i0.wp.com/vashivisuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2001_ALL-SHOTS-vertical.jpg) (8000 x 2600) and [horizontal](https://i1.wp.com/vashivisuals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2001_611_5K_web.jpg) version (5100 x 2200) as well.

Now do it for Russian Ark.&&Just saw this movie for the first time ever in IMAX at my local theatre. It was amazing, I’ve always seen the hal parts but everything was new to me and it was great. &&I watched this movie a couple weeks ago. The ending had me like ""Whut?"" And I can only imagine how it was when it came out&&The use of colour in his film follows a pattern and then ends in a rainbow&&This is the first time I notice how much the final eyes shots resembles more and more the Hal 9000 red light... amazing.&&Seeing this film in IMAX couple weeks back was amazing. An actual experience being fully immersed into it in that setting.&&What are ""shots""? For a non movie buff what are these other than 600 screenshots from the film? I understand the concept of a scene sorta and I thought shots were moving images that were part of a scene, such as a tracking shot or long shot etc , they're still a cumulation of frames ?&&This is on my to-watch list; however, I'm deliberately waiting for the 50th-anniversary edition, as they will take the original print and have it remastered for 4k. I figure I might as well see it in all its glory for the first time, and I'd suggest others do the same if they have the means and have not yet seen it.

Edit: I should note that it is getting released at the end of October, so you only have to wait seven weeks.&&Would each shot here represent the first shot from that scene, is there any particular reason why these shots were selected and not another 611 shots but taken 1.35 seconds later?&&A testament to how much care and thought went into each frame of Kubrick's films. &&Thank you, Hal&&ITT: people posting the fence scene from Taken 3&&It's magic even as a damn mosaic.&&Man the use of color in this movie is so amazing.

The red is always used in moments showing where humanity's progress is being halted. It's used in the scene where the the American man is hiding information from the Russians, it's being used when they secretly board onto the moon base, and it's used on HAL. Blue and white seems to be synonymous with technological progress, being used on every space ship, the sky in the opening, and the Starchild at the end. I find the American flag in the moon section really interesting because of this. I feel like Kubrick put it there on purpose because the flag is white, blue, and red. As if to say the very nations that give us progress also ground us due to our politics. 

I also find the lack of more color throughout the film really interesting, almost all the greens, oranges, pinks, and purples are all saved for the stargate at the end. It's as if Kubrick is saying that we have so much more as a species to experience and find.&&Each shot looks like it should be in an art museum &&611 Shots for a sci-fi movie today would be approximately 11 seconds of a fight scene. &&The stargate sequence is one of the greatest sequences of all time. One that goes on for too long, granted, but still amazing.&&I saw this movie three times and every time it bored my in ways I didn't think possible. I want to like this movie as the masterpiece it is according to so many. It just doesn't resonate with me in any way and if there is genius here, I guess I just can't see it. &&just finished the book, haven't seen the movie yet, but this really impressive&&Never seen this movie. Probably will watch it tonight. Am I in for a wild ride? &&611 shots for a 161 minute-long movie averages out to ~16s/shot. That's exceptionally long compared to most movies made today, and even a lot that were produced at the time. &&I’m just here to tell everyone to read the book. They’re completely individual pieces of art and both definitely worth experiencing, but in my humble opinion, the book is much more mental-landscape-altering. &&I feel like more of a minority with this film, because I really did not like it. I know it's considered a masterpiece and that it does some really brilliant things along with great visuals. But it was just was kind of boring and lacking in story. &&I love this film, one of my favorites. Does anybody know why Kubrick decided to do two shots of the bone rotating? That is the one shot that always bothered me, and I never understood why one shot wasn't good enough.&&Every frame could be a print in an art museum.&&No bones about it, its a beautiful film&&I tried writing a post explaining how I feel about this movie but it just came off as super pretentious and I don't want to subject you all to that. So I'll just say this movie is very good. &&That opening with the chimp is way to fucking long.&&I met Dullea at comicon in Boston. The man had plenty to say about how the movie was ahead of its time and how much of a genius Kubrick was &&And to think it took half that many shots just to properly capture Liam Neeson jumping over a damn fence.&&Going to see it tonight on the big screen - 70 mm.

The shots are very long and intentional.&&I love how you can see the story in the imagery of the scenes. You can see the conflict arise and the resolution.

Some of them seem like they went on for several minutes.&&By today's standards it absolutely is.

EDIT: holy fuck people, I get that the editing of that fence jump in Taken was bad. Please stop posting it!!!&&In contrast in *Taken* you have **15 shots for a 6 second scene** for a guy jumping over a fence:

It’s so much more painstakingly difficult when you’re working on a 90-minute feature with over 2000 cuts. &&I just watched it again a couple days ago.

It’s a very deliberately paced movie.  Nearly all shots are very long, either wide shots that more or less let the entire scene play out, or uncomfortably close ones on the ship.&&Is a shot any time the camera isn’t moving?&&Back in the day they did a shot for more than 2 seconds.

Hell, and entire 5 minute dialogue used to be the norm. Now it's micro bursts for several reasons:

* Easier to avoid mistakes in dialogue and acting
* Keeps viewer's attention
* Enables some dramatic perspectives
* Can take 25 attempts at a line without wasting too much time
&&According to [this link](http://www.cinemetrics.lv/movie.php?movie_ID=6886):

* Shots: 601 (maybe a different cut or could be the database's automatic way of counting shots isn't perfect)

* Longest shot: 164.9 seconds
* Shortest shot: 0.2 seconds
* Average shot length: 13.6 seconds
* Median shot length: 9.2 seconds

Out of the 19,319 entries in that database (many of them are individual scenes or trailers), if ordered by average shot length, it is 3202nd in the list, so in the top 17th percentile.  Actually the more I look at this list the more I notice garbage data.  Pulp fiction is in here 13 times, sometimes just as clips, but one of the entries says that the entire movie only has 11 shots.  So if there is garbage data in here, it makes sense that much of that garbage data would be at the extremes, making it seem like real data points aren't as extreme as they really.&&It is 161 minutes, long so the average shot length is about 16 seconds long. &&> 611 shots seems really low for such a long movie

Some of these shots are repeated. But it does seem as if Kubrick did the minimal number of setups possible. &&Hitchcock’s The Rope only has ten shots.&&Here's some data: https://stephenfollows.com/many-shots-average-movie/&&There are a lot of long takes in the movie and the pacing is much slower than modern films.&&I’d be interested to see the number of shots in a movie like The Revanant or Gravity, Chivo being known for his long takes &&Not only that, every single shot is absolutely gorgeous.&&Especially when you consider a handful of these ARE the same shot, just separated by two cuts.&&Check out Stalker. 142 shots over the course of nearly 3 hours.&&About 15.8 seconds per cut, on average. Makes me wonder today's average. &&what do you expect from a movie that has a 15-minute shot of a guy breathing?&&Which is part of why this movie is awesome.&&Kubrick was also very well known for doing many as many takes until he got the perfect shot so for example in the shining I want to say there was this one scene with Jack Nicholson with like 60+ takes&&It's very effective storytelling.&&Or that bit in Taken 3 where Liam Neeson jumps over a fence.&&Yeah.  Watch one of those and at the end of it you feel like someone's gonna rip a spike out of your head and you're gonna lean up and say ""I know Kung Fu.""

Except it's more like ""I know shitty filmmaking.""&&Someone said about the movie that HAL becomes more human while David becomes more robotic or something like that 

edit spelling&&In this picture, you can see these four consecutive shots of HAL with each one zooming in further, that are shown just before he kills the astronaut repairing the ship. 

On paper it would seem like a cheap trick but in context it is probably the most terrifying moment in the film.&&[deleted]&&That’s really interesting, thank you for sharing. &&“I can’t open the pod bay doors John”&&Yeah.

Also, this would not work so well with Rope. :D&&Can someone ELI5, what are these ""shots""? Surely there are more frames of film than that, so are these like groupings of frames around a theme of some kind?

Check them out [here](http://vashivisuals.com/category/vashi-frames/). To name a few; Jaws, Chinatown, Lawrence of Arabia...&&[deleted]&&Or any movie with Roger Deakins' cinematography!&&it’s been out since last year i’m not sure why you haven’t seen it.

/s&&someone make my dreams come true and make this happen. &&It’s just a screenshot &&And Victoria!&&I just saw this movie for the first time all the way through super jetlagged on an intercontinental flight with periodic interruptions in German from the flight crew. Not as great, but even trippier.&&Still never seen it &&I dvr'ed is the lat time it came on. Couldn't finish it as I kept falling asleep.

I guess I just don't get it.&&Id recommend reading the book, it's amazing and everything makes sense afterwards :)&&Then imagine being 8 freaking years old and trying to figure it out. LOL!&&I'm jealous! I'd love to see it in imax, unfortunately I'd probably have to go on my own though, no-one I know would be likely to go with me :(&&I saw it in IMAX last week, took my buddy who’s going to be working as a film teacher at our local high school (he had never seen it before!) and my girlfriend. I’m pretty sure they both enjoyed it and respected it due to how well it holds up for a 50 year old film!

Is showing this film a normal thing in IMAX? When I saw it playing in my local theater I basically cleared my plans to go see it. &&It's showing at a theater pretty far from me for like $25 for a ticket. I've never seen it before. Worth it?&&A shot is one moving or still image that can be any length that when edited together with other images creates meaning. You are correct the proper term usually refers to a moving image but there are a few still frame shots in 2001 for instance. What this person has done is taken one frame (in celluloid film from this era there are 24 frames of still images for each second of footage) from each of the 611 moving image shots from 2001 to show the various kinds of shots employed. However you do lose context from things like camera movement. A more accurate version would be 611 gifs of the entire shots but that would be such a huge pain to create. 

tl;dr - A more accurate title would be ""A frame from each of the 611 shots from 2001: A Space Odysseey""&&Basically, a ""shot"" is what happens between 2 cuts.&&A shot is essentially what happens between the time the director says, “action!”, and when he say “cut!” That’s a shot. Each one of these photos is a single frame of film from within each of those shots in the movie. 

Edit: a shot doesn’t always start with “Action!” and end with “Cut!” Some shots are of just inanimate objects or cityscapes, or landscapes, etc. but you get the idea. &&I just saw it for the first time in theaters on Sunday. It was the remastered version. I think October is just when it is released on Blu-ray. &&Oh nice. I didn't know they were re-releasing it. Thanks for the heads up! &&The recent IMAX digital re-release is from the digital restoration and let me tell you, it was magnificent. You are in for a treat.&&I didn't know it was getting remastered and I watched it for the first time last month! I think it's a good idea to wait til then to watch it. It really is a visual experience, so might as well overdo it.&&I was able to watch this for the first time at my local theatre in IMAX last weekend!&&Uhhhh, no prob, bruh - SoCal Hal&&Very cool!&&Can you explain why it’s amazing? It was tedious to watch. Just like the camera man was tripping on acid for half an hour.&&There are many logical reasons for this. One is, the film was never meant to be seen in small format. It really is an immersive film experience when you see it in 70mm or IMAX. Also, this movie was released in 1968. Look at all the sci-fi movies up to that point in history. Absolutely nothing came close to the realism, design and technology used to make it. It was arguably a cinematic quantum leap. Finally it was purely visual storytelling. They deliberately wanted the audience to leave with an unconscious impression of the grand ideas inferred in the visuals. 
It is clearly a movie that must be seen in the context of its time. Seen that way, it truly transcends all that came before it in its genre.&&I understand how that feels. To some, and sometimes, even to me who liked it a lot, the film can feel like it's dragging a scene on for a bit too long, or you're just not getting any immediate payoff of whatever mystery is supposedly hanging in the air because the pace is also excruciatingly slow. It also has a lot to do with the way the sound works. Some scenes are unsettling in their silence, and some, are overwhelming.

Perhaps try accompanying it with the book that came out with it? I haven't checked it out myself but people say it gives a lot more depth to what your seeing, and gives you a better understanding at what's really going on.&&I've literally said this about comic book movies for the last decade. &&Another one of the few of us who read before watched, that was a good idea on your part&&Please don’t watch it on anything less than 4K then. DVD or streaming on a small screen doesn’t cut it. If you can see it in IMAX or the 50th anniversary 70mm print, go!&&I wouldn’t say you are a minority. Plenty of people find this boring or uninteresting. It’s a combination of the special effects and our expectations. 

I find the effects absolutely amazing and entertaining but when this came out this was all insanely awesome effects. It was a roller coaster ride all by itself. 

Nowadays we can look at it, shrug, and make some reference to Jurassic world or marvel CGI. 

Concerning the plot, it’s actually a pretty interesting and good plot but it is a fairly short novel. Kubrick definitely could have made it a much shorter movie. 

But don’t forget, the effects were a ride all of their own. Kind of like the equivalent of ‘mindless action’ in films like Taken. There was no plot there ,but that kind of action really entertained a large portion movie watchers at the time 

So the movie was really lengthened by the special effects ride that doesn’t impress people nowadays. 

Everybody gets their own opinion, but I can see why you would feel that way. &&I think it sets up the match cut with the spacecraft to be more visually jarring. It also builds a three-shot narrative around the juxtaposition. (1)See this? (2)This leads directly to (3)this.&&Almost every shot in this movie is way too fucking long&&I thought the same about the trippy colors. 

At first, I'm like... Woah.

Then, mkay.... 

Then, still going....

Then, okay am i really going to have to fast forward this??&&Don't sort by controversial then&&So is Classical music, am i right?

Not an unpopular opinion amongst the youtube generation btw.&&Read the book adaptation.   I appreciate the movie...but the book is mind bending.   &&Yeah, that’s how they do it. How else could they? Getting the shots wouldn’t take longer than watching the movie. Just screenshot every time the camera cuts. Putting them all together in Photoshop wouldn’t take that long either. &&There's a good while in between the disconnection of HAL and the arrival at Jupiter (like a couple months--they're in the asteroid belt when all the shit goes down). Dave just grabbed the green helmet when he got in the bay because he was in a hurry. He'd left the matching helmet in the Discovery's control room when he ran to the pod. WHICH WAS DUMB. But he was in a panic. Presumably he restores both suits in the interim.

edit: also I remember that there is a scene missing from the film, but which was present in the script and novel, where HAL decompresses the entire ship with Dave aboard, so there may have been a reason other than precaution for Dave to have quickly grabbed a helmet. But of course it still would have been good to have one on the way out in the first place...&&I think this is also indicative of Kubrick's directing style - long shots, careful setup, etc.&&... can I still post the Catwoman [Basketball Scene](https://youtu.be/rNlmRId2FVQ)?&&There are something like 3,000 shots in Infinity War. &&I actually like less shots. Makes a movie slower but also more realistic. I prefer the editing in 2001 over the much faster and advanced editing in most movies nowadays&&Also has to do with stunt double , how is liam neeson climbing fences en taken 2? 14+ cuts ans like 8 diferent camara angles.

Edit: confused word&&this movie was trying to portrait the minimalism of time passing in space. Instead of the fast paced Hollywood present stuff. You take 2 years to go to an other planet. And it's monotonous. Not like interestelar the ""new 2001 space oddesy"" tries to portrait it, where the supposed ""most prepared spaceship pilot in the world"", after a 1 year sleep in the ship has to be explained how a wormhole works 5 mins before the event, with paper and pencils.   &&Star Wars was really a turning point for this. People usually remember the film for it's special effects, but what really made Star Wars stand out amongst the crowd was how the film was edited to better build tension and add flow to the action sequences.&&That's what our boi Edgar Wright's whole filmography is a critique of &&And human attention spans&&Probably around 600 cuts in Liam Neeson jumping over a fence in taken &&What the fuck!! They don't even work in a continuous flow!&&Annnnd I have a migraine&&I never watched this movie and now I'm never gonna watch it&&Honestly, I consider the freeway scene where he stole a cop car to be worse than that. Yeah, that's probably got more shots per second, but there's still plenty of cuts in the freeway scene, and it goes on for faaaaaaar too long and is way more jarring.&&This is shitty movie making. The cuts add nothing in terms of story telling... and very little in terms of effect. It doesn’t heighten the tension per se, it just adds brain stress. &&It took them 15 shots when it should have only Taken 3﻿

&&[Every Frame A Painting](https://youtube.com/watch/?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ&t=2m25s) explains this editing style really well&&On that note -- Birdman is mostly one shot. I think they did some digital stitching and it's not one take, but I can't remember exactly.

There are cuts but there aren't many.

Edit: For those that don't want to scroll through the comment chain: there are 85 shots supposedly, with only one noticeable  cut and  the rest hidden. Some people argue the one cut that is obvious is significant to the story. Thanks everyone for helping me get to the bottom of this! &&*sneezes*
Dammit. Take it from the top. &&A newer movie, Victoria, also had one continuous shot. It's a good movie but gets boring in a couple parts and makes you realize why some editing is a good thing.&&might want to use ""6xx"", a bit clearer for us mortals. &&They should do something like this for Solaris, I can almost guarantee there will be like half the number of shots lmao.&&He uses it occasionally. It isn't his main thing like Mizoguchi. Story of Late Chrysanthemums from 1939 is 2 hr 30 minutes with 140 shots. Kubrick mixes conventional filmmaking with long takes.&&Pardon my ignorance but what do you do as a colorist? I’d never heard of that job before. &&A shot ends with a cut. The camera can be moving through several rooms for example but as long as there aren't any cuts, it'll all be one shot.&&A shot is the length of time between cuts. If an entire movie was captured in one take with no cuts or edits it would be 1 shot. &&A shot begins and ends with each cut. So in a dialogue scene, each time it switches to the person talking, it is a shot. &&[This scene. Just awful.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCKhktcbfQM)&&I’m sure that scene used more than 611 shots but I get what you mean &&I was confused what movie you were referring to but I realized you meant to say “Tak3n”.&&I’m not sure I really agree with David becoming more robotic, as he has to spends the second half of the HAL sequence just thinking about how to get out of certain situations. I’m not sure what about his performance would really read as “more robotic” towards the end.

Right on about HAL becoming more human, although it’s kind of twisted. HAL does human things like singing, and begging for his life as he gets closer to death, but it’s corrupted by his unemotional voice. (It’s getting deeper throughout the song and his voice has no panic at all when saying things like “please stop Dave, I’m afraid.”&&I definitely think the entire HAL segment has a deep undercurrent of how technology is leading man to become mechanic and machine is becoming more human. I have a Stanley Kubrick analysis book that mentions something like that in deeper detail, I'll try to find the quote when I can.&&Consider this: HAL sings Daisy, a courtship song. He also becomes a stone cold murderer just like a bone-weilding primitive. Contrast that with the way space fairing man evolved into dispassionate sleepwalkers (stuck to the ground only with Velcro soles), lying to each other, making contact to distant loved ones through vid screens, and sinking their teeth into processed paste that ""all tastes the same."" HAL becomes red in tooth and claw while mankind becomes a victim of their own passionless technology. It's only after Bowman goes through the monolith (is it a coincidence that the black rectangle looks exactly like a movie screen?), and sits down to a real meal that he breaks a wine glass, itself perhaps a symbol of a Jewish wedding ceremony, and unifies his cold reason with his passionate animalistic side, thus embodying what Nietzsche's Zarathrustra says, that man is a condition that must be overcome, and only by marrying reason with passion can one become the Superman.&&To me, this is overlooking their intentions.  Hal is saving the mission at all costs because it saw danger.  Dave doesn't consider that an option, thinks it glitched, and destroys it.&&I don't think it's so much that he becomes more robotic rather than he, and the other humans, are living rather robotic, inauthentic lives. Right from the beginning of their part of the film.&&I don't love the movie barcode thing because it assumes that one image = one color. For instance look at the end when Dave is in the white room. A lot is made of the contrast of colors, the bright red spacesuit against the white room. By choosing a single color to ""represent"" that you are ignoring the larger context of that image.&&2001: A Sequential Odyssey?&&Someone did that to Memento.

It's cool to see he switches from a 2x3 frame ratio to a 4x5 depending on the movie, and in the case of the Grand Budapest Hotel, he switches frame sizes IN the movie and uses a primarily square format for the first time. &&Polanski's coming in the low teens obviously&&What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?&&I was intensely bored by it.

It helps with certain movies to see it with more people, or in a theater.   
Also knowing some details, like understanding what they are trying to talk helps.

I once saw a 35mm print of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly in a completely empty theater. Just me and not a single other soul. It was the best moviegoing experience of my life so far.&&I bought two tickets, went into a Meetup for movies in the area and found a complete stranger to take with me. He'd never seen 2001 and had a good time, at least I think he did. Usually if someone sits through the whole thing that means they enjoyed it.&&What's wrong with going on your own?&&Going go films and even some gigs alone can be a blast. It's easier to get fully immersed. Not to say sharing the experience isn't as good but they both have their perks. Don't shy away from it!&&Play elite dangerous in vr. The game has a bunch of 2001 Easter eggs in it.&&I went to IMAX with my friends and said that it is an amazing experience to see, so they agreed.
Afterwards they found me even more a weirdo than I already am. &&Nah it's 50th anniversary was this year. It had a limited run or fathom event or something earlier this year for that I think.  I know ~~Tarantino~~ did some work on restoring it and I think this was the result of that, again for its anniversary.

It would not surprise me if it does show again due to what I assume is some success with this release, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

edit: Christopher Nolan, not Tarantino.&&This is a special thing for the 40th anniversary restoration. It's the closest you can get (better, really, given the quality of the restoration) to the Cinerama and 70mm roadshow presentations from back in the day.&&If you enjoy films and moviegoing in general, yes.

If you like sci-fi, particularly things that could be considered hard sci-fi, yes.

If you like artistic movies that aren't in-your-face with action and can be very slow paced, yes.

It's not a film for everyone, but anyone who enjoys movies in general *and* especially sci-fi, highly recommended. Especially in theaters because you're so immersed.&&I think what is surprising (and possibly confusing OP) is that *2001* has *only* 611 shots. We seem to get that many just from one scene of a modern action film. &&As a non movie buff, this sounds to me like a “scene”. Is there a difference? &&And a cut is what happens between to shots. Glad that we sorted this out.&&The work that went behind it combined with the music and effects look amazing. Then it goes on for ten minutes and you get bored.&&subreddit idea gold&&Just adding my two cents here: I absolutely loved the effects and the crisp image (it's the only 60s movie I know that doesn't feel that old); but the strange plot(-fragments), the overly long shots, like the apes at the beginning or the psychedelic trip at the end, kind of killed the movie for me. I understand it's considered a masterpiece from a technical and movie making point, but I had no fun watching it.&&I thought the book came first, but your right, the book was [developed concurrently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_\(novel\)) with the movie. Gotta re-read the series now.&&He came from a photography background so all of his shots are composed with painstaking effort. Makes sense to linger on them longer when you think of them from that perspective.&&Yes, absolutely. Even for its time, 2001 is slower and more deliberate than the average film. Someone linked to a site that had a bunch of these composite images of shots, and other films from around the same era have many more than 2001.&&That's so disorienting I barely know what even happened.&&I counted (roughly) 135 shots. That's around 1/5th of all the shots of 2001:SO&&Good lord! That was quite the treat.&&Wow.&&There are 3000 shots in the three-second fence climbing scene in Taken 3. &&Did Infinity War feel like the camera was jumping around too much for you?  Because even if it was that many shots, it felt like it all flowed well to me, which is the important part.&&Yeah, I get that. I don't find the length of the shots alone to be enough of a determinant of what I think is good/bad though. Sometimes fast is appropriate; sometimes slow. It really depends on the pace of the scene.

I will agree that most blockbuster movies these days set a really weird pace with their editing. It feels like they are almost insecure about letting a shot sit too long, and the overall pace often feels robotic -- like they just cut at a fixed rhythm the whole time.&&This is why I love Tarkovsky. Especially Stalker: 142 shots in 163 minutes. &&Fight scenes are way less engaging and coherent these days for me. I often can't keep track of what's happening or who's doing what, it's just punch explosion someone else is kicking oh there's a sword magic another explosion please just finish already so I know who died&&""Better Call Saul"" does a phenomenal job of this. I find it allows the actors to breathe more life into the characters and makes interactions feel more organic. Sure it doesn't work for every scene in every movie, but damn if it isn't effective when used properly. &&Have you ever seen There Will Be Blood? It's a perfect example of a modern movie that masters the long shot and actually lets the images sink in for the viewer. It won an Oscar for cinematography I believe. I would recommend it&&Looking back at movies like Empire Strikes Back, you can see a *looot* of style changes, especially with editing

they hardly do any static/matte painted shots anymore like at 4:32 because of CGI, but those were the shots that made things feel absolutely larger than life&&I'm a fan of the Takeshi Kitano gangster movies.. those usually also use fewer and longer shots. &&What you don't think [this](https://youtu.be/rNlmRId2FVQ) is the pinnacle of modern cinema? :)&&[You want less shots](https://feenta.com/best-one-shot-one-take-movies/) ??&&This is why Let The Right One In is one of my favorite movies. Makes the thing so much more moody and tense. I think about the exsanguination and under the bridge scenes and how they would’ve been less effective if they’d done a bunch of quick cuts and close quarters gory edits. Also, the hospital shot where you suddenly see Eli move through the shadows gave me chills down my spine.  &&2001 was an outlier even by the standards of those days. It has shots that are static lasting for  a few minutes several times in the film.&&I'd be interested in a comparison of the shot-number, and shot-length, of *2001* versus *Interstellar*, which is a **very** similar film, in some respects.

(I'm not interested enough to do the work *myself*, obviously. I'm sure there's some 19-year-old avoiding studying for an exam who'll procrastinate themselves into answering this question in 3000 words, at the very least. :-)&&Trying to watch a music video these days is seizure inducing. They never linger for much if any time in most current videos and it’s a struggle for my old brain. 

But that’s evolution of the format, too. Just like when we watch movies from past generations they can seem snail slow to us but are enjoyed as well paced for those a generation or so above. 

I compare it to Asian gaming. I was on a flight with a Korean gamer a few years back. He was rocking the Porsche of fidget spinners while watching a MMO match with so much going on I was beyond lost understanding how he could follow it. But he grew up in that level of information, so for him it just came naturally. He was insanely nice and pretty calm as a person, but mannnn does that kind of activity cause me anxiety. It’s just too much at once. 

I keep trying to stay on top of the influx of information. I immerse myself and try to take everything in. Sometimes it works. Sometimes I’m reminded why really old people are crotchety. 

Also: Fewer&&I think editing is best thought of like antibiotics, it should be a tool of last resort&&You should check out the movies directed by Park Chan-Wook like Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and Oldboy. Early 2000s Korean movies are all about minimal editing &&Once, when Driver 3 was a thing, my friend and I used to edit our replays in the film director mode and compare them. He always complained that I held my shots for too long and that it was boring to watch. Meanwhile he was cutting constantly and it was near impossible to follow what was happening.

It was like the difference between a car chase in *Bullitt* vs a car chase in *Transformers*. I still hold the belief that mine were better.&&Extras? What do you mean?&&Star Wars was absolutely saved in the edit. George gets a lot of credit, but he surrounded himself with amazing talent and hard workers to make what we have now. (at least for a new hope)&&This reminds me of the one time i ruined my girlfriends' appreciation for the movie Doomsday. 

Its a decent movie with lots of action and an ""OK"" zombie/post-apocalyptic world plot but they cut scenes multiple times a second... Now we can never watch the movie the same way again...

Colorists take the image from the camera and tweak them to 1) balance exposure and color of the image, 2) match the shots within a scene and within the whole project to have a consistent look, and 3) stylize the image to match the vision of the director and dp. 

When you watch a movie and if you go “wow the image is beautiful! The colors are really gorgeous and have this depth to them!”, a good portion of that is to the credit of the colorist. A lot of it has to do with the great work of the crew on set, but the colorist brings out the best in the picture. An image straight out of a cinema camera is flat, gray, and dull. We pull and stretch that image to make it look nice! Kind of like painting. &&Just to clarify further - a cut is when a the film switches (in the editing room, two separate shots are ""cut"" together) from one camera angle to another.&&That just makes me think that Liam Neeson sucks at jumping over fences.&&Holy shit. That was awful.&&

But, more than that, even as he is ""executing"" HAL, he's also desperate for those final moments of companionship as he makes himself totally alone. ""Yes, HAL. I'd like to hear it. Please sing it for me."" It is hidden by the panic and resolve, but Dave is totally feeling what HAL is saying about being afraid (he gets more upset through the scene even as he makes himself ""safer"" until being distracted by the recording). That slowdown and hesitation is all HAL has available to him in the way of expression.&&Well he doesn't get emotional when Frank and the rest of the crew die and certainly keeps  his cool with HAL.

Eidt: Also, does Dave ever seem afraid before the monolith?&&I don't think he truly becomes human. He is beyond human, or at least we think he is. As you point out, he only ""feels"" when he is being torn apart. 

HAL was as far as humanity could go in becoming beyond human, but HAL ultimately had the tiniest of flaws, reflecting our own imperfection. Thus, he was shed before humanity made the next evolutionary leap forward. He's literally the last thing before Dave transcended his human body and made the leap forward.&&Bowman and Poole was always fairly robotic. I agree neither became less human as the film progressed. &&The whole situation with HAL really comes down to the fact he has a moment of crisis. HAL was the only one who knew the nature of the mission and therefore assumed Bowman and the others may be a threat. When he makes a judgment call and lies about the malfunction and it becomes clear when they find this out they will turn him off to fix him. HAL has no concept of what it means to sleep, which it the equivalent of rebooting or repairing a computer. In his mind if they turn him off he dies. Therefore he has a moment of crisis and choses to kill the crew because he is fearful they will kill him.  When HAL is singing Daisy he is literally regressing back to when he was first created. This becomes very clear in the book and I actually began to feel pity and sadness for HAL when I rewatched the film two weeks ago.  

The book is different. The way the crew is murdered is altered and unfortunately HAL does not utter his signature line to Dave. However I think the novel helps clearly explain a little bit  of the abstractness of some of Kubrick's scenes. 

&&HAL definitely has hints of an aggressive and self-interested personality before he is directly threatened. He cheats at chess, and the way he describes his computational abilities sounds a lot like bragging.&&Yes. Now I have to think exactly what I want to say & how I want to say it to my Alexa; otherwise she doesn't understand.

As we're the primitives in the opening.

Edit:. You may be aware... But after several readings of your well crafted comment...I can't be sure.   He didn't just evolve.&&This is one of the best interpretations I’ve ever read. Having just watched 2001 on the big screen for the first time, it’s all so fresh in my mind, and it’s one of those films that I savor for days afterwards.&&When I found out the song with which the movie starts was based on ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" from Strauss it just blew my mind and I went into a trip of connections.    
   
This also made sense with the ending of the movie, were Dave becomes a baby, which Nietzsche's Zarathrustra says it's the presentation of the Ubermensch (Superman), an all absorbing baby.   

The movie is so deep I had a hard time dealing with people comparing it with some modern space blockbusters.  &&Thanks so much for that beautiful Nietzsche quote! Really seems like something that could encapsulate all of 2001. As the movie explores losing humanity.&&Did you write this? That’s amazing and I never considered some of this&&Love your point and will think about it for awhile.  I think I really need to read Thus Spake Zarathustra sometime.*  But can your expand on the point about lying to one another?  I don't recall any lies but it's been awhile since I've seen the film.  

* *for slightly more unrequested context, I'm an architect and have been working on developing my own theories on what architecture should be.  This idea of marrying passion and reason is exactly the path I wish to go down and I think the starting point which buildings should be designed from.  There's this rational categorical side to us that demands reason and order and is exemplified by things like 20th century Modernsim, while there's also this more animal side that seeks art and meaning and includes the messiness of nature and daily life.  Films are definitely a great way to explore all this as well*&&Consider this: the next letter of each letter in HAL is IBM.&&I've always considered that Bowman was 'allowed' to experience the Monolith's thing *because* he showed he was able to overcome his fear (there is clearly fear on his face before jumping in the vacuum chamber, at least imho) and to kill a superior ~~human~~ being (HAL). &&[deleted]&&I think we got a real classic on our hands.&&What are we, some kind of 2001: A Space Odyssey&&I thought that was an option on the DVD ... &&To expand, if your gonna do this yourself, you could just screen cap the first frame of every new shot. Or if you wanted to be more creative with the look you could pick your own frame within that shot.&&>  If you were to do this for a film like Russian Ark you'd only have a single picture.

Right, but I think you've missed the point of his question. For example, if you were to do this for ""Russian Ark"" which single frame would you choose to represent that single shot? His question is the same but for each single shot from 2001.&&This probably just shows you the first frame of each shot?&&...which is made up of numerous frames, some very different than each other, and so /u/stomatophoto/'s question remains unanswered: How were these individual frames selected from each ""shot"" which has multiple frames.&&I think Barry Lyndon would be even better than 2001, probably not color palette wise but every single frame is essentially an IRL painting&&I have to object when it comes to LoA.   That movie is the most beautiful film I had ever seen up til that point.  Plus..... Fuckin Obi Wans' lost years finally get told on the big screen.

Bear with me man, I lost my train of thought


🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔&&I completely agree, I don’t think it really holds up well. I can see how at the time it was revolutionary for the effects, but my god was it long and drawn out. &&Next time I see something interesting is going to be on in my local cinema maybe I'll get over my awkwardness and just go for it! &&Honestly that sounds like it would enhance the way that movie is shot so, so much. It would make the desert feel that much emptier &&Wow nice, sometimes I wish I wasn't such a shy person, then I'd be more likely to do things like that, it sounds fun! &&Yup. Captain America: The Winter Soldier for instance has 3,288 shots [according to this website.](http://www.cinemetrics.lv/movie.php?movie_ID=16601)&&Some of the shots are incredibly long. There are shots of astronauts walking from floor to ceiling, jogging in a loop that puts them upside-down compared to other actors in the scene, etc...

Longer shots are actually much harder to pull off than short ones.&&Yes. A scene refers to narrative, a shot refers to technical. Think of it like a piece of musical notation. Shots are like the notes, a scene is like a movement, a film is like the symphony. A scene is a piece of the narrative that tells part of a larger story, with each scene playing into each other. To create the narrative scene you edit multiple shots together to create meaning as well as build emotion and pathos. There are some rare scenes that are just one shot but most are composed of multiple shots. [This scene for instance from No Country for Old Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLCL6OYbSTw) is composed of multiple shots, 15 in the first minute.&&I just love longer pans and shots of his films versus the rabid cuts of many movies out there. It just allows you to take in the scenery and setting better. Or even to contemplate the story events more&&I initially read that as pornography background which I feel like also would’ve made sense &&I may be crucified here by saying that, but as someone who likes to watch a movie when going to sleep (and sometimes dozing off during it), 2001 helped me achieve my personal best of 4 failed attempts to watch, until I finally decided to watch it in a Saturday afternoon.

It's a great movie, but the time that it takes to get going and the long shots turn it into a hard watch for sleepy people.&&All compacted in a \~2 minute scene for your viewing pleasure! /s&&It was fine in most parts, but watch the fight between all the women and there’s like 1,000 cuts in one second. Marvel told a great story and most of the action was good but it’s definitely not perfect. 

In the BTS the stunt guy even said marvel doesn’t care about choreography as much as creating a fun scene that develops character by allowing for humor and quips. &&Well, it didn't to me.&&That's part of what I liked about Infinity War. There were several long shots in the film, especially at the beginning, and it was very refreshing to see in a big modern blockbuster.&&Something I really appreciated about *Blade Runner 2049* (well, one of many things) is how long some of the shots lasted. It actually had almost twice the number of shots of *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1190 versus 611) and a very similar runtime, but I never felt like it was rushed in the way a lot of modern films were. There were cuts during the action sequences, and while showing the world, but the shots would linger on characters' faces several seconds longer than most modern films do during the talking scenes so you could really see the reactions. I know some people didn't like the runtime of *Blade Runner 2049*, but I really appreciate that they didn't cut those extra seconds out of scenes. It makes the performance feel so much more *real* when you see the characters' expressions and it doesn't just immediately cut away.&&Fast editing holds your attention better but doesn't give you time to take in the context.  This is a conscious decision.&&Yes! Maybe it’s me getting older but I often have issues with many new big movies because of the overall pacing feeling so rushed. For me it’s anything from cramming in as many characters and/or environments as possible to extremely fast cutting. 

I get it can be hard today to keep people’s attention for more than 3 minutes but for me the end result is more often than not a forgettable 2 hours sadly.&&Fucking hate when they cut every few frames during action scenes to the point where you can't even tell what's going on. &&Tarkovsky is who I think about whenever the topic of spare cuts comes up; it doesn't hurt that I wrote my thesis on him, I guess. 

He was of the belief that film was perhaps the only art form in which the sensation of time and its passing can be immediately felt by the consumer of the art and readily, instantly manipulated by the artist; you can experience jumping 50,000 years from proto-humans using a bone as at tool to a Pan-Am spacecraft headed to a space station in 1/24th of a second, essentially, or you can focus on a guy in the backseat of a car while he sits silently for almost five minutes. Longer cuts create what Tarkovsky called the ""pressure of time,"" which he preferred to build in his scenes. I think there's a very distinct experience felt in watching a Tarkovsky film where you come to get a sort of better spatial understanding of a scene or a film because of how long he can let shots run. Feeling the time tick by in something like ""Stalker,"" especially inside the Zone, to me creates a more intimate and dream-like atmosphere. 

Part of the reason I think Tarkovsky's films still stand out, especially against the work of other Soviet contemporaries at the time (much of which is great in its own right, make no mistake), is Tarkovsky's distaste for montage theory. This is a shock to Soviet (and hell, to a degree most) film aesthetic because of the work of people like Eisenstein, Kuleshov, Vertov, etc. who were and are frequently credited with creating the grammar of modern film editing. Tarkovsky did not believe that a scene, or a film in general, was a series of shots which exist in direct relationship to the preceding and succeeding image which move through time. He ""sculpted"" his films in time, letting what he called the ""natural rhythm"" of the shots dictate when it was time to cut. He aimed to create ""poetic films,"" no doubt influenced by the fact that his father was an accomplished poet in the USSR.

That's kind of a stripped down attempt to explain his editing philosophy without writing a small novella. If you're interested in his philosophy on film at all, track down his book 'Sculpting in Time' and his journals 'Time Within Time.' They're a fascinating read. He had some brilliant theories and philosophies, and a few kooky ones which he thankfully later rejected; in 1966, for example, he said that he felt color was a gimmick and that he knew of no film that used color well. 

Edit: Typo, but not a funny one that I would have kept and readily accepted the mockery for having typed. Just a boring old n instead of an m.&&Stalker is a masterpiece, the way Tarkovsky set the shots and move the camera is just brilliant. overall, he's on par with Kubrick, IMO. &&Have you watched Angelopoulos' The traveling players (Ο θίασος)? Very few cuts and masterfully composed scenes that [last for ages](https://youtu.be/_BsiDkHPcDM).&&I think Villeneuve used a nice mix of both long shots and short in Blade Runner 2049.

Breaking Bad was rather good at it too.

I've noticed this with the X-Files as well. 90s episodes had a much slower pace, where as the recent 2 seasons are chock full of rapid-fire cuts. Creates a completely different tone.&&I have yet to watch Better Call Saul, but it's been highly recommended to me for this exact reason. I absolutely love those good, tense, dramatic scenes that are just a conversation or an interaction between two people.

The fight scenes especially are awesome without all the cuts we are accustomed too.

I would love to see Sonatine or Scene at the Sea done like this!&&Editing is an essential part of filmmaking, and 100% required in every movie ever.

-iarestupid&&bad editing will do that&&Well Dave does give the impression that he is rushing as fast as he can in space to save Frank (he’s limited by the lack of gravity and how slow the machinery moves). By the time he finds out the rest of the crew is dead he’s basically fucked and is trying to kill HAL.

There’s no real shot of Dave with the Monolith, but there are some freeze-frame shots of him scared during the light tunnel, and he’s really worried and perplexed when he arrives in the room at the end.

I think I’m getting off track anyway. There is definitely subtext about humanity losing themselves a little bit. I just think the guy who plays Dave gives a great, internalized performance, so I never understood the idea that he was robotic where I find him to be more subtle.&&As a man of science and logic, he probably knows that panicking will only complicate things further, and it's best to keep a clear mind at all times.&&It's never directly mentioned but I've always assumed that his contact with the monolith profoundly changes him (as it did the apes) and that his transformation is already underway before the events of the rest of the movie.&&Here's an actual coincidence: the computer HAL's name is actually the three preceding letters in the alphabet for IBM.&&And HAL was a Caesar Cipher of IBM

This is communicated by the actual (and forgotten/ignored by most audience members) beginning of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which is NOT the first images of the film.  The movie begins with 3 minutes of black screen while the Ligeti choral voices play.

So....

Are we looking at a black screen?

No.

We're looking at the film's first monolith.  

EDIT: Many versions of 2001 do not show the opening music/intro over black screen but the Blu-Ray does. If you want to understand what I'm talking about. Start your Blu-Ray and stare at your screen. Eventually you will realize your anticipation of the first images of the film are causing you to stare at the black 1:4:9 (well, close enough) rectangle in front of you while the music that will soon announce when every monolith appears in the film is playing. &&Um, how could you forget ""DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN!""

""Southern proposed the film as an attempt to reinvent the genre. Kubrick decided against Southern's suggestion in the belief that he did not have the appropriate temperament for pornographic cinema; also, Kubrick did not think that he could sufficiently reinvent the genre to truly elevate it. ""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick%27s_unrealized_projects

Read the book years ago, it was highly average, don't remember much about it. 

Weird thing to pitch to Kubrick but of course Kubrick aspired to make the best movie in every genre, and welp porno is a genre. And what a genre! :D

&#x200B;

EDIT: sorry, I really didn't know. I've only seen maybe <20 movies before 1999 and just saw this movie for the first time last week when AMC was showing it in IMAX for the 50th anniversary. &&Oddly I was just thinking the opposite about Civil War. Some shots felt too quick, especially when Spiderman was involved (his cgi looked out of place to me). I really liked the film but it was almost like they lacked faith in the plot.&&Dont forget Black Panther also had much longer shots than the normal modern blockbuster. The long take casino fight scene is a prime example of this.&&Of course it is. And many people obviously enjoy that. I don't, though. I find the pace of the editing on big blockbusters, in a macro sense, to be too rhythmic and driving. I find there aren't enough ebbs in the flow, so to speak.

This is just my opinion, of course, but I like to think it's an educated opinion, as I am an editor myself.&&Yeah, it overall feels like a bit of an insecurity with letting up on the pace for even a second. I often end up feeling like these movies run too long, when it's not even the length that's the problem, it's that they feel like they cram in a few too many sequences/moments that don't really add anything or move the story forward.&&Fascinating comment, thank you for sharing.

I wanted to ask you about this sentence:

> Tarkovsky is who I think about whenever the topic of spare cuts comes up; it doesn't hurt that I wrote my thesis on him, I guess.

When you added the phrase ""I guess"", is that to signify some sort of humbleness to the act of writing a thesis? Would the sentence have a different meaning if you didn't add that at the end?

In other words, you know very well that you wrote a thesis on Tarkovsky, and you also know that you are very knowledgeable in his work. So is the ""I guess"" meant to take off the edge a bit to make sure that you don't come off as 'too smart'? Or is there another reason for it?

I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but I'm not being sarcastic, I'm genuinely curious in people's thought process when they add these addendums to the end of sentences.&&Wow yes to all of this. I recently got to experience Andrei Rublev for the first time, in the theatre. While the run time is at 3 hr 25 minutes, the film doesn't feel long and drawn out as every moment and every shot gives you space to *feel* it. Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of films that are a tight 90-something minutes, not a second wasted, with concise story telling - but there is just something about Tarkovsky's filmmaking that gives you the extra moment to really feel a scene or a moment, and that is just so special.&&The first time I saw *Stalker,* it was on DVD, and I earnestly wanted  to see it on a big screen. I've gotten to do that twice now. There are subtle elements that are barely discernible on the small screen, such as the excruciatingly slow zoom in the first shot. A lot of people say his films are too static, but in reality there's almost always something happening. But often, it's very subtle. The sound textures in that film are amazing, too. He manages to convey a sense of surreal dread and menace but also sadness and loss, with so little, and so little that you're consciously aware of.&&I will check it out! Thanks for the recommendation. &&I don't even like action movies much and found the Raid enthralling.&&Sometimes it works. Cloverfield worked, for me. Most of the time it makes me a bit sick. I couldn't even watch the Hardcore Henry trailer without feeling seasick.&&*The X-Files* episode ‘Triangle’ is supposed to look like four 11-minute takes. The one following Scully through the FBI is most impressive. &&Was gonna say, pretty much the whole reason Better Call Saul is so good at this is because of how much time they spent perfecting it in Breaking Bad.  Really makes you feel how much the characters are constantly having to weigh options that are usually very rough.  Both fantastic shows in their own right.&&As many awesome moments of visual action that Breaking Bad has, some of my all-time favorite scenes from it are literally just two people talking.&&I just started watching it a few weeks ago, and i like it a bit better then Breaking Bad. The cinematography is amazing, and there are great performances throughout.&&You are correct, I am overstating my case here, it isn't a fair analogy.  Cuts must be used well, serve the artistic purpose, there is a sense in which editing is used to compensate for shitty directing, cinematography, or acting and I abhor these uses of it.  Used well, rapid fire cuts, like in Pulp Fiction's, ""what country you from"" scene is a beautiful usage and the scene is wonderful as a result.  &&Ahh yeah, that can be a factor in certain sequences.&&I heard somewhere that *Taken 3* made *Taken 2* seem as good as *Taken*.  &&2 has its moments, though not many. 3 is unforgivably bad&&I did love Stalker.

Seriously, this is 100% true. In fact, just rewatched the film at the Museum of The Moving Image, in Queens, NY (the “unrestored” Christopher Nolan special) and it was glorious to see this beginning again, same as 50 years ago. They also do it to begin the second part of the film, after the intermission. 
&&Every DVD/Blu-ray copy I've owned of 2001 has started with the black screen.  It upsets me that some don't.&&This is awesome, never realized this. Thanks for the insight!&&It's also 13 boms (iirc..

And then we’ll just spread some rumors of how you’re a dictator while making movies but if anything people will love you MORE for it.&&To be honest you could say that about all of his movies. Except Spartacus &&That’s the joke - it’s seamless.&&I saw it for the first time a few weeks ago too in IMAX. If it had been a movie I was watching at home I would've given up within the first 10 minutes. It moves at a glacial pace the entire movie. Watching a ship dock for 5 minutes just feels needlessly self-indulgent. 
I can definitely see from a technical perspective why the movie is so revered and how it was so influential but man does it not hold up. It honestly feels pretentious the whole time and that people want the movie to be deeper than it really is.&&Yup shots definitely make up a scene. The always start and end a scene and various edits convey a scene change. And yeah 611 is low, even for the time. Kubrick loved really appreciating the special effects and the atmosphere. 

For a modern example Captain America: The Winter Soldier has 3,288 shots [according to this website.](http://www.cinemetrics.lv/movie.php?movie_ID=16601)&&There were more than that even in a shorter movie of the day; 2001 has an unusually slow cutting pattern.&&And then like 30 years later Kubrick made 'Eyes Wide Shut' which is fairly pornographic in its own right.&&I just watched for the first time in IMAX 70mm a few weeks ago. It was amazing. Big ass fucking fetus floating towards Jupiter.&&That's the feeling I get when watching the Winter soldier&&Preaching to the choir here, but the shot when the Maw's ship arrives on Earth and the gradual increase of chaos as the heroes go out to inspect was simply incredible.&&> this feels different to other Marvel movies somehow

To me, it felt a lot like a creepypasta or a childhood nightmare about your favorite characters.&&They're talking about filming time and not camera angle or distance. Basically, the amount of time one camera stays on the same scene (the camera itself can pan, zoom or move around) without cutting to a new camera angle or a different scene. Even when there are hidden cuts inside the scene, as long as they look seamless it counts as one long shot. &&Don't apologize for asking good questions! Looks like others have answered your question, but I just wanted to say how awesome it is that you got to see 2001 on IMAX for your first time! &&Hitchcock's The Rope is one continuous shot (actually two but the edit is hidden).  Check it out, it's a great movie.&&how long a scene goes on before they change camera angles.&&some long shots are just the camera staying in one place, but the best long shots ive ever seen are tracking shots. a few examples are in game of thrones and true detective.&&I recently watched the German Netflix series Dark, it has minute long sequences in which nothing happens, usually with slow music. Sometimes the camera doesn't even pan. Initially it felt like they were constantly padding the episodes, but once I got used to it felt so incredibly relaxing, like the series was OK with me just sitting back and thinking about it, enjoying the actors do small acting tricks.&&Exactly! A lot of movies would be better with less content and just let the story be more focused and have characters who are meaningful to it. &&It's a fair question, and I didn't read sarcasm in it. No humility was intended. I don't work in the academic world of film anymore, so I never get to talk about this with people. When I saw Tarkovsky's name pop up I was pretty excited. All I meant by ""I guess"" was that relative to other people known for their long takes - Kubrick, Tarr, Angelopolous, whomever, really - Tarkovsky is the first that comes to my mind because of my thesis work on him. When I saw the comment about how it seemed like there are so few shots in 2001 for a film of its length, I was preparing almost the exact comment about the shot count in Stalker relative to its length, and it's more or less because Tarkovsky's work is the work I know best in the particular niche topic of more deliberate editing and take lengths. &&The way that I read into that (granted, I'm not him) was that the coincidence of him having written a thesis about it, while potentially pretentious, is presented as just a little comedic. He adds the ""I guess"" to further signify lightheartedness/humor, and the implied lack of seriousness or concern would also further distance him from pretentiousness.

The point of all this seems just to briefly characterize himself positively, so any reader will take his opinions positively.&&Tarkovsky is who he thinks about when the topic of spare cuts comes up. He could have thought about someone else. He is guessing that it's because he wrote his thesis on Tarkovsky that his mind immediately goes to him. 

IMO it's pretty certain that his thesis and thinking of Tarkovsky are related (he might have written it *because* he was interested in Tarkovsky though). The use of ""I guess"" would fit better in the context of something more casual than a thesis.&&Have you seen the sequel?

I was getting downvoted so I was trying to explain that I'm not trying to be flippant, I just really didn't understand it despite it sounding like a simple concept. 

&#x200B;

It was awesome! I was a little thrown by the intermission screen though and looked around and asked someone if this was real or if it was about to come back haha A couple behind me said that's part of the movie. I don't think I've ever been to a movie with an intermission before. I loved it btw! It was insane how great of a story it shared. It felt less like a movie and more like a documentary at times and I think it's because of the long shots as people have mentioned. Also it was strange at first watching scenes with zero background music or noise effects. I liked that a lot. I also tried to take a step back and watch it as if I would've 50 years ago and didn't already hear ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" in other movies. I guess it's kind of like Seinfeld now, for those who didn't watch it before recently they think it's just a show with a bunch of common tropes when it's really the other way around. I also liked that I didn't know of any of the actors and allowed me to accept the story without having reminder thoughts about their other previous roles. All in all, I thought it was fantastic and pre-ordered the 4K disc when it drops in October. 

I didn't quite understand the ending though. Did he go through some kind of wormhole created by the monolith near Jupiter and now he's some kind of cosmic being that is viewing the world from space? &&thanks for the suggestion! I've only seen Psycho and The Birds from him. 2 of the <20 movies I've seen before '99 haha&&ah thanks! That makes sense to me now because when I watched this movie for the first time last week I now recognize what I felt it was ""different"" because some scenes felt more like I was watching a documentary. &&If you like tracking shots...

 &&Yeah, but Civil War was choppy af, especially the first half.&&And just to be a bit of a terminology geek, what people are calling ""long shots"" in this thread are technically called ""long takes"". A ""long shot"" refers to the distance between the camera and the subject.

The 2nd monolith is buried on the moon as an alarm to alert the aliens that we have evolved enough to leave “the cradle of earth”. The 3rd monolith brings Bowman across space and time, in a comfortable “cage” made to resemble what aliens would think is luxury (even though it’s all wrong). Bowman is taken to the next stage of evolution, reborn as a star child. That’s it. Not showing any aliens was brilliant because not all only did they not have the technology to depict them in a non-cheezy way, it also shows aliens as incomprehensible, in the same way as a mouse could never understand a television.&&If you pick up the novelization, the ending is fully explained, but you more or less got it right.

Answer: It’s not, the authors of the site are biased as hell and basically reach their conclusions based on how they want the movie to be perceived.

I went through Hidden Figures, a film they rated as 75% accurate. For nearly every single “True” scene, it says “This never happened” or “This didn’t happen in a way anything like this”, followed by “However, we decided to say it’s ‘True’ because it illustrates racial and gender injustice that was common at the time.”&&I feel like I could watch Selma and find 0.1% of falsish scenes &&I know for Selma there were copyright disputes between the movie producers and the King family/estate resulting in the movie not using the actual speeches from MLK.

So it's not so much that I found fault with anything in the film as what it left out. &&Read Jane Hawking's book! It was lovely and spelled out much more detail. &&From what I understand, that one would fall pretty low&&That stuff ruined the whole movie for me. As someone who watches a lot of Air Crash Investigation, the NTSB is a hell of an agency whose work has probably saved tens of thousands of lives over the years.&&The problem is, the movie is short as is.  The drama HAD to be added.  There's only so much movie you can make out of a 10 minute flight and a 24 minute rescue. 

Random question: With how badly the plane was damaged from the bird strike, wouldn't the plane have been scuttled anyway if they landed at EWR or Teterboro? &&However, that aspect of the movie did communicate the very real fear and risk (from the pilots' point of view) of the NTSB blaming it on the crew. Part of their job is to have a human performance panel, and they absolutely investigate whether or not the crew acted appropriately and if they could've taken actions to have saved the plane but didn't. 

For example, the NTSB did conclude that if the crew had initiated an immediate turn-around they could've laded at LGA with a high degree of probability. However, they didn't find fault with the crew because the possibility of doing so vanished when they accounted for a reasonable length of time for the pilots to perform basic troubleshooting.

There's a great episode of a great series called *Air Crash Investigations* that goes into Flight 1549: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUR3q25g9g. It discusses the NTSB investigation in greater depth than *Sully*, and with less artistic license.

So from the viewpoint of the movie communicating to the audience the actual feelings behind that aspect of the NTSB's investigation, it's accurate. Their actions they took in the span of a few minutes, and their careers up until that point, went under intense scrutiny for months and months as part of the normal course of the investigation.&&Someone said in a review that The Big Short isn’t a drama... it’s a fucking horror movie.

EDIT: just actually read the facts and holy shit... despite the infant son dying instead of the brother who committed suicide and the guys going into Lehman Brothers after it went belly up, everything is true in some form.... wow. That really is terrifying to think about &&If you like the movie, read the book.&&[deleted]&&I love that movie, but I end up being furious by the time it's over.&&Yeah except some of the not true parts are pretty important. For instance the film implies ratings agencies were stamping MBS just because they knew others would anyway but the truth is the risk modeling being used downplayed the risk of certain left tail events because they had never happened before. Basically a nationwide downturn in housing was modeled as such a remote possibility that the risk was essentially considered irrelevant. This may or may not have created the condition where a nationwide turndown in housing was possible to begin with. Either way the movie completely ignored the complexities there in favor of some narrative about the agencies just not caring.  If anyone's curious [this](https://www.ft.com/content/912d85e8-2d75-11de-9eba-00144feabdc0) a good read about the issues with risk modeling. Just one of the many sides to the perfect storm that was the GFC. (if it comes up as a pay wall just Google ""the formula that felled wall street- the Google link typically skips the pay wall) 


Also the end credits part was completely bullshit and clearly written by someone who didn't understand finance. Michael Burry never invested in water and Bespoke Tranche Opportunities aren't a thing. The first was someone who wrote that epilogue not understanding a broad analogy Burry used in an interview to describe agricultural plays and the second was literally a tongue in cheek quip put in a single email from a Goldman rep. Mortgage tranches never went away because the problem wasn't the tranches themselves it was the shit put in the tranches and mislabeled. Risk modeling, capital requirements, and oversight have completely changed since 2008 which is the important part. 

Not to say you shouldn't enjoy the movie.  Just realize that it had a narrative to push and ignores some important things in creating that narrative.  It isn't so much that there are lies in the film, just that there's a whole shit ton left out which can give someone some pretty glaring misconceptions about 08.

&&And be terrified. &&As an Apollo nerd, there are quite a lot of little flaws in the movie, and plenty of stuff got compressed or removed for the sake of the run time.  Gene Krantz and his ""White Team"" of flight controllers got the focus of the movie while Glynn Lunney and his Black Team got kind of short changed IMO.  (They took over shortly after the accident happened and recognized the seriousness of the situation and powered down the CSM and took major steps for bringing the crew home safely).  The Gold and Maroon teams don't even get mentioned.

The movie shows the astronauts bickering a bit and getting heated in ways that never happened (apparently the audience couldn't buy the astronauts being so cool in a dangerous situation).

The film also kind of makes a Debbie Downer or even an antagonist out the ""Grumman guys"" when preparing to do a course correction burn, ""We designed the LEM to land on the Moon, not fire the engine out there for course corrections.""  In reality the Grumman engineers were doing everything they could to help the situation and had even done conceptual work on the ""LEM lifeboat"" scenario before the flight.

Still, for a Hollywood popcorn flick the movie does a great job showing the mission in an entertaining and dramatic way.  Lots and lots of dialog was taken verbatim from the archival tapes.&&It's worth watching History Buffs' video on Apollo 13. Actually all of his videos are worth seeing.&&One of my favorite YouTube channels did a breakdown of the movie. He doesn't go scene by scene but gives you a grasp of things that get changed for the sake of entertainment. https://youtu.be/zjCOMJDULaE&&I'm an Apollo history buff and I've written professionally about the mission before. Off the top of my head, I'd rate the film _Apollo 13_ at probably 65-70% accurate. There are multiple composite characters, and many incidents are combined while others are omitted or shown out of order. The movie is _outstanding_ in capturing the look, feel, and spirit of the Apollo era and the hardware in particular, but it's not super-duper technically accurate (something Ron Howard freely admitted, because his job was to make an entertaining film based on an historical event).

If you're looking for a deconstruction of the Apollo 13 accident and the mission, IEEE Spectrum wrote [the definitive analysis](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution) a few years ago. It's unfortunately paywalled now, though.

I used it (and several other sources, most especially Cox & Murray's _[Apollo: Race to the Moon](https://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Race-Moon-Charles-Murray/dp/067170625X)_ text, which is probably the best Apollo history book ever written) in pulling together a less-exhaustive but still-IMO-great [piece on Ars Technica about the mission](https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/02/the-greatest-leap-part-5-saving-the-crew-of-apollo-13/).&&I met Fred Haise (drove him to an event from our airport and back) and he was a really great/captivating guy. The night before I drove him, I actually watched Apollo 13 for the first time, and I asked him what the biggest differences were.

he told, specifically, or at the least the things that stood out to him the most, were that 

* they really didn't argue like they did in the movie, after shit went down. They were all pretty calm and collected. he said they just needed to add some drama.

* and 2, when they're trying to straighten out the ship/set their course correction, in the movie they keep looking out the window, and you see the Earth swaying around as if the ship is flailing about. In reality, he told me the Earth was nearly dead still in the center of the viewport. That's actually just how accurate they had to be, like even tho the Earth was completely still in their viewport, they still might've been 100% off course. Space is spooky.

Really cool, interesting guy. He even sent me a signed photograph a few weeks later, which I thought was awesome. Still hanging up in my room today.

&&As somebody who just about remembers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, *Rush* didn't ring true to life at all for me... which is the movie's greatest strength.

That took a second.  &&hunt and lauda were roommates in london early in their career and were good friends&&I believe the book you're trying to remember is Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges. I also read it before seeing the movie and I was livid. So incredibly disappointing.&&They changed Turing's personality too much to fit the characters Cumberbatch would play. The real Turing was extroverted and would joke around. &&The movie is worth watching and enjoying just for Cumberbatch's acting.

By the end of the movie I didn't even care about the story but I was livid at the way Turing was pushed aside. The movie really showed how one person can be ousted from society and made feel like the loneliest person on the planet.

It's more of a really depresing Forrest Gump movie than a biography.&&I thought it was decent upon first viewing in theatres but was pretty dismayed to learn of the artistic liberty they took with pretty basic stuff such as Turing's personality. They just wanted Cumberbatch to play a Sheldon Cooper kind of character so that they could lazily portray a troubled and socially awkward genius narrative. I have no problem with biopics/true story films taking liberties in the interest of time but to severely and materially alter the personality of the biopic's subject in such a way really made me resent an otherwise well made and well acted film.&&There's some truth though. Minnesota is cold and White Bear Lake's mascot is the bear. &&Just all red.&&And the Blair witch project&&Also Pokemon&&Fargo was the first one I thought of, too. Those Coen boys rock.&&I recall the FBI agent played by Tom Hanks wasn't based on a single person. They needed to simplify the narrative so people could follow it. He was created to help with that. &&I read the book after the movie came out and there were a lot of changes. The biggest probably being that Frank never saw his father again after he ran away. &&Fantastic Film! The crazy thing is pretty much all of the crazy CIA and East-German stuff is accurate. The Soviet Union really was a farce.

The three glaring fabrications are (1) Donovan's home was never shot-up, (2) Donovan never saw someone get shot escaping across the Berlin Wall, and (3) the student who crossed into East Berlin didn't do it dramatically as the wall was being built, but shortly afterwards. Also, Frederic Pryor (the captured student) was interviewed after the movie and said Vogel ""was actually a very nice guy"", and not a brutish government stooge like was portrayed in the movie.

That said, my main issue with the movie is how they treated the U2 pilot. In the movie he was caught off-guard and shot down by 3 or 4 of SAMs, and it's implied he caved during questioning in the USSR. In reality, he gave a decent chase; he was intercepted by 2 soviet fighter pilots (one of which was shot down by a Soviet SAM) and it took 14 SAMs in multiple volleys before he was finally hit. There's also no reason to believe he gave up anything to the Soviets (only media speculation after the prisoner exchange). He was even allowed to continue working as a test pilot after getting home. I can understand how the other inaccuracies were done to streamline the plot / heighten the stakes / add some drama, but don't see the justification for portraying the pilot like that.&& You want to learn more about Donovan, here’s an article from his alumni magazine: https://news.fordham.edu/fordham-magazine/metadiplomat-the-real-life-story-of-bridge-of-spies-hero-james-b-donovan/&&Well, mostly...

In reality, Johnson was supportive of the civil rights movement and willingly worked with King to secure voting rights for African-Americans ([here's a phone call between Johnson and King where they discuss raising awareness of voting problems in the South](http://archive.millercenter.org/presidentialrecordings/lbj-wh6501.04-6736)). In real life, LBJ and MLK didn't have a falling out until the latter began criticizing the Vietnam War.

It's a shame that *Selma* had to villainize Johnson, because it's otherwise a nearly flawless movie.&&That's very surprising, you'd think that historically significant things such as political/revolutionary/protest speeches would be covered by fair use. &&reenacting the speeches doesn't make it fake unless they said things in the speeches that he never said. If they just filmed their own version of an actor doing the speeches that still makes it all true. &&I haven’t seen Selma, do they have made up speeches or do they simply skip those events?&&It was pretty disheartening to really enjoy the movie when it came out only to find out shortly afterwards that practically every major plot point was heavily fictionalized. &&As if the codebreakers themselves were in charge of deciding whether to disseminate the intelligence or not.&&It was just a cheap imitation.&&The Imitation Movie&&“Lets make a movie about PT Barnum, but remove the parts where he kidnaps and/or exploits disabled people”

Martin Scorsese even blacked out the airline ticket near the end of the movie. Why? Because the airline company that was actually used in real life (American Airlines, I believe?) didn't want to be associated with a gangster movie/organized crime.   

People say that it was because it was before they could digitally alter the ticket and the scene was already shot. That *may* be true, but they probably could have gotten around that in another way. I think that Scorsese wanted accuracy and didn't want to use a fake airline. Surely, they wouldn't shoot the scene, and *then* try to get permission to use the company, right? I don't know. It's interesting, though. &&Looking at the breakdown for Hacksaw ridge, it appears a lot of the falsehoods are time compression related, or involve characters that didn't exist in real life and are probably combinations of multiple people for the sake of the movie. They marked any scene false that featured Doss alone with a made-up character. I guess that's fair, but if you didn't look at the breakdown you'd probably assume that the false scenes involved things like Doss kicking a grenade (which happened), but in reality it mostly is marking other details which aren't major deviations, and are mostly there to serve the story. 
&&They used that excuse but then also exaggerated the size of the cliff and had a dude running around like captain america with a torso shield so...&&Dude fucking stood on a grenade to save his comrades and got launched in the air. Imagine seeing that in a movie lol&&That's what I heard too, and it would be good if there was a way to tell the difference between the kind of falsehoods.

Any thoughts?&&I mean when you really think about it it’s not *that crazy.* Most of the movie is just ultra rich frat bros doing drugs and banging hookers in NYC.

So it's not like they frame it as a perfect romance.&&It also makes her out to be the bad one in their relationship, which was false.

&&This is how I felt after Ray.

How so?&&I also am an avid fan of Air Crash Investigation. I hate that movie because of their absurd portrayal of the NTSB.&&[deleted]&&If I'm remembering this movie correctly the point of the ""investigation"" was because they thought Sullenberger was too quick to ditch the plane in the river rather than try to land at Teterboro, and they wanted to prevent anyone attempting that in the event of future similar accidents. But it turned out he was right anyway in this fake situation.

I really disliked that scene because of how simply the investigation was overturned by the dude telling them to change one setting in their simulation and suddenly the test pilots couldn't do it anymore. Resolved as suddenly as it came about.&&Probably not, there wouldn't have been any major structural damage, so probably would have been good to go after new engines and skin repair, but ultimately up to insurance to figure that out, planes have been through worse and still went on to fly.&&The way it was added basically smeared one of the most important and little understood government agencies we have.

He was in the eye of the storm working on securitizations and making millions for his bank with his team.

Basically, watching that movie with him gave me a new type of respect for my dad, seeing how accurate the movie was and how stressful his world is daily.&&[deleted]&&HATED that film when saw in the theater.

Edit: Take a look at the original link: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/
Some of the moments of The Big Short that are marked False/False-ish are actually very accurate. For example, one moment is marked completely false, but the only thing wrong was 1 character was swapped with another. In another moment, it shows Geller & Shipley wandering around empty Lehman offices, but in reality they didn't sneak into the building unlike how it was shown in the movie. Seems like The Big Short should have been 95% or 96% accurate&&Keep in mind it's a selective snapshot of one part of that whole crisis. Note how most of the characters and protagonists are actually hedge fund managers who had no problem walking away with 10's of millions for themselves while the economy crashed - after betting on it, yet the film makes us empathise with them, support them, root for them. Yeah. There's a high amount of selective context in the film. Entertaining film, don't get me wrong, but for those of us who are big into the crisis, the history of it and so on.. this film represents only a portion of it, and that portion is quite filtered



&&I'd add 'Too Big to Fail' to that list as well. It's a movie produced by HBO about the crisis from the perspective or the Treasury Department, and their actions to try and mitigate it. &&99 homes and a birch hit one. &&The Lehman Brothers scene was a fantastic visualization of the aftermath.&&Does it have Margot Robbie in the tub, though?

edit:

Now, seriously. I believe it's totally another beast.

People amused at the ""presentation"" of the movie will find the book pretty dry, I believe. It has 10x the info, but ten times less charm. 

I loved both.&&Reminds me of ""Enron:  The Smartest Guys In The Room.""

First time I saw it I was shouting at my TV screen in anger.  But these guys made those guys look like small potatoes by comparison.  &&[deleted]&&The genius of the movie (and book) is that it manages to turn a very complicated financial crisis into basically a standard disaster movie, which is what it actually was.

The whispers of an approaching problem, the gradual realization of impending calamity, the attempts to forestall it, the attempts to survive it, the calamity itself, the dazed wandering through the aftermath.

The plot's timing very closely parallels something like Dante's Peak or The Wave.

It's magnificent.&&I don't think that audiences wouldn't believe astronauts would be cool under pressure. It just adds more drama than if they stayed calm the way that astronauts are selected and trained to be.&&Also, as noted on the commentary track by Jim Lovell himself, he hugged Fred Haise from behind to warm him up, not the front. He made a very specific note to mention that, and it always struck me how he was concerned about how it would be perceived. As if anyone would judge him for the manner in which he gave body heat to one of his crewmembers.&&>Lots and lots of dialog was taken verbatim from the archival tapes.

It's ironic though that the most famous line from the film ""Houston, we have a problem"" was actually "" ""Okay, Houston, *we've had* a problem here.""&&Totally second this.

Like they had this famous ongoing professional rivalry for sure, but they were actually friends more so than constantly loathing each other. &&It's exactly the sort of thing he would do. There's a great clip of Hunt punching a marshall who came to check on him after a crash. Hunt immediately apologised but it was a great demonstration of his act first, think later approach to life. &&He's a great actor. Too bad we didn't see Xemo vs Thor for the 2nd time. &&It's a great movie. If you like racing it's even better, but should be very enjoyable to just about anyone. &&Its like The Prestige in car racing form. &&Could you please explain a little what makes the movie so different? I was shocked to see that so much if it isn't quite true and I am wondering why it has that poor ratio. &&Yeah. I wish they had left him that way too because I think Cumberbatch could play a character like that quite well but he's been type cast as an asshole genius. He does that role well but it just isn't very diverse and he's a great actor. And interesting enough the role where he shows just how good he is at being something other than that is the role that set him up to be type cast. As Sherlock he ends up playing so many different emotions and personalities. Especially when he almost overdoses or is high he is so much more than just an asshole genius. And in the final episode of the last season he shows so much emotion. He's a great actor... He's been limited. &&Yeah. The movie was great which added to my annoyance about it being so far from the real story. In the end though I do like the movie.&&Go Bears.&&[deleted]&&These are based on true stories, not actual true stories ;)&&I can't comment on the entire plot. But Frank abagale is definitely a real person who did a lot of what's in the movie.

Thanks!&&I had no idea that Donovan's house was never shot, that's a pretty big fabrication. Still, if that's the biggest liberty they took, that's impressive that the most dramatic and interesting aspects were all true.&&I don't remember any strong implications that the pilot talked. I remember it being pretty ambiguous but leaning towards him not saying anything. What was it that hinted to you he talked?

Most of them were about a suicide that never happened, but the real people it was based on actually lost a child and didn't want to relive the pain seeing it portrayed on screen. A few other things were changed for dramatic effect, but the story was otherwise 100% accurate.  
  
Now it's SUPER depressing.&&This thing is actually wildly inconsistent. I've been reading the scene by scene breakdown for Hacksaw Ridge and some things which I think should fall into the Unknown category are marked as False. Such as:

>**Movie** DOSS is alone with his bible when SMITTY grabs it from him from behind. He then confronts DOSS & attempts to provoke him. He mocks the size of his bible then smacks DOSS across the face, calls him a coward & urges him to retaliate.

> **Reality** Doss was repeatedly mocked & abused throughout training so scenes of this nature are likely to have taken place.

Then there's this scene which is marked as True which reads:

>**Movie** DOSS finds PINNICK, who believes he is blind. DOSS washes the mud out of his eyes & he sees again. PINNICK is overjoyed. DOSS continues on his mission.

>**Reality** Doss discusses this moment in the 2004 documentary, but it happened in Guam, & he was to discover the next day that the soldier had died.

It literally says that it didn't happen at that battle. It happened in Guam. But it's marked as True. And yet earlier in the movie it decidedly marks a scene as false because it has a caption saying that the scene takes place at ""Blue Ridge Mountains Virginia"" but is false because the filming took place in Australia.

I feel that this was an attempt to be interesting and a fascinating examination of ""true stories"" in Hollywood but upon closer inspection you find that whoever made this completely half-assed it. If you want to be very judicial, fine, but at least be consistent within your own work.&&There is a filter on the website that provides this info. This is the results on the ""lenient"" setting. No film got above 81% on true facts only. &&I’m a 40 year old, white, straight male, and I will watch that movie EVERY single time it’s on tv. It’s really good.&&It really is. If not for Vietnam Johnson would have been remembered as one of the greatest US Presidents.  But the US involvement in south east Asia really overshadowed his legacy. &&I found their depiction of LBJ to actually be far kinder than he probably deserved. He wasn't completely for the Civil Rights movement until the more revolutionary black nationalists turned up the heat. 

He played a political con game, where on the one hand he supported the message of ""we shall overcome"", while simultaneously calling for the support of Richard Russell, his Dixiecrat, southern segregationist buddy to his aide immediately after the assassination of JFK. 

If you look at any action LBJ took to assist black Americans PRIOR to February of 1965, it was usually at a time that was politically convenient for the Democrats to garner the assistance of the black voting block - which was the deciding factor in the election against Goldwater. 

When it came to actually DOING something, LBJ stood idly by while municipal and state law enforcement officers violated the Civil Rights Act passed the year before, even after his ""friend"" MLK Jr was arrested in Selma. 

LBJ didn't issue the National guard until Malcolm X declared that ""if Rockwell's presence in Alabama causes harm to come to Dr. King or any other Black person in Alabama who's doing nothing other than trying to enjoy their rights, then Rockwell and his Ku Klux Klan friends would be met with maximum retaliation from those of us who are not handcuffed by this nonviolent philosophy"". 

LBJ didn't actually give a fuck. Politically, he needed the black voting block and realised that they were becoming fed up with empty promises and 10% effort shown to them. So he promised 80% while knowing his own friends would block most of it from actually happening. 

His eventual actions led to positive change, yes. But the man was by no means an angel. &&Yeah if we're going by actually words said then all of these would be 100% false.  The event happened just the words are different.&&They have made-up speeches, but they sound so much like his style, that I thought they were real until I read about the script being unable to use the real ones. &&It really distorted things. Read something that the family of the ""villain"" general was really mad that the film had totally trashed his reputation. In real life the guy had been super supportive and an overall good dude. Then 70 years later a movie needs a villain and associates his name and position with being an asshole. 

EDIT: Ok here's a quote from Wikipedia about it.

>Denniston's grandchildren stated that the film takes an ""unwarranted sideswipe"" at their grandfather's memory, showing him to be a ""baddy"" and a ""hectoring character"" who hinders the work of Turing. They said their grandfather had a completely different temperament from the one portrayed in the film and was entirely supportive of the work done by cryptographers under his command. There is no record of the film's depicted interactions between Turing and Denniston. Indeed, before the war, Denniston recruited lecturers at Oxford and Cambridge, and Turing, Welchman, and others began working part-time for him then.Turing was always respected and considered one of the best code-breakers at Bletchley Parkand in short order took on the role of a leader there.

Just read the [article on the film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game?wprov=sfla1). There's a large section on innacuracies because it got so much blatantly wrong. 

&&It was *really* disheartening to know a lot about Turing and Bletchley, then see the film butcher their history, then listen to people say how much they liked the film.&&It wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be the kind of show that PT Barnum would try to make. He'd sweep all the dirty stuff under the rug and make something shallow and enjoyable that would appeal to as many people as possible.&&I meant more so the events and timeline depicted in the movie. Martin followed the book almost word for word, even Henry and Karen's narration in the movie was lifted from the book.

It was a movie made by an [acclaimed director](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkumar_Hirani) who is his real life friend, and the movie is a 'pure PR move to clean Dutt's image. And I kid you not, I've seen the whole theatre giving a standing ovation after the movie. I felt dirty.&&It's interesting to me how divisive this movie is (at least on Reddit). In my opinion it was very anti-war and showed how PTSD had destroyed this man and was tearing his family apart. Sure it has its rah rah moments, but overall I thought it was a good display of how shitty war is.&&There were parts of it that reminded me of that movie at the end of Inglorious Basterds, it started making me a little uncomfortable when I made that connection.&&If a movie where a guy's first kill after being deployed are a mother and child, where the war mentally scars the protagonist and his brother and almost ruins his marriage, and then ends up indirectly getting the protagonist killed is the most blatant propaganda film you've ever seen, then you've never actually seen a blatant propaganda film.&&Yeah I like how it got an Oscar nom for BEST EDITING lol.

It is, mostly due to Dodd-Frank/Basel III. Although Congress recently rolled back some of the protections from Dodd-Frank at the request of regional banks.

I should also mention that Jim Lovell did an excellent audio commentary on the film.  People interested in the movie should definitely buy/rent/borrow a copy of the DVD or Blu-ray and give it a listen!  (There is also a separate track with Director Ron Howard which is interesting as well.)&&I think if they did it accurately it would be interesting to watch, but nowhere near as entertaining. &&Jim Lovell was in the Navy. I always took him saying that kind of jokingly, like no homo between bros. &&No homo!&&I remember around the time of production, Ron Howard was often at F1 races doing his research (possibly as a guest of Lauda).&&I wish more producers would bring in experts to get the smaller technical things like that correct&&so that time the guy at the bar showed he the keys to his Ferrari F1 car was all a lie?&&Lauda has gone on record saying that he was very sad to hear Hunt had passed away at the age of 45, and that Hunt was one of the very few in the industry he genuinely liked

Iirc Lauda later said it was the right thing to do and that he didn't regret it one bit, but at times it was hard to live with the mercurial and erratic Hunt. It was basically the start of Hunts recovery though.&&I just finished watching it. I don't care for racing but that was a great movie.

They had a perfect - too good to be true - story with a heartbreaking ending, a story that should be hard to fit into a single movie.  Instead of telling that story straight and giving it the emotional weight it deserved, they spent half the movie on some fictitious over-dramatized tropes.

I felt the same way about [Kill the Messenger](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1216491/?ref_=nv_sr_1).&&They missed Argo&&I would have guessed ""American who thinks they probably have a Scottish ancestor somewhere back there""&&Scotland despises this movie.

Just nitpicks though, that he wouldn't go to do the research himself and stuff, they even said another on his team really did meet a stripper who had multiple mortgages, but marked it as false.

That's like saying ""If not for the Iraq War and the War on Terror Bush would be remembered as a much better President.""&&The whole theme/concept of the movie was that in addition to being closeted, Turing was this irascible outcast who couldn't get along with anyone,  and had this idea that no one else saw any value in.

The villain boss, the ineptitude of British Intelligence, the team pinpointing the location of every ship in the Atlantic overnight AND discovering that one of the team's brothers is in grave danger.

They took what could have been an amazing movie about solving a puzzle, working with people of different disciplines, genders, and organizations (various military groups) and turned it into an unnecessary drama.

I don't see why the race against the clock to solve the problems, understanding how they solved it, etc. couldn't be the main focus. The movie could have been a modern day Das Boot with a different context and it would have been an incredible piece of art.&&That’s similar to the villain in Cinderella Man, who’s portrayed as a huge asshole who brags about the fact that he’s killed two men in the ring.

JACKED TO THE TITS!!!!&&Too true. 

Pacing, which arises in production, played such a key role in that movie. It allowed you to balance education with engagement (read: entertainment). 

Im not particularly knowledgeable but I’d assume that, often, when production is done best it’s the type of thing that you can’t put your finger on, because like you said it’s part of an overall polished product &&Tell me how much you're worth, and I'll tell you how much I'm worth.&&*...and then he took that call.*

^(or something like that, I don't remember the exact line but I remember the phone call. Such a great scene.)&&And he left the world of investing. The little investing he does now is over one commodity.

Water.&&Well, the main difference between this and the real occurrence is that it wasn't Eisman; it was Daniel who was speaking to the stripper, so I don't think it is fair to declare a scene entirely false just because it was the close business partner of a person and not the other person themselves in a scene that is otherwise accurate with what happened. They could have marked it True-ish or at least False-ish. The event in question did happen, unlike the other ""False"" declarations of things in other movies that are entirely made up. It could have been film scheduling, etc. to explain why they had the other guy there.

However, I'm sorry if I got that Lehman Brothers scene wrong, what I was saying is that I interpreted the ""sneaking"" into the building as that Geller & Shipley simply walked in. I can't find the movie on Netflix, at least in my country, and I can't find much more when researching to figure out if they didn't go in at all or that they didn't ""sneak"" in.&&They also address it at the end when Vennet says that he wasn't trying to be the good guy or the hero, he was just doing exactly what he was hired to do, others be damned and that many of us can empathize with.

I don’t think they went far enough on that end.&&>But the most unforgivable part was when they had Turing discover the spy and keep his mouth shut so that his own secret wouldn't get out. Why make a biopic of someone who did so much great work only to slander him like that?

This in particular annoys me not only because, as you said, it slanders Alan Turing (by basically making him a self-serving coward) but also because it subtly justifies not allowing homosexuals in the government.

One reason people didn't like the thought of gays working on top secret projects was because they thought an enemy could use the knowledge of a closeted persons sexuality as blackmail against them, like what happened in the movie. It basically shot it's own message of tolerance in the foot just to create drama.&&>AND discovering that one of the team's brothers is in grave danger.

Being fair here, that particular scene is a type I don't mind seeing in biographical dramas.

It's so directly a convenient and over-the-top coincidence that it is obvious that it's a Hollywood fiction that did not actually occur in reality.

But it very efficiently demonstrated and personalized the horrible dilemma these people were faced with.  No, they weren't leaving one of their colleague's brothers to die, but all the same, every time they didn't warn a ship of an impending attack, they were leaving *someone's* brother to die.  A whole ship of someones' brothers.  In order to hopefully save *more* on the net by being judicious about which were saved and which were not.

So:
 
1) The scene must be obviously fake enough nobody can complain if they failed to understand that.

2) The scene portrays an accurate message or concept.

That particular scene passed both of those points for me.&&Even though basically no-one was against what he did. But of course there had to be an investigation anyway. That's the nature of things. &&if it was just another war movie about a battle i would've thought it was a bit much, but I thought the gore really made hacksaw ridge that much more impactful when you contrast how brutal it was to doss's selfless character&&I just looked up the human shield scene online.

Funny story, his real name is Ratesh Bhalla. He chose Sonjay Dutt as his wrestling name because he's a big fan of the actor, who the movie 'Sanju' was based on. &&The playa from the himalaya, I haven't watched wrestling in 10 years yet at one point he was my favorite X division star&&Her first real exposure to mainstream Indian audiences was through the Indian version of the Big Brother reality show (Big Boss)

During her stay on the show people weren't really sure why she was there/famous until she finally said she had a background as a pornstar. Since then she's found a decent but of succes, but almost with an overtly sexual portrayal. 

Typecasting is insanely fast and hard to break from in Indian entertainment, and most actors/actresses mainly play one or two types of roles (eg maternal/bad guy/quirky best friend.) Sunny's been type-cast as an ""item girl,"" basically the sex appeal for the movie, and is mostly doing sort of raunchy, almost mainstream smut movies which are doing quite well. She's getting a couple cameos I think, but that's it.

All his kills were armed combatants, within the rules of engagement.&&The film’s issue is that it makes Chris 100% hero with no subtlety, when that is controversial. No attempt at all to tackle how his real interviews show him dehumanising the people he was shooting at.

For me, the film wasn’t pro or anti war, but it was too far pro-US soldier. Conflicts rarely have a “good” and “bad” side, but you’d never know that from this film.

Actually I think most people really do. It's just that their idea of ""learning"" is a big stupid mix of what they see in popular movies and talking shit about politics with people who already agree with them.

AKA no actual work or study beyond high school, if that.&&Maybe they did learn. They learnt how to get away with it. &&Total US Mortgage debt 8.8 trillion

Total US student loan debt is 1.3 trillion

You are right, but 1.3 trillion is still a ton and the number is growing incredibly fast. Tuition costs are rising and new grads wages have been pretty stagnate. My anecdotal experience at school right now is that most of those that are borrowing vast amounts of money are not in fields where they will make that money back. 

So while loan recipients cannot declare bankruptcy to get rid of the debt, it doesn't change the fact that a ton of recent graduates will not be able to pay the loans anyway. 

Student loans are also not collateralized. If a borrower defaults on their mortgage the lender at least gets the house back. 

It's definitely a different problem than MBS because 90% of this debt is held by the government. They don't check credit. These guaranteed loans are also the reason that tuition is going up so much, causing even more loans to be taken out. College is a bubble and it's definitely getting bigger. 

The leverage was a huge problem with MBS. Who was it, Goldman Sachs I think, that was leveraged 15x into MBS.  This isn't a current problem with SLABS. I'm not saying this will cause the next crash, but it's not helping.

Just don’t watch it with your parents like I did...&&I believe it was the part (I’m paraphrasing a bit here) where he received major wounds to his leg from either enemy fire or a grenade going off, and he was put on a stretcher. As he was being taken to the medics tent, he saw a wounded soldier nearby, and told the stretcher carriers to let him off and grab the other guy instead; he then proceeded to crawl the rest of the way to the medics tent (I think around 300 - 400 meters). &&This is from his Medal of Honor citation:

""On 21 May, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited five hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Private First Class Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, this time suffering a compound fracture of one arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station.""

Damn, strong disagree regarding... Both, really.

There's only one Tom Hardy movie in which I haven't just seen Tom Hardy and that's Locke; which is impressive (not necessarily in a good way) considering how he's played so many different characters. Egerton is positively a different person in each one of the few roles he has.

I was right.&&https://youtu.be/fnyMUpPdVqw&&Sacha isn't necessarily a better actor but he had a lot of good ideas for the Mercury film (namely historical accuracy and wanting to display the not so glamorous parts of Freddie) but that caused creative differences.&&Sorry didn't explain very well. Not that he's a better actor. But Cohen has a greater pressence in my opinion and I feel he's much stronger for Mercury. Don't mean to disrespect Malik and his portrayal looks fine. I'm just a huge Queen fan - to me Mercury is the greatest frontman there's ever been, and I put all my eggs in the Cohen basket when it was first announced. I also preferred the darker/realistic/adult direction Cohen was taking the project. It does look a bit glossy from the trailer. But it'll be a feel-good singalong and enjoyable for the casual moviegoer, which is what they're after. Can't say I blame May/Taylor for doing it this way.&&Cohen has had some amazing roles where he loses himself in the roles he plays and he has also proved he can sing in at least 2 roles.&&Cohen just completely becomes the characters he acts, and will do completely anything. It says so much about him that he was in massive films (E.g. Borat) where he was in character fooling people, and still in 2018 he can do it all over again without being recognised. 

If they were going for the original (and arguably far more interesting) take on Freddie’s life, I.e. completely crazy, I don’t think anyone could have pulled it off better. &&Haha that's fair enough. But I gotta say, I think he's insanely versatile. The Dark Knight, Lawless and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are three of my favourite performances and he's very different in each. I never watched Locke but it's been on my to-watch list since it came out. Maybe time to give it a go.&&Fassbender is fucking phenomenal&&WE WANT MORE ASHTON KUTCHER&&Timberlake (putting his music career aside) is a lot like Jon Hamm- a good comic supporting actor in need of a solid dramatic leading role tailored specifically to his gifts.

I actually had the privilege of seeing Elton John live last weekend and he was incredible.  &&I know and the original is great, but let's be honest, the version everyone knows is Eric Clapton's. &&Don't forget about After Midnight, also JJ's.&&Actually the original song ""Cocaine Blues"" dates back to the early 1900's, possibly late 1800's. It sounded much different, of course, but it was the root of these later songs. You can hear the closest to the original if you search Rev. Gary Davis. He was an amazing musician who could play pretty much any style of the old, old finger picked blues.&&Dude no one has done more cocaine than James Brown&&Keith Richards?&&I dunno.

If the movie is mostly young Elton, it makes more sense to cast a younger person (rather than CGI/make up the shit out of an older person, which is the only thing I can imagine you’re referencing here; and besides, Marvel had already cast those actors in older roles and just needed them to be young for a single scene or movie here and there).&&I half-expected that link to be Mrs. Featherbottom.&&Better Call Saul standing next to Spongebob Squarepants, hehe&&Haha.

I thought it was fantastic. Why didn’t more people like it?&&It's my birthday!&&""Captain Fantastic"" is such a brilliant concept album: a hugely successful rock star looks back on his days as a struggling songwriter, and gradually rubs away the nostalgia until he sees his past for what it was: frustrating, pretentious and full of really mediocre songwriting.

It's a fun deconstruction of the sell-out narrative: instead of discovering that he's lost his touch, the narrator realizes that, though they were the happiest days of his life his early work was unpolished and ultimately unsatisfying. But then, in the final song, the narrator admits that in a way, he misses the early days.

(If you're not familiar with Elton John's earliest work, here's an example of the high-concept pretentiousness on ""Empty Sky,"" his first album: the final track on the album is called ""It's Hay, Chewed."" Pronounced with a cockney accent, you'd read that as 'it's Hey Jude.' And it is: the song is an instrumental rendering of the Hey Jude chord progression as upbeat cocktail-lounge jazz, until it suddenly erupts into an oddly-edited medley of about ten seconds of every previous song on the album... including ""It's Hay, Chewed."")&&They could team up with Aladdin Sane and Billy Shears.&&Maybe we'll finally get to see what, exactly, a horny back toad is.&&Oh man, that’s gotta be rough. &&Pedro Pascal turns out to be a bit of a dick..&&Country rooooooad

I mean, even if you didn't like Queen, is it even possible that this isn't just a straight *fact*?&&I think Sacha Baron Cohen would have been a poor choice for Mercury. He's 6 inches too tall and incapable of expressing unironic joy or happiness. I don't want a cynical Freddy Mercury.&&His rendition of the Kazakh national anthem was beautiful&&> The Dark Knight, Lawless and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are three of my favourite performances and he's very different in each.

I'll be honest and say that I haven't watched Lawless and IDK, his character in TTSP is essentially the same ""stoic, manly dude"" that Tom Hardy always comes across as (at least in his roles). Mind you, Bane is everything but silent, but somehow he still feels very much like Tom Hardy.

I should point out that this is in no way a criticism of Hardy, I love a lot of his movies and I like him in them. I just think he has a very Clint Eastwood vibe (although he's certainly more emotive) in the way that his characters are recognizable as him. I simply don't think that that would be a good fit for a larger than life figure like Elton John.

I myself find ski jumping terrifying because i can't even stand on skis, lol. Love to watch it on tv tho&&According to the producer, Fletcher shot for 16 days, with the film two thirds completed. In an interview with [The Playlist](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/05/bohemian-rhapsody-director-dexter-fletcher-bryan-singer-exclusive-1201962712/), Fletcher himself said:
> “I came into the last few weeks of principal photography and editing and the bits and pieces like that. So I was lucky to have a really good input to something, but it’s really about watching what had been already created and being part of that. It wasn’t like changing and reinventing the wheel.”

At that point credit hadn’t been determined, but he also stated:

>As to whether he will receive the director credit from the Directors Guild of America, Fletcher said, “I don’t know, and at the end of the day, I don’t know that that’s really important. I think the film stands on its own merit, and that’s what really should be important, I think. I didn’t get into it for that reason […] I was just proud to be able to be a part of it and help complete what I think is a great film. That’s what I got involved for.”&&Because, although I much prefer Dexter over Singer, by Dexter's own admission, the film was already 2/3s complete when he stepped in and it was a ""very good film"". As much as the DGA rules need updating and credit should be shared, it does sound like Singer did the lion's share of the work.&&Money shouldn't cut it anymore... &&I'm honestly unsure. I'm sure there's contract stuff I know nothing about. &&Exactly. When you look at writing credits for a movie it would be something like:

I've legit been listening to the original Sinatra version for like the last month because of that Seth performance.&&He has a Jazz album! Definitely check it out!&&His voice has been proven time and again though. He does all of Brian’s songs on Family Guy. It’s pretty well known he can sing like a fucking champ.&&It makes a lot of sense because Seth’s teachers also taught Frank&&Even fundamentally they're different. Zootopia is a movie about HOW they're animals, Sing is a movie where they HAPPEN to be animals. It's not plot relevant, but because they're animals and got released at the same time they became competitors.

Sing is good for what it is; an ensemble musical.&&I love both of those movies. Watched both multiple times. I don't think either will get stale.&&I prefer to think that Sing takes place somewhere in Zootopia. There’s really nothing in the movie that contradicts that idea.&&Both really good and under appreciated. I think the animation in Sing is some of the best I’ve seen.

To me anyway, a frontman (or woman) is the lead singer and also visual/theatrical focal point of a group. When you watch Queen, you're watching Freddie, with occasional Brian May solo excursions. 

Roger Daltrey? Great vocalist, energetic, could really swing a microphone. But The Who were FOUR dynamic personalities on one stage. You're watching Roger, but then you're watching Pete's windmills and guitar pounding. Keith Moon was a dynamo behind the drum kit. And then you see the Ox, who's not really moving, except his fingers are all over the goddamn place, and then you hear what he's doing on the bass and it's fucking incredible.

Joel McNeeley, the arranger, is probably the best big-band arranger since Quincy Jones: check out the standout track ""The Sadder But Wiser Girl."" (I am convinced he recorded this one intending it to be a duet between Brian and Stewie on ""Family Guy,"" then decided to do it on his album instead; it has what can only be described not as instrumental breaks, but obvious dance breaks for a musical number.)&&He has a Christmas album too! His ‘baby it’s cold outside’ is great!&&His sister also has one with an equally angelic voice. Both are amazing singers. &&As well as anything Chris and Stevie sing.

Nah Turns out both movies were rather lovingly crafted musical films for younger people and children. &&Technically Sing isn't a musical, all the music and singing is conscious. It's a movie about music.

Agreed. Plus, the funny thing about enjoying that music is that, for a certain demographic, our parents *hate* it.     
Not because they don't ""get it"" or whatever, the common reason parents don't like the music their kids listen to, but because it's the music *their* parents listened to, which they themselves rebelled against.

They either need to plan out these overarching plot lines ahead of time or just go back to the movies never really connecting in any meaningful way.

All the crazy adventures in between, and it's alluded that there were crazy adventures we never saw, are just totally skipped over.

When the brain drill torture happened they should have seriously injured Bond and incapacitated him. The rest of the characters should have gotten together and used their specialties to take out Blofeld and C. C makes a constant point verbally that Bond is a relic and not needed. Spectre should have repudiated  this by making the film a second act where Bond doesn’t win and the audience sees the danger of his absence. This would have left the next film open to a more somber and powerful ending because it would be Bond trying to emotionally and mentally recover from such brutal torture and having to finish trying to snuff Spectre out and also wanting to leave. &&okay, so -

casino royale: yes

quantum: no

skyfall: yes

spectre: no

bond 25: ...yes?

They wrote that brain drill crap and bond's senseless immediate recovery?&&I really like QoS and dont understand the hate, it's very watchable.

John Logan (who also did Skyfall) did the script and Sony/EON were unhappy with how it turned out that they rehired Purvis and Wade to try and salvage it.

&&Casino royale is the best bond movie since goldeneye. So fun to watch. 

Quick edit. I think I misworded this. Casino Royale is currently the best bond. My previous favorite was goldeneye.&&I love how Casino Royale could still be a phenomenal movie outside of the Bond universe &&It's so great - I watched it back to back with Quantum of Solace over the summer. I really love them back to back. Quantum is frantic, but I think it works.&&I agree with the enthusiasm here but don’t forget that the structure was a little weird with what felt like a 30min epilogue.

I’d like to see a cut with the Venice section tacked on to Quantum of Solace.&&Casino Royale is easily one of the best films ever made and the script is one of the main reasons why. 

But, it was a loose adaptation of a great novel so there is that.&&I'm reading the original novel, such a surprise how much they changed Bond's character in the films but still a well-written story.&&They also wrote TWINE and Die Another Day, so we really don't know what we're getting with them. Keep in Mind Paul Haggis also wrote some of Casino Royale and John Logan part of Skyfall.&&They also wrote Die Another Die&&Now I watched Spectre at the cinema when it came out and I didn't realise how forgettable it was till I read this and thought, none of this rings any bells.&&SPECTRE was better on re-watching for me. You’re right though, it should have been a walk-off home run, but wasn’t. I’m in the camp that really liked QoS, so I think this is good news. I don’t think they would have rehired them without a treatment for the new movie.
&&Die Another Day is my favourite Bond movie, I had no idea people considered it such a travesty. &&The internet in general brings out the extremes.&&People are most critical of the things they love. Don’t let it upset you! :-)&&[deleted]&&Danny Boyle might have had ideas that didn't ""fit"" with the bond franchise. He's one of my favourite directors and the only reason I'd have watched the latest Bond.&&I think it's more that they have to salvage it the way someone dives to salvages still useful pieces of a sunken ship.  It's not that the ship was a bad ship, it's just...it sunk.  It needs to be salvaged.  A director like Boyle would have had several rewrites happen to make whatever script they started with more in line with his personal vision and voice, and with him gone they need to find a way to turn the script into something that a different director can do rather than just some director having to mimic Boyle's style or having a script so out of line with their own style that it doesn't work.  And they don't want to start from scratch so they kind of have to salvage the pieces that work without Boyle and adjust the rest to suit a new director.&&It’s very disappointing to me. I feel that the Bond movies have become these narrative monstrosities, a superficial roller coaster ride of ups and downs that last so long you begin to ask, ‘what is the point here’. Given how Boyle deftly handled Jobs’ biography by keeping the story anchored on a single situation, I was hoping he could have restored some of the elegance and pithiness of the original books by Fleming. I guess the Broccoli’s are just too tied to their product placement and globe trotting, to let it go.&&Glad someone has posted this. I'd love to know what Danny Boyle was planning to do and why he wasn't allowed to. Who really cares if he did something different? Bond is such a tiresome franchise it could use a new lease of life. If it bombed go back to the tried and tested formula in a couple of years time. &&>Company gets mad at director for being different

Danny Boyle said few days before they announced he's not gonna do the movie that actually making a Bond movie is hard for a Bond fan because you want to do the classic movie and they want you to do something original so yeah sure&&It’s on the management to ignore the public “outcry” and deliver what they actually want to see regardless of whether or not there’s a vocal minority claiming they want something different. I get why these franchises are doing it, but people don’t actually want anything radically different. They want familiar. Not exactly the same, but enough so that they can recognize the series they’re watching.

If you’re going to completely subvert the expectations of a series, you better nail it or be prepared for the backlash. &&> Make it less gritty and more fun this time.

So you want more man From UNCLE?  I can get on board with that.&&But...but.. I'm ok with gritty!...&&>now free from the DC franchise

Did I miss something? I thought they're still making DC movies. &&Cavill is going to shoot The Witcher.&&Letting a movie this big die is not a great idea.  There's money invested, and people are working on it.  It's easy as an audience member to say ""Well if it's going to be bad, I don't want it to even exist"", but even bad movies pay a lot of people, and its not all rich producers.  I work in film/tv and I've worked on tons of crappy projects.  No reason it should die and put so many people out of work, just don't see it. =P  A lot of my rent was paid for by things you've probably never heard of and if you have and seen them you regret wasting your time lol

But I couldn't agree more about *Man from UNCLE*; I want that to be a franchise with the 3 leads returning so very very much, it was just fun all the way through.&&> So in essence, we didn't get to see Bond be Bond, just his come up and then decline.

Which is too bad because Casino Royale was a fantastic reboot.&&The reason they suck is because they can't indulge in colonial-era fantasy anymore like the previous movies, so now everything has to be ""personal"". 

I watched DR. NO for the first time in years the other day and you forget that Bond is kind of a nobody, he's just one of many agents they have and they send him off to find out what happened to some government official. CASINO ROYALE kind of touches on that, but ever since you'd be forgiven for thinking Bond is the only agent they have.&&Is that a porno?&&""Check your lease man, cuz you're living in Fuck City.""&&Are you implying that Johnny English is bad?&&X-men 3 and Mr & Mrs. Smith were equally bad but good point!&&Gilbert.

*puts up flameshield*&&I don't give a fuck. I love Die Another Day. It's the last fun Bond movie.&&They seem like the idea guys. They structure the concept, story, and action set pieces.

Why didn't he just kill him?&&Yeah, I was very disappointed with that scene. I didn't have an issue with the idea, but it's just so anticlimactic to tell him the effects before doing it. I feel like it would've been notably more impactful if they'd done it, had Bond falter on recognizing her, and then explain how they crippled him.

Christoph Waltz was so wasted in that film... it's depressing.&&I agree that QoS is better than Spectre in a lot of ways. But Spectre was shot beautifully something that QoS lacked heavily and was a total mess. But plot wise Spectre has to be the worst Bond movie. At least QoS had that gritty Bourne feel going on for it. &&[deleted]&&Agreed, I've never gotten the aversion to Quantum.  It's a decent addendum to Casino Royale, and the chemistry works between Craig and Kurylenko.

Spectre showed people what a real disappointment looks like. &&Do you enjoy the more classic bond films?

Looking back it just seems weird for it to be in the middle and not at the end to me&&I was so hyped for Spectre; so much potential. Such a generic, underwritten letdown.&&> Spectre were very much 'end of the line' stories

""End of the line?""

Spectre re-introduced Bond's nemesis Blofeld and then left him alive at the end of the film.

If anything this would have been the ""start of the line.""

If things were ""proper"" we should have gotten part two of a Daniel Craig ""Blofeld triology"" in 2017 and the final chapter of the triology next year.

...or the Blofeld trilogy should have been filmed back-to-back, with Bond films in 2017 and 2018, then a new OO7 for a 2020 release.
&&[deleted]&&Wish they just had a “Bond just does his day job” entry in the series &&Dalton was actually the first serious Bond, and people hated it back then.&&He has done a great job. I remember people were doubting him when he was first announced but he has been such a great Bond.

I like the serious nature of the newer movies. I like the goofier older ones too. But it's kind of crappy that out of the four movies only two of them (Casino and Skyfall) are seen as good movies and even Skyfall is a bit controversial among fans.&&there are several serious bond films that came before craig’s films. both of dalton’s films are rather serious.&&He's not at all in line with the books.

(He directed both of the movies you mentioned)&&> Casino royale is the best bond movie.

You could end it right there, honestly.&&> Casino royale is the best bond movie  ~~since goldeneye~~

Yep, you're absolutely right. Totally agree.

I remember watching Casino Royale in Seattle's Cinerama (absolutely *phenomenal* theater) and loving every second of it. So fantastic. &&Eva Green as a bond girl.  That was such a great decision. 
I absolutely loved this film and it had so many cryptic story avenues.  Just rehire Martin Campbell! &&could? 

Casino Royale is one of the top 5 action / spy thrillers ever made and I will fight anyone who disagrees &&I understand the hate for Quantum but if you treat it as a 2 hour extension to Casino Royale it's pretty good.&&Quantum only works when you watch it back to back with Casino Royale, since it is half a movie.  Casino Royale stands on its own as a top 3 bond movie.&&Yes, Quantum of Solace is actually quite good, but since it's the first direct sequel in Bond history (plot literally starts like few hours after ending of Casino Royale) you need to watch it back to back. In my opinion given the circumstances (writers' strike) they've pulled off pretty decent movie.&&Every single time I've watched Quantum of Solace I love it more. Hated it in theaters, like I was actually mad about it haha. Then I watched it in 2012 for my Skyfall binge and I liked it, then again in 2015 for my Spectre binge and I absolutely loved it. It's so underappreciated. &&I agree. It's a great Bond movie, but the ending makes me hesitate on calling it the best. It just felt so jarring and out of place. &&If it wasn't a Bond movie, though, it wouldn't've gotten that phenomenal theme song. So, it would've been an amazing cake, but no icing.&&Not true, the internet *never* brings out extremes!&&The rock and both bad boys were better than ok though...&&I liked the first half of The Island.&&Honestly the only reason I'm upset about the Boyle departure is because its just going to make it that much longer before we get a new Danny Boyle movie.&&the bond franchise needs something fresh though.  &&His UNCLE character had some great comedic chops and some over-the-top smoothness that would just get buried in a Bond role. More UNCLE, please!&&Or... live action Archer&&Yeah, I really don't want them to turn James Bond into a Marvel character. As much as I enjoy the goofy Bond films of yesteryear... their time has passed. I don't think most people would be able to take them seriously anymore. &&There were reports earlier this week that he was no longer gonna portray Superman. The studio didn't confirm it and just gave some vague statement about appreciating the partnership.

He has the look, the physique, and can absolutely pull off the damaged ruthless killer vibe. Hardy and Cavill are great and all, but they are huge names that already have franchises on their shoulders. When Bond brought in Daniel Craig, the biggest thing he had been in was Tomb Raider. It's better for the Bond franchise to use a proven actor that isn't a huge name and turn them into a mega star.&&Perfect. Never even thought about him in the roll, he's so good though.&&Whoa. He totally fits. Damn, I hope they really consider him! Cavill and Hardy have their names attached to many things right now, just don’t see them as Bond. &&Yep&&Whoa. This is an absolutely *phenomenal* casting. Dude basically is Bond.&&Idris Elba would be an amazing 006 villain who is the counter to Bond. I would love to see that. &&He's a bit too old I think.&&I agree, but also see the point that he is too old.

He would however make a great Bond Villain I think.

Especially if he was very charming and friendly, because god damn his smile makes me melt. If he was a friendly charming psychopath I would have lots of feels.&&Who knew that would be a breath of fresh air for James Bond?&&And CASINO ROYALE was largely rewritten by Paul Haggis anyway.

Correctly if i'm wrong but I heard that Daniel Craig was heavily involved in the writing.&&PR press release putting spin on it to try and counteract recent negative press.&&I care more about the DPs than I do the writers at this point. 

I have not been watching the latest Bond movies for the plot, but instead for how beautiful they look. If ever there's an action franchise that comes out with as stunning a cinematography (and action sequences, I guess) as the Bond franchise has been lately, I'd gladly go watch that instead. 

I wish Bourne's continuation didn't tank as bad as it did.&&*puts on polarised sunglasses to counteract the glare(s)&&The opening sequence is one of the best out of any Bond films, especially the credits sequence with Bond in North Korean jail.

The rest of it is an absolute shitshow but I'll give it that at least.&&I liked Quantum of Solace, idk what all the hubub's about&&The first 35 minutes of Die Another Day is fantastic. I don't even understand the hate for Madonna's theme. The movie goes to shit the moment Bond meets Jinx in Havana. &&I didn't even realise die another day was considered a bad movie.

I enjoyed it&&The 1st half was as good a Bond movie as you can get. The 2nd half was as bad a Bond movie as you can get.

Moneypenny: Ok

<bond music plays>&&Also, did the writers even touch a tiny-ass drill bit?  You can snap those just by pinching them in your fingers and have to be extra careful drilling things.  All that squirming would have broken it from Bond's hair gently brushing against it.  &&It's James Bond. Long, overdrawn torture scenes are a staple of the series.&&that's sort of a Bond signature. It was even parodied in Austin Powers:

>Dr. Evil: Scott, I want you to meet daddy’s nemesis, Austin Powers

>Scott Evil: What? Are you feeding him? Why don’t you just kill him?

>Dr. Evil: I have an even better idea. I’m going to place him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.

I mean, you thought the testicle smashing torture was cool or the laser to cut bond in half was reasonable, but a drill to the bean to make him forget was too silly?&&AND THE DRILLING INTO HIS EAR DIDN'T EVEN MATTER SO WHAT WAS THE POINT?  I went from thinking ""if Bond really does forget who she is or lose his ability to shoot straight, this could be the greatest Bond torture scene ever"" to ""what the fuck was the point of that drill if he's superman 1 second after it?"".  Biggest letdown in series history, and I'm including not seeing Jaws' dick in that space one.&&It really did feel specific enough that I thought they were setting up something later on...like Bond would kill the wrong person by mistake or something.&&Spectre was a bad film, but at least it tied the knots on Craig's films. I can't understand why they are pushing for 25 with him.

He should have been able to leave on 24, do the search for 25 all these years and start. Now they have to hurry, because 2022 is a big Bond anniversary. Bad management from the owners.&&It sucks because Christoph waltz could’ve been the best Bond villain ever. I love how they got Anton chgurg and the bad guy from inglourious basterds in two films in a row because those two are probably the best two movie villains ever&&Spectre was a mess, but I could at least follow what was going on. I could not for the life of me keep up with the plot of Quantum. Between that and the *awful* action scenes, I was basically just waiting for it to end.&&> But plot wise Spectre has to be the worst Bond movie.

I think that honour goes to ""A View to a Kill""&&>cervical drilling

What part of the movie was this?!&&> Personally, I loved the first three Craig films... Spectre felt a bit like backsliding to me

My feeling exactly, though I was probably even more disappointed by Spectre going back to the shooty-shooty-bang-bang Bond after the much more interesting explorations of what is possible in a Bond film in the previous three.&&QoS had it's problems, I think that watching it in tandem with Casino Royale is an improvement, almost sort of like a weakish third act to a larger film. I would argue they took some missteps through Daniel Craig's arc, Bond movies had never been as interconnected as Craig's stint has been, every other film working well as independent, stand-alone's, and especially QoS taking a more investigation/conspiracy/mystery direction than had been seen before through the franchise, which may be why some people take issue with it, possibly a similar gripe that people would have with Spectre as it sought to tie up the loose ends and introduce an iconic enemy to the 'reboot'. I don't think it's necessary to interconnect Bond movies given the constant evolution of the character to adapt to modern times and modern film. &&Casino Royale was a return to the idea of Bond as a man rather than a super hero. &&Spectre was so goddamn bad. Not even average standing on its own. Christoph Waltz didn’t have a chance in that role &&I agree completely about QoS being overshadowed by the excellence of Casino Royale. Casino Royale was also more true to the novel than a great many of the Bond films . Quantum of Solace was an okay film. It, of course, is nothing like the story from which it derives its name; as that story has mostly nothing to do with Bond.&&That car chase scene in the beginning was EPIC!

""It's time to get out"" -> cue the music&&Skyfall over Casino Royale? I felt Skyfall had a weaker third act (though beautifully shot), while Casino Royale was a tight near-perfect Bond movie. Don't get me wrong, Skyfall was great, but just a bit weaker plot resolution.

Prior to the new Casino Royale, From Russia with Love was always my favorite Bond, and it warms my heart that Casino Royale and Skyfall are both worthy company to that film. &&For some reason on Reddit (and increasingly online in general) reviewers a movie is either amazing or trash/shit. Heck, not just movies, just about everything is being reviewed that way, from electronics to companies to people.

Yes, Spectre was a weaker film with a pretty ridiculous reveal and several missed opportunities. But it had a lot of good stuff too. 

&&Bond should use the Goldeneye satellite to destroy the Moonraker space station, which will then fall on the head of that hacker guy whilst screaming ""I'm invincible!""&&Yes. Only Live Twice could really use a remake though.&&...Again&&Not enough scuba battles. &&Thunderball and Never Say Never Again are like the same &&The book version of Casino Royale deals with Bond’s age as well. In it though, he decides to continue as an agent despite his age. 

I think that was kind of the point of bringing up his age in Skyfall. He isn’t like regular men in that he’s going  g to get old, rusty, and retire. Not for a *veeeery* long time, anyway. 

Also, I think Silva is meant to be a picture of what happens when a Bond-like agent gets burned and turns bad. I think Bond is supposed to see this guy and recognize that it could be him if a mission goes awry. Bond taking a new mission at the end is his response to that idea. It’s him saying that the overall good he does is worth potentially being burned the way Silva was. He knows the job. He knows himself. He’s ready to lay it all on the line. 

When I think about the book and that movie, it makes sense to me. &&Skyfall's ending is insane. So the movie is about Bond getting older and older and then at the end he's young again. No real rejuvenation scene or moment. Just ""back to work"".

Movie had a perfect bookend too. M fakes her death and goes to the island James faked his on. Package is left for him, gets it, gets a call from an unknown number, they have their chat, M tells Bond he's not done working, he's not ready to retire, but she is. Bond finds the renewed interest and vitality he was missing all film and goes back to work. (Also missed scenes for Bond to learn how to age gracefully from his old caretaker. What a piss poor movie my God Sony is a disaster of a studio.)&&100% agree.With the death of M and his past burning up in the background, this was a great way to retire and say goodbye to his old him. Have him head off into Monaco driving a DB5 along the coast throwing his gadget watch out the window while a picture of  Vesper Lynd on the dash near the speedometer.&&The opening sequence with the Day of the Dead parade is pretty cool at least&&I can remember so much of Skyfall.. I barley remember what happened in Spectre. &&I had to have a think what Spectre even was...

Skyfall would've been a good way to go out for Craig&&i actually kinda like sceptre, it's so fucking camp and crazy at times. it also managed to make me super anxious at a certain scene with bond and the main antagonist, but immediately let me down after that when nothing that happened there mattered.&&The end of the line sense of Spectre comes from bringing Craig’s Bond back to the wacky Bond of the 60s and 70s. For three movies he’s been the deconstruction, gritty, Bourne Bond, so for his final movie, they start reintroducing ridiculous supervillain plots, Blofeld, gadgets, Bond girls, etc, just to set the stage for a return to old school Bond with the next actor. It’s like full circle or something &&It would be hilarious if they just skipped the pushback in the next film and just had Q and M just sigh in resignation.&&“This vexes me”.&&Dalton’s Bond was before his time, sadly.&&There's a real interesting documentary about this actually, I believe it was in a broader Bond discussion, but the thought was at the time that people just weren't ready for such a visceral / angry Bond character, after the somewhat slapstick approach Moore's Bond had.

That said, the Dalton Bond films are quite good in my opinion, even if they used a cello case to sled down a mountain.&&I loved the Dalton years as a kid then watched it get campy again.  

Also,  Maryam D'abo.&&[deleted]&&Dalton>Craig &&[deleted]&&Queen Elizabeth in the new season of The Crown?&&Unless you're going to squander his talents by making him an angsty, one-dimensional evil wizard with bad sparkly eye-liner.&&Can't wait to see his character in Death Stranding&&I agree.   

His Danish movies are amazing as well.&&Mads Mikkelson in Hannibal was absolutely amazing. Loved him as the villian in Casino Royale and in Dr. Strange. However, Dr. Strange his role was underwhelming but his acting was enough to make up for it.&&I enjoyed him in Rogue One&&Yeah, it really brought him to international attention, even though he did have a couple of international movies before Casino Royale &&Yeah, and so gritty. It was one of those films from a decade ago that redefined how gritty and brutal the action scenes can be – this one, MI:3 (for all the flak it gets, I think this one was stellar), and Bourne off the top of my mind.&&Everyone agrees on that.&&I dunno. Goldfinger is still thrilling to me.&&agreed!&&Also has the best Bond theme song.  I never really enjoy Bond theme songs but Chris Cornell's You Know My Name manages to both be really enjoyable and connect to the character of Bond in that movie very well.  ANNNDDD now I'm going to go rewatch Casino Royale.&&I think it's one of the best movies ever made. Plus, whenever I'm feeling nostalgic for the mid-2000s it somehow hits the spot.&&That and the fact that it isn't a steaming pile of shite is impressive considering they produced it during the Writer's strike. &&QoS is my second favorite Craig Bond movie.

&&Jesus WB shit the bed so hard for the DCMU, it could have been amazing but fuck that, Batman vs Superman needs to be the second movie, and justice league needs to be the fifth movie.

I like Cavill, but you're right that he's too big. 

Dan Stevens is versatile enough to make it work. He cleans up *really* well. &&Wasn't Munich before Bond came out? So he had at least sort of been a spy.&&I like this so much. Why did I never think of it.&&Why can't he play Felix Leiter?&&Yeah I think that's a fair criticism, it'd probably take quite a toll on him which is why he might not be up for it.  I remember reading that Craig had quite a few injuries as a result of playing Bond so that's definitely a concern.&&I have no idea but they have credits for it&&Bingo&&I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.&&Did you enjoy Bourne? I feel like it tanked because it just wasn't very good. It didn't keep with the spirit of the earlier movies at all, in my opinion. It was action flick first, spy movie second, which is the wrong formula for a Jason Bourne film.&&If you haven’t seen it yet, the latest Mission Impossible has some of the best action cinematography in the past few years.&&Do you think Spectre was beautiful?  It was mediocre in absolutely every way. Absolutely underwhelming in terms of script and actions scenes.

Quantum of Solace also has incredibly average cinematography.

I don't think Casino Royale was anything special as far as cinematography, but it was competent enough to not get in the way of a tight script and compelling characters.

Then you've got Skyfall, which was absolutely beautiful, but had one of the stupidest, non-sensical scripts I've seen since the Roger Moore Bonds.

So, what is this ""lately"" you're talking about?  We're 1/4 for ""beautiful"" bond films in the Craig era, and that was because it had an absolutely legendary cinematographer, so that's kind of to be expected.&&I barley even remember it....I wrote a whole comment talking shit bout how they didnt even use Matt Damon and then remember they actually *did* make a proper sequel....but it lost the magic.

I remember the tragic deaths and thats about it. i wonder how they can get the first trilogy feel back. Those movies are fucking awesome.&&Yeah but those opening credits had Madonna's song in them and it was...well, it's the worst Bond theme. &&And this is exactly what I can't figure out. It's like they took two different movies and cut half the scripts out and added them together for that movie.&&I think it was due to 2 things, first I’m pretty sure it’s the only direct sequel in the bond franchise so it didn’t feel like an entirely complete story as you needed to see casino royale to understand he whole story, unlike other bond films. And second, it was the sequel to the best bond film in decades so expectations were incredibly high.

But yeah it wasn’t a terrible film by any means, I quite enjoyed it as well. &&It's funny because every time I sit down to watch Quantum, I really don't mind it...in fact I rather enjoy it. But as soon as I walk away from the screen I immediately forget about what even happened. &&I only hated QOS because of the shaky cam Bourne Ultimatum lightning edit shit. The story was good. &&I couldn't get excited about some mastermind with a plot to control a significant portion of Bolivia's water supply&&The only thing I didn't like about Spectre was when the remainer of the plane that he's bobsledding down the mountain goes into and crashes out the other side, it should have had the ""dahdah DAHAH da DADA"" stinger.  It was the perfect time for it.&&I’m with you. I thought QoS was great but like any franchise it gets compared to the others. While it is the weakest of the Craig Bonds it’s by no means a bad movie. &&The shaky cam and the editing in Quantum of Solace were atrocious. The writing was not the worst part of that film.&&<sexiness ensues>&&Have you all even seen classic Bond? It's all unbelievable to the point of ridiculousness.&&But first, Mr Bond, let me explain my entire plan to you...&&The testicle smashing torture was really well made and served a legitimate purpose. Bond dying was the last thing LeChiffre wanted. He needed the password so he tortured bond in a simple, effective way. He even said he doesn't understand the overly elaborate methods famous in the campy Bond movies.

The problem with the brain scene is that the Craig movies have clearly distanced themselves from the ridiculous, stupid plot devices of the 60s in favor of a more grounded world, and Spectre jumped right back in with no transition. && “I have a gun, in my room, you give me five seconds, I'll get it, I'll come back down here, BOOM, I'll blow their brains out!”&&What seals that joke for me is the way Dr. Evil looks at everyone else at the table like ""why does this need to be explained?""&&In fairness, the testicle thing was in the original novel, and the CR film is perhaps the most faithful Bond adaptation that isn’t OHMSS&&Was just going to say this.  They have some hilarious jokes about them.&&To be fair the ball smashing was cool but also served a purpose as Bond had information LeChifre wanted. I can't imagine why your evil step brother would want you to forget everything during his torture of you.&&Me:
>How do you explain this plot device??

Bond:
>I ain't gotta explain shit&&I'm glad we'll get another one because DC deserves so much better than Spectre as his last outing. He's arguably the best bond. But half of his outings are trash. &&The decisions of the Broccolis and MGM are SO destructive and out of touch. The decision to rush Quantum with an unfinished script due to the writers strike was colossally stupid, and they got the good will back and basically could've gone anywhere with Spectre and just WHOLLY blew it. They're broken clocks that occasionally get it way right but largely get it all the way wrong, but they insist on control and they insist on continuing. At this point I just wish the whole franchise would go away.&&No kidding, I've seen Quantum probably 3 or 4 times now, and all I can tell you about the plot is... Something to do with stealing water? 

Which admettidely, is a great premise for a modern, grounded, realistic bond. But still.&&Hahaha so glad someone caught that. My initial thought was, ""Is he referencing a sex scene....?""&&[deleted]&&And how he is portrayed as essentially a sociopath, which was pretty cool to see. The movie then gives him feelings and attachments only to rip them away. God I love that film.&&Alas, GoldenEye satellites are just space based nuclear weapons that are detonated in the upper atmosphere: using them blows them up.

The GoldenEye project only launched the two weapons used in the movie.
&&Skyfall is a piss poor movie? It has a 92% on rotten tomatoes and a 7.8 on IMDb with over 500,000 reviews. Just cause you don’t like the movie doesn’t make it piss poor lmao, it’s one of the best in the franchise. &&Skyfall had such bad edits too.  Literally went from day to night in one cut where no time should of passed during the cut.  Just to have a better action scene.&&I agree, Skyfall really has atrocious writing, I think it is admired because it has fantastic cinematography but the writing is just drivel.

The plot relied on so many cheap gimmicks to move forward, by the time the villian inexplicably broke out of a guarded maximum security prison offscreen to advance the plot I was ready for the movie to be over.&&What's crazy is that Mexico City never had a Day of the Dead parade, ever!  And now because of Spectre, they've had the parade 3 years in a row and it has been getting bigger and bigger each year.&&That shot was essentially the climax and high point of the entire movie.&&The Day of the Dead intro is everything that is awesome about every Bond movie. The rest of Specter is everything that is wrong with the Bond franchise&&Which should have ended with Bond some how ending right back in that apartment with the chick he was about to bang. &&Something about a jealous stepbrother trying to kill him 30 years after his dad played favorites?

&#x200B;

I don't know. I was so disappointed by that movie. Such a letdown after Skyfall.&&Remember every single case you ever worked on?

It was me, Bond!!! i did all that stuff. HaHaHaHA &&TBH, Spectre failed to put together all the elements of the Daniel Craig Bond movies in a cohesive fashion. Even now, I have a hard time trying to retell the plot to my parents without them getting confused over how the characters are all connected.
Seriously, Kingdom Hearts is easier to figure out.&&Dave Bautista was the only memorable part of that movie.&&I remember Mexico City and that Waltz is upset about something. I didn't realize how little it stayed with me until just now.&&Bond 25: Directed by Mel Brooks.&&The trick - and they touched on this just a little bit in Spectre, is to have *M* go rogue and order Bond undercover, whilst fighting to protect a legit, supported, operation from government interference. It would also be a subtle nod to the times.&&""I'm terribly vexed.""&&[deleted]&&Yeah, it's too bad. I would've liked to see more than two movies with him in the role, but what can you do? Eighties gonna eighties.&&""Everything or Nothing""

It's on Prime now.  It's wonderful.&&Not gonna lie, License to Kill is easily my favourite Bond movie. No goofy villains, serious premise, few cheesy lines, and he played the pissed-off rogue agent incredibly well.&&What age, if you don't mind me asking?

I did kind of grow up with Brosnan (though again, I consider Craig to be my Bond) and aside from Tomorrow Never Dies I always thought Brosnan's were solid despite the cheese.&&I'll allow it.&&Did I fucking stutter?&&He could pull it off&&I'd watch that twice&&I thought he was pretty great in Dr. Strange. &&Haha you say that like that game will ever release (please actually release, Kojima-San) &&I'm just always happy when he shows up in any film/show. Top notch actor.&&Others may feel differently, but I love Craig because it seems every Bond before Craig was a playboy first, and a secret agent second.  Craig is a pure fucking hardcore secret agent first, and doesn't let anything or anyone else get in the way  of that. &&[deleted]&&Did a rewatch of the series a couple of years ago. Goldfinger should honestly be the standard that all Bond films are weighed against. It is the quinessential Bond film that has everything the series is known for.

I mean a lot of people think Bond movies need to only be dark and gritty but that's just plain not true. I don't think the newer films are bad, but they take themselves way too seriously.&&> The coldest blood runs through my veins

> You know my name 

Doesn't get more perfect than that for Craig's Bond. Fantastic song.&&I must admit: I like all Craig's Bond movies. That being said: Skyfall and Spectre stories make no sense. &&Any idea on why he left?&&Oh hai M&&Honestly, if it is Idris or Henry Cavill I'll be happy. Both could definitely pull it off&&I remember seeing somewhere that he wasn't THAT big before becoming Superman.  He could probably do a minor cut and get to the Craig physique pretty easily.&&Layer cake was what got him the bond role. &&Honestly he can go from super affable and charming to dead eyed stare that would void your soul in a split second. He’d make the perfect Bond, seducing women with his smile while killing without a feeling.&&That and EON Productions might prefer to pick someone whom they at least get a decade's worth of films out of. Although if you age like Roger Moore, anything is possible.&&[deleted]&&Bango&&That’s a bingo&&I enjoyed the first Bourne trilogy, but the latest installment had tried to cram too much into itself and felt too shoe-horned of an excuse to bring him back.

I'd have been fine with a splinter-series of movies (seriously, there's so many other agents in the same program! take your pick!), but they botched it bad enough I don't think it can make a comeback.&&What do you think of the Mission Impossible series? I think Mission Impossible should primarily be a spy series, but I don't mind all the cool action sequences they have now. &&Oh man the latest Mission Impossible was so fucking good. I got goosebumps, gasped, and the audience was into it just as much. It's just a liiiiiiiitle too light-hearted to fill in the Bond void. 

I'd like a franchise that takes itself a little more serious the way Bond did with Casino Royale-- which, to me, was the best of the latest ones. 

The Bourne trilogy would've filled it in just fine, it's just that its latest attempt to continue it sucked.

I feel like when everyone is having so much fun and being silly and light-hearted as they were in Mission Impossible, the stakes don't feel as high, or the repercussions of what they're up to doesn't resonate as much.

Hard to put my finger on it exactly, maybe I can explain better later.

Regardless, yes, Mission Impossible Fallout was incredible and I loved every second of it. It's been a long time since I've just wanted to go right back into a theater to see something a second time right away (as far as action movies go anyway, I guess I wanted to see Hereditary a second time right away).&&The HALO jump is my favorite scene so far this year.&&Agreed. My favorite Bond themes are Tomorrow never dies (super sexy), Live and let die, Another way to die and Snake eater.&&Plus some sections of the ending were cut because of the writers strike and any reference to a future sequel was cut

Edit: Daniel Craig later admitted that the strike ""fucked"" QoS and the script wasn't even finished.&&I think QoS on it's own is super average. However if you watch it right after CR I think it flows much better. &&It's far and away the most-realistic Bond plot, considering it is already happening in multiple places.  &&It absolutely was and I loved it. It's part of why I like modern Bond a little less. I miss all campy ridiculousness of the earlier movies.&&But 2nd, I'll order my peons to kill you off, while I walk away to attend to other matters.  Then few minutes later I will be shocked to see that you are still alive, and we will engage in a gun/fist fight.&&Eh, I chalk it up to Spectre just wasn't that good of a movie, not ""they're jumping back into camp.""

I mean fucking hell, I don't think anyone could have written something to follow Skyfall. It was a masterpiece as a movie, not just as a Bond movie. Javier Bardem as Raoul Silva was and is still *terrifying*. Maybe the scariest Bond villain of all time, and right up with villains from any movie.&&Scott, you just don't get it, do ya? You don't. &&You just don't get it Scott...&&Like ""Jesus, how does this kid not know the basics of this business?""

 I kind of love how transactional the AP movies are. It's almost like they set up Venture Brothers to explore a world where professional arching is a thing.&&I'm trying to think of other silly bond tortures.

""Aaaaaah this centerfuge is going too fast!"" 

""No, don't crush me between your succulent thighs!""

""Jesus. Even I, James Bond, the horniest man in cinema, have a hard time pretending I want to pork Madonna.""&&Fun fact, that style of torture is called ""Dutch Tickling."" 

And the torture selected was more a reflection of LeChife having been emasculated at the card table. He specifically chose a torture to inflict the physical version of what Bond had succeeded in doing financially and personally.

LeChife could have pulled out fingernails or waterboarded or electrocuted or Dutch ovened or two-girls-one-cupped Bond, but he chose that. The genius of that torture scene is it developed the villain's character more than Bond. We understand his insecurities and desperation more because of his choices.&&Like most Bonds. Most Bonds are hit or miss, that's reality, and many of them leave with a bittersweet taste. DC shouldn't get any special treatment, even if Casino and Skyfall are among the best on the entire franchise.

Spectre wrapped things well plotwise (when you look st the entire DC run, the actual film by itself is lackluster), so it was an organic moment to swap or reboot.&&Don't know if I'd go as far as calling him best. Don't know if it's even a call that's possible to make since the films span such a long timeframe and each Bond brings something different to the table.

Tbh I think Brosnan was the best Bond but sadly his last 3 movies were steaming piles of crap. But Goldeneye Brosnan was the epitome of the character for me.

Craig has some great movies and some not so great movies, and I personally rank him top 3, but his character doesn't really *feel* like Bond.&&I get the feeling that their decisions no longer have the best interest of the IP, but on their personal pockets.

With big franchises regularly surpassing the 500mil mark, and Bond easily being capable of achieving it (as an IP), being patient for a year or two could render much more gains. Then again, I don't know the behind the scenes situation.&&[deleted]&&I grew up in the Brosnan era, and can honestly say I'm really not a Bond fan.

&#x200B;

But Casino Royale is easily one of my favorite movies. To me it's not a Bond film, and, that's what I love about it. It has just enough flavor, the right amount of nods, but it is just a great movie. &&Yeah, this is a great example of someone jumping from ""I didn't care for the movie"" to ""it's a fucking awful movie"". Like, have your opinions, sure, but be realistic.

Not every well-made movie resonates with everyone, and not liking it doesn't mean you have bad taste. Visa versa, just because you think you have good taste, that doesn't mean it's bad if you don't like it.

Moreover a movie having flaws does not alone make it bad. You can make anything sound awful if you only list off the flaws. It's called negativity bias, and it's the internet's favorite thing.&&I know the scene. &&He broke out of a maximum security prison that was built after he left because he knew the inside of the building. Also he had a number of attack helicopters fly across England without the RAF caring?? &&That's pretty funny.&&Yup, they've even added musical acts and other features. It's the best thing that came out of that movie.&&That’s really cool!&&Like a James Bond mini-movie.&&When not even Cristoph Waltz can salvage your villain, you've done fucked up.&&I really didn’t see why they had to emphasize the step brother thing. It felt way too forced. And I got the sense that the brother becoming the head of a global criminal ring was purely to get back at his daddy issues. &&the antagonist was too cheessy. like a retarded version of evil&&And they didn't even have any flashbacks to actually *show* how he was involved. That's just shit writing right there.  &&Dumbest script ever. &&Yeah I've always thought Spectre should have just been a shadow organization that after bond brings down a bad guy they swoop in, pick up the pieces and they expand their evil empire better than before..  Not that haha it was us actually controlling everything all along!  They could have played up a ""you've accomplished nothing"" angle that would could have created an interesting internal conflict for Bond&&>Seriously, Kingdom Hearts is easier to figure out.

I know Spectre was complicated, but that's just not true. Kingdom Hearts is  impossible to figure out once you get past the first game. I'm actually surprised the story is the way it is and no one at Disney ever stopped Square from going full Japanese anime on the storyline.&&Christoph Waltz was perfect casting and I feel like he was entirely wasted.  He could have been iconic and the only thing I can remember about him from the movie is his line from the trailer, back when I had some hope for the film.&&That part where he gauges the guys eyes.&&He was in that movie? Man I *really* remember nothing about it&&Dude, when I saw Christoph Waltz was playing the villain I was insanely stoked. Then I watched the movie and he could have been played by literally anyone. Fuck that movie was disappointing. &&The train fight scene is a memorable one. Again, with the gritty brawler type that distinguishes the Craig era Bond.&&Oh yeah. Waltz is in it.. lol

Wow, I really remember nothing about that film. &&mexico city was actually an excellent beginning.&&That Mexico City opening was pretty awesome and that's the only thing that was good about the movie.  I remember they drilled some hole in Bond's head but that didn't end up even affecting him, just nonsense.&&Skyfall 2: The Search for More Money&&This was called Get Smart (the original TV show, not the movie). Check it out.&&I’ve always loved License to Kill and have always thought it was the most rewatchable Bond movie. In recent years, someone pointed out to me how it comes across as a bit dated because of its hallmark as a typical 80’s revenge flick. While I think there’s some truth to that, it’s still very appealing because of Dalton’s performance. He pulled off the fearless and emotionally driven Bond just perfectly. &&Just a cello!

...

...

Cello.

...

Cello.

Cello.&&On your recommendation I just hammered through it.  Holy cow.  &&They wanted Brosnan in the first place, so once he was finally free from Remington Steele, Dalton didn't have a chance.&&A few cheesy lines, but they are executed perfectly. “Compliments of Sharky” before launching a harpoon into a guy. “A farewell to arms ...” when handing over his gun in Hemingway’s house. “Laundry it!” when Robert Davi’s character was asked about the blood soaked money. I’ll defend that movie to my death.&&No but King George did&&He was great but the role was pretty.. unremarkable for me :/&&Mads: Hello, mister...?

Benedick: Doctor.

M: Mister Doctor?

B: It's Strange.

M: Maybe. Who am I to judge?

Hard to imagine Mads telling jokes but that one is so perfect for his delivery it gets me every time &&""Shaken or stirred?""

""Do I look like I give a damn?""&&Yeah, I remember when it was first announced that Daniel Craig was going to be playing Bond, so many people were upset or baffled by the selection. I know I personally *hated* the idea, probably because I was fairly young and used to Pierce Brosnan. The idea that this *blonde* guy would replace him was just insane to me, I was sure it was going to be a trainwreck.

Aaand then he just fucking killed it. As much as I enjoyed Pierce Brosnan's portrayal, especially in Goldeneye, I never realized just how much better the series was when it was a little more serious and realistic. One of my favourite parts of Casino Royale was the complete lack of ridiculous gadgets, just a highly trained operative with his weapons and whatever the hell happens to be nearby.

I think the general feelings of negativity surrounding Craig have mostly disappeared. Even with movies like Quantum of Solace which were arguably ... not great, he still played the role phenomenally.&&we getting old, or time is changing quickly. &&They need to stop doing villains with personal grudges against James Bond, the human. I am so sick of the current ""this time it's personal"" trend, where Mission Impossible, Bond, every single Netflix Marvel series, etc., can only use villains who have a highly specific, long-standing vendetta with the hero. Why can't the hero ever be the solution to a problem instead of the surprise cause of it?&&>I mean a lot of people think Bond movies need to only be dark and gritty but that's just plain not true. I don't think the newer films are bad, but they take themselves way too seriously.

Daniel Craig blames Austin Powers for this.
&&I agree about taking it too seriously. As a kid watching **Moonraker** was a blast and a very unforgettable experience, it was so cool. I miss the old days when Bond was fun. You got things like a creepy voodoo doctor in **Live and Let Die** and a Volcano evil villain base in **You Only Live Twice**. So much fun and so memorable.&&I could break down why every lyric in the song fits the character perfectly.  Starting with:

>If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
>Odds are you won't like what it is

The moment the song starts playing we've just seen Bond's first two kills.  The first one bothered him but the second he didn't even blink.  The part of him that hestitated with taking a life died with that first man.

> When the storm arrives would you be seen with me
>By the merciless eyes of deceit?

Bond is entering the ""big leagues"" of espionage for the first time.  Deceit is everywhere in his life now and there is almost no one he can trust to stand with him when shit hits the fan.

I don't have the time to keep going but it's telling that, to my knowledge, this is the only Bond theme that did not have the movie title in the lyrics of the song.  This is not the theme to Casino Royale so much as it is the theme to James Bond as a character.&&I did not shoot her! I did naahht. &&I think they're referring to his level of fame rather than his physique my dude&&Lol, I was talking about his fame/notoriety, not necessarily his physique. 

I agree that he could easily get down to a Bond-esque frame. &&Well put. I always tell people to watch [the party scene from *The Guest*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERcpB53eJ3k) (this clip doesn't have the brief sex scene, though) if they want to see Stevens exhibit all of those things.&&Craig also did the opposite of aging like Roger Moore because Daniel Craig smoked like a chimney.

EDIT: more specificity&&Yeah that's also a fair point, don't know if he'd be up for a decade of Bond.  That's a pretty huge commitment.&&Ha, i see what you did&&That's a bingo!&&Bongo &&What did you think of Bourne Legacy?&&A splinter cell movie would be fucking awesome&&Mission Impossible has managed to maintain the spy stuff while ramping up the action over the course of the series. They're not perfect, but they're pretty well done.&&I can see that, but it’s funny considering Bond has its roots in campy humor. I agree MI can deflate moments with humor, but the entire Paris chase and the last act were pretty darn serious and rivaled any of the best Bond action scenes.

That said, only Bond is Bond and I love that character. Modern Bond exists in a more realistic world that MI keeps at arms reach. &&How good was the bathroom and HALO jump scenes in Fallout though?! The cinematography during the helicopter chase was also immense.&&Can we hire the writers back now and do reshoots to make it the movie it deserved to be. A Bond sequel had the potential to be soo good.&&You can see the cutoff point too, film is fine until the airplane chase, then it turns into a Brosnan bond , even down to his delivery of ""c'mon c'mon"" when trying to get the plane to climb&&Agreed, I just don't find it very interesting for Bond. If the ""masterminds"" are just realistic bureaucrats, then Bond should just be your average diplomat.&&It's why Austin Powers can parody the style so well. It's all just cheeky British humour passed off as some sincere.&&Austin Powers made fun of this brilliantly with Seth Green:

https://youtu.be/-7O7sBg-iJc?t=1m46s&&The entire movie was nonsensical. The bad guys motivations were, at best, weird. I get that there was bad blood between them, but how does that go from ""I hate you!"" to ""I hate you so much that I will build an entire criminal imperium to spite you!"" I feel like a few steps were missed in here.

It's such a shame that they chose Christoph Waltz for the role. He deserves better.&&His opening scene was fantastic:

https://youtu.be/FumW4wuqDeQ&&Not to mention, Skyfall actually translated the old Bond camp into the post-CR stuff exceedingly well. The deformed villain's overdone, but those few shots were chilling. The villain's unbelievable plan's overdone, but this time it's so personal you forget it's ridiculous. I mean, I only saw it once in theatres but I can still recall weirdly small details of it right now&&The plot to Skyfall is absolute nonsense as well, you have the blinkers on if you think it's somehow less nonsensical than Spectre.&&Venture Brothers is just pure amazing.&&It's been this way for every Bond actor.  I love Daniel Craig but for me, Pierce Brosnan *was* James Bond.  He was perfect.  He had *one* good movie (Goldeneye), and the other 3 ranged from okay to terrible.  I've always felt bad for Brosnan because of that.  They wasted him.  

Sean Connery was great (of coursh!).  Not all of his movies were great, though. 

Timothy Dalton got stuck in two movies way ahead of their time when audiences weren't quite ready for the gritty action hero Bond yet.  

Roger Moore, for me, was probably the weakest Bond but he was in some of the most fun Bond movies ever made so it worked itself out for the most part.  

But yeah, even when you account for the nostalgia factor of the older Bond films, they have *always* been hit or miss regardless of the actor.&&Dalton never had a bad one. But to be fair, he was only in two.&&My wife broke her ankle about a year ago and had to do physical therapy twice a week. One day her therapist was telling us a story about feeling awkward because he had to practice “cervical exams” on his boss. We previously had no medical knowledge that the term had two meanings. We were both looking at each other like “wtf? He gave his boss a Pap smear?!” He noticed the horrified expressions on our faces and was just kind of like “It’s not that weird. I just had to massage her neck.” He only knew the word to mean neck. When we told him the other meaning he turned bright red and cringed so hard. Needless to say the story was shared to all of his co-workers and everyone laughed at us for the rest of our PT trips. &&What scene is it?&&Apparently, not everyone is thrilled with it.  I get both sides of the argument.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city&&I only found out about it because I'm going to Mexico in November and part of my trip coincides with the Day of the Dead.  So, naturally, I was like ""I need to see the parade from Spectre.""  After reading a few threads on Trip Advisor, the locals commented that it was a new thing from the movie, which totally surprised me.

Unfortunately, it's normally the week before Day of the Dead proper, and coincides with the Formula 1 weekend.  Either way, I'm still excited to be in Mexico City on Day of the Dead proper.&&Literally Spectre was the antithesis of a cool spy movie.

The climax was in the 1st 5 minutes and the movie de escalated to the point of blandness at the end. &&Wasnt he Blofeld too? Blofeld is supposed to be Bonds arch nemesis and they kinda ruined him. Spectre was very disappointing but Skyfall was one of my favorite Bond films. Javier Bardem killed it as the villain in that movie.&&Atleast there was a running refrigerator in that room&&All you have to do is remember that EVERYONE is Xehanort and Sora created Roxas from Ventus by accident. Easy!&&It becomes difficult after DDD for the 3ds, the rest is fine since it has no time traveling. 

People think its hard because there are 2 games in between kh1 and kh2 and since they are both on mobile devices (GBA and Ds) they think they aren't important.&&Yeah such a great actor badly written and under utilised&&It would have been sofucking easy just not to have that stupid 'adopted brother' relationship.

Like, you want a connection? Okay, you already went to the Goldeneye well with Skyfall's villain being a former spy. Maybe Blofeld was a former M in charge of the spy agency who was turned by the Russians just before the Cold War ended, leaving him with no country to support him, so he built his own shadow empire. 

And what's the villain's plan? To have leverage over heads of state so he can basically rule the whole world as the power behind *every* throne. That line from the trailer about Blofeld being the source of all Bond's pain? That's because this whole time, Blofeld *was already in control* of MI-6, using them to take out people who would stand in his way.

And for once, the villain gets away. Maybe he doesn't *win* per se. Perhaps Bond is able to escape a death trap and learn about a big mission that will be the core of the final movie in his franchise. But Blofeld could end with the upper hand.&&It was like they wanted Joker 2.0 with that 'funhouse' setup for bond at the end. &&I really hope you meant gouged, because if he slowly spaced them out with increasingly sized piercing needles, you and I watched very different cuts of the film&&I mean he was standing pretty still for a lot of it.&&I don't remember him at all.  I'm not even sure I saw that movie, but I'm pretty sure I saw it.  &&Ahem.

*Moore* Money.&&That look he gives when reminded of his dead wife... the feels&&How can you not love Del Toro's character.

honey mOOOOOOON&&Honeymooooon.&&Okay, that was good. Have an upvote for that.&&This. He did great with what little he had to work with. It was just a criminial underuse of an exceptional actor for a throwaway villain.&&One of the coolest lines in any movie imo&&The bathroom fight in the very beginning?

I was sold right there. &&>  One of my favourite parts of Casino Royale was the complete lack of ridiculous gadgets, just a highly trained operative with his weapons and whatever the hell happens to be nearby.

This. One more reason I loved the Nolan Batman series.

But on topic of  Daniel Craig, you're absolutely correct. I haven't seen a Brosnan Bond film, so Craig's is the image that I think of when I hear ""Bond"".&&I'd watched and loved Layer Cake a few months before Craig's announcement as Bond so I was really psyched when that came out (plus I felt ""in the know"" because most Americans probably didn't know who he was). That was like 12 years ago when I was in high school but I'm pretty sure it was still an excellent British gangster film. Haven't seen it in a while but my memory highly recommends it if you haven't seen it.&&I still remember seeing it in theaters.&&This is a really good point. 

I think the villain is more menacing when they care very little about Bond, because he's small potatoes compared to the villain's plan. &&> Why can't the hero ever be the solution to a problem instead of the surprise cause of it?

Wow, this is a great concise critique that puts into words things I've thought for years now!

The trend started as a way to explore more of the anti-hero trope as there were too many boy scout goody-two-shoe heroes running around. I'd also argue that it started as a reaction to the world post-Vietnam.

Americans (whose tastes still steer much of Hollywood production), have had to wrestle with the realization that we aren't as much the boy-scouts as we thought we were. Things we thought we were doing for good, have been coming back to haunt us. This trend has only intensified since 9/11.

Of course, while that's interesting, I find myself more drawn to the really good people heroes in films, the ones who unabashedly work to solve problems. In the superhero realm, Captain America is electrifying in his portrayal as a good person operating in a tough world/universe. 

I wish we would see more of these. It's good for us to have heroes that we can aspire to be like at our best.

&&I love your take on the song. I think Chris Cornell did a great job with the lyrics (assuming he did the lyrics and composer David Arnold did the melody).&&Anyway, how's your spy life?&&[I also see it!](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ZfFsMdW)&&We just say bingo. &&I'm so happy in the jungle I refuse to go.&&For me, there was a lot to like. The performances were good, and I really liked the characters plot. What I didn't care for, and seemed to slow the movie down, was trying to tie it to Jason Bourne.

If they'd stuck to the very basic tie-in of the program is getting shut down, and now he has to find a way to stay enhanced, then just follow that story, it would have been better. I didn't care for all the higher-ups having their meetings and interrupting the flow.

But, that's just my two cents.&&Yeah, but you don't get it. Bond's a *SUPERDIPLOMAT*. &&Laser sharks bro &&I think the criminal empire was incidental to the spite, but I don't disagree. It wasn't a good movie. And yet, I couldn't not be captivated by every one of Waltz's scenes.

It's a crying shame he didn't become a mainstream actor earlier in his career, because son of a bitch can that man act. 

Not sure any scene will carry the terror and conflict and suspense of the chat with Perrier LaPedite.&&Javier Bardem is fantastic.&&I need to watch the full series again after the latest PROBLEM light episode. Something tells me the attention to lore, details unveiled by old dialog, and call backs will be solid.&&It's really annoying to me how its become ""conventional wisdom"" to shit on Brosnan's Bond and his movies. Yes, *Die Another Day* was bad. I think his run of *Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies* and *The World Is Not Enough* was a pretty decent run. I think *Goldeneye* is the best Bond movie. Ever.

A lot of people seem to forget that Pierce Brosnan was actually a really popular Bond when he wore the tuxedo.&&It's near the end during the climax.  It's such a jarring cut.&&Oh man, Mexico City is a beautiful place. Like all cities it's got its issues but they've cleaned it up a lot in the last decade or so. There's so much to do and so many places to visit. Hope you have a blasty blast there!&&In fairness, places like Tucson have parades, so it isn't entirely fabricated. &&And then Blofeld declares that somehow he’s the reason for everything that has happened in the past 4 movies.   

&&I remember almost nothing from my only viewing of the movie in theaters other than the opening scene, which while visually spectacular, made Bond seem incredibly reckless (not in a fun way) and like he had a total disregard for civilian lives. I bought the most cheapest, no-frills version of the DVD I could find in the Walmart bargain bin (not a good sign when a new release is already in there) simply bc I already own the rest of the series, and I’ve yet to sit down and watch it again.

I think my only other memory of the movie is Bond picking up a woman at her husband’s funeral&&Better go catch it!&&The fact that we already saw this absurd relationship, where 2 long lost brothers become a super spy and a supervillain by some odd chance, in a damn comedy series!  Austin Powers & Dr. Evil!  As far as I can tell, it's not from the books...that would be one thing, if it was in the Bond books and then Austin Powers parodied it and then the new movie wanted to be true to the books, but as far as I can tell it was something they invented on their own.  And even if you are going that route, the story shouldn't have been about him looking for his brother and then revealing that he's Blofeld because that is only meaningful to those of us fans who know who Blofeld is.  Someone new to Bond, the reveal doesn't work on its own.  They should have had Bond hunting Blofeld, knowing there was this hidden puppetmaster behind everything, and the reveal should have been oh by the way I'm your brother.  It still would have been a bit cheesy but seems more dramatically powerful.  Knowing the whole movie that he's looking for a lost brother and having the reveal just be a name that either you already knew Waltz was playing because you are a fan and followed the production or means nothing to you and has no impact because you aren't familiar with the past Bond films/books was just really silly, like when they had Benedict reveal his name was Kahn all dramatically in the 2nd Abrams Star Trek...that kind of reveal only works for fans and doesn't work for people new to the franchise, on its own.  And I usually have issues with movies requiring outside reading and information for their dramatic beats to work.&&They went full dr evil with that shit lol&&Gauged Eyes scene in Spectre can be viewed in the VHS extras. Don’t think it was included on the laserdisc unfortunately. I’ve not seen it because lies.&&https://media.giphy.com/media/tnYri4n2Frnig/giphy.gif&&My friend recently gave me a choice of two movies and I picked *Spectre* because I said I had been meaning to see it. 

During the opening part I was like oh, I remember this, but I must have started it and never finished it. I kept having the same thought over and over as the film went on, until about two thirds of the way through I turned to my friend and said ""Uh, you know what, I'm pretty sure I've seen the whole thing before.""

Same thing happened to me with *Thor: The Dark World,* which we rented to prepare for going to see *Ragnarok*.&&Kind of like his role in Rogue One.

He was great but I would have preferred to see him cast in a recurring role.&&There’s a huge issue with marvel villains that they don’t get much time to develop (other than thanos) because they don’t get much screen time and they’re killed off at the end of the movie. The villains’ scenes really have to be written exceptionally well because they have to cram a lot of information into a small amount of screen time.


 A movie I recently watched which honestly surprised me about how well they developed the villain was the mummy with Brendan Frazier. The movie is a little campy, but the writing is amazing. They convey a bunch of information in small exposition scenes at the beginning and it pays off when they have *so* much more time to develop all the main characters throughout. The library scene sticks out the most because it establishes so much about evie’s character in a ~2 minute scene. She’s well educated, meticulous (knows exactly where the books should be and scoffs that a book is in the wrong place), clumsy (the silly knockover part), naive and stubborn but extremely well educated and informed about the future subject matter (discussion with her boss where she explains why he hired her and his retort is essentially that it was because of the huge financial support her parents provided), and from wealth (earlier convo with boss). Essentially everything you needed to know about her character is jammed into a 2 minute scene, but it’s done so well that it feels natural. Brendan’s character, rick, is also fleshed out pretty quickly in 3 separate scenes (army at hamenaptra, prison, and boat). The mummy and his motivations are spelled out in the intro and then he develops off of that throughout. It’s actually a really really well written movie and it shows by how enjoyable it is to watch nearly 20 years later (holy shit that movie is 20 years old..)&&He plays more of a playboy and uses many more gadgets that did incredible miracles that couldn't happen in real life.&&Its still awesome &&Like Kingsman (the first one). Sam Jackson not even knowing they existed for a while ass pretty refreshing. &&Waltz was phenomenal, and, for all its plots, spectre looked *amazing*. The cinematography was beautiful. I still rewatch it, and it's far from the worst bond, but yeah

In fact, I'm almost inclined to place it above quantum for the Craig Bonds, if only for those 2 reasons.&&[deleted]&&They meant it to be this huge Aha! moment but it ended up just insulting the audience&&That was really the part I didn’t like. It’s like someone said “Skyfall got so much into his backstory and had a big, villainous conspiracy! What if we ‘do more of that,’ to the nth degree no matter how much shoehorned retconning it involves?”&&I remember thinking the big action set-piece in he desert lair was *incredibly* lazy. Bond was just zapping guys with ease with a pistol from 150yds+, and then everything explodes for no discernable reason.

I also remember thinking killing Bautista was a huge mistake. He could have been in several films, as a new ‘jaws’-like antagonist. He was by far and away the best thing in the film.&&Pretty sure he shoots down a helicopter from a boat with a ppk&&Well, I see what you’re getting at and while I would have loved to see more of him, I don’t think I’d like to see more of that character in that movie. The father didn’t really need to be in there more than he already was, if he had been the movie would have suffered a little bit I think. I love  Madds in that role though he totally pulled it off, but I would also have liked to see him in a recurring role, yeah. &&I do remember interviews with the props guys for Die Another Day where they said that everything on the car actually worked (aside from invisibility) because it was cheaper to just build than to elaborately engineer shooting and simulations for the effects.&&“Oh shit it’s that young valet!”&&No way man. The comeuppance at the end of QoS for Vesper's death and her vindication is worth the ride, even if it's a bit hollow. It was a story arc I never saw coming and cheered when I figured out what was happening. Bond isn't a machine, he needed *something* to redeem his tenuous relationship with humanity.&&Even as casual movie goer as soon as I read about that edit my mind auto went to that scene. I've only watched it once. &&Probably because none of the movies were written for a twist like that to even make sense. No foreshadowing of any kind because it wasn’t planned and 100% only happened because they got the character rights back.&&I hate when writers/directors take away from past movies to try and bolster their current movie.   It’s almost like theft in a sense - they want me to emotionally assign something I already liked to their crappy retcon.&&I always got the feeling that they had more elaborate plans that Craig wouldn't do. In the early movies there were free running chases. He's older now and hates being Bond. He said he'd rather ""open his wrists"" than do another until they have him tons of money.

I think he said ""wouldn't it be badass if I want even challenged by them and just casually shot up the base without having a sweat"" because he didn't want to do it and they were forced to go along with it.

I don't know how they got the Mexico scene out of him.&&",2018-09-14 10:37:52
"New Image of Willem Dafoe as Vincent Van Gogh in Biopic 'At Eternity's Gate' - Also Starring Oscar Isaac, Mads Mikkelsen, Rupert Friend, and Emmanuelle Seigner",33767,9cnlsz,https://i.redd.it/2woiblura2k11.jpg,661,1535997203.0,,"OUT OF PAINT, AM I?&&You know, I'm something of a painter myself.

&&> At Eternity's Gate is a 2018 American drama film about the final days of painter, Vincent Van Gogh. The film is directed by Julian Schnabel, from a screenplay by Schnabel, Louise Kugelberg and Jean-Claude Carrière.

This just premiered at Venice Film Festival. Decent reviews so far. Release date is November 16, 2018.&&Willem Dafoe AND Mads Mikkelsen? I'm already sold. &&I recommend watching Loving Vincent. It is a great film that looks to be a similar story for this movie, of Van Gogh's final days. &&Sort of nitpicky but Dafoe is like twice as old as Van Gogh was. I mean, it's a pretty big age difference, I dunno just seems kind of weird to me.&&He looks like Charles Bukowski!!&&Related - the 2017 film 'Loving Vincent' didn't get enough attention. Great film also covering the final days of Van Gogh's life... [and apparently the world's first fully-painted film!](http://lovingvincent.com/).&&He looks like Chuck Norris. &&But does he hang dong?&&Dr. Who nailed this episode. &&Doctor Who did Van Gogh, and that was enough emotion for me.&&Looks like pure Oscar bait. I love it. &&Was Tony Curran busy?&&Nothing against this film but I don’t think anything will come as close emotionally than the episode of Doctor Who [“Vincent & the Doctor](https://youtu.be/ubTJI_UphPk).&&That's the least like Willem Dafoe I've ever seen Willem Defoe look.

I'm in.&&You know who would have been perfect as Van Gogh? The redhead dude from Homeland.&&I wonder how his dutch is gonna sound&&Willem...DAFOE!&&Tony Curran's Vincent from Doctor Who is the only acceptable Vincent. &&Yesssss madssss&&Man bill burr looks like shit. &&I'm just here for the goblin memes&&Why can’t he be Williem DaFriend&&Mads Mikkelson, Oscar Isaac, AND Willem Dafoe?! &&He actually *doesn’t* look like he’s just committed murder in this picture. I’m having trouble processing this&&Give Dafoe an Oscar already.&&Gauguin and I are gonna have a hell of a time!&&He'd play a good Snake. &&""I hear that Rupert is a real jerk""

""Nah, he's a Friend.""&&IT WAS A FIRE FIIIIGHT&&Did anyone watch the Florida project? I liked Dafoe in that&&Me and you Theo, we can rule this city or we can fight to the death &&[deleted]&&Can’t wait to see it! Some awesome names slated for the movie &&Woah! This is unreal. Didn’t realise this was a thing. Great cast!&&The only think he can do to be more like Van Gogh is cut his ear off.&&Willem Dafoe is the absolute man! He has a range like no other.&&Dr Who portrayed Vincent's life beautifully hopefully this can be as good as that&&Looks like Seth Green in old-face.&&He looks so uncharacteristically soft and human. I'm almost not terrified of him&&Has Oscar Isaac NOT been in a movie lately?&&This is shockingly good casting imo. I don't think any Dafoe tier actor could give the role the air of genuine that a flick about Van Gogh needs, I'm suddenly excited. &&That’s gonna be a damn good movie&&That’s a fucking cast&&Doctor who episode anyone?&&Willem Dafoe as Charles Bukowski as Vincent Van Gogh.&&WE CAN PAINT THIS WORLD TOGETHER, SPIDAMAN.&&THERE WAS A STARRY NIGHT!&&The guy who played VanGogh on Doctor Who looked way more like him. &&Bullshit. It’s a Rogue One Sequel. The Khyber crystal resurrected Jyn, and Galen.&&Dafoe as Van Gogh?  This should be a good one (albeit depressing, yet enlightening!)&&Reminds me of the Dr. Who ep when they bring him to see his paintings exhibited snd he starts crying because he got to see that people really loved his works.&&This headline sounds like something from Bojack Horseman

You know Courtney Portnoy! You probably recall when she soared as a thorny horticulturist in One Sordid Fortnight With a Short-Skirted Sorceress. How would you enjoy joining Portnoy for a scorched soy porterhouse pork four-courser at Koi? Glorify your source, but don’t make it feel forced, of course. And try the borscht!&&Looks just like two-eyed Big Boss/Solid Snake.&&I instantly saw him as solid snake , just the eye patch, and it’ll be perfect &&> Mads Mikkelsen

Sold.&&No Matt Smith, no thanks! &&How the hell is Oscar Isaac in everything latley? He must just work 24-7

I got to be an extra in the upcoming ""triple frontier"" and got to see him do his thing and since then I just notice his name EVERYWHERE. It's ridiculous.&&Willem Dafoff, as those of us in the art world call him.&&“Lust for Life” with Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh, 1956. Great film.&&Do you know how much I've *SACRIFICED?*&&At first glance I thought it was Damian Lewis&&Didn't Van Gogh die at 37? Little bit much having a 63 year old play him.

Edit: Apparently I'm not the only one who noticed.&&Can't wait for the scene where he rips his bloody ear off and camera twirls cackling, head peaked to the sky with lightning and thunder in the background, gotta love him&&Why not get the guy from the Doctor Who episode? He was a spitting image. &&William Dafoe is good and all but I prefer the actor who played Vincent Van Gogh in Doctor Who.&&Oscar Isaac is such a fucking underrated actor &&But will it beat that Doctor Who episode?&&I feel like Van Gough was weird. I feel like Dafoe is weird. Names rhyme. Both weirdos. Great actor. Ok painter (lol).......I'm in. &&So, you are saying they are going to make a movie, about van gogh, with dafoe, isaac and mikkelsen??????? what the fuck, this made my whole week and my hole weak!&&Not a big fan of Schanbel but this is his kind of movie. &&Schnabel and biopics = a must see. &&I would watch the hell out that &&Great cast! 👍 Hopefully they focus on his work than one moment in his life where he cut off his own ear (hence the bandage in the picture).&&Ooh, that’s a great cast! &&So, who is Rupert's friend starring in this movie?

*shows himself out*&&dont care about art at all, but the cast will make me watch this&&Mads Mikkelsen and Willem Dafoe in the same movie? They must be going for broke with the method acting. This movie is either going to be amazing or amazingly weird.&&I see Captain Flint.&&What's wrong with his ear...oh.&&Julian Schnabel?? Is he going to be the defacto guy for artist biopics now?&&So is it me or do we do a better job at picking actors that look like the subject? its not all makeup. right? &&Wow. Can’t believe costume design accidentally covered up his ear like that. &&Grown man with a cat&&How does he look like Willem Dafoe, Vincent Van Gogh, and Chuck Norris all at the same time?&&Checks out. Ear's missing&&Dafoe can do no wrong in my book&&Working title was The League of Extraordinary Looking Gentlemen &&It will be hard to beat the Altman film and Tim Roth's Vincent.&&He looks like Charles Bukowski.&&If im not mistaken he never cut his ear off.. that was just a story&&Why hasn’t he been the Joker yet? Dude has literally been the perfect choice since Year One ;D &&Vincent Van Dafoe*&&Yup. Willen Dafoe is definitely thr type of guy to take his own ear. Great casting&&Shit whens this come out?&&No thanks, I'll watch loving Vincent instead.&&It’s hard to look at him and not see the green goblin because he didn’t even need a mask for that role &&During an eclipse, is it safe to look directly at Willem Dafoe?&&With this cast it could be about Van Gogh the action star. &&QUICK EVERYONE MAKE VAN GOGH MOVIES &&looks too much like william defoe&&I believe Van Gogh’s friend cut his ear off fencing.&&As someone who don't know much about Vincent van gogh.. what happened to his ear ?&&He's very much a method actor.  

Hope he's still got ears.  &&I really hope they stick to just the ear lobe and go for accuracy.&&Everything Mr. Dafoe touches turns to gold, or at the very least, he make it gold when he's present in the scenes. I am a huge fan. I've got to go see this.&&After watching Loving Vincent, I'm even more excited for this film! &&I wonder how they’re gonna pronounce ‘Gogh’ in this one.&&.... he looks really bad for the role&&Do you know how much I sacrificed? &&Is it pronounced By-ah-pick or Bio-pick? I've always used the former but I've heard alot of the latter.&&Oh HELL yeah&&ME AND YOU CAN RULE THIS PAINTING, SPIDA MAN, OR WE CAN PAINT TO THE DEATH&&I thought it said Rupert Grint and now I'm sad because I want him to be in another movie. &&Start getting that Oscar statue all polished up&&William Defoe as Chuck Norris &&Smells like Oscar gold.&&I’ll see anything with Willem and Mads in it. 😍&&Willem..

This shot even seems reminiscent of his 1889 “Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear”&&It was either torn off in a fight with his artist friend Paul Gauguin, Van Gogh cut off part of it due to a complete nervous breakdown when he found out that his brother was getting married, or he did it to try an impress a waitress.&&ever try painting an ear? Yeah, it's best to just paint a bandage and call it good.&&That would actually probably look more horrific than just taking the whole ear off.&&Harder livin' back then.&&I guess it works if you assume that Dafoe doesn't look too old and Van Gogh probably did look like crap from not taking care of himself.&&Spoilers

Van Gogh cuts off most of his left ear in a fit of manic depression which while often is attributed to his infractuation to a French girl, was actually probably cut off in a fight with his friend/crush Paul Gauguin or he did it due to a nervous breakdown when he learned that his brother was engaged.&&DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IVE SACRIFICED!!&&back to formula HYUAGH&&GOD SPEED THEO!&&FINISH IT&&What if it was just one guy with 6 brushes? &&*choir intensifies*&&Spiderman.

You can also see in his letters to his brother Theo (it's from these letters that we know so much about Vincent, you can see them at the Van Gogh museum and they're really heartfelt and you completely sympathise with him as a person and as an artist, but i digress) that while some were written in Dutch, many were in French.&&No, we can’t.

Also, about a decade earlier, the animated movie Yellow Submarine with music by The Beatles.&&[Let them know... ](https://m.wikihow.com/Request-New-Shows-and-Movies-from-Netflix)&&He didn't look 25-35 years older though. Not all of the movie is Van Gogh at 37.&&Hes like the Lindsay Lohan of his time.&&[deleted]&&I assume [these are the photo's](http://www.dailyartmagazine.com/vincent-van-goghs-photos/) you are talking about. The photo of him at 19, certainly does not look quite old to me and does not look much over early 20's in my opinion. I think he would get asked for ID at most bars in the US today.

The unconfirmed photo was taken in 1886 when he would have been 33. There is a reason it is unconfirmed though, it has a Canadian photo studios address on it, and Van Gogh never went to Canada. 

I think judging how old he looked by one unconfirmed photo from another country is not really a valid argument.

That being said, I don't really care. Dafoe is a good actor and has certainly played intense, unhinged characters well in the past.  I just find him a somewhat odd choice as his age is so far off. &&Cooking and eating with his dirty paint brushes and On top of sniffing paint and paint cleaner would make any 30 year old look 60. &&My guess Is nogh. &&Theo does, but no one else does.&&This is not a valid or relevant response.&&Van Gogh was 37 when he died.

British cinema is gritty, dark and realistic. Especially films from the 70s and 80s. It's a world apart from anything starring Hugh Grant.

I'm going to assume that you are also a Gary Oldman fan (sorry if I, erm, have, erm [insert Hugh Grant hair-ruffling], been presumptuous), then you should also check out his directorial debut Nil at Mouth.

&#x200B;

The one thing I would add is:

Why do that with Dafoe and spend tens of millions on CGI when you could have another actor?

&#x200B;

He's a REALLY fine frickin' actor. And for the depth of soul required to embody such an extraordinary character, I would say it could be worth it. And I would understand them trying. 

&#x200B;

However, you're probably right: they wouldn't do all that for such a low budget flick. 

&#x200B;

Now you've got me wondering of other cases where an actor was way too old for the role and either pulled it off or didn't. Good idea for a separate post, if you're feeling energetic. I'm feeling lazy. But I might do it anyway. 

&#x200B;&&tbh I probably would have become a Republican if it wasn't for Trump. I've been a die hard liberal forever, but my progressiveness was always rooted in wanting a better outcome for people, and the more I learn about government intervention in free markets turning into disaster for people, like you know:

government funded student loans resulting in schools raising tuition to ridiculous levels and making everything worse for everyone with huge amounts of personal debt, education expenses and tons of unmarketable degrees

rent control in cities like San Francisco that end up raising the prices for everyone else and lock people into their apartments since if they ever move their rents will sky rocket

the list goes on and on

I've become more fiscally conservative.

But fuck if I'm going to be jumping on the Trump train, I don't even want on the Ted Cruz train. There really aren't any places for fiscally conservatives free market type people, and I don't mean libertarian crazies, I just mean like, you know smart policy that recognizes market forces, not deregulating coal plants so they can dump more toxins into our ground water and raise global temperatures

The left is swinging hard toward free college tuition and free health care and taxing the rich like there's no tomorrow and portraying these sorts of things as rights that are easy and only good with no possible bad outcomes and I just want to run away and hide from everyone.

A grinding sound crescendos to a buzz and then a roar as a huge machine rumbles to life.

The camera pans and dollies back again to reveal a large factory, empty of workers, a giant machine and complicated production line gaining speed. The camera dollies down the line showing various stages and closeup details of the process. The dollying camera halts near the end of the line to show a Hostess Twinkie fall into a giant pile of yellow snack cakes...

Big white letters appear on the screen.

""Rule No. 32: Enjoy the little things.""&&I recall an interview with Emma where she said that they were gonna make up to 18 zombielands. 

At this rate, with 7-8 yrs between 2 films, it's gonna be the year  (±)2146 when the last one airs.. Can't wait!

I felt the first overstayed its welcome after a very strong start.  The device of constantly referencing back to his list of rules works for a while, but by the end I was rolling my eyes at a ""double tap"" gag.  

There's a lot of potential there, and I'd love to be wrong about this one.  I'd love to see them pull it off, but so far, I'm just not optimistic.&&Begun preproduction and set to release in October? Yeah that'll go well. &&Surprised no one is talking about the terrible show that was based on the movie and characters &&Man, wayyy too late.

It was for Amazon. They did a few episodes and then dropped it due to lack of success. It wasn't bad. IMO, the issue was that nobody knew about it. Hulu and Netflix do a decent-ish job promoing their shows, but I never know what's happening on Amazon.&&Now if we could get a good sequel/prequel to cabin in the woods.&&We got Blade Runner 2049, The Dark Knight, The Godfather 2, and a bunch of others So there is always hope ..&&They had to wait for the walking dead to stop making zombies uncool&& Can’t forget to mention after everyone from the movie weren’t keen on a sequel, Amazon attempted a  ‘Zombieland’ tv show...ended up being so terrible it got dumped after the pilot episode.

[Zombieland tv show trailer](https://youtu.be/G62sQ4G2Wzg) &&22 Jump Street was pretty good&&I thought Deadpool 2 was better than the first, and the writers of that series are also the writers of the Zombieland series. The same director from the first Zombieland is also directing this one. So I think we have a right to have more faith in this than the average sequel.&&We're looking at you Super Troopers.&&What about jumanji???&&>  comedy sequels have not exactly been killing it in recent times

I found Star Wars: The Last Jedi to be a fantastic comedy. 

Had me in stitches all the way through. &&I'll probably watch it. If it sucks I won't like it, but if it's good, I will&&How TF has Bill Murray never won an academy award&&Its pretty damn amazing how far each of these actors have come since in the past 10 years. They're all phenomenal actors, it's gonna be strange seeing them back in a role they took at the beginning of their careers (Minus Woody).

Maybe they should make a sequel to this sequel in another 10 years time like the Before series. &&I hope Bill makes it to the sequel, even as an actual zombie. &&Yeah the original Zombieland came out October 2, 2009, so that must be a typo.&&They look the same!&&The Double Tap&&Apart from Bill Murray..... &&I want to ask someone who really enjoys the movie.

What do you think about the girls sudden character shift from cunning survivalist opportunists to helpless little girls who mess everything up and can’t even save themselves?

It’s bugged me so much, and I don’t want to yuck other people’s yums but did you notice this? If so, does it bother you to any degree?&&Still waiting on Spaceballs 3: The search for Spaceballs 2&&Zombieland 2: Rampart

Only title I will accept.&&Would have been more horrific if filmed just after Hostess went under.&&Well, he'd actually be a zombie this time. They never showed a bullet going into his head.&&Shot in the chest, enough time to wrap him in sheets and plan a ceremony. Then they chilled at the house until after dark. Murray was never shown to be undead in that time.  
  
My money? He's in the next one, and bitches them out for: drinking all his good booze, shooting him, and not checking for a pulse.&&You don’t really get to choose to bring Bill Murray back. He must choose to.&&Your life will be complete if the world lasts through 2019 and this project doesn't have any *mishaps*.&&[deleted]&&Bill Murray should be a zombie they shoot dead in the sequel.&&Having Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg play brothers in a movie must happen eventually. &&Yeah he totally added some weight to that chin!&&Rule #4: the double cash&&When did Mel Brooks start writing Zombieland rules?&&Emma Stone is best girl. You have to be literally blind to not at least think she's cute.&&Lmao, when did your friends not think she was hot? Like, did they not see Superbad, aka one of her early prominent roles where she was known for being a babe?&&Uhh... you must not have watched the entire first movie all the way through to the end.

[Tallahassee finally got a twinkie.](https://youtu.be/8rpAVbEudNU?t=37)&&Yeah, everyone here is really excited about this, but Fleischer hasn't made a decent film since (from the filmmaker who gave us '30 Minutes or Less' and 'Gangster Squad'). I'm not even cautiously optimistic for this. I liked Zombieland, but I'm not holding out hope for a decent sequel. &&>motivation

One is looking for a twinkie while a another one is  trying to get home. How that not practical&&The whole point of the movie is that these are all people who survived solely because of character traits that universally seen as faults. Zuckerberg had no real life friends even though he was going to college and should be in the prime of making them, the girls were career thieves abandoned when they were young, and Talahassee was a [obvious special forces guy who probably was away from his family doing some kind of work and was unable to protect them and turned hard and cold with guilt from it.](#spoiler)

It's a super plain redemption movie where people who were never close to their family, never had family, and who couldn't be there for their family in their time of need come together to move on. A single production better than the entirety of The Walking Derp.

But I know what you mean they make me SO MAD every time they take advantage of the others...but when they make their turn you completely forget about it. Then you rewatch it and get SO MAD AGAIN.&&Look, Columbus needed to get laid.&&You’ll probably get it back&&I guess the reel is just another hole...?&&It’s your movie we’re all just livin in the background &&It’s because we’re living in a simulation. &&It's everything up to filming. Storyboarding, scouting, set construction, planning the shoot, costumes etc etc.&&I'll take him over Michael Cera.&&Summarizing as best as I can.

There's a lot that goes into movies before the filming actually starts. Location scouting, set/costume/prop designs, crews to hire, schedules to make and so so so much more. ""Production"" doesn't actually begin until the cameras start rolling, so ""pre production"" is the work they put in to get ready for that point&&They made a TV show about it... it wasn't good. &&Yeah I thought 'Fury Road' was pretty good.&&Yeah but that wasn’t a comedy. A lot of these sequel movies suck because they’re comedies. &&Fury Road was practically a reboot.&&yeah but we also got Thunderdome

&#x200B;&&And blade runner &&Yeah, but we also got Super Troopers 2.&&Fury Road isn't exactly a sequel, it's a story with the same character much like Bond movies&&To be fair, Ruben Fleischer is no George Miller. &&And Blade Runner 2049. &&I though super troopers 2 was also good&&That movie was so bad. Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.&&I never watched the show. Wasn't it just a pilot and that's it?&&A show that had nobody from the original movie?

Why be worried? &&wait thers a show ?&&Yeah&&Can one find these episodes?&&The new Jack Ryan show on Amazon is pretty good. Actually being reasonably promoted, at least where I live it is.&&I spend a lot of time on internet and I go on a lot of very different sites and yet I never read anything about Amazon shows. They do not promote them at all but I do see stuff about some of their shows, it's just that somehow it seems like they don't want people to think they own the shows lol.

&#x200B;

Like I had no idea they had Bosch until very recently and after that I decided to take a look at their series and I do not know any of them and most of the posters and summaries do not make you wanna try them.

&#x200B;

I'm not even gonna bother since I already have Netflix, Hulu and HBO. Amazon can give up already.&&I think if they did a prequel, it would have a similar flavor to Hostel 2, in that they would go much deeper into the workings of the organization.  

I'd love to see it from that perspective. Show how they capture the monsters, how they set up the cabin, how they pick their targets, etc.&&Can they even do a sequel? &&I am kinda hoping they go the Cube route.&&TDK came out only 3 years after Begins didn't it?&&I never though BR2049 was going to be anywhere near what the original was, I walked out of the theater and considered that it might have been better.

Its not, but I considered it.&&except blade runner these films did not take long to come out&&22 blew me away, it was one of the best comedy sequels I've ever seen. They used what made 21 great and made it even better.&&Was better than the original. &&I agree with this. &&23 was not bad either...&&Yeah but that came out two years after the first. We’re talking about ones that took extensive time to warrant a sequel: supper troopers, joe dirt, anchorman, dumb and dumber, Bad Santa.... You get the idea. &&I think Deadpool 2 was on par with Deadpool 1 which is pretty much as good as it gets for comedy sequels these days!&&I'd say Deadpool 2 was about on par with Deadpool 1, which is a good thing.&&Honestly curious what made the second one better than the first in your eyes. Maybe my expectations were too high.&&Wait people don’t like super troopers 2? I thought it was pretty great the first time I watched and after it came out on DVD I watch it again and enjoyed. Original is better but the 2nd is solid.&&I heard Super Troopers 2 was pretty good though? I'm still pissed that Bad Santa had a sequel. WHY?&&I enjoyed Super Troopers. Oh I think it still falls prey to ""The first was better!"" syndrome, but it was a worthy successor.&&They should have made Potfest instead.&&Jumanji isn't really a comedy. The new one is, but I can't think of a single joke from Jumanji. 

&&Jumanji was surprisingly enjoyable - The problems is for every good comedy sequel there are multiple terrible ones. &&Zathura is the real Jumanjii sequel.&&yeah I was laughing so hard during TLJ that I had tears running down my face. Tears from...laughing...not cuz I was watching a terrible movie ruin a beloved franchise...ha ha yeah laughing &&Not a lot of Academy Awards for straight comedies or for actors in Wes Anderson flicks. His nomination is for *Lost in Translation*.

Woody actually has 3 nominations (_The People vs. Larry Flynt_, _The Messenger_, and _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri_)

Eisenberg was nominated for his work in *Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice*.

Breslin was nominated for _Little Miss Sunshine_

Emma Stone was nominated for _Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance_ and won for _La La Land_

Also, I'm obviously kidding. Jesse Eisenberg was nominated for _The Social Network_.&&A lot of his films aren't Oscar bait.&&Because other than a handful of exceptions the roles he is known for aren't award worthy.

Caddyshack? Nope.

Ghostbusters? Nope.

Groundhog Day? Better than the other two, but nope.&&He is overrated?&&...Because they don’t give out awards for being funny, entertaining, or doing things people like.  They give them out for doing an impression of important films of the past.  

Nobody gave a second thought to giving an Oscar to Groundhog Day when it came out.  They were too busy trying to predict what would be the next “classic” film and give IT and oscar, usually things that were basically like Simple Jack from Tropic Thunder.  &&Fun fact, when the movie came out, only Eisenberg and Stone hadn't yet been nominated for Oscars. Harrelson, Murray, and Breslin were all Oscar nominees.&&Holy fuck, I was a sophomore in high school then. Where did the last decade go lol&&Feels like it came out 5 years ago. Shit. I was 13 in 2009. I don't wanna grow up.&&Except the 13 year old, who is now 22.&&I'm sure while he won't be a part of filming, there will totally be a flashback when they meet a new celebrity in the movie, and Colombus uses that experience to, you know, not kill someone, but it turns out they're actually a zombie, and Little Rock just barely gets saved by Tallahassee&&It's a zombie movie, he could totally come back.&&I saw it less as a character shift and more of a moment of weakness. They'd reached their original journey's end, were forced to face a harsh reality, and decided to throw caution to the wind.&&It sounds like a plot they would go with and I would be totally down to see it &&I thought it was Spaceballs 2: The Quest for More Money&&This is now the only way I would accept a Spaceballs sequel &&ThanksKilling 3?&&Waiting for History of the World part II.

Only if its related to Rampart.&&Have him be a zombie, but still completely cognizant for no reason.&&I think the Zombieland universe follows the George Romero Dawn of the Dead rules and not the Walking Dead rules. No bite, no zombie. 

Edit: Correction. The bite only rules are derived from the Romero remakes&&The sequel will feature Woody Harrelson's character locking up zombie Bill Murray in his home and feeding him occasionally so as to keep him ""alive"" in case a cure is eventually discovered&&*technically* the ""zombies"" in Zombieland are the ""still-alive-infected"" type zombies, not living dead type. (I believe they mentioned this in the special features)&&Well, Patrick Swayze was going through chemo when they were filming the movie so they got Bill Murray to do it instead.

Just find someone else willing to do some bit from their most famous movie and then shoot them as well. Make it a thing.&&Watching Bojack??? &&Wasn't he already shot dead in the first one? 

I think a Dan Akroyd cameo (or someome similar) would work a bit better.&&They're technically just living people with super rabies and a bottomless case of the munchies.

It's no Road Warrior, but it has its moments.&&Hey I love Thunderdome &&Is this seriously any good? I checked it out from the library over a week ago and it’s been sitting on my coffee table ever since. I want to watch it, but I’m scared it will suck and desecrate the original for me. I’ve avoided playing it  like 5 times this past week by finding other shit to do.&&Not as bad as the prequel, Dumb and Dumberer&&yup&&Cause it was still written by the 2 who wrote the screenplay for the 1st movie. And the writing for the tv show was really bad.&&IIRC Zombieland (the movie version) was originally meant to be a series. The whole ""Zombie kill of the week"" was supposed to be a recurring weekly joke.&&Kinda, not really. Amazon or something made a pilot.  It didnt take off, wasnt great&&Unless they still have it up on Amazon, I wouldn't know. I watched it upon release. A lot of people hated it, but I thought potential was there once they let up on the slapstick, and got the tone right. If it's not on Amazon, I'd say you'd have to go a less than legal route and I don't want to link anything like that in the subreddit.&&Seems like it's being promoted everywhere.  I liked it, even with Bud Light Dilly Dilly king in it, who actually does a great job playing his character.  Glad to see it was renewed for a second season before the first aired.&&Yeah they did a really good job of world building, it would be cool to see how they switch over from old gods to guys in shirts betting on a merman 😂&&Also wasn't godfather 2 only like 2/3 years later?&&Yup, 2005 and 2008.&&I like it more than the original&&[deleted]&&All thanks to Korean Jesus. &&my name is Jeff &&JULIA ROB HURTS. &&There was a third one?&&There's........ a Joe Dirt 2?&&[deleted]&&Supper Troopers: a movie about finding dinner.

Kinda bummed it was a rehash of all the old jokes from the first one. Like, I get that's what people wanted, but not exactly...&&God why did you remind me of Joe Dirt 2. That movie was a fucking atrocity.&&Don't forget Grown Ups.

EDIT: Why am I being downvoted? Wasn't Grown Ups 2 a shitty sequel?

EDIT: Oh, both of them were horribly received. That's weird, I swore the first film was well received. Nvm.&&Idk me personally it just had more moments that made me laugh than the first. The first one was good but I honestly liked the second better, possibly because it built on what the first had already established&&Personally I liked it more. The first was funny but didn't really wow me... The pacing didn't feel right, the story felt bland and didn't endear me to the characters, I didn't *care* what happened in the resolution.

Deadpool 2, to me, did everything the first did right and fixed what it did wrong. It was still gut busting funny but i actually cared about the characters outside Wayde, everyone seemed to have more depth to them, the plot got me emotionally invested. I even cried at Vanessa's death, they did such a good job making me get attached to her right away in the second when I didn't really care in the first. And Russell, his tragic arc and redemption... It all just got me in a way the first didn't. The first just felt to me like a fun action romp while the second felt like a cohesive story.&&I liked it.  Super Troopers > Beerfest > Super Troopers 2 > the rest.&&2nd one is a good movie but the comedy is kinda forced. Still funny though.&&Quote from a friend who smokes.. ""Don't bother going to see it unless you smoke.. Its a stoners movie and everybody in the cinema who wasnt high wasnt laughing.""

I guess it kinda summed it up well enough for me.&&4th wall breaking monkey child. I guess that's about it... &&How can you say any movie ruined that franchise after the prequels? The Last Jedi wasn’t good, but let’s not act like Star Wars has been some perfect film franchise who never did wrong and TLJ ruined their perfect streak.&&Oh man you got me on that Eisenberg one.&&Got me at the end there&&It's interesting how Wes Anderson movies lately get nominated for most awards except for the acting ones

Jesse Eisenberg was robbed from BvS tbh ;p&&You bastard :) I was actually feeling a bit frustrated about it until your correction.&&He should have one it for Three Billboards.

Like a ""Clearly We Fucked Up Somewhere So Here It Is Award""&&You take Caddyshack out of your blasphemous mouth, he made that movie &&ooo reddit won't like this&&Ok to be fair, the Oscar that year went to Schindler's List, which is a classic film. And the Golden Globe for Best Musical or Comedy went to Mrs. Doubtfire (for which Robin Williams won a GG as well.) Neither Groundhog Day nor Murray were nominated for the Golden Globe that year either, though they probably should have been. (Mrs. Doubtfire, Dave, Much Ado About Nothing, Sleepless in Seattle, Strictly Ballroom; Williams for Mrs. Doubtfire, Hanks for Sleepless in Seattle and he also won for Philadelphia, Kevin Kline for Dave, Johnny Depp for Benny & Joon, and Colm Meaney for The Snapper)

Something completely unexplainable and bizarre happened during the late 2000's and early 2010's that made the prequels gradually gain a large fan following of younger folk who were most likely born in the mid-late 90's. It started with clickbait internet articles pointing out the ""good"" things about the prequels (e.g. ""Pod racing!!"" or ""Yoda lightsaber fight!!""). The internet generation started seeing the prequels in a positive light. I still can't understand it because the prequels are objectively terrible movies in every aspect, and they've aged so badly that today they're basically unwatchable.  

But at this point you basically can't criticize the prequels without the Star Wars fandom jumping at your throat. The prequels are cannon, and the canon is supposedly immune to criticism. It's just...yeah, I have no explanation.&&Well, their production design is pretty great, so it makes sense Grand Budapest would be nominated for a bunch of those.

Columbus started out trying to reach home and see if his parents survived. Then he decides he's going to try and gain some self-confidence (and overcome his fear of clowns) and/or have sex with Emma Stone.

Tallahassee was looking for Twinkies, obviously, and dealing with the death of his kid. He has a couple breakdowns in the film and thus a few moments of weakness of his own despite being introduced as maximum badass.

The girls were trying to get to Pacific Playland, and they thought it was a safe-zone. Upon reaching that objective and finding it was not a safe zone, they kinda had nothing else going for them, so hey why not get some enjoyment out of this bleak world while they're there?

Part of the reason the movie works so well (for me) is that it allows these moments where otherwise competent characters slip up due to their own personal issues. If the movie hadn't set up these issues in advance it would have looked like they were being stupid for no reason.

Didn't the prequels also have a inconsistent tone in an attempt to cater to absolutely every kind of audience possible? We've got everything from slapstick Jarjar and R2D2 scenes, to boring political senate gatherings, to Romeo & Juliet romance, to decapitation, torture and child-murder. The prequels basically tried to check every box.

JJ Abrams *did* attempt to set up an overarching story in TFA. It's why TLJ made so much money despite being terrible - people were extremely eager to see where the story would go from TFA, there was so much incredible potential and hype. TFA left me saying ""meh"" but very excited to see it being used as a launch-pad for something vastly more interesting.

"According to director Guillermo del Toro, the ""Pale Man"" monster in Pan’s Labyrinth represented the Catholic Church and their role in facilitating fascism. [Trivia]",33029,9e4721,https://www.idyoma.com/blog/2018/7/24/spanish-movies,1368,1536411925.0,,"**Absolutely! More specifically, the scene criticizes the Churches role in the Spanish Civil War (the setting of the film). You can see various clues throughout the scene:**  
- The Pale Man sits at the same spot of the table that the fascist Vidal sat in the banquet scene.  
- The Pale Man's appearance and silver plate of eyes is a reference to the Catholic Saint Lucy (who is often depicted with her eyes on a plate).  
- There are tons of religious references in the scene: The fireplace (gates of hell) behind the pale man, the Adam and Eve story (when Ofelia eats the ""forbidden fruit"" and the Pale Man's similarity to Goya's painting 'Saturn (a Roman god) devouring his child.'  
- Plus overall, Del Toro says that the scene is entirely a metaphor for the ""Church eating the children when they have a perversely abundant banquet in from of them. There is almost a hunger to eat innocence…”  


**Edit:** The scene has so many meanings that I can't write down them all, but have a think about the meanings of the paintings and the pile of children's shoes as well. Plus, [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Francisco_de_Goya%2C_Saturno_devorando_a_su_hijo_%281819-1823%29.jpg) is a link to Goya's painting that inspired the Pale Man.&&I never saw the connection, but the Pale Man is one of my favorite movie monsters of all time. At the time I thought it was supposed to be a sexual predator, a pedophile that lures children with promises of food. I guess Catholic Church makes sense.&&What the hell am I reading here?

>This 2006 film from the masterful Guillermo del Toro is set in Spain during the Nazi dominance of World War II. Pre-Allied successes, a troop of soldiers are sent out into rural forested Spain to hunt down rebels and consolidate the Nazi advances.

It takes place in Franco's Spain. The Nazis never conquered Spain, nor did they even try. The fascists in the movie are Franco soldiers. The Allies never fought Franco, who ruled until the 70s.

Fucking basic research.

Edit: They've edited the article to delete references to Vidal and his soldiers being Nazis, and they added explanatory text claiming they meant it just took place during Nazi dominance of Europe. While the current version is more accurate, they were obviously under the impression that Vidal and his soldiers were Nazis.&&The pale man was certainly creepy as fuck, but you know what freaked me out the most about this movie, and is the scene that left the most vivid impression? Maybe don’t read this if you haven’t seen the movie yet...






It’s when that bastard Captain murders the teenage shepherd boy right in front of his father– by bashing a glass bottle so hard against his nose until his face is obliterated, and I assume his brain caves in. The sheer violence of this was horrific and incredibly difficult to watch, but the fact that this was done right in front of the father? I can’t even imagine what it would feel like to see that happen to your own child while you stand by helplessly. That’s why I think it was actually something of a mercy that the Captain, the sick fuck, simply shot and killed the father shortly after he killed the son. Better that than being haunted by that image the rest of of your life. &&Does anybody also think that Guillermo del Toro can make both genius movies and movies that kind of suck?&&This conflicts with the last couple times he tried to say it was a representation for other things&&As a Spaniard, I really enjoyed the Pan's Labyrinth depiction and symbolism of the scourge that fascism and it's collaborators (ike the church) were and how they damaged this country and its people.&&This kind of information always brings to mind Tolkien's response to questions about what the One Ring represented: ""I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.""&&I seem to recall him saying it represented white men and abuse during the height of #MeToo.&&Fascism check. Catholic Church check. To the top we go!&&He posted a tweet on Feb 2, 2017 saying:

Pretty accurate.&&Thought I was on r/circlejerk for a second there&&Does stuff like this come across to you guys? Do you pick up on it? Is the work better for it?

Do you think there's a different in a pale man for the sake of a pale man vs. the pale man meaning to represent the Catholic Church; especially if the latter isn't apparent in the narrative?


Edit: i’m not dissing the movie... just asking...&&Back in February 2017, soon after Trump took power, he went on Twitter and said, ""it's not accidental that he is a) Pale b) a Man,"" implying it represented white men.&&I think Guillermo did Pacific Rim and Hellboy because of a combination of liking the IP/premise and needing to pay the bills. He's at his peak doing symbolist horror like PT and Chronos. &&The Catholic church certainly enabled and supported Fascism in Spain, to the point its higher ranks became almost indivisible to the regime.&&Lotta hurt feelings in here.&&It was fascinating to read about all the symbolism and metaphors in this film. It admittedly went far over my head on first viewing. A truly profound masterpiece.&&RCC did a lot to fight fascism too. It's well known that the Nazis wanted to arrest the Pope and murdered a lot of Catholic clergy.&&Now that's a subtle satire, if I've ever seen one... &&The Catholic church facilitating fascism? What? I can honestly say I've dedicated half my adult life to the history of fascism, and even wrote several papers (mostly for school, not necessarily my most brilliant works) on fascism and Catholicism, and of all the things he could have argued for the Church aiding and abetting fascism is one of the least convincing.

Fascists *despised* religion, Judeo-Christianity in particular, with its ""anti-natural"", ""degenerate"" philosophy of helping the weak, which they believed was largely responsible for the degeneresence (I think that's the word in English) of humankind.

The only place where that argument could be made with any amount of validity would be Spain during its Civil War, but even then it's fairly iffy since the Holy See only aligned with Franco (who they absolutely despised) because he offered their priests protection against the Republicans who by that point were openly hunting down clergymen and burning them alive to the tune of the *Internationale* in front of video cameras. And even then it's not really correct since Franco, though he certainly had fascist elements under his banner, was most certainly not a fascist himself at all, but rather a super-conservative *a la* France's Petain.

As a general rule, fascism and the Church have always been at odds on a fundamental ideological level, and the Church has always been outspoken against its ideology with the exception of two Concordates signed respectively with the Germans and Italians to end the persecution of German/Italian Catholics. Concordates of pragmatism in both cases between two parties that despised each other.

This sort of thing tends to really get a rise out of me since people all over the Internet blindly associate the Church with aiding fascism and I feel like I'm alone on a hill shouting ""Hitler blamed Catholicism for the fall of the (Aryan) Roman Empire! He despised religion, and the Church more specifically, who he saw as a symptom of the global Jewish disease! This makes no sense!""

/rant&&Didn't the Church have a hand in sheltering Jews during the Holocaust?&&What I would like to know is what the eyes in the palms of his hands means&&If you’re interested in another film about the Franco regime in Spain check out “The Spirit of the Beehive,” directed by Victor Erice in 1973. It’s definitely a slower movie but I think Del Toro got some inspiration from it, and it’s just an overall incredible movie. The cinematography is fantastic and, like Del Toro, the director does a good job of kind of playing tricks on the viewer by weaving fantasy with reality, although it’s more of a psychological thing there as opposed to the crazy visuals in Pans Labyrinth. &&Wow, geez what a shock, if the ""right hand"" scene doesn't tell you what this movie is about... &&The provided link is not the one you seek. It is for a 'best of spanish cinema' list, which addresses the catholic-white-man connection only in passing. It does, however, provide the following link to a GdT interview which is far more interesting and informative:

I was taught in a film analysis class and so was my friend in a separate class that the whole scene represented the Holocaust, that his body was modeled after a starved victim and then the pile of children’s shoes are obvious. 

I guess it is open to different interpretation though &&Thousands of men and women were imprisoned after the civil war in Francoist concentration camps, approximately 367,000 to 500,000 prisoners in 50 camps or prisons. Executions of the ""enemies of the state"" continued (some 50,000 people), including the extrajudicial (death squad) executions of alleged members of the anti–Francoist guerrillas and their supporters.

Thousands of women suffered public humiliation (being paraded naked through the streets, being shaved and forced to ingest castor oil), sexual torture and rape. Many Republican women were forced into prostitution. Furthermore, thousands of women were executed, among them pregnant women. One judge said: ""We cannot wait seven months to execute a woman"".

Under the Francoist legislation, a woman needed her husband's permission to take a job or open a bank account. Adultery by women was a crime, but adultery by the husband was a crime only if he lived with his mistress.

**The Spanish Church approved of the White Terror and cooperated** with the rebels.[80][135][136][137] According to Antony Beevor: ""Cardinal Gomá stated that 'Jews and Masons poisoned the national soul with absurd doctrine'... A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, but **the majority of the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power** and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such an important part of the Spanish diet.""

Always remember, there are people who want this to happen again. Who stand to benefit, if reverting to brutality can be called that. They will use anything on their power to get their way.

* The Captain becomes aware of Mercedes' betrayal after she steals from his pantry. This parallels the Pale Man who wakes to Ofelia's presence after her theft of food.
* Ofelia acts with disobedience when she opens the \*wrong\* locker (the correct locker which she opens is different from the one shows in the instructions in the book). This plays into the theme about the importance of disobedience and raises the question of whether her theft of the grape was really wrong.
* The connections between the church and the fascist regime (the false father) are also in The Captain's insistence that Ofelia refer to him as her father, and in the regime's distribution of bread to the community.
* The rose on Ofelia's shirt (in the post-death sequence) is a reference to the Empyrean rose (symbolizing heaven) in Dante's Inferno.
* There are many, many vaginal and menstrual symbols in the film, associated with the maternal symbol of the moon. The initial defeat of the toad is an expression of mastery over Ofelia's sexuality which destroys the clothing that symbolizes sexual repression at the hands of the state.

There is a great review of the film [right here](http://filmreadings.com/2015/12/20/pans-labyrinth/) that goes into detail on this stuff and much more. Perhaps worthwhile reading for anyone who also likes the film and/or this sort of close reading of cinema in general.

The Germans did actually send a lot of equipment and some ""volunteers"" but the article here is hella wrong. &&[deleted]&&I will not hear you besmirch the good name of the world famous idyoma.com &&It's referring to the context described in del Toro's interview with Mark Kermode from the bit where they're comparing the historical context of Devil's Backbone vs Pan's Labyrinth:

> **Kermode**: Just before we show the clip from The Devil's Backbone, it's important historically but here we know less about the Spanish civil war than Spain or Mexico. Crucially, Pan's Labyrinth is set in 1944 and Devil's Backbone is set in 1939. You once said, ""For better or worse, it is a period that belonged only to Spain."" What did you mean by that?

> **del Toro**: Well, it was a moment when Spain was alone, completely alone in 1939. Because everybody else was trying not to upset the balance in Europe, tiptoeing around Hitler. So the republicans were alone. Mexico offered help and offered to receive emigrants from Spain and sent weapons and ships and things. After tiptoeing so much around Hitler, the civil war ended in 1939 and six months later Hitler invaded Poland. 1944 was important because once again the resistance in Spain was fighting on the side of the allies to ensure that the outcome of the second world war would not be in Hitler's favour. They sabotaged the tungsten mines in Galicia in the north of Spain, the main source of material for the building of panzer tanks in Germany. So they were sabotaging these and fighting in France in hopes that after Normandy the allies would turn their gaze upon them and take down Franco. That never happened.

So, though the fascist forces in the film are Franquistas, the context is them stopping the resistance forces from assisting the Allies and hindering Hitler's war effort. 

The full interview is linked in the article but you can find it here: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/21/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank 

The article wasn't clear enough in what it was describing. &&You’re not reading it apparently, it just says that the movie takes place in Spain, during an era of wwii when Nazis were dominate. It doesn’t say Spain was occupied by Germans, just that they sent in a troop to attacking rebels. I’m not sure why you got so worked up over this lol.&&Nazi's were highly involved in the Spanish civil war though that quote is wrong. &&This is a case where you don’t know how much you don’t know. 
I grew up in Francos Spain. It was never clear exactly what type a fascism it was and it was plenty contradictory. You could use nazi or a subset of Nazi to describe it, especially around the ww2 times. 
The description is perfectly fine. 
Technically it’s not nazi, but due to the vagaries of what it actually was nazi isn’t far away from it. &&https://i.somethingawful.com/inserts/articlepics/photoshop/12-07-07-popups/Kerro1.jpg&&The father would probably murder the captain eventually, the Captain knew this.&&The great thing about Del Toro is that he makes movies he wants to see. Even if they’re not groundbreaking, he makes enjoyable movies. A problem in the industry right now is that too many creators are making movies for an award, for money, to sell toys, etc. Del Toro makes movies because he wants to enjoy his own creations, but he’s also aware of the messages his stories tell to a broad audience and tries to appeal to that. &&Totally.

I was super excited for *Crimson Peak*. Meh.

Chastain was great in it at least.&&Yeah, Shape of Water and Cronos are great IMO. But, though some people like it, Pacific Rim never really grabbed me. Interesting concept but I wasn't sure of the execution. &&It's weird. Pans labyrinth is my favourite film. But every other film is always just missing something and I wouldn't watch them again. Like I like the ideas, the settings etc...  But there's just something not there. &&His best films (Cronos, the Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth) are in Spanish and made in Spain, while his English-language films can be good, but are never great. Even his attempt to do a Pan's Labyrinth type film in English (Shape of the Water) was not quite great in my opinion.&&I liked all the ones I've seen. Granted, those were just Shape of Water, Hellboy 1&2, and Pacific Rim. &&You mean this commonly held opinion?&&I mean, that could be said about most any director. Tim Burton was unbeatable in the '80s and '90s in terms of his creativity and twisted sense of humor. But his last good movie was Big Fish over a decade ago. Spielberg has been pretty much the undisputed king of film for having culturally impactful films in every decade thus far as well as multiple family and popcorn flicks, but he's also got 1941 and War Of The Worlds. I get what you're saying, but it's kind of broad to say.&&What else did he say the monster represented?&&I prefer directors like David Lynch who refuse to explain jack shit about their movies. That way, they not only avoid contradicting themselves, but also force the audience to actually think and draw up their own theories. 

I feel like many directors try to rehash something from one of their old movies to stay culturally relevant and appear progressive in retrospect. Authors are guilty of this as well. JK Rowling often crawls out to say something like, “Acktuuuaalllly I wrote Dumbledore to be gay!” or most recently, “I never specified Hermione’s race and it’s possible she was black all along,” even though [she totally did specify her race.](http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Hermione-white-face.jpg)&&A thing can have multiple meanings?&&Let us see what is relavent right now....hmmmm.....ahhhh?

Edit: this was more sarcasm directed at the director trying to stay relevent by bashing the church. One sentomemt below was that the monster represents people burning theie nikes. That was the sentiment I was going for. Also I have been told the interview is from 2006 so I was weong on most accounts. The monster represented my own ignorance. I am the monster.&&As good a filmmaker as he is, I sometimes think he doesn’t know exactly what he wants. A lot of the time it’s hating Catholics.&&I liked when it represented a monster.&&It's insane to think that Franco was still in power just four decades ago. We often associate fascism with a long-gone-by era in Europe, when it's actually far from that.&&Okay but he made blatant Lucifer falling from grace allegories.&&Wow that’s a great quote. &&You are of the same mind as Tolkien?&&That's really interesting. Thanks.&&I seem to recall him saying it represented my mom when she wouldn't let me have dessert before dinner. &&I seem to recall him saying it represented when it’s really dark and you’re on your way to the bathroom and you step on a lego.&&I seem to recall him saying it represented the rise of artificially intelligent algorithms that keep us inside perception bubbles and led to our current political climate. That's why he has eyeballs in his hands.&&I seem to recall him saying it represented when you're about to say grace but you remember that you're blind but you have a spare pair of eyes in your hands so you use those to see who you're saying grace with.&&Clearly no link between white men abusing people and the Catholic Church.&&I seem to recall him saying it represented that shocked feeling when you’re helping a friend collapse a sofa bed and you’re holding on to a bar and the other end of the bed drops to the floor and you think OhMyGodHaveILostAFinger&&I seem to recall him saying it represented Yoshi committing tax fraud.&&Anti-Clericalism, Ho!&&Reasonably speaking, the entire movie is supposed to be a commentary on fascism in Spain at the time.  It might not have been obvious to people (I'm too dumb to have picked up on it) but it's not absurd to think that one of the monsters in the movie was supposed to represent one of the societal forces that enabled fascism.&&I doubt anyone connected the Pale man with the Catholic Church; but the film is obviously allegorical, it literally takes place during fascist Spain 1944, you see all the effects of such a regime on the people, it informs the girl’s fantasy escapism &&As a media studies teacher, it was difficult to sometimes get students to want to see the symbolism in a text, be it a movie or book or painting. “can’t we just enjoy it?” So I often asked about the clothes they wore, or why they would barrack for certain teams as a form of tribalism. To make them see that they participate in symbolism all the time to seperate themselves form others, be it older people via their clothes, or other groups via their teams. That they were the most put upon generation ever by influential media is an important message they needed to protect themselves from being mislead or influenced in a manner they did not want to join in. So when they watch a film, they may start to see the symbolism that characters may portray, and that subtextual layer of understanding may be a warning or means of empowering themselves. 
In identifying multiple layers of meanings in texts, you are taken on journeys far beyond your own existence and imagination. It can draw you into other worlds where you may see different people’s perspectives or propel you on journeys where discovery’s could be exciting, hilarious, thrilling or even dangerous. You can often feel empowered to act on those embryonic ideas to change the world you live in now. 
So, yes, understanding symbolism can be the best thing around! &&I never once gave a thought to symbolism when I saw Pan's Labyrinth. It was just a weird but entertaining movie to me. It might be interesting to learn about the alleged symbolisms, then watch it again, to see if it's more cohesive. On the other hand, that may ruin the fun of it.

Slightly related, I remember when we read Deliverance in high school, and Mr. Curran asked if we caught the symbolism of the white owl flying by. I got so angry! Why the fuck did we have to look for deeper meanings? Why couldn't we just enjoy the story? Obviously, my attitude hasn't matured much as I age.&&You left out the second half of the tweet where he adds it represents “institutional evil feeding on the helpless”&&Yeah, I read about this in the Del Toro exhibit at the AGO. &&Sounds more like he just likes to talk out his ass and make shit up.&&would i be wrong to claim that ~~protestants~~ evangelicals are enabling fascism in america nowadays?&&Not in Spain they didn't. Almost without exception, the Clergy were very supportive of Franco. &&> Fascists despised religion (...) The only place where that argument could be made with any amount of validity would be Spain during its Civil War

What about in Croatia, where Ante Pavelić and the Ustaša declared Roman Catholicism and fascism the twin hearts of the Croatian man, and made forcible conversion to Catholicism part of their ethnic cleansing program? Why did Mile Budak, at the time the Ustaša Ambassador to Nazi Germany and Minister of Education and Faith, declare this?

> *The movement of the Ustaša is based on faith. For the minorities we have three million bullets. We shall kill one part of the Serbs, expel the second part, and convert to Catholicism the third part of them.* (Address to the residents of Gospić, 22 July 1941)

Why did the Bishop of Sarajevo, Ivan Šarić, publish an endorsement of this policy in an official bulletin, and why did the Ustaša populate its ranks with over 300 priests? Did we forget about clerics and church officials like Tomislav Filipović, who oversaw major extermination camps while wearing their clerical garb (Filipović was executed for war crimes still wearing his cassock)?

Why did it happen also in France, where Pétain declared almost immediately that Catholicism would be ""reinstated"" as the core of French character? Why did he cancel the Republic's separation of church and state and allocate state funds for Catholic education? If the fascists and collaborators in France hated religion, why did they seek out and glorify the members of the Catholic Action Française and install members to positions of power, and why did priests in good standing publish in Je suis partout, endorsing the Nazis, the British Legion of Fascists, etc? Why did notable members of the French Catholic leadership, like Archbishop Durieux and Bishop Caillot, spend their free time writing praise for the collaborationist government and fascist policies?

Why did it happen also in Romania, where the Iron Guard
/Legion of the Archangel Michael explicitly labelled itself an Orthodox Christian fascist movement? Codreanu's writing is an effort in finding 500 ways to reword ""fascist sacrifices are like Christ's sacrifices! Jews deserve death for not recognising the Savior!"" Were the National Christian Party, who wore swastikas on their shirts and gave Jews the choice between Christianity and a bullet to the throat, not fascist enough?

I think you're whitewashing the existence of clerical fascism especially in Eastern Europe and Italy a bit, and I don't see how *anyone* could in good faith deny that Christianity was dominant in the Anglosphere fascist movements (here in Australia all meetings of the largest fascist group were combined with Anglican religious services).&&The monster needed to see. #nomoremonsterbodyshaming &&>Under the Francoist legislation, a woman needed her husband's permission to take a job or open a bank account.

You cannot put that up to the Franco regime. The same was the case in basically all other european nations, from the US to Germany. &&Fascism and socialism are completely opposed ideologies. Quit listening to T_D and Turning Point USA&&Both poetic films that are ultimately very different. I'm glad they both exist.&&+1, Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few modern movies that has a perfect blend of both a gripping, engaging narrative and a selection of relevant, though provoking subtexts. Also check out the toad scene from the film, as that has plenty more commentary on the Church, fascism and the Spain's leadership under Franco.

&&[deleted]&&I don’t care his stance I just hope he never stops making movies with attention to detail and unreal mise en scène. One of my favorite directors&&How many people said that, though? I think it’s pretty widely acknowledged that Pan’s Labyrinth is his best movie so far.&&I think the biggest thing is that TSOW is significantly more approachable to the majority of audiences (from the audiences perspective not mine). Maybe that’s a harsh overgeneralization, but a large percentage of people I know (live in the Midwest for reference) just flat out won’t see a movie with subtitles. 

There is also that the fact that it’s a movie with deep symbolism and external references to major historical events outside of what most people learn in the US. Where as (from a very simplistic view) TSOW is just a romance with some monster man and some random dick that works for the government. 

Of course that ignores the fact there there is an entire commentary and everything has much deeper meaning. But we also have like what 8 transformers movies now, so don’t expect much from most audiences at this point. Also, it’s a movie and people who think that TSOW is better or more representative of del Toro’s work can have their opinion. I might think it’s wrong as do you but they’re entitled to it. (FWIW I don’t think you made it seem they weren’t entitled to it, I always make sure to mention the above since a lot of people tend to forget that on the internet and irl)&&Shape of Water is a beautiful and wonderful film that everyone should see.

But Pan's Labyrinth is on a completely different level. It's a damn near perfect film, and easily my favorite ever.

Personally, I'd put Crimson Peaks above Shape of Water too. I personally like it more, though I think it could be argued Shape of Water is a better film.&&Because you're forgetting Pacific Rim!&&Peak GDT should still be At the Mountains of Madness.&&Replace Del Toro work virtually any director and most actors and you'll start to understand how recognition and awards work in the arts. Rarely is someone recognized most for their best work.&&Agree. PL ks one of my favorite movies ever. &&The shape of water is so hamfisted that it often feels like a parody of a cold war movie. Pan's Labyrinth is so much more genuine in its message and the tone is entirely consistent. &&For real. Like The Shape of Water was grand, but it’s nothing compared to Pan.&&Shape of Water isn’t even in his top 5 to be honest.&&I thought shape of water was just ok by comparison.&&I didn't really ""get"" The Shape of Water. It was good. Very good. But I didn't ""get it"" because Pan's Labyrinth exists. &&It was not my kind of film but I appreciate it anyway because it was an actual work of risk, unlike most big budget films that come out today.&&We haven't even begun to see peak GDT&&Pans Labyrinth is one of my very favorite movies and i thought the shape of water was so much hot garbage. &&More like ancient myths are just weird. Greek mythology is just full of gods raping humans. So it fits with the idea and themes.

EDIT: Let me clarify one thing, GDT is a weird mofo, I'm not denying that&&>Doug Jones, who played the faun in the movie, doesn’t actually speak a lick of Spanish. To get around this, Jones memorized both his and Ofelia’s lines phonetically so he knew when to speak. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, he couldn’t actually hear Ofelia’s lines when it came time to act out his scenes, because the servos inside his costume were too loud. As a result, he had to read lips. In a language he doesn’t even speak. Now that’s dedication.

>Of course, in the final product, his lines were dubbed over anyway. But the dub actor noted that Jones’ work was not all for naught, as it went a long way to show where to place the lines and how to say them.

Holy crap. Doug Jones is a boss&&Nah just likes his folklore for what it was strange, beautiful and nasty &&it's 100% that too, Del Toro's the kind of smart nerdy guy that puts enough effort into his movies that he can pull triple or quadruple entendres when he thinks he can get away with it. &&Keep in mind that many, many of the people who make observations about films watch them just like you do- they just let the movie play and enjoy it. Then they do research, replay parts of the movie to look for things that might support their theory, read more about the movie on their own, etc.

They do it because that’s what they like doing. If you like watching movies, that’s what you should do. It doesn’t make you an idiot, it makes you a regular person who likes watching films. don’t worry about how others enjoy them. And their theories and whatnot will always be there if you want to read them. &&Nope, there's no wrong way to watch a film! It's impossible in most cases to pick out little bits of symbolism on your first watch. I always enjoy researching the director of the film's life, which usually is projected into their films. You can see Del Toro's love of fairy tales and his strict Catholic upbringing in most of his work.&&These details aren’t necessarily meant to be seen on an initial viewing. They’re meant to add layers of information that add value to the work. It’s the difference between something like the film Slender Man and this. GDT wants you to revisit the film and find value every time you do.&&Most of this stuff you're not really supposed to catch the first time you watch it, I wouldn't worry about it. &&stuff like what the top commenter mentions, while awesome, usually don't amount to more than fanservice for academics and history nerds, and usually are put in in a way so that doesn't affect the experience if you don't catch on. It's also what happens when somebody like Del Toro spends like half a decade planning and executing a single film, and has enough time to think about the significance of every single second of the experience to a point where the audience literally could never catch everything he's doing. If you are familiar with the subject matter at hand, and learn enough about what good subtext looks like by example, you eventually will catch on and start to notice things yourself.&&Most people are the same way. They just google the movie after and read what the critics/directors say.&&- The Pale Man sits in the same position on the table as the fascist Captain Vidal. Therefore comparing the two.  
- The Pale Man murders innocents, including children. Much like many fascist leaderships throughout history.  
- Adding to this, he has a pile of his child victim's shoes on the floor. This is almost identical to the 'shoe room' at the Auschwitz concentration camp.  
- The Pale Man has a massive feast in front of him, but when a child eats a single grape he tries to kill them. This represents the oppression, selfishness, greed of past fascist dictatorships.  


There is a lot more in the scene, but I would suggest looking into the history of the Spanish Civil War and other scenes from the movie yourself.
&&It helps if you are familiar with the history of the catholic church during that time period, specifically their collaboration with the fascists.&&Had a mate who's metaphor for taking quickly to something was ""like a catholic priest to a choirboy"". &&I think this is a quote from 2006, the article links to this [interview](https://screenanarchy.com/2006/12/pans-labyrinthinterview-with-guillermo-del-toro.html)&&Pretty sure that catholic pedos aren’t only a recent thing...&&When has Rowling done that? I keep seeing redditors whine about JK Rowling but they never seem to have a sensical reason.

So authors are never allowed to add to the canon of their work if it's not explicitly mentioned in the work?

Dumbledore has no kids and there's never a mention of a wife or girlfriend. I could easily see his character being gay and I think suits him.

Worst fucking case scenario she made Dumbledore gay to give a sense of inclusion to her LGBT fanbase, wow the fucking horror.&&How does it feel to be so ignorant and lazy that you can't even verify when a quote is from?&&Spanish civil war was used as a testing ground for both soviet and German developing war doctrines.&&Ye completely misunderstood the nature of fascism in Spain and it's isolation from the rest of Europe at the time.&&Hobbyist ""journalism"" in a nutshell.&&""Consolidate nazi advances"" is the line that really shows it up - the nazis were certainly heavily involved in the Spanish civil war on Franco's side, the Luftwaffe's bombing of Guernica being the most famous example, but Franco was not a nazi. The paragraph quoted is misleading at best, and otherwise plain wrong. &&It says, ""a troop of soldiers are sent out into rural forested Spain to hunt down rebels and consolidate the Nazi advances,"" suggesting there are Nazi advances in Spain to consolidate. 

Oh, and it calls Vidal a ""Nazi commander"" further down.

Edit: They've edited it to make it seem like a minor misunderstanding, but their edits included deleting the bit about Vidal being a Nazi commander and pretending they never said that, which is just dishonest.&&It still has nothing to do with Nazis.&&What nazi advances were there to consolidate in late 30s/early 40s Spain?&&I think you make a good point. Fascism is a very fluid and often self-contradictory ideology that is more concerned with justifying the personal power of the fascist then with any actual commitment to an ideology. This was true under Franco, and it was true under Hitler. 

However, this article, in its original form, seemed to be making the claim that,  like France, Spain had been considered by Germany, not simply using Nazi as a catchall for fascist. &&True, that’s one unfortunate side effect of murdering a guy’s son in cold blood right in front of his face. He’s probably going to want to get revenge and kill you too at some point. Can’t take that risk! Smart move, Captain. &&Nailed it. He even once said about Crimson Peak that no one was really calling for gothic romance films but he wanted to see more of it, so he made it. &&Just what I was thinking while reading other comments... Also, I recall to have reading something like that somewhere else, but it could be that my mind is making up that&&Sounds like an artist&&I respect GdT because he has demonstrated his immense skill, but chooses not to make a masterpiece every attempt, but making a movie for the sake of movies--it is very pure to me.&&That precisely sums up my reaction as well. It was visually appealing in some spots. Otherwise meh. &&I love the designs of the ghosts&&Watched it with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it.  It wasn’t his best but visually it was another masterpiece.  Classic gothic horror story. &&I think the biggest problem with *Crimson Peak* was that everyone was told it would be a Lovecraftian horror film when it wasn't. It was a gothic horror akin to something Edgar Allan Poe might write where the ghosts are just symbolism but no actual threat to the characters. We were all expecting more, but got something else. Not something less, just something else.&&My biggest issue with Pacific Rim was having so much of the movie be about the drift compatibility of the two main characters. It's like, I don't fucking care about this, I want to see monsters fighting giant robots.

Other than that I loved the movie. I actually really Pacific Rim. &&Don't you remember Mimic? That's his worst film. 

It's funny how it kinda reminds me of what happened with Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Alien Resurrection where a big studio took this acclaimed foreign director and had them helm a horror film about oversized evil bugs.&&I find Shape of Water to be one of the worse movies to be considered good, ever.

Edit: And I really enjoyed Pan’s Labyrinth.&&Oh man I LOVE pacific rim but I also don’t take it seriously on any level at all. At. All. &&I'd need you to watch Cronos with me for me to really like it. I watched it because I'm a GdT nut.&&Pacific Rim was exactly what it set out to be.&&What about Hellboy?&&I wouldnt consider Shape of Water a pans laberynth style movie. Its a straight romance movie&&Would recommend Pan's Labyrinth. It's brutal. &&He also said the pale man represents all institutionalized evil that feeds on the helpless, which is why he is by design pale (white) and a man. If you search ""pale man tweet"" you'll find it pretty easily.  

Edit: I guess I should clarify that I see this comment Del Toro made earlier this year to mean the exact same thing he's saying in the OP, but here are a lot of babies in here taking issue with him ""allegedly changing"" what the meaning of the character was so I was just providing what people are claiming was the change.&&The only time I like authors changing details is like Philip Pullman changing Mrs. Coulter's hair color in the most recent book. He claims that once he saw Nicole Kidman's portrayal in the movie he realized he was wrong and that she should have been a blonde all along.&&Ridley Scott does this too though not to the extent of David Lynch. Villeneuve as well I believe.&&> JK Rowling often crawls out to say something like, “Acktuuuaalllly I wrote Dumbledore to be gay!""

Uh no I believe she was simply asked about his love life years ago and responded ""I always thought of him as being gay.""

Why do I keep seeing redditors misrepresenting this just so they can whine about Rowling?&&Context suggests that that adjective was there to show Hermione's nervousness, not that she was Caucasian.&&That quite about Hermione's white face is about her being scared/nervous. JK's not just randomly dropping her ethnicity in a random sentence in the middle of one of her books. &&>I prefer directors like David Lynch who refuse to explain jack shit about their movies. That way, they not only avoid contradicting themselves, but also force the audience to actually think and draw up their own theories.

Additionally, I think artists can generally explain their feelings and ideas better and in a more full way through their art - when they try to explain them in plain English they can never have nearly the same depth and subtlety. &&Well David Lynch > Del toro &&[deleted]&&The catholic church facilitating facism in the 30s is a contemporary topic?&&The interview is from 2006 but don't let that stop you.&&""...the Pale Man monster represented people burning their nike shoes...""&&I see it as criticism of the Catholic Church as an institution and less of a hatred of actual Catholic laity tbh.&&You know, it never bothers me but yeah, he does rip into Catholic perspectives really often. &&I mean, you can watch movies at their most surface level representation and leave it at that. There's nothing wrong with it. but trying to pretend there's no deeper meaning or subtext to a lot of movies including Del Toro's is just being blatantly stupid.&&Pan's Labyrinth is so full of obvious symbolism it'd be crazy to watch that and think it was all supposed to be taken literally. &&I mean, the Catholic church was a monster when it facilitated fascism in the 30's&&More of a reference than an allegory.&&That was really more his attempt to reconcile the stories of Middle Earth with his Catholicism - Remember, Middle Earth is supposed to be Earth's ancient past.&&The whole Middle Earth series was made for two reasons: for Tolkien to find a use for those new languages he made up, and to reconcile his hardcore Christianity with his love of Norse Mythology. Thus, he does include some Bible references as part of the second reason.&&I seem to remember your mom telling me it represented her son when he wouldn't clean his room. &&The horror! &&Gotcha.&&He makes good movies, but seems like an edgy teen.&&Clearly there's no link between abusive white men and the Catholic Church.

Your comment is stupid.&&Mostly Evangelicals. &&The other side was killing priests and burning churches so of course the Clergy supported the side not trying to kill them.&&Might’ve had something to do with the republicans murdering Catholics where ever they went &&Do you think it had anything to do with the fact that the RCC was against communism?&&Well, that's part of the problem of using terms like ""The Church.""

However, in this particular case, I believe I remain justified in what I was saying as I was responding specifically to Guillermo Del Toro's affirmation , which was spoken from the perspective of Western Fascism, more specifically its Spanish iteration. I will read up on what you've shown me though, it looks interesting. &&Pans is amazing, the shape of water is questionable, IMO.&&Best movie made in the last 50 years I think.&&I'm very excited to see him bring Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark to life.&&I really wish we had gotten his Hobbit movie.&&It’s not just some random romance story. There’s tons of symbolism in regards to the fear of the future and holding on to the past. The use of green representing the old ways of things. They touch on it a few times. Look a bit closer at the movie, it’s not just a beastiality love story. &&Surface level, The Shape of Water is a movie about a woman woman fucking a fish. They might not get Pan’s, but they’ll watch it. &&I more mean critical acclaim than success, a lot of writers I love were saying it was GDT’s best, which I took to mean better than PAN’S, so my hopes were high. I liked it, but not more than PAN’S.&&I’m not though. Quite a few people are pointing out how different The Shape of Water and Pan’s Labyrinth are, but to me they’re both in a similar vein, and contrast more obviously with output like Pacific Rim.

It’s like GDT has two modes. Peak GDT would probably be if the girl from Pan’s Labyrinth piloted a jaeger.&&You mean to tell me The Departed isn't Scorsese's best flick?&&I don't get how you guys can say that when Pan's Labyrinth literally has ""Fascists are fucking bad, and resist authority and tyranny"" written all over it. Like you'd have to be asleep, and wearing earplugs (or not understand Spanish) for that message to not be rammed into your head like a piledriver. 

It's as subtle as SoW and ""Discrimination is horrible.""&&That Zeus guy had a lot of bastards.&&I like the way David Lynch talks about watching films and what he wants people to get out of his: Every person's experience watching a film is unique, and every experience that person has of watching the film will be unique. To take away from that by leading them to think that the response the film inspired in them was somehow wrong is to kill the art present in film, not to promote it.&&

very informative, thank you!&&Ah. Then I was wrong, and I’ll own that.&&They’ve been around for quite some time, even as a media trope &&Neither were gay people when Dumbledore was around, now look.&&Nope it just started now and has only gone on for the last 6 months. &&Nor are they unique to the Catholic Church.&&I think the reference is her saying after the series had completed that Dumbledore was always supposed to be gay, despite having no hints to any sort of sexuality throughout the books, and it seemed like she only said it because homosexuality had become a hot button issue around the time.&&In 2007 she was asked if Dumbledore had ever loved anyone at a Q&A event, and said ""Dumbledore is gay, actually"" and many people on reddit feel she was just tacking it on years after writing the story because it was more acceptable to be openly gay at that time.

[Here's an article on the topic](https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3755544&page=1)&&https://news.avclub.com/j-k-rowling-says-harry-potter-has-jewish-wizards-but-1798275023

Well there’s also stuff like this. If you want Jewish or LGBT characters in the Harry Potter world, that’s great, but write them that way. Dumbledore’s sexuality I can see being hinted at, but the “Jewish wizard” was nothing more than a name whose religion was never revealed until years later by Rowling. It smacks of claiming to have representation without actually writing it. &&I'm going to make a guess and say it's a reference to when she decided to say Dumbledore was gay even though the books make no real reference to it.

https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=3755544&page=1&&It never really came up in the books. She probably had it in her head all along but never saw the point of throwing in a gratuitous love story for a character that didn’t need one, whether gay or straight. &&Dumbledore being gay is the most popular case of this, but she has also said that:

> Lupin's werewolf condition was a metaphor for HIV, Hermione was not necessarily white, that tuition at Hogwarts would have been free, and that Harry Potter would have eventually come around to her stance against boycotting Israel. Basically, it's pretty clear that she has a political agenda, and she's willing to use the Harry Potter universe to push it.

You’re right: I didn’t read the article. Should have. My bad.&&People tend to label all facists as ""Nazis"" because they were the most horrible and powerful of them all. The true facists were Italians followed by Nazis, then Horthy's government and Falangists in Spain + many more puppets during ww2.&&whoa dont bring ye into this&&Pan's Labrynth was not set in the civil war. It was set in 1944. Del Toro describes the historical context of the film here:

>1944 was important because once again the resistance in Spain was fighting on the side of the allies to ensure that the outcome of the second world war would not be in Hitler's favour. They sabotaged the tungsten mines in Galicia in the north of Spain, the main source of material for the building of panzer tanks in Germany. So they were sabotaging these and fighting in France in hopes that after Normandy the allies would turn their gaze upon them and take down Franco. 

Source: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/21/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank

So the rebels in the film were trying to assist the allies and combat hitler as a kind of round about way of challenging Franco - who had already consolidated his victories by that point in time. 

The article should have made this a lot clearer though for people who didn't know. &&None. It was a civil war. They aided franco in supplies. This is dumb.&&Those ghosts were terrifying!

Loved it&&That's the issue with mecha and kaiju shows in the past though, they never had a solid plot. Even the highlights of titles del Toro grew up watching like Godzilla was all about men in monster suits stomping cardboard buildings.

del Toro ultimately succeeded in recreating the stuff he enjoyed watching as a kid, and that unfortunately includes the warts it had.&&What was pretty great about Pacific Rim was that we got plenty of monsters fighting giant robots without it being super blurry or shaky. The thing is, they couldn't make the fights the entire film because it would've been incredibly expensive. There has to be some other stuff to pad out the time and give some weight to the action sequences.&&The drift concept is why that movie is good...&&I mean they made a sequel that was mostly about Kaiju vs. Mech fights that turned out to be pretty shitty.&&You wanted the movie to be stupider?&&Drift compatability was a plot device to force the two lead characters to interact and process their own traumas tongrow as characters.&&They spend so much on that and then the other guy's dad dies so his dad's old partner is like ""Oh you and him were compatible, I was compatible with him, so we're all good."" What. We just spent an entire moving going over with terrible dialogue with how that is not how it works.&&And then there is pacific rim 2 which has no redeeming qualities. &&I thought the characters (besides Charlie Day and Ron Pearlman) were rather boring and should have been as over the top and big as the robots/monsters. Instead I found myself not caring about any of them. But I haven't seen it since it came out so I could be completely wrong. &&I haven't seen Mimic. I guess I probably shouldn't bother. The reviews aren't particularly friendly either...&&You didn't like it? How come? I thought it was quite beautiful. &&I think so too, but I can't articulate what was wrong with it. I really enjoyed it, but it also kind of bored me. And such a crazy story shouldn't have been boring. It's a great film that I would never, ever bother watching again.&&I liked TSOW, but i don't think was the best film of the year.&&It definitely didn't deserve to win Best Picture. It's the first time I ever saw the Academy choose the least expected choice for Best Picture.&&I adore del Toro, but I turned Water off.&&I couldn't believe how mediocre it all was. Not to mention how creepy the relationship was.&&yep. imo, TSoW was not oscar worthy. PR was more enjoyable.&&I agree, and as a fan of movies up and down the spectrum, highbrow to low - it’s something I find very endearing about  Del Toro. He’s got an aesthetic, a cinematic style...but he tells different kids of stories and is completely ok with following his own path, making monster movie popcorn fare as well as bold, heady films that rely on top tier actor performances. Not being solely a studio puppet or difficult, brooding auteur, but his own kind of director.  
To that end, I think Blade 2 is also exactly what it set out to be; is one of the most fun experiences I’ve ever had in a movie theater, and is the far and away best in that trilogy. The creature creation / execution is on par with Carpenter’s The Thing.&&I like Hellboy a lot, but if I was making a list of my fifty favorite films I probably wouldn't really consider Hellboy, while Pan's Labyrinth and Devil's Backbone would be definite contenders. &&Yeah this guy has no idea of what he's talking about.&&How is that different? Sounds like a more generic description of the catholic church.&&Maybe he wasn't comfortable with a direct confrontation at that time and has since decided it's time to be less vague than ""institutions"".&&I don't see how that's contradictory to the Spanish Catholic Church. They were literally the definition of institutionalised evil. &&Oh so like the Catholic Church in Franco's Spain? Got it.&&To me, you could say it represents both what you said and what OPs article says and it’d be accurate. I kind of see Del Toro saying it represented institutionalized evil that preys on the helpless as a more a vague meaning, while saying the Pale Man represents the Catholic Church essentially helping facilitate fascism is a more specific example of that vague meaning. I could be wrong though.  

One really cool thing about this movie is there’s a few ways most of the big scenes could be interpreted, and I haven’t seen one interpretation that I think is really just wrong. I’ve even seen comparisons of this to Alice in Wonderland and it was convincing.&&Wait, she wasn't supposed to be blonde?? I seem to recall specific passages where he describes her hair in a sort of halo-y or angellic fashion specifically because she's a blonde! Mind blown. Did he go back and revise everything because of that?? I swear I read the books way before that movie ever came out.

Or maybe I'm pulling a Berenstein/Berenstain bears misremembering thing...&&Ridley Scott doesn't talk about fan theories, instead he makes 17 directors cuts and sequels to entertain them.&&Kind of an academic difference, really.

Ultimately JK Rowling failed to actually include diverse representation in her novels, but then - in whatever context - *implied* she did all along. Maybe it was a throwaway response to a question one of the filmmakers asked her about it.....

Buuuuut boy did she ride on the train of good will she got from it. Even if she didn't, it is difficult not to feel a bit incensed at people elevating her voice over actual queer people for doing what amounts to basically nothing.

Though personally my problem with Rowling is more her bourgeois, horseshoe ""Hey far left and far right are equally bad, but I'm still gonna spend way more time implicating the left because they threaten my fortune"" right-wing-enabling wastrel politics.&&It’s a little bit of both, I think. People complained about the lack of Jewish characters and her response was to tweet that Anthony Goldstein was Jewish. It often seems like she wants brownie points for having diverse representation, but since it’s not explicit in the text, it honestly doesn’t count. I prefer Mark Hamill’s response to people wanting to know if Luke Skywalker is gay, which is that if people see themselves in the character, they can interpret Luke how they want. He’s not trying to claim representation, just acknowledging that fans can identify wit a character however they want to.&&That was pretty much the most transparent attempt at garnering goodwill for doing literally nothing that I've ever seen. Rowling totally pulled that out of their ass.&&Obsessive fans turn on the creator of the thing they love all too frequently. See: George RR Martin for another recent example.&&Except someone’s face turning white due to nervousness isn’t something that happens to non white people. &&I'm having difficulty even comparing the two, they're both so unique.&&Fascism is already a theme of the movie though?&&The interview is from 2006.&&To be fair... this movie came out in 2006, with the Catholic pedo scandal in the last few weeks alone you could justify ripping on Catholicism, and that’s not even considering the last 12 years&&Yep. Just like the Sea Valar/god having a trident.  It's deliberately evoking well known mythic motifs to suggest a connection.&&Christianity is a religion mostly developed in Europe. What did you expect most catholic priests to look like? Dark skinned women?
It's possible to interpret art however you want, it doesn't make it a fact.

Are you going to associate them with prodigious science too, since Newton and Galileo were White Christians?

Here's my interpretation of this thread: giant circlejerk.&&Yep, there are a lot of Christians that think Trump is a fucking nut too.  Evangelicals are pretty much his most staunch defenders.  &&Absolutely. It was almost certainly the leading motivation for their support of the fascists. &&'The Church' means the institution; the formal hierarchy. It *is* a single entity for all intents and purposes, and in Spain it *did* support the fascists. &&Shape of Water is brilliant, and like Pan’s Labyrinth has many layers of meaning, but it’s really hard to live up to something as great as Pan’s Labyrinth.&&SoW is heavy handed and lacks subtlety. &&I thought that Shape of Water was a beautifully done forbidden-love story. I see both it and Pan's as peak del Toro, he's just a consistent-ass mofo &&I have yet to see Shape of Water but everyone I know who has seen it has hated it.&&SOW was pretty crap. &&Shape of water is a beautiful movie about loneliness &&Do you know when it comes out? &&You have just made my day, I had no idea about this. &&Wasn't aware of that. Who needs sleep any ways.&&Sorry if it came across as that being my opinion. I was more commenting that from an outside perspective TSOW comes across as a much simpler to digest story. 

You are absolutely right in that it’s much more complex than the simple reduction I stated above. It’s just a lot simpler to view and understand if you don’t want to view it from a more in depth standpoint which appeals to a wider audience. &&I thought the fish character was symbolic of aliens (immigrant aliens)&&Only if the jaeger was an scaled up golden army robot and she was drifting with hellboy.&&As much as I enjoy Pan's Labyrinth and The Shape of Water, Pacific Rim is just pure art. Absolute peak work. Though Golden Army comes in very close behind.

Man, if Pacific Rim had been a movie about forcing children to pilot mechs against horrific giant monsters it would just be NGE. Guillermo could absolutely do an NGE movie but I'm glad he didn't.&&No, it is not.&&You are on a majority Western speaking internet forum. It would be safe to say most people don't speak Spanish outside of select subreddits.&&That Zeus guy shape shifted into a Swan and raped a lady that way.&&Greek Mythology in a Nutshell:

Zeus: I'm going to put my dick in it

Everyone Else: Don't do it

I've very much had to disassociate her art from the artist the past several years. &&The trope existed as far back as the Spanish Civil War, in fact. &&We made jokes about being assaulted by priests as kids in the 80's so...&&You're either missing an /s or you have some relatively recent history about the Catholic Church abusing children that you probably don't want to read. Here's a wiki article about stuff in 2002: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston_sex_abuse_scandal

I wouldn't blame you for not looking it up, it sucks to read about this sorry of thing. Total betrayal of trust on the part of the church. But they've never really been the good guys.&&She’s done the same re: trans individuals.

She’s been revisionist with Snapes background too.  She’s the worst about it.&&Her twitter and Pottermore are rife with ""after the fact"" story ""additions"" that don't actually make any difference to the books at all, but revolve around some social issue.&&/r/suddenlygay&&I mean the characters name is Goldstein. And they're a minor character. I'm pretty sure that there were two Indian girls too but she never explicitly mentioned their religion either. Why would she? The only time christianity reference is Christmas.&&I mean the character was named “Goldstein” though lol&&Same thing with Dumbledore though. Like, now that you tell me he's gay, it does totally make sense and it's absolutely become part of the characterization to me. But you don't get credit for writing a gay character that literally nobody realized was gay and who's sexuality was conveniently always side stepped.

The series was extremely heteronormative. The way Dumbeldore apparent homosexuality was dealt with just proves that point rather than disputing it.&&**Direct link**: https://babe.net/2017/12/15/harry-potters-biggest-fans-say-the-series-is-ruined-for-them-thanks-to-jk-rowlings-troubling-politics-24294

Most Americans seem to think that unless you are wearing an SS uniform and running death camps you can't be a fascist. It's also weird how fascist tendencies are pretty common in US culture and nobody seems to notice (e.g. militarism is mainstream in the US, so is nationalism, the society is racially divided...). E.g. the fact that children pledge alliance to the flag in US school just looks like straight fascism to most Europeans. &&All pieces of shit though&&I stand corrected; thanks for the information, i didn't realise that. The article is still misleading, but less than I thought &&It said the film was set in 1944 after the end of the civil war in the context of WWII occurring on the continent. &&You may think you want to watch 2 hours of men in rubber suits flailing around in a cardboard city, but I guarantee you don't. After 15 minutes it gets a little pointless. 

The human characters are there to set the stakes, supply exposition, and provide you with the cost of the fighting monsters.

In a lot of Kaiju movies this is done in a way that falls pretty flat (for western audiences at least). Invariably there will be an older and respected senior, a bright young man who works for the senior, his beautiful girlfriend, and a kid sidekick. The kid sidekick will advance the plot by ignoring all common sense and endangering himself. The Senior and the Bright Young Man will tell you why it's impossible to beat godzilla, and the beautiful girlfriend will shriek about how Godzilla is now tearing up Shibuya or whatever. 

But there's no tension, the characters are almost never in any real danger, no scenes where they're fleeing a building as Godzilla and the other Monster are crashing through the neighboring city block and knocking over towers. The human element is a failure in traditional kaiju because they're the characters you're supposed to identify with, and nothing interesting happens to them. They have a lot of dialogue about how the army is useless and then 10 minutes before the end of the movie they deus-ex-machina a way to drive the monsters away. 

You want to see a good example of a Kaiju film? Rampage. With The Rock. There aren't a whole lot of fight scenes in it. I don't think two of the monsters ever actually fight each other until the last 20 minutes of the film. Before that it's just humans trying to find and contain the monster threat. But the human characters have reasons to be there, they face danger, they do things and things happen to them. And when the fight scenes between the kaiju happen (And you KNOW the Rock is involved in them) it's the payoff of a lot of tension and build-up, and you're better able to appreciate the potential cost of the fight since you've seen the major characters discussing and reacting to it for the past hour. &&>del Toro ultimately succeeded in recreating the stuff he enjoyed watching as a kid, and that unfortunately includes the warts it had.

Kinda like what the Wachowskis did with Speed Racer. I was a fan of the cartoon too so I loved it but I can see how everyone else thought it was dumb.
&&> del Toro ultimately succeeded in recreating the stuff he enjoyed watching as a kid

That's the issue with nostalgic stuff.

You feel connected to it and enjoy it because at one point you enjoyed something similar..

But it doesn't necessarily make it good. Especially for those that never enjoyed the originals. &&Evangelion is the only one worth a damn... that I know of&&The difference between a serviceable movie and a good movie is what's done in the small moments. Conversations are fine, if they serve plot or character. If you're tuning our everything but a few big set pieces, it's probably better off as a music video than a film.&&BRUH, GET IT ON TIL I DIE GET IT ON TIL I DIE GET IT ON TIL I DIE&&I thought the russian pilots were great, personally&&I saw it as a kid. It was fun. I saw it later, still fun. It's not amazing, but it's a good time.&&I felt it was beyond cliché. I know the value of a well applied, necessary cliché, but this movie had nothing in for me. Maybe acting, the actors did a phenomenal job. But everyhting else, specially dialogue and plot was mediocre. Even scenery was meh, and to know it competed with some awesome movies (3 billboards, Bladerunner and some other great movies) and won is just insulting.&&As a big Del Toro fan, I thought it was beautiful and well-acted, but that's it. It was Del Toro doing his fucked up fairy tale thing, but I didn't think it was as good as past movies. &&I really loved the beginning, the idea of maids in the super secret government facility in the background of what is otherwise a run of the mill monster movie, was pretty clever and charming. I just didn't really enjoy where they went with it. The love story was fine, I felt like it was just a vehicle to put the sex scene on screen for the hell of it, but for what it was I enjoyed it. But there wasn't really anything else. I would have liked the 'normal people watching a crazy cinematic out of this world adventure unfold' theme explored a little more. That is a comedy/horror (depending on the direction you choose to take it) gold mine, but it was pretty much dropped after the first act.&&For me it was the pace. The relationship between her and the monster felt like it developed within the first 20 minutes of the movie.

To be fair though, I didn’t finish the movie. Not because I didn’t like it, but it was late and I had work the next day so I was like, “I’ll just watch it later”. Haven’t gotten around to it yet. &&Yeah but Hellboy would be on my top 50 fun popcorn movies. Perlman slays it&&Ask all the people bitching at Del Toro in this thread, because I don't know&&I mean, Spain was descending into a Russia type scenario that the Catholics in Europe had been fearing of since 1917. The Russian Orthodox Church was almost obliterated by the Communists and 10,000 priests were killed. Two remaining Orthodox priests even asked the Pope for aid, which is like the most desperate move ever. When the Catholics in Spain saw it going a similar route (with many desecrations and murdering of religious), they allied with the only group that could protect them and that was the Fascists.&&You are misremebering things - Mrs Coulter was always described as being dark haired.&&Like that unicorn dream to give evidence to the 'Deckard is a replicant' theory.. &&I've never seen Rowling as a right wing enabler. I'd  be interested as to where that particular criticism comes from.

Given she grew up on a council estate, was a single mother on benefits prior to writing her novels and is a vocal long time supporter of the labour party I've never viewed her as a right wing enabler. &&And to be blunt, given the demographics of England and the setting of the story if Herminone were non-white it would probably be mentioned. 

We know the Asian girl is Asian.

  Hell, Rowling made damn sure we know who the gingers are. 

&&I’ve never seen a green person but I’ve observed envy. Literature sometimes uses metaphor. &&I've seen authors describe non-white people's faces turn white from fear.

Always white authors, and never ones that have been around many non-white people, of course.&&People just want to discredit Del Toro for reasons man!!&&Oh, of course. But he also criticizes other perspectives of Catholicism very often. Like, it makes up at least a chunk of his work.&&I admired a lot of things about SoW, but didn't really love it. It winning Best Picture was a makeup call IMO, and there were many better contenders. &&Sorry but there's not many layers to SoW, and those it has are razor thin.&&The fish sex movie?&&When is Del Toro ever subtle? We're talking about the guy who had most success with a movie about *mecha punching monsters* and a few about *a demon from hell fighting Nazi's* oh and he published a fantasy epic about *Nazi vampires* Pan may be more subtle than those, but it's still pretty heavyhanded in it's symbolism.

Del Toro is the opposite of subtle and I love him for it. I wish more people where as openly Anti-Fascist and in love with childish but epic things. The world would be a better place.&&I'm kind of okay with the lack of subtlety.&&Is that inherently a bad thing?&&You don't know Guillermo if you think his movies are subtle.&&It's inspired by Sirkian melodramas, as well as being a fairy tale.

It’s such a passion project, you can tell he really worked and cared about the script.&&I really loved the Shape of

The characters are great, the production is great and so is the music.&&I loved it! I think it has a different kind of depth than Pan's Labyrinth.

I would argue that it's also a very interesting lense through which to view American culture. &&I see where you’re coming from now. Totally get what you meant. &&Every character in the movie is representative of some aspect of ""The Other,"" contrasted against the point of view of Michael Shannon's character.

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/21/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank

Franco's forces were hunting down rebel groups who were trying to fight the Nazi war effort. It is relevant.

In the intro to the article, before any mention of Pan's Labyrinth it very briefly discusses the Franco regime as it outlines Spanish cinema and its influences. &&People let their knowledge base be influenced by entertainment, and nazis are really the only representation Facism gets

Therefore all facists are nazis&&>the society is racially divided..

I was with you until there. That is in no way unique to the US. It hasn't been that long since the banlieus were last on fire.&&Yeah, the article should have included more detail. &&Ok fair. Still no nazi's.&&Then that makes the article even more terribly researched. &&Personally I feel like the 2014 Godzilla movie did a good job of it. The story worked, not in spite of the humans being useless, but because all they managed to do was screw things up, then barely avoid the consequences of their own m screwups. ""Let them fight"" was like the moral of the story, and even though people didn't like how late they fought in the movie, I feel that just made that final moment when the spikes started lighting up all the more satisfying.

It was the most cohesive and I think if people read some of the smaller details of the movie they would enjoy it more.&&Gundam, Zambot 3, Macross, Dumbine, Five Star Stories and so on and so on.&&You really lost me at scenery being meh. I remember thinking the set design was flawlessly done&&That’s funny, I thought it broke Del Toro’s usual cliche by having a happy ending. I was just waiting for tragedy to happen. I didn’t expect things working out. &&Delicatessen or amile are better versions of what the shape of water was imitating.

I get it he wanted to make a Creature from the Black Lagoon version of Amelie.

But it just didn't grab me either.&&I totally agree. It was incredibly beautiful, satirical, and well thought out and executed. On paper, it is exactly the kind of movie I should love, a passion project from a very talented director. But it fell completely flat for me. I felt there just wasn't enough there there.&&Yeah, I think those are fair criticisms. 

I think a film that plays on ideas of belonging or being an ""outsider"" particularly in regards to love is always going to get pats on the back from the awards. 

I suppose I went in without much in terms of expectations and enjoyed the Amelie feel but with the weird Black Lagoon style story - as /u/hAbadabadoo22 described it. 

I agree with you on acting though. The lead performance was very well done. &&My biggest issue was that the characters were essentially cartoon characters. Michael Shannon's character should have had a mustache so he could have literally twirled it. And the subtext was a blunt as a hammer to the head. I agree with another poster who states that if you want this type of movie, it's better found in a Jean-Pierre Jeunet movie.&&Agreed. All of the technical elements were there. Beautifully shot, acted, set design and everything was great. But other than that it was cliche.

Still enjoyed it overall just on the strength of the performances.&&Holy shit are you me?&&I watched the cast commentary and they all basically just gushed about Guillermo when they weren't talking about Prague.

The Specimen came from GDT's sadness for the fate of the Creature From The Black Lagoon. And he was also very aware of how the Creature and most all other monsters from that era's monster films represented white America's fear of anything that didnt look like them. I think he honed that into the creature and that's why all the main protagonists eventually come to his defense. The Russian, the disabled, the African American, and the homosexual.

There's a lot of politics and shit in those shows, a lot to cram into a 2 hour movie aimed at people who've never seen any of the cartoon.

But when you're working with kids you always get poorer performances.

For instance, there is the protagonist, a shy disabled (mute) girl who can't quite fit in. Her best friend is a gay man who has a side plot involving his struggles being a gay man in society. Her coworker is a black women who also faces issues with society due to the society she is a part of. There is a spy character who wants to do the right thing but has difficulty because of his situation. His plot also ties in with the ""Us. Vs. Them"" sentiment of the era the film takes place in.

And of course, there's the monster, which is the most literal (and is very literal) way of telling the audience that it is wrong to treat people who are different in society as if they are inhuman, since that is literally the plot of the movie.

So yes, the film I think certainly is not nearly as veiled in its attempt to put forward a message (and is occasionally held back as a result), but I think the emotional core, performances, and storytelling really let it ride above that and deliver it's themes and emotional beats with strength.&&My kids started watching it and I, in my usual form, was all “oh hell, what is this bullshit, oh hey GdT, I’ll give it a shot.” Loved it.

Maybe it undermines the point *you* took from the art piece but the point you took from it isn't necessarily the whole encompassing point of the piece. I think being heavy handed can actually be integral to the point of some art.

I always love how Guillermo del Toro loves to play with genre like that. It would've been derivative if he had played the monster movie tropes but every aspect of the film tries to humanize the context of the genre and the actual events of the story itself. For what the movie lacks in subtlety, it more than makes up for in passion and heart. &&If she is your idea of radical I can't imagine how you would describe the alt right.&&That’s pretty much how I treated Star Wars for the last few years that Lucas owned it. &&> She has also found ways to work her politics into the Potter books, retroactively changing them ever since she completed the final book.

Now I actually thinking casting Hermione as black is a great thing! The character is in no way dependent on race. 

Buuuuut In the books Rowling makes a bunch of references to Hermione skin that would only make sense if she were. Like getting ash in her eyes and looking like a panda. 

So I think that the director should get credit for realizing the potential for a non white Hermione, but Rowling herself seems to be trying to claim credit. &&There are a few points where she describes her in language that points to her being white.

As if the 'artist' has just given up on the audiences intelligence and just told them what they should feel, which imo would make it more of a PSA or propaganda at that point.

I do feel like an art piece can be 'a bit heavy handed' or can have some heavy handed aspects, but I'm not sure that I'd consider it art if someone produces a piece that just says something.

I'm just debating because it's fun to think about, you're welcome to disagree or give examples to refute.&&It looks like you responded to u/Troven instead of u/KilgoreTroutJr.  u/Troven never said that it was heavy handed, only that being heavy handed undermines art.&&I was told the fish man hangs dong.

&#x200B;

I have a very strong position that anything that does not appear in the work itself cannot be considered canon, so when fans talk about Dumbledore being gay as being established canon, it bothers me a lot. She said it off-handedly in a Q&A session well after the books had been written.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't give two shits about him being gay. I care about people saying Rowling's post-publication words are the definitive statement on it. I think there's a decent argument to be made that Rowling didn't want to include homosexuality in her books for financial reasons, but after the books were done and sold and made all that money, she didn't care about it anymore.

&#x200B;

She seems like a very lovely lady, and I don't have any problems with her. I agree with her politics from what I've seen, but it is true that she does continuously alter her stories after publication in non-canon-establishing ways (she could put Dumbledore being gay in a book that takes place within the universe and that arguably would establish canon, although I suppose there's an argument that no book can alter the canon of another book, and this does raise the issue of how we ought to really treat series and how long in your series you have to ""update"" previous works before you are retconning rather than informing, etc.).&&Really? Are we talking about the same film? I'm referring to [this fantastic Norwegian effort](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunter).
&&The whole ""animals can't consent"" thing is ridiculous IMO (and I am aware it's an unpopular opinion) - at least, with animals of a certain size and above. If, say, a horse doesn't consent to being fucked by you, believe me, you'll know about it. Even much smaller animals, if they're not restrained, will flee pretty quickly if they don't like what's going on. 

Do I condone doing anything sexual with animals? No. But I certainly don't think practically speaking it makes sense to say they can't consent.&&Sexy monster &&I'm going to link you an [article](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2015/11/against_subtlety_the_case_for_heavy_handedness_in_art.html) on this which I've been reading for the past few minutes, not as a counter to what you're saying but just a point of interest/supplemental to the discussion.

I actually just found it after originally posting my comment and wondering to myself if others had written plenty on the topic or if there were even lists of well received yet heavy-handed works of art, turns out both seem to be true.

I do not agree with the author that ""subtlety sucks"", but I do think our ""obsession with subtlety"" does suck. I believe the author too quickly brushes over one of their defenses of subtlety which is the actual pleasure of seeing through it, *finding* meaning in art can be immensely pleasurable. I think they diminish their argument a bit to dismiss this aspect of art appreciation, after all I think that feeling could be entirely why some people enjoy art, for them subtlety is probably not only good but necessary. To this type of person a puzzle might be more useless if it's already solved than if it's unsolved and unsolvable, so they'd never take issue with a puzzle being too difficult.

I'll say that a lot of art I enjoy, I would describe as heavy-handed. I really appreciate lots of science fiction, fantasy, romance, and horror films/books/games/images that wear their hearts on their sleeves and shows you what they're thinking. I enjoy deeply subtle art as well don't get me wrong here, I just don't see being heavy handed as necessarily bad by any means.

Now though, to your floating of the definition of the word, then it get's interesting. If when we say ""heavy-handed"" we mean that it has been *too* oppressively overbearing, obvious, and unsubtle, then that's an opinion that can be true for you and for me to say something that I think heavy-handed is good no longer makes much sense. If when we say ""heavy-handed"" we mean that it *is* oppressively overbearing, obvious, and unsubtle then both of our statements can be true, you can dislike that aspect of it and I can like that aspect of it. I'm clearly not using the definition that it's taking it *too* far, but rather the definition that it has taken it far. I feel it's important to clarify that, since it could change how we see this issue entirely.

&&I just want to say that after each of both you and the other editors responses you both give great examples and reasons to agree with either perspective.

Could be the color grading combined with the outfits they have to wear from their dads' closets, the weird guy that hits Seth is driving an old car, they're often in 70's era houses etc. its just not what stuff looked like in 2007, at least to me.  

Gives it this weird ""any time"" vibe that really helps it resonate with everybody &&It was pretty relatable. 

IMO, though it is depicting contemporary high school, the characters/vibe/attitudes in American Vandal seem closer to my experience than any other fictional media. 


*-(Also in my 30s)*&&Holy fuck, I'm 36...&&His dance while ""Fuck da police"" plays in the background is amazing.&&Pussies on the pavement, fellas!!&&Right after they bust the party and you see Bill dancing with a drink is my favorite shot in the whole movie.
""I ASSUME YOU ALL HAVE GUNS AND CRACK.""&&Bill hader is great in everything he’s in &&You know Yoda? From Attack of the Clones?&&Bill Hader is great in everything he's in&&Bill hader is great in everything he’s in &&I met the ex at paintball... yeah.... shot ‘er right in the neck &&Bill hader is great in everything he’s in

&&Love when he's dancing alone at the party to some gangsta rap with a beer in his hand. ""Fuck the police, no justice no peace.....""&&Why did you park in the teacher's parking lot..?

.

.

.

I mean, you're not staff....&&#I. KNOW THAT.

.

.

.

...Evan, let’s just go to your house.&&Pussies on the pavement!&&You sing... and you sing good.  My brother came from scarsedale just to be here tonight.  &&Before that scene when Seth gets hit by the car in the parking lot the driver said he looked like a guy named jimmy. It took me a long time to notice that detail. &&Enjoy fucking Jules!&&Jimmy’s brother? The singer?&&The Guess Who&&I love when the guy snorts the coke and then joins in the beat with the quiet ""waah waaaaahhh""&&That's actually The Guess Who&&These eyes...&&Thats a great scene. The guy on coke is so into it lol&&Don’t make this weird, sing.&&Coked out Bernard from The Santa Claus&&And the characters actually look like they're in high school. I know they were all older, but it wasn't the stereotypical cast of 30 year olds dressed to look like teens. 

The movie came out when my friends and I were sort of at that same stage of life where we were all getting ready to move on to college. So not only was it hilarious, but it really struck close to home for me. &&>teens of all ages

Now this is a thinker. &&Check out Eigth Grade for the most realistic depiction of that age I have ever seen. &&Dazed and Confused has to be on that list.&&*kicks ball*

“You’re getting that Seth!”

“No I’m not!” *runs away*

I got in trouble at PE a lot during high school because of this scene lmao&&""That was like 8 years ago asshole"" **&&That's one of my favorite moments. ""Calm down, Greg, it's soccer""

That one moment summed up pretty much every single gym class I've ever taken. We're not at the Olympics, we're playing soccer indoors. Take it down a notch. &&Blew my mind when I recently realized that kid is Dave Franco. &&*eight years ago&&Is this your first rodeo kid?&&http://www.isjonahhillfat.com/&&""I look like Fred Savage from the Wonder Years!""&&I appreciate you using shibboleth&&My mother calls movies shows, so apparently she's a Hollywood insider.&&His raimi trilogy video kind of made him blow up&&This is the first video I've ever seen by him, while I appreciate the content, I don't like how conceited he states some of his opinions.&&I subbed to him after the Junkrat overwatch video and the Nuzlocke series. He puts out A+ stuff&&Yeah I'm glad for him. He makes good content&&He seems like an obnoxious ass. Is he seriously claiming all the films presented in his opening montage are “comedies done poorly”? Step Brothers, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, 40 Yr Old Virgin, Hangover, etc? I’m not a fan of all, but that’s a pretty broad, “edgy” and cynical statement.&&guy is as pretentious as they come. &&I went to an all-dude high school, and I can unequivocally say that Mean Girls is the dude version of Mean Girls. &&Young millennials. My old as is always going to put american pie ahead of it.&&Ya as a sophomore in college in 2008 when this came out, it was super relatable to my high school experience. Obviously a lot of things were really exaggerated but it definitely sent me back to my high school self. I saw it twice in theaters because after I saw it with friends I convinced my sister and her boyfriend they had to come see it with me and they loved it.&&I’d have to rewatch to judge the comedy but the ending, up to Cera and Hill falling asleep does a great job of capturing young male friendship.&&Yeah but most teen movies/rom coms follow this formula. First part is funny, then then tie up can take too long sometimes.&&The middle does drag a bit and isn't as funny, but it does have a good ending. &&Seriously, “I decided to make a positive video today” and then immediately starts shitting on a bunch of other movies.&&I told her what time it was...&&I told her what time it was&&Role models. It always makes me laugh.&&Can't Hardly Wait&&Ferris Bueller's Day Off&&Mean Girls&&Member Eurotrip?&&The story is not about high school (freshman in college), but I feel like Orange County is a pretty solid flick.&&Accepted. maybe I'm just a Jonah Hill fan. But I liked that movie a lot too.&&Dazed and confused not an all out comedy like super bad but still a funny and good movie&&Hot Rod for sure&&Sex Drive&&Fast Times at Ridgemont High&&Road Trip and the American Pies &&I'd like to hear about other similar movies too, there really aren't imo. Europe trip isn't like Superbad, it's too surreal, whereas what I like about Superbad is how it is very realistic for a comedy, most of the things in it can actually happen in real life, the most unrealistic part are the 2 cops, but even that isn't farfetched.&&American Pie&&Pineapple Express and This Is The End are the other two movies written by Seth and Evan that I would consider good.&&Im 20 and adore all the films you listed and im pretty sure i ""get"" them. &&*Coen. Show them some damn respect. /s&&Haha he way he says “ok” at the end of that line is so funny. God I can still hear like all of the lines in this movie I’ve seen it so many times &&Yeah, but, they don’t really show dick going in, which is a major concern for me.&&Ah man that was funny. Gotta watch it again&&Seth: ""Besides, have you ever seen a vagina by itself?"" 

Evan: ""No."" 

Seth: [shakes his head] ""Not for me."" 
&&""Evan, you don't want to get to* college and suck dick at fuckin' pussy.""

Edit: A word&&What about Perfect 10? You know, Perfect 10?&&The package on netflix was funny same sort of humor &&This, the first Hangover and Step Brothers were on repeat when I was in college. When Ed Helms' character is getting lectured by his wife about how his friends are immature and he starts defending them only to have them pull up out front and having Bradley Cooper yell, ""Paging Dr. Faggot."" Pure gold&&2500 came too soon dawg&&That humor is timeless&&My god yes that was so funny! It's his delivery and the whole exchange in the scene that they are talking about it like friends trying to decide what restaurant to go to.&&Can I get 13 beers to go please.&&McLovin were you violating that young girl!? Were you violating that young girl with your penis!?&&McLovin whyyyyyyyyyyyyy&&Seth Rogen low-key gave himself and Bill Hader the best lines. 

“Prepare to get fucked by the long dick of the law.”&&Oh my god it’s in!&&Haha why is this the funniest line for me. Just the way McLovin keeps going on like Evan will 100 percent have his back, and the quick, without even looking at him “fogel, shut the fuck up... and take off the vest, you look like Aladdin.”  From the typically sheepish character. Subtle comedy is fun. &&Better than,”You look like a future pedophile.”&&You chased him across a field of barley? &&And yet, also looks like Pinocchio &&OMG. I always thought he said ""you look like a Latin"" I feel so dumb. But I still thought it was hilarious. &&*Faaaagle....*&&Hell yeah. Was fucking amazing I was awe struck honestly&&It’s a fantastic show.  The type of show it wastook me a while to appreciate but the mix between drama, comedy, and absurdity is great&&Emma Stone's range in that show is amazing&&Super underrated, imo. Hilarious and also feels like it could be a real (2009-ish) high school.

Edit: Also want to add that American Vandal has done a great job of this task more recently.&&The aladdin line fuckin killed me.

Actually most lines in this film was proper laugh out loud for me&&I NEED A RIDE! YOU CANT UN-ARREST ME&&One of my favorites:

""You know how many foods are shaped like dicks?""

""The best kinds""&&I use ""I gotta catch a glimpse of these warlocks"" to the same effect.&&I SHOULD’VE BROUGHT THE VEST&&Chill dude, im boiling some eggs over here.  We got a lotta time to hangout.. Im makin a fuckin *cake*&&I seen'd it &&*Shotgun to the foot.

""Gross.""&&Fogell have you ever actually met someone named Muhammed?&&His line delivery there always gets me.&&God that’s my senior year in a nutshell. 

I just wanted to hang out with my friends. Every class was cooking 101, shop, photography, typing.... 

Every class the teacher had to either tell me or another senior to please leave. &&I will&&YOU FUCKING KILLED HER!&&Hmm. Why has Seth Rogen looked 36 for 10 years&&He was 23 in the 40 Year Old Virgin?

What the eff, he looked 36 in 2005.&&Everyone knows a Jay.&&*BUS WANKERS*&&Canadian here and I think the inbetweeners is one of the greatest shows of all time. Same with movies 1&2. It’s absolutely brilliant &&I’m a senior in high school right now, and for me it is 100% American Vandal.&&Football friends!&&Fast Times at Ridgemont High...&&Meh, Breakfast Club characters were too cool and romanticized.&&As I watched this video, Dazed and Confused immediately came to mind too. 

Both movies are brilliantly funny.&&It's one of the things that helped me relate to the move a lot, actually. There are a lot of suburbs in my area built around the 70s that haven't been updated much since then. Whatever town they're felt a lot more real because it wasn't some sparkling new town full of mcmansions. It was houses that looked like my friends' and run down liquor stores &&I recall reading that they used the WB 70's logo for the intro, so probably intentional.&&They also never specify where they are. IIRC, the license plates/cop cars/high school are all vague and don't lead you to believe that they are in any particular city/state. I figure the only thing we can assume is that they're not in Hawaii based on McLovin's ID.&&It's something I love about movies like Superbad! Movies that feel timeless or not bounded to any specific era. If Superbad took place in 2018 the only real addition would probably be a bigger use of cellphones, if it took place in 1998 it probably just wouldn't have cellphones. And that's it. Some references like Seal might be dated, but the movie isn't a pop culture extravaganza (like Deadpool, which is fun, but the first one already feels dated with some references). 

&#x200B;

The Nolan movie (like Inception, Dark Knight), the Raimi Spider-Man movies or other movies are like that to me, aside from small details, their ""present day"" could span 20, 30 years without feeling extremely dated. &&American Vandal does a great job of capturing the inter-workings of high school drama/rumors/social status etc and what it’s like in high school as a whole.  Superbad focused on the plight of a few characters wading through all of that. &&I love American Vandal and I feel the same way. I'm 36, like seemingly everyone is here haha, and it feels so much like things I remember from school. I think for the most part teenagers are far less varied in personality than adults. Somethings just don't change.&&Oh no, it's the cops.&&The song is actually ""Pork and Beef"" by the Coup. Hilarious scene though.&&Prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law&&SPREAD YOUR SHIT!&&PREPARE TO GET FUCKED BY THE LONG DICK OF THE LAW&&Dont trust the police

No justice no peace

They got me

Face down in the middle of the street&&*don't trust the po-lice*&&I was shocked to find out he helps with South Park that made my year knowing lol &&bill hader is so good that im going to upvote this and your duplicate comment below

bill hader is 2 upvotes good&&Check out Barry on HBO. It’s awesome!&&Loved him in Hot Rod&&Totally worked with that dude- before he was an actor- he’s legit funny irl&&That line kills me every time.&&Bill Hader is great in everything he's in&&Are you guys still picking me up for work?


Are you going to answer me...?&&""Just hold my fucking hand dude""&&My brother came all the way from Scottsdale, Arizona to be here tonight, and you're not gonna sing for him? &&You look like Jimmy's brother man, you totally look like his brother. &&There's a huge difference lol&&Lol I was like...wait...The Who definitely didn't sing These Eyes..&&Okay, I'll start. Roger Daltry?&&That scene gets me every time holy shit &&crrrrrrry every night, for yooooou..&&When he starts crying is the best haha &&That was a great depiction of coke at parties tho&&You want a line of cocaine? YEAAAAAA&&Like a bird.&&I think McLovin was actually in high school. Iirc I read a thing about how his Mom had to ok the sex scene at the end. &&For me it came out when I was about to graduate 8th grade. It was the first R rated movie I saw in a theater (had to buy a ticket for a different movie and sneak into Superbad) and it set all of my expectations for what high school was like. A friend and I took foods as a blow off class, only to find out the teacher was a chef and took it very seriously. Relating high school experiences to Superbad definitely made those 4 years a lot easier for me. &&That's 13-19 isn't it&&Or the middle school episode of Atlanta. That exactly how it was for black kids &&So fucking funny lol. 

&&
Fuckin calm down Seth, it’s soccer lmao&&Fun fact, the ball going perfectly into the walk way of the stadium actually happened by sheer luck and that ended up being the scene they used. It was every bit of the equivalent of a 60 yard goal from where he was standing.&&It's good shit, right Miroki?&& I got stopped by the cops for saying “oh no it’s the cops” when I was walking by them hahah&&That line kills me every time&&People don’t forget!&&Yup. That; and “two weeks in school left gimme a fuckin’ break”&&You just blew my mind. I need to watch the movie again now &&Just like when I realized Joe Truglio plays the creeper dude who hit them with a car&&on that note www.isdmxinjail.com &&It wasn’t just the Raimi trilogy that made him blow up. His original Star Wars TCW video was pretty big.&&Yeah that turns me off immediately, which sucks because I actually agree with a lot of the points he makes in his other videos, but I can't stand the tone. He's also got some needless negativity problems, but that's hardly unusual on YouTube. Some of his videos have really flimsy arguments, too.

It's the same way I feel about moviebob. I agree with him on many points but I just can't handle his condescending, ""over-opinionated fan boy that hates everything"" tone. Lighten the fuck up a little, good lord.&&His videos on Bright and The Cloverfield Paradox are some of the best, funniest things I've ever seen. &&Can't Hardly Wait, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Drive Me Crazy too. 
In my humble, relatively old-ass opinion. &&Pie fucker?&&I definitely feel like both are iconic to me. Born in '89. American Pie was some of the first titties I saw. But Superbad, came out while I was in high school which just makes it a perfectly timed movie in my life - lacked in the titty department though.&&Wow McLovin, great fucking story do you have time to tell it again?&&And if you like Role Models, I Love You Man because that is Paul Rudd at his absolute best to me. &&Love that soundtrack by Wings. You remember that one song? It was like...

*Love take me down to the streets.*&&Fuck you Miss Daisy&&Suck it, reindeer games.&&I'll kick everyone's ass in this room! Also this like JLH at her hottest when going for the girl next door look.&&the girls never came.. THE GIRLS NEVER CAME!&&DUDE! You made out with your sister!&&This isn’t where i parked my car!&&Miami Wise A #1 new show! &&SCOTTY DOESNT KNOW&&Pretty good,... PRETTY DAMN GOOD, LADS!! &&AH!

You better not! &&Ask me about my wiener!&&It's my generation's American Graffiti&&[Watch tha leather, maaannn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zrBwId36OQ). &&No, I wouldn't know anything about your 69' GTO Judge, 455 Big Block, Ram-Air, 4.11 Posi... Somethin' like that? Weird... That thing must have fallen straight from space! Well, good luck with your future ride, spaceman!&&Clark Duke is fucking incredible in that movie&&I am not a teenager, but I feel that American Vandal accurately portrays modern teenagers. The characters, for the most part, behave like normal human beings.&&Blockers just came out this year and, to me, it is the female version of Superbad. Super hilarious, but with a lot of heart. Don't sleep on it!&&Adventureland, more heartfelt but by the same director. About the 80s. 


&&Log Jammin'&&Have you ever seen a vagina by itself?  Not for me.&&I didn’t know that was a problem for you. I need to see the penis going in &&There’s one in the deleted scenes where he says “Have you ever seen a vagina by itself? It’s like a clown on a street at night, it’s alarming.”&&The Iron Chef of pounding vag&&Still remains arguably the best line I've ever heard &&I was in theaters opening night to see this film. That line right there caused the two middle aged women sitting in front of me to walk out. Made it even funnier. What the fuck did they think they were going to see? &&I actually really dug that movie up until they got out of the woods, but the hospital room scenes with Blake Anderson were hilarious.&&Really? I couldn't stand it. But I love Superbad.... what's wrong with me? &&You're about to get fucked by the long dick of law!&&Chicka chicka yeah!&&NEED BACKUP THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD&&The Seth Rogen and Bill Hader dynamic was the best. I wanna see a movie with just those two but I suppose it'd be pretty similar to Super Troopers.&&I'm 35. I'm hearing ""low key"" all the time randomly sprinkled into sentences by the young people. It almost never means what ""low key"" used to mean. Is it just used to add emphasis? &&The delivery of that line is perfect. I laugh out loud every time I hear it.&&Like a naughty Prime Minister.&&I hope they put some hops in it&&best show I've seen in a long time. well written, great acting, Jonah Hill seems kind of off in the first episodes with his acting but that's literally how people with schizophrenia are, very flat affect and monotone voice so I think he did great, and by far one of the most original and well executed plots in any show I've watched.&&Some of the scenes felt like Tim & Eric tampered with a Black Mirror script.&&Have you tried Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency? I have not seen Maniac, so I could be way off. But if you like the weird mix of drama/comedy/absurdity as a concept than boy would you like this. 

&#x200B;

LPT: Do NOT watch this show high.

Edit: just watched Maniac pilot. I Stick to my recommendation. &&Even the throwaway lines were perfectly accurate. Like ""just listen for a second. Jules and her stupid f****** friend came up to me and asked me to buy them alcohol.""

There is NOTHING more high school than putting up with the friend of the girl you like.&&Muhammad is the most common name on Earth, read a fucking book for once. &&yep, the only comedy I've ever gone to see in theatres twice. &&This was always my favorite. Because it doesn't actually make sense, but the meaning is so well portrayed. &&I always say ""let's make a move"" before I start running.&&Fogel take off the vest. You look like Aladdin. &&Safety first.. then teamwork &&You used ta not give a FUCK about discretion. I seent you pull someone jawbone off.&&\* seen't&&It's my cats birthday.&&Have YOU actually met anyone named McLovin?&&He was bitten by a radioactive 36-year old in his twenties&&[deleted]&&Seriously? That’s so crazy.&&He somehow looks younger now.&&Check him out in Donnie Darko, as well as Freaks and Geeks - He looks much younger and yet...still the exact fucking same, if that makes any sense.&&I know 37 Jays. And I've had a trial at West Ham.&&*Ooooooo friend, football friend*&&I'd rather be a bus wanker than drive that yellow piece of shit!&&The first thing I think of, every time that show is mentioned. &&Currently sitting on a bus, ashamed.&&That on Netflix? Is it good?&&I feel like that and 21 Jump Street got the less aggressive vibe that most high schools have now. I graduated 6 years ago but everyone was friendly to other kids, even the weirdest kids had friends, and I never noticed any bullying. Although I was at a huge school in a nice area. Not sure if it would be the same everywhere. 

Edit: also adding that my mom is in education and couldn’t watch American Vandal because it was too much like being at work lol. &&Fast times definitely gets more real than Dazed. Don’t get me wrong I love Dazed, but I feel like fast times touches on some more serious shit and does a good job at it&&Check out the 1968 pre Clockwork Orange Malcolm McDowell in ""If..."" Kinda dark but weirdly hilarious&&It get a bit too aborty for her.&&I never watched Breakfast Club and thought ""yeah, that's just what high school was like"".   I will admit that getting my butt taped with athletic tape was just a happy coincidence. &&It’s more about the idea that kids/young adults should be treated with some respect because they have to deal with a lot of problems at home and school and need a little help and support, yet some kids are treated like garbage by parents and other authority figures.&&When I went to see it in the theater, my friend was wearing his dad's clothes from the 70s. So yeah, felt almost too relatable.&&Pretend he's your lil' sista, with a picta, balla dolla dickta!&&Any time I rewatch this movie I end up just screaming this line around the house for like a week. Just like at the cats, the wife, the mailman, whomever
&&Wait really? &&Bruh checkout Barry on HBO. My fav show of 2018. It’s only 8 episodes (half hours) so you can binge it tomorrow when you’re hungover. 

NoHo Hank is one of my favorite fictional characters EVER. &&My favorite line in the movie. &&You sing. And you sing *good*.&&You fuckin ssSING. And you sing good. &&You do&&When he points at his eyes during the hook still cracks me up. 


**""These eyyes. Are cryin'.""**&&And you brokeeeee it, broke it!&&""broke it....""&&No way man!&&Dude gets one line in the movie and it sticks with you for life &&I think she had to be on set watching the sex scene sinc he was like 15 at the time but like you I don't remember exactly. &&He was. He was in my class and disappeared for a few months to film&&Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s three weeks left in school give me a fucking break.

I’m sorry for cursing.&&I'm white, but going to an inner city school, I felt I could relate more to that episode than anything for my middle school years. The scene where the kid drops yogurt out the window and gets punched, and the importance placed on your clothes, being terrified of being outed as poor because other kids will make fun of you despite basically everyone in school being poor. &&[deleted]&&Greg...Greg needed to calm down. &&Just drilling holes! Fuck it!&&Honestly rewatching a lot of those “older” 2000s comedies and some 90s is really fun now because you recognize a bunch of bigger actors today in smaller roles you might not have noticed them in the first time you watched.&&The serial killer from Too Many Cooks drives a taxi in Anchorman 2&&Huh. Tax evasion. Who knew?&&I think that's the point, though. They get them views. Believe it or not, the Internet has a significant population of insecure, irritable douchebags. &&Have you guys seen Preston? 

Prestooooooooooonneeeeee&&> Can't Hardly Wait

Man, this movie doesn't get nearly the love it deserves. Probably because it came out a year before American Pie and got immediately overshadowed, but it defined the high school comedy for me.&&I feel like Superbad was our American Pie. The only thing was not spawning endless sequels. Watching Superbad in theaters is what I imagine watching American Pie was like for high schoolers at that point in their own lives.&&Jonah Hill is an amazing actor and I love him in so many movies, but sarcastic Jonah Hill is my favorite&&Good one, Jobin&&SLAPPIN DEH BAYSE&&I'll see you then or I'll see you another time!&&That's not a wings song. &&I don't think that's a Wings song. I don't think that's a song at all.&&You white, you Ben Affleck.&&For the last time, I’m not Ben Affleck!&&Me scusi!&&""My baby takes the morning train.""&&The way he sets that up by nonchalantly asking for the guide book absolutely cracks me up.&&[Subtitles] *I’ll drive this truck off a cliff before I ever go back to Berlin*&&I am here to fix deine Kabel. Ja, ich bin expert. &&Super Gay&&Ha ha!  The line is straight up poetry.  Its simplicity makes it effective *yet* paradoxically elegant in a way.&&I didn't know he was in that, might have to check it out now.

When I saw that eggplant emoji as the title before I thought it was just some stupid CW drama.&&Nothing, the package was an awful movie.&&He was Jewish! An odd crime for a Jew to commit. Ok, so we have an African Jew wearing a hoodie...&&Oh no, it’s the cops!&&I'm assuming you all have guns and crack!&&It’s basically a synonym for ‘sneaky’, but without the the negative connotation. Kind of like ‘on the down low’ (as in, Rogen sneakily saved the best lines for himself and Hader even though they’re only supporting characters), but it was mostly a joke, everyone has great lines. &&Mine is ""people don't forget!""&&Ignorant Yank here. What?&&Under appreciated comment of the day, I got you bro&&You can tell by the hops &&I spend like the first several episodes not understanding what was happening, and I still watched it anyway, which is a testament to how good it was.&&Absolutely! like dr. moramoto in the office, the orientation video they watched, the sex video game, all of those and more. totally felt like a modernized aesthetic of the 80s and 90s&&""Gotta to catch a glimpse of these warlocks"" always stuck with me..&&You can say fuck.&&""Fogel have you ever met anyone named Muhammad?""

""Have you ever met anyone named McLovin?""

""No that's why it's a dumb fucking name!""

""Yours would be too...if you were a man""

&&This is my go to quote! &&huhhuhhuhhuhhuhhuh&&Man, I was in eighth grade when that movie came out and didn’t really know how old people were. It’s so weird to think that now I’m currently older than his character in that movie.&&Knocked Up is one of my favorite comedies, and i think a lot of the stuff this guy points out about Superbad can also be said for Knocked Up.

&#x200B;

This joke now carries a whole new level of hilarious.

I'd say it's, like Superbad, a perfect storm of the perfect minds and performers necessary for something like this to reach its full potential.

Even from a procedural perspective, it's legit better than some of the actual crime docs I've seen and caught myself several times marveling at the fantastic level of detail, both narratively and comedically.

I've actually been dragging my feet to watch season 2 because I can't imagine it being any where near as good as the first.

Don't sleep on this one. &&I loved it. It found the perfect middle-ground between documentary and parody without ever laying either one of those things on too thick.&&More so about how kids feel the need to stereotype people into one group and one group only. &&To this day I still have no idea what this means.&&I AM THE LAW&&This is my favorite line in the whole movie. It's just so fucking random and nonsensical and bill hader is the perfect guy to deliver it. Perfection. &&One of my favorite videos on the internet https://youtu.be/oYOc482SgHw&&im way ahead of you man

The movie is ass, ok.  But holy shit, Scarlett Johanson is the dudes sister in that movie. I was like wtf&&In a similar vein, Jonah Hill is the hippy kid from 40 Year Old Virgin that wanted to buy the cool shoes from the EBay shop. It’s great listening to the directors commentary in that scene because they mention how much they love this kid doing some ab libbing and that they think he’s going to go places.

Edit: Removed who to help :)&&Ainz-sama?!&&This is...a really cool poster. &&[Trailer for who haven't seen it](https://youtu.be/USPd0vX2sdc)&&ah, not the Overlord I was thinking of&&I expected a giant skeleton pretty skilled in enchantments, dark magic and necromancy.&&I read the credits and thought, ""Billy Ray Cyrus is a screenwriter???""&&Call of Duty Nazi Zombies:The Movie.&&So, is this going to be a cloverfield film or what?&&I guess this is gonna be the Wolfenstein movie then. &&All hail Lord Ains Ool Gown. &&I worked on this poster.

&&#NotMyOverlord

Ainz Ooal Gown is the true Overlord.&&Not to be confused with overlord the anime/manga/novel series.&&I am very excited to see this, purely for the sake of seeing something new and original. &&thought this was the anime for a second&&I don't see Ainz-sama&&Goddamn it I thought Ainz-sama had finally made it to the big screen. ALL PRAISE AINZ OOAL GOWN.&&Ainz Ooal Gown banzai!&&Totally thought this was a movie for the anime and got really disappointed :(&&I have to assume this has nothing to do with a king who summons goblins and demons or a story about a japanese man getting sent to another world as his MMO lich character. &&Ains-sama!!!!&&*Spawn more overlords.*&&The clear problem with this poster is that I can’t see the words ‘Iain De Caestecker’ in any sort of prominent position. For shame.

Watches trailer 

Or that. That's cool too &&I just can’t get hyped for this — would love for it to be great but thought the trailer was severely underwhelming. &&Was so excited for a new ww2 movie... then realized its jj abrams.. Hard passss&&Can't wait for the lens flares!!&&For a second i was thinking about the anime Overlord&&Oh...this isn't about the anime.&&With Abrams involved, you know the first and second acts will have some great setups...&&If this doesn't have a stupidly-overpowered lich destroying everything in sight regardless of whether it's needed or not, then I'm not watching it.&&If this movie is just COD zombies: the movie and dumb fun then I am perfectly fine with it&&This movie is going to be terrible.&&The glory of Ainz Ool Gown will be known throughout the land!&&I just want more Nazi Occult in my Nazi movies, is that too much to ask???&&Love the art, but the title font just doesn't fit in right.&&this is how you fucking do posters&&Yes because the actual operation Overloard was too boring, so let's add some bullshit monsters.
&&I thought they were making a live action of the anime.... &&There's so many amazing and real WWII stories Hollywood can draw upon, they don't need to make up fictional monsters for a war movie. &&Hey. You know what historical event that could use a little more terrifying horrors to make it more interesting? World War II obviously. Its so vanilla for 2018 without any interdimensional hell demons or something. &&Oh my god, people in the comments weren't trolling. The movie really is about nazi zombies. That's just so fucking stupid man.&&Not the overlord I was hoping for, but looks interesting nonetheless.&&Spawn more overlords&&Can't wait for John Boyega to provide us with a nice little dose of interracial sexual tension while playing the confused black man with altruistic values who's been thrust into a situation much bigger than himself and completely out of his control which he must overcome to survive and defeat a greater evil than he originally realized he was up against...

Again.&&My weeb ass automatically thought this was about the Overlord anime 👀&&Not a fan of the title tbh. Overlord was obviously the name of the real life operation so some might not be expecting the sci-fi angle. &&Oh yes! Finally some Ainz Ooal Gown movie coming out and......wait.  
Oh, WWII. Still watch it though.&&Huh, that's not exactly what I was expecting. I'm not sure if this movie is going to be terrible or a cult classic.&&> On the eve of D-Day during World War II, American paratroopers, who are caught behind enemy lines after their plane crashes on a mission to destroy a German Radio Tower in a small town outside of Normandy. 

Damnit Paramount, learn to write full sentences. I had to read that three times to be sure it wasn't me. &&Is this the movie linked to Cloverfield or am I thinking of something else?&&That first sentence is horrible and seemingly incomplete. 

Edit: First sentence is fixed now :)&&[deleted]&&So are they Nazi Zombies? Nazi Super Soldiers gone wrong? Nazi experiment to combine soldiers with the denizens of Hell?&&It sounds like a WWII version of ""Dog Soldiers"". I'm **so** in!&&Sounds like treyarch zombies&&A Bridge Too Far meets Dawn of the Dead, literally?&&Damn i was excited to see a movie about the 101st airborne like band of brothers, about operation overlord, etc. 

This kind of sounds like a cheesy WW2 horror film...violent creatures that are a result of a secret nazi experiment? meh. &&Well that took a turn. I'm in&&So...it's just like ""Frankenstein's Army"" or ""Worst Case Scenario""?&&Season 3 isn't even over yet and we are already getting a movie?! What a time to be undead!!!&&I pray that there are no fools who do not know of our objective!&&SASUGA&&A I N Z O O A L G O A N&&As long as there's more than 5000 paratroopers, they should be okay.&&I got this reference! Just started watching this weekend too&&Glad I'm not the only one who thought of our lord ainz ooal gown&&Momon saá-n&&Papa Bones.&&This must be part of his 10000 year plan for the Sorcerer Kingdom! Sadly foolish ones such as us cannot hope to fathom the infinite wisdom of such a Supreme Being.&&Punish me bone daddy.&&Haha, I saw the poster and I was like wait what? They're making a movie?!&&Came for this &&Lol that’s what I came here to find out, is this the anime or some actual life shit &&MOMONGA-SAMA!!&&Finally got caught up, are these the blood ""splat"" you light novel boys speak of?&&A movie on the true Overlord would be great&&[KOTAE WA DOKO AYEEAYYEEE AYY](https://youtu.be/jMoVmSV4yA8)&&Its Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown you filth. Humans have no right to call him Ainz-sama. &&God damnit I was so hyped from the name alone. I am now infinitely full of disappoint. 

Even in the traditionally less anime subreddit of r/movies, I cannot escape anime. Such is life.&&One True Overlord!&&Er.. woof&&Any of you nerds know if the LN is any good? &&SASUGA AINZ-SAMA&&Next week can't arrive soon enough!&&I’m glad I’m not the only one who spends too much time on r/Anime and took a minute to realize what I was looking at&&I like how subtle it is. You don't really see the paratroopers until you notice the plane, then the whole thing suddenly jumps out at you. Very well done!&&Amazing poster!  The dual purpose of blood splatters and paratroopers is genius. A starkly contrasted minimalist piece that captures the elements of the film without saying anything else. It really works with JJ's style of mystery box storytelling and advertising because it catches the attention of someone who doesn't know about the film and might get them to look into it.


Edit: I forgot to mention the stylized gothic font, which recreates the aesthetic of the classic Nazi propaganda posters.


Even the credits work really well. Being a simple sans serif text in that perfect neutral grey beside the imposing black gothic letters and on the ""pure"" white background makes them fade into the background of the piece.&&Looks a lot better than I thought it would. Always wanted a Wolfenstein movie.&&Dang, looks like the trailer shows a lot though&&Holy shit looks insane!! Also Iain De Caestecker aka Fitz!! Okay I'm in.&&Looks like the perfect setting to introduce BJ Blackowitz.&&I  can't figure out the tone of this movie with hells bells playing in the trailer.  Campy horror? &&It’s Nazi Zombies the movie. &&Terrible song choice. Makes the tone all over the place. &&I guess the US army is desegregated in the wacky Nazi mad scientist timeline.&&It looks good honestly, but im getting tone whiplash from the soundtrack.&&Did I see Fitz from AoS&&r/TitlesIFellFor&&Personally thought of the video game series. What was your thought?? &&S-S-SPAWN MORE OVERLORDS.&&SASUGA AINZ-SAMA&&I thought it was the anime for a second&&Spawn more overlords.&&SAGUSA AINS SAMA&&I still don't know if its him or not&&Billy Ray is one of my favorite screenwriters and virtually anytime I tell somebody that I have to clarify.&&Where's the mystery box, JJ?&&I'm getting that vibe too&&No, and if it is, we'll see the reveal in the film itself since they keep denying it&&A Quiet Place is the best Cloverfield film&&That made me exhale stronger than usual. Asking the real questions here. I would say since it looks like a decent movie, no. &&No, Abrams confirmed that this movie stands alone.&&I'll say it's Cloverfield bc it's jj + bad robot  &they said it was going to be a ww2 movie that comes out at the end on this year&&Yep, this is the unofficial Wolfenstein movie we were all waiting for.&&I thought so too. Until they scrapped any shred of paranormal occult doings and turned it into lame zombie experiments.

If I wanted wacky experiments, I'd watch Frankenstein's Army, which is equal parts creepy, shlocky, and just plain fun, without the loaded pretension if it being a JJ Damon Whatever Production.&&P A P A B O N E S&&Thanks for doing some analog-ish stuff. &&Is the Wolfenstein font intentional?&&That’s dope!&&Cash Shop Daddy&&*Papi!?*&&I love it though&&Amen&&That we know of.&&Operation overlord was the military name of d-day and the things that went with it. &&>something new and original.

It's just Wolfenstein as made by JJ my dude.&&Live action Shallchair? Not this lifetime.&&Sasuga Ainz Sama&&I imagine Hollywood botching it and making Ainz into Skeletor to make it pg13.&&like madhouse would spend the money....

God so many moments ruined by bad CG and cheap budget. Show gets 3 seasons and they still cheap out. &&Don't be disappointed. Live action anime from Hollywood are shit&&I thought it was for the video game &&They're just worried having his name on there would overshadow everyone else.&&It's actually getting a theatrical release so that's at least one more level of confidence than the studio had with Paradox.&&Hey, I had fun with Paradox.&&I understood that reference.&&And then noooo payoff.&&Not enough people appreciate these type of movies.&&Every movie needs more Bone Daddy-sama xD&&Yeah, that's the exact reaction I had when I first saw the trailer.  


""Oh cool, A WW2 movie! Looks pretty good too.... wait a minute, is this turning into a horror movie? Hang on, is that a zombie? Is this a Wolfenstein movie?""&&Sounds a bit like Predator set in WWII Europe.&&They write ""creatures"" though I am sure you can make an argument for humans who have been ""worked"" on.. that was my take at least from the trailer.&&> I'm not sure if this movie is going to be terrible or a cult classic.

""From producer J.J. Abrams""

Draw your own conclusion.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USPd0vX2sdc

I'm going with a little of each?  Production value looks worth seeing, even if it's waaaay too much HDR&&> I'm not sure if this movie is going to be terrible or a cult classic.

What's the difference?&&It's produced by JJ Abrams, so we'll get a solid premise, interesting world lore, and absolutely no payoff after investing in it.&&YOU CANT JUST END ON AN APPOSITIVE HOLY SHIT&&It was heavily implied to be linked to Cloverfield and pretty much everyone thought that it was, but it ended up not being linked at all (unless there's a last minute fake-out).&&Probably, after the mess that was Cloverfield Paradox they can mix any thing they want inside this Universe.&&It’s not linked at all anymore &&I think it's fixed if you just remove the 'who'.  But yeah, as it is there's no predicate.  &&It's because of the word ""who,"" if they get rid of that it becomes a complete sentence. &&Hellboy made me feel like that at times too&&When I first saw the trailer I immediately wanted a Wolfenstein movie. &&Either way, it's Wolfenstein!&&I just assumed it was Jews and LGBT’s that got venom pumped into their eyeballs and have to get shot the fuck down by American paratroopers. If I’m wrong, that’s just neat-o. If I’m right though, that’s pretty fucked up

If I’m right tho, and they are just victims of Nazi’s I can’t imagine the movie will focus too much on the horror of Camps and will jump straight into the bloodiest. Some colonel or something that they’re monsters made by the Nazis but Nazis weren’t experimented on in WWII, that was just other people. Gonna be a trip anyways&&That was one the the actual good werewolf movies!&&“Come and have a go if you think you’re hard enough!”&&I didn't think anyone else knew that movie. Jesus, it's so cheesy bad-good. Also, Michelle Rodriguez. &&Or WW2 zombonis&&Bridge too far is Market Garden, not Overlord &&More like D-Day of the Dead.&&IKR, after Dunkirk, Fury and Hacksaw Ridge  I’m aching for another WW2 movie/series. Oh well guess it’s time to watch Band of Brothers again, hiyooooooo silverrrrrr&&This is what I legit thought was going down.&&There are two films, just fyi. They're not great, just kind of rehashing the story of each season, they're weird.&&Sasuga Ainz-Sama!&&Fool you wait for the LN not the anime&&Eh?&&SASUGA AINZ-SAMA!

&&Papi...&&*Formerly Nine's Own Goal&&F-Five thousand?!&&M E T A &&It's an actually good version of SAO written by a guy who actually understands role playing, moms, and world building


God i love it &&Read it. Better&&I literally binged all of S1 last night. I begin S2 in an hour.&&Gets me every damn time.&&at least it isn't both, a live action anime movie directed by m night shamalama&&SASUGAAAA AINZ-SAMA&&I thought this was related to that and I was trying to remember when a airplane was introduced

""This isn't GATE""&&iono about everyone else, but I think all 3 opening theme songs have been great for Overlord. &&The LN is awesome&&Its awesome&&Believe it or not I actually only saw the paratroopers, then read this and found the plane!&&I was the opposite. It took me a good second look to realize it was blood splatter and not just silhouettes of a dropzone.&&Feel like such a dumbass with no imagination cause all I see was blood until I red this comment...&&This sounds like it was written by Patrick Bateman. &&But how will I know what the movie is about without seeing giant heads of the stars of the movie on the poster?&&I really love the design, it feels like an instant cult classic poster. I just wish the blood behavior was consistent across the drops, it would have been cool to have seen the parachutes formed from a cast off pattern. &&is this a new copypasta?&&The line “1,000 year wars need 1,000 year soldiers” hooked me. &&The rumors last year were that this was supposed to be part of the Cloverfield ""universe."" Not sure if that's still true or not. &&That's what Bad Robot wants you to think, there's usually a lot more than it seems&&I don't know if I like or dislike that the trailer gives away the twist. Without the twist I wouldn't be interested in the movie, but if I had went to see it anyways and discovered the twist then, I would given the trailer credit for not giving it away.&&Yeah, they totally could have pulled something like From Dusk Till Dawn. &&Fitz and that dude from Playtest (Black Mirror)&&So weird to hear him with an American accent&&Me too. Looks awesome.&&I've been dying to see Iain in something else other than AoS (and the other few things he'salready been in). He's such a phenomenal actor. Hopefully his role is big enough in this movie to really show off his skills.&&I can never not see him as Fitz.  So iconic.  So GOOD.&&This movie why he was absent early in Season 5.&&Blazkowicz?&&Yeah the song makes it feel like it's going to be a comedy or something like a more comedic version of inglorious bastards but the visuals and dialogue don't seem remotely comedic or light hearted. I'd much prefer it if it was more serious based on what I saw. &&Action horror with a dash of Abrams levity.

I don't understand why people don't like trailers for ""serious"" (*hard* quotes in this case) movies that allow themselves to freewheel a little bit. I love that shit. It's part of what keeps me coming back to Abrams pictures.&&yeah the AC/DC ruins the trailer for me&&Yeah I agree it's a bad choice in music. Ruins alot of superhero movies for me too.&&Wasn't that Dead Snow?&&Respectfully disagree. I know exactly what kind of movie this is going to be now and it makes me want to see it even more.&&i think it’s meant to be 1/2 typical WW2 movie and 1/2 horror&&For some reason I still clicked....take it away boys&&[deleted]&&[Overlord, the light novel series](https://i.imgur.com/8QVIxby.jpg)&&the anime prolly, really popular atm (also s3 airing now)&&I thought a new saving private Ryan with a worse cast. &&Can't wait for the sequel, Overseer.&&It’s not https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ray_(screenwriter)

Edit: but now I wonder what would have been &&Breach is great too. Favorite Chris Cooper performance.&&Where is that fun futuristic laser gun?&&I have a $50 bet with my friend that the last shot of the movie will be the Cloverfield monster in a test tube or some shit&&Well 2 of the 3 Cloverfield movies are good, so even if it is, maybe it'll be more 10 Cloverfield and less Paradox. &&The original Cloverfield and Lane were good movies. Paradox was the one that dropped the ball&&[deleted]&&Didn't he also say khan wasn't in star trek &&Where's B.J.?&&Just zombies would be kinda disappointing indeed. &&Confirmation on the scrapping of the occult elements entirely? Just because an element isn't in the trailer doesn't mean it won't be in the movie.&&Like what they did to DOOM. It's almost poetic. &&It’s a high gothic font. Wolfenstein happens to use it as well.&&We and Wolfenstein had similar motives and inspiration. I pulled hundreds of reference images when I first started work on the title. Among them were a handful from that game, but our Overlord title treatment is a completely handcrafted original. We also looked at other typeface styles from that era.

Edit: clarification&&Ya&&Yeah but we’ve never had wolfenstein by JJ Abraham.&&[https://i.imgur.com/fMNsKk3.png](https://i.imgur.com/fMNsKk3.png)&&Can you imagine if they did all this misdirection and then when you go to the theatre you see our glorious  supreme leader? 

##SASUGA AINZ-SAMA&&They'd cast a 16 year old boy as Ainz and make sure everything he did was morally justifiable.&&show got 3 seasons BECAUSE they cheap out, and save on budget for more profit margins.&&What is this story about Paradox?&&I kind of prefer films taking the unique premises of popular games as opposed to movies about the exact game.&&The last Wolfenstein game was like a god damn movie. 8 hours of gameplay and 8 hours of cut scenes.&&Its funny because it's actually a Cloverfield movie&&I have a feeling not many directors dare follow in the footsteps of Saving Private Ryan.&&My dad told me this was his experience watching the first Predator movie back in the 80s.

*""Arnie's fighting Sandinista in Nicaragua? Go kick commie ass Arnie. Wait why are those corpses skinned? Wait why do they have plasma weapons...""*&&When we saw the trailer my husband leaned over to me and said ""so it's Call of Duty Zombies?""

Seems accurate to me.&&Aw, that's sucks. I thought it was a movie completely focused on d-day&&Or it's the exact plot of Frankenstein's Army. Not that anyone saw Frankenstein's Army... not that anyone *should* see Frankenstein's Army.&&Or wolfenstein&&Sounds a lot like Return to Castle Wolfenstein.&&It looks more like Nazi Zombies from waw in the trailer.&&Plot twist: it was actually the Allies who cremated all the people in the concentration camps because the Nazis had infected them with a zombifying virus and it was the only way to prevent their spread.&&A terrible cult classic it is, then.&&Isn't this a Cloverfield movie?&&I'm curious about when people are going to start bitching about how the Army wasn't integrated yet, while ignoring the fact that there also weren't experimental Nazi monsters in WWII. &&> On the eve of D-Day during World War II, American paratroopers~~, who~~ are caught behind enemy lines after their plane crashes on a mission to destroy a German Radio Tower in a small town outside of Normandy.

Fixed&&The temptation to call it ""Cloverlord"" was too much to bear, so they had to rewrite the story.&&Dude it’s totally going to be a cloverfield movie at the end (they just want to keep people surprised)&&A post so nice he said it twice!&&Cloverfield: A Star Wars Story

Star Trek into Clover Field&&mvp&&I honestly don't even think it's bad. I really think it's just good. Being kind of campy doesn't necessarily equate to being so bad it's good. 

The character choices in that movie are actually great. It is not a movie propelled by stupid decisions. I found the characters, dialogue and events that pushed the plot to be very refreshing.&&You mean it's not?..😫 &&You know, from that time.&&-floor guardian niggas everytime Ainz flushes the toilet&&Subarashii!! &&Bone daddy&&[It's finally a tuesday!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/1169e5c27db68d02e58e2baf0dea3a88/tumblr_nskcy1m97C1smyfwvo1_500.png)&&I'm enjoying it.

Comparing it to SAO is silly, they have almost nothing in common.&&SAO is just a bad version of .Hack that got a lot more attention. And had less talking/plot but more action.&&Nobody understands moms these days. &&I watched the anime first, may times already and keeping current with the ongoing season.  


I just started reading the LN over the weekend and I am extremely happy I watched the anime first.  The amount of information the anime unfortunately needed to skip/cut from the story would have disappointed me as well.


I however also have the added bonus of actually being able to picture the scenes from the anime while I read.&&Is there ever an explanation of what's actually happening in game?

I just assumed it's supposed to be a massive unannounced update, that the MC is stuck in and hasn't been populated yet. Basically like FF14 where the game just went through a massive renaissance.

Well there was a three page long massive backstory explaining his motives.

He wasn’t just trying to become undead for more power and stuff.

He came home after playing out late to his mother...’s body.

His mother died from brain cancer and that there was nothing he could do.

Even so, in his sorrow and grief, he convinced himself that he could have saved her if he had come home on time, piling all of the blame upon himself. 

He then sought out necromancy and the eventual goal of being an undead so that he could research the spells necessary to bring his mother back to life (as resurrection spells incinerate those of average ability). 

IIRC all he says is “all the work from the last five years.. is going to be erased in an instant?” Or something to that effect.

You miss SO MUCH of the actual story by watching it. The adaptation is good, but the novel is great because he writes lengthy but INTERESTING backstories, dialogues, and revelations that are so key to appreciating it.

I just watched the most recent episode, having just finished the Emperor arc...

Please, just start reading it. You will appreciate the anime so much more.

I hope more people who watch the anime see this. My eyes were opened when I read the novel. 

It’s unbelievably good.



Oh and P.S. they whiffed the adaptation of the current season. Part of the suspense and twists he uses is exemplified in the Lizardman arc. It isn’t revealed who is going to perpetrate the attack on the Lizardmen, and enhances it so well because you cheer for the Lizardmen, then its revealed that its AOG...

This guy does it better justice than I can.&&ah, shit. I was just going to comment that if you pace yourself you won't have to wait for the final 2 eps of season 3 :P But I don't know if I'd be able to hold back either, season 1 is really strong. &&.... and then killing them.&&Mmo lol&&To be fair he ripped most of it from Dungeons and Dragons... so it wasn't like he made the whole system from scratch.&&.hack//sign in particular.
Although it could just be nostalgia talking but that was the best iteration imho&&Yeah I know that feel.

It's better having a pre made mental image of the main characters running around in your mind than being forced to remember character details and having a fuzzy idea of what happened 

&&I read the novels from the start and they always had character illustrations so there wasn't a problem visualizing the characters&&The implication is that the ""New World"" he's in is not actually part of the game, but is somehow a separate ""real"" world entirely. This world doesn't obey the rules of the game, and the way elements that came from the game adapt to this new world is to a large extent unknown but is generally 'faithful' to their game versions. 

Among other things this forced friendly fire to turn on because there's no realistic equivalent, but somehow magic survived and the NPCs behave according to their backstories. Maybe the Web Novel has a deeper explanation but the LN hasn't gone any deeper yet, except for some vague hints that don't explain much.&&It's pretty much implied that the gods of new world are previous lvl100 players. The 6 gods were likely first and used a world class item to introduce tiered magic, ruining wild magic. The eight Kings of greed were the next, the guild fortress survives till now, that's where platinum dragon Lord sleeps, guarding it's armory. The legendary Heroes were non max players who defeated the demons, implied to be NPC of eight king of greed that gone mad from their masters death.&&But it’s just blood drops!&&FEED ME A STRAY CAT &&""He's NOT KAHN!""&&Um what.  The entire point of paradox was opening up even more  anthology avenues.  You do understand that the paradox is what released monsters and demons throughout the entire timeline in the first plave. The events of Cloverfield 1 hadn't happened until paradox even though it happens before paradox.  Paradox released these things into all of the timelines. &&Me too but I think there's a case to be made for this one. If you just told me or showed me ""It's a movie about operation overlord"" I would've dismissed it instantly as yet another American WW2 movie. But this... this is suddenly interesting.&&Wow, TIL. He was in 22 Jump Street too&&It's me not remembering the character's name correctly after all these years and being too lazy to google.&&Edge of tomorrow turned out alright I think.&&There's an anime adaption that is good as well, maybe try that also (but still definitely try the light novel, it's great).&&Author-kun is sellout, all he does is put ads out for RUNECRAFT™&&Your achy breaky heart?&&Guess what though? Ever since the Cloverfield Paradox was described as being the reason for the events of the original Cloverfield (in the superbowl trailer); the origins of Clover are pretty much whatever you want it to be.


Hurr durr the paradox ripped a hole in space time which means anything could happen anywhere. 

Sucks.&&Today I learned that Jaegermeister is basically Nazi Schnapps.&&*Penetrate Up*&&Penetrate Up&&***Penetrate Up***&&Only the Anime-Only's, since a stupid amount of character building is cut out and a lot of stuff is left very open ended enough to make such claims, that can't entirely be refuted without bring in the source material.

&&There is also the fact that Paradox was not made for the Cloverfield franchise. The movie was bought during production and the Cloverfield elements were added in.&&Not saying they can't be good, but IIRC,  *Rampage* is currently the highest-rated video game film adaptation, sitting at a 53% Rotten Tomatoes score.&&I think the problem is they don't take video game films seriously. Once we have a generation of film makers who respect the source material we may start seeing better film adaptations.

Comic book movies were in a similar place about 20 years ago.&&It’s not a movie, but Netflix’s Castlevania show is pretty damn good. Easily the best video game adaptation I’ve seen.&&I played through mgs2 a couple times. I still have no fucking clue what's going on. M. Night Shyamalan must jizz his pants with all the twists in that fucking game&&You go into those expecting that, though.&&Mgs4 is apparently the worst offender but I never played it.&&Movie Gear Solid indeed.&&Yeah I wasn’t even mad about all the cutscenes and internal monologue with how well it was written&&I don't remember it all, but I believe Overlord started as a legitimate Cloverfield movie. I remember reading about this movie months ago. I know God Particle and The Cellar (or whatever 10 Cloverfield Lane is called) started the way you said&&His universe building is so weak. Fucking follow-up on the first movie. We still have no idea about what happened or why. I guess that's his style, never to flesh out a plot. &&Yeah, I appreciated the effort, but the ""story"" (for lack of a more appropriate term) went from boring to awful. I'm still not entirely sure what is even going on towards the end. The movie is at its best when it's just a narration-less camera navigating a monster-filled labyrinth, and even then it sorta feels derivative of Doom (a movie no one thought would ever be aped). Also, the lack of consideration given to the implications and logistics of shooting a found footage movie during WWII took me right out of it.

I think you can like the movie for what it is, but I won't be recommending it to anyone anytime soon.&&just like most cult exploitation films though, so really it's fitting for the genre&&Agreed. Set and costume design were great, but the rest fell short.

Great movie to laugh at when you’re drunk and/or high with friends though.&&Exactly.&&I know, right? Like it'd be a twist some might see coming but still would be a gut punch. But it would make for a lot of political controversy and imho anything to do with the veracity of the holocaust is better left untouched. &&[deleted]&&Someone needs to pay me to troll the internet for grammatical errors. &&jfc&&I hate you. Good job.&&We just need to make that human dead first.&&S a s u g a&&I give you the honor of explaining it to the other floor guardians&&In that place!!?&&Also that one guy that Solution eats at the beginning of the Shalltear rebellion arc had a long backstory about how his parents sold his sister when he was younger and he would always look for her whenever he got into a new town&&> AOG

Ainz deserves your respect. Type that shit out.&&Man watching that video I'm still so far they axed Rokka no Yuusha.  The theme was fresh and the psychological warfare was totally unexpected in such a setup.&&I'm just glad it started up again. Now it's just going to be added to my weekly watches&&Not just the characters but the scenes as well.&&Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now, you fucking stupid bastard!&&""My name is KHAN""

Aaaah fuck&&I’d argue his lying made the movie better though. &&Right I always forget about that one. But isnt that more inspired than a real adaption? &&I just don’t think it understands &&Yuuup

As such a massive fan of the franchise I just have to ignore any and everything about Paradox.

God, fucking trash.&&Cloverfield: Scapegoat&&Hasn't that been the cloverfield franchise thus far? Cloverfield lane and Paradox were both original movies that were later tweaked to have Cloverfield elements.&&I hope the Tom Clancy’s Division movie will be good. I like Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal. &&Which is a crime. Silent Hill was an enjoyable film which took the core concept and managed to also make the film *feel* like a game. It should be higher!

By feel like a game I mean how after the opening cutscene the character is confronted with one meh monster, runs away, opens some drawers and finds a torch so that they can explore the next area. Fixed camera angles etc...I liked it.&&Warcraft was at least 10% cooler than that on the real tho&&Prince of Persia the Sands of Time was pretty good IMO. Assassins Creed was a pretty fun watch although didn't feel quite as well crafted. Silent Hill and the first few Resident Evils aren't bad as far as most horror movies of their eras go.

Then you have the Angelina Jolie Lara Croft movies, which aren't objectively good movies but are fun to watch if you want to see Angelina's nipples poke through her shirt while she shoots at things for an hour and a half.

And then there's the DOOM movie with The Rock, which like a fine cheese has aged incredibly mouldy and can only be enjoyed by those with an acquired taste for it.

Rampage was actually pretty fun. I liked it and wasn't disappointed at all, it was pretty much exactly what it promised to be.

Then you have stuff like the Pokemon movies and the Final Fantasy movies which are actually pretty good although most of them are straight-to-video.

Halo: Forward Unto Dawn was actually pretty great, and I liked the animated Halo: Legends shorts too. Haven't seen Nightfall though.

But the you have the Hitman movies... I'm just not even going to go there.

But yeah, for the most part video game movies are usually pretty lacklustre to say the least. That being said there is still lots out there that people enjoy.&&Ace Attorney is at 70 iirc but that's Japanese, I'm not sure if you count that.&&A lot of people I knew had no idea Rampage was based on a video game, and went solely because of The Rock and the giant CGI monsters.&&I hope Jordan Vogt-Roberts' take on Metal Gear Solid can change that. I've seen a few interviews with him and the guy seems genuinely like a big fan who respects the source material. Plus he has Kojima's blessings, which must count for something.&&[removed]&&Really? The 1989 Batman movie is unmatched in my opinion.

And were the Christopher Reeves Superman movies sub par? I hope I’m not being blinded by having seen them in my youth. &&It also seems like they choose to make movies about games with either little or bad stories and then wonder what went wrong.&&That’s why I haven’t played any Mgs game without big boss at least we know he’s motivated by revenge and we know what/who he is. Meanwhile after that everything’s just a huge incomprehensible but still amazingly fun mosh pit that’s impossible to understand.&&Basically, the hostile take over of the oil rig in MGS2 was a ""real life"" simulation of the events of MGS1; to test the effectiveness of raising and training soldiers through the use of virtual reality training. Which is conducted by the Illuminati-esque organization that controls the world - the ""la li lu le lo"" AKA ""the Patriots"".

All of the weird crazy shit at the end is caused by the computer virus that you inject into the AI system that was over seeing the experiment.&&Mgs2 is a meta commentary about the fans of the first mgs and hideo kojima's struggle to make a sequel to mgs that lives up to fan expectations. The main story is about recreating the perfect soldier by putting him in an orchestrated operation without his knowledge. It's not a perfect story but it is enjoyably cheesy.&&Paradox explains why Cloverfield.

It's a shitty explanation...but I forced myself to watch it twice.   I'm less mad than I was.&&yeah it _really_ fell apart at the end. but the design of the monsters was really cool and I love the setting of it &&I would say this had a bad enough execution that it actually hindered the effects and fun stuff. For some (probably budget) reason they made it a found footage movie so you can barely see the care and craft that went into the practical effects&&Couldn't get away with it in today's landscape. Sure would be though! &&I'll give you an update for each one you find. Here's the first payment. &&Trawl?&&I look forward to the future where we, as a species, communicate with emojis and abbreviations and nothing else. Like modern day hieroglyphics.
🔥🤘🔥🌶&&A i n z  -  s a m a&&Overlord is where I go for Wholesome moments.&&They changed a lot of details but kept the same basic concept and characters. I wouls still call it an adaptation. &&I remember when this popular and my four shit head nephews would sing ""my achy breaky fart"". They would then proceed to fart for an ungodly amount if time.


Ahhh nostalgia &&> As such a massive fan of the franchise

How does someone become a ""massive fan"" of a franchise like Cloverfield?

To me it seems like there just isn't much there to be a fan of so how do you end up being ""massive fan""?&&Lane is also amazing. John Goodman is perfect at playing a crazy creep. &&Yes but paradox shoehorned the monster parts in. Lane on the other hand mostly just had the IP slapped on.&&Jake looks a ton like my guy on division, so that's cool I guess.&&The difference is that that's less a video game movie and more just a Tom Clancy movie. And those have been done multiple times before.  This should be on par.

(Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, Sum of all Fears, Shadow Recruit. And more.)&&Gyllenhaal is good but even he couldn't make Prince of Persia any good. &&It also retold the story of the first game, but didn't follow it to a t while still keeping the theme and atmosphere *very* Silent Hill. It was and still is exactly what I want from video game movies.&&Same. I never played the games, but I really liked the movie on its own. &&Yeah I was a big fan too, plus it has Sean Bean and he *doesn’t* die.&&Movie was somewhat entertaining yeah. But remember some of the acting being pretty bad. Especially the lady cop.&&The biggest problem with the Warcraft movie was that it seemed to assume the viewer had some exposure to Warcraft lore. It made very little sense as a standalone film. At least thats what it felt like to me, as I was only partially familiar with the lore. I enjoyed it but felt like if I knew less going in I would have been bored and lost.&&I recall one of the Deadspace movies being enjoyable, albeit the downer ending always grates on me.&&Duncan Jones is a huge fan of Warcraft. Look how that turned out...&&High fantasy is frankly just a weird genre that takes a skillset many high fantasy fans don't have to make a good film.

Star Wars, A New Hope. 1977. Unnamed actors. Frankly awful acting from rookies on every wing of the cast. No franchise backing it. Literally by-the-numbers script. Legendarily amazing score. Spawns a legacy franchise still being added to today.

Dune. 1984, 7 years after ANH. A-list actors, including Patrick fucking Stewart. Grade A source material. Fucking *bombs* at the box office.

What makes a high fantasy movie good is still anyone's guess.&&I think part of the problem is that they just retell the game's story in the movie. Anyone who's a fan of the game has already ""seen"" it so there is no excitement. They should take the setting, and make original stories.&&As someone who started with MGS when it first came out and stopped after snake eater I was pretty confused for the longest time but I enjoyed the ride the whole time. 
I very recently watched the edited ""movie"" of 4 whilst playing phantom pain it's blown a lot open and helped me understand a whole lot.  
Since you've played the big boss games I'd recommend playing the solid games just ignore the twin snakes remake though. &&>I haven’t played any Mgs game without big boss

-

>we know what/who he is

[Laughs in Phantom Pain]&&It wasn't just about creating better soldiers, it was about testing how society and the media reacts to the ""worst possible situation,"" which the Patriot AIs had evaluated to be the Shadow Moses Incident. They sought to recreate it for the Selection for Societal Sanity.&&yeah, and someone thought a vaseline smear filter would make it look better too... it sort of makes me wonder who it was on the project that had so much passion to make it almost an incredible nazisploitation movie and who was hoping to be a Sony Pictures executive and fucked it all up&&And a Darmok and Jilad at Tanagra to you too friend.&&You go to the wrong place&&Great question!! There's A LOT that makes Cloverfield a great and interesting movie, as well as the anthology that has followed it a really fascinating film experiment.  Part of that is a familiarity with monster/kaiju movies in a similar vein, but the majority of that is in its fantastic viral marketing, which adds a ton of elements to the story and universe.

To address your other question about how the CF movies share a similar theme: One of my favorite elements about this series (even Paradox, as truly garbage as that movie is) is that the protagonists, like the audience, don't know what is going on around them.  In the original film, they don't know what the monster is, why it's there, etc.  They're just trying to save their friend.  In 10 Cloverfield Lane, a woman wakes up in a bunker and just has to assume there's truth in the apocalypse tale fed to her by (a truly menacing) John Goodman.  And yes, even in Paradox, they don't know what's happened, where they are, or where the Earth went (maybe try checking BEHIND THE SUN IN THE BEGINNING YOU TWATS).  

Point is, though there are only a few films with none to light story elements that are shared, they're interesting and unique movies with a lot of character and personality.  Cloverfield is still unmatched in its method of monster movie storytelling (Shin Godzilla and Trollhunter come close) and is a powerhouse of lore and thrills.  Part of being a massive fan of something relatively small is the constant hope that the creators will return to such an accomplished strategy in a meaningful way.&&Are you saying you can’t be a massive fan of anything short of a trilogy? (Since we’re excluding the paradox bs)&&I wouldn’t call myself a “massive fan” but there are awesome, super intricate ARGs that coincide with the movies.&&Haha and I modelled my character on Jessica Chastain, truly we are visionaries &&There were literally 5 face models in the division &&He looks like all our guys on division lol&&He's an easy guy to look at no homo &&I just finished Jack Ryan, never thought something produced by Michael Bay would be that good.&&SPOILERS

I think he dies in the sequel. Still didn't survive the franchise...&&[deleted]&&#Major Mgs 5 spoilers below 


Now do you remember? Who you are? What you were meant to do? I cheated death, thanks to you. And thanks to you, I've left my mark. You have too. You've written your own history. You're your own man. I'm Big Boss, and you are too. No... he's the two of us together. Where we are today, we built it. This story, this legend; it's ours. We can change the world, and with it, the future. I am you, and you are me. Carry that with you wherever you go. Thank you, my friend. From here on out... you're Big Boss.
-Big boss 

In a way we were big boss he’s not a person but an idea. Not a man but a phantom a demon and to many still a hero. One of the most interesting video game characters in history, I’m sad to see metal gear solid end and sad to see the end of big bosses story the final chapter of the worlds greatest spy mercenary and ultimately the end of the man who sold the world.&&Troll Hunter is still by far my favourite monster movie. It was done so well and wasn't over the top. Just enough. I loved it.&&Nope. I don't have a problem with the massive fan part, but moreso with the ""franchise"" part.

Is there a Cloverfield ""franchise""? I understand that there are two movies with ""cloverfield"" in the title and that they are very loosely connected (Cloverfield Lane was changed, both title and film content, at the last minute to tie-in with the Cloverfield ""universe""). Does that constitute a ""franchise"".

And, moreover, how is it possible to be a ""massive fan"" of such a ""franchise""?&&He did produce A Quiet Place, so what a year he's having! &&God damnit I fuckin loved Troll Hunter. It is easily my favorite foreign film (admittedly, I don't watch a lot of foreign films). 

I also love Trollhunters (the Guillermo del Toro/DreamWorks show), if that matters. Lol&&There are 3 films on the Cloververse.

Snake eyes was also one of the coolest characters in GI Joe. But maybe I’m biased. But really I just really respect actors who don’t need “face time” in the costumes.

this sub is full of dumbasses who don't know anything about action movies. Would you say the same of The Raid? Yeah there's some action movies where you need actors who can put in a legit great performance like let's say Die Hard but if you're making something that's mainly action and not so plot heavy casting stuntmen is a good idea if you want to make sure at least the action is gonna be good.&&Hire recognized actors as Stunt Doubles and this movie would be set&&That's awesome.

Two entirely different skills. My guess is it'll suck.&&So is everyone going to perform their own stunts? It's going to be composed of a bunch of people who look eerily similar to big time actors.&&Good. That IS the category that should be added to the oscars. Better pay for these guys too.&&THIS SOUNDS AWESOME! 
i can't wait!&&So many hallway fights to be had&&I imagine this must be incredibly inspiring for a lot of professional stunt doubles.

I mean, I get why acting and stunts don’t always go hand in hand, but still cool to hear some will be getting he spotlight &&As much as I abhor the name ""Outbreak Z"", I am really really looking forward to what a film with this mix of influences could accomplish.&&So will they get so famous, they need their own stunt guys?
Then those guys will get famous and get a movie then so on..&&I hope Terry Notary gets a part. That guy is grossly underappreciated &&Yo, I'm so late to this thread, so I'm sure this will be unnoticed... but I really hope they have good writers. Great stunts don't matter without good writing. Get those writers locked down so that the stunts can shine.&&I thought zombie movies were out of fashion already :(&&Please cast Zoe Bell! &&So this will be like a porno. Incredible action scenes followed by terrible wooden acting. &&of a renown?&&So basically the acting will be bad&&How long til the academy awards recognize these people? &&I’ve actually wanted to see stunt people get something like his for awhile. Good stuff!&&22K upvotes? Like those weren't bought&&Oh, so the acting will be awful. Got it &&So a zombie movie filled with terrible actors and great stunts? I AM IN!&&Hopefully he picks stunt doubles who are good at acting.

At least better than Steven Seagal or Chuck Norris...&&I thought it was world war z sequel.&&Hell yeah, thats going to be great&&*renowned&&So NOT actors.

This will be straight-to-streaming, I'm sure.&&So the stunts will be great, but the acting terrible?&&I'm just excited to watch and attempt to guess who they stunt perform for based on their general body type and face shape. &&This sounds like an idea that started in r/crazyideas&&This movie has a good chance to be awesome if it's more action than horror.&&Will Danny Trejo be doing the stunts?&&Sounds like a unique idea, but if they really want it to gain traction, they should ditch the horribly generic name. &&I hope they can act &&It sounds like the director is trying to prove a point rather than make the best movie he can. Maybe they should have actors perform the stunts while they're at it... &&no more backflip kicks to the head pls&&Can they act?&&IM IN WOOOOOOO&&That’s great for a blind actor /s&&Holy crap that's a bad idea&&So incredible stunts and choreography... With lackluster acting? Let's hope they CAN act. &&So, what World War Z should have been?

Haven't recovered from the awful sequel yet.&&outbreak prime???&&Good for them. They deserve it. &&If only he could direct the fighting in iron fist.....eesh&&Sounds great! Just... don't use that title.&&**renowned**

""Renown"" is not an adjective.&&Poor stunt actors who craves attention and fame. &&This is some /r/upliftingnews shit&&As long as it doesn't cut every two seconds, I'm down.&&Hallway Z&&I'm a big fan of the Netflix series. I've shown multiple people the hallway fights. But, for some reason, I saw ""Daredevil fight choreographer"" and thought of sea-saws.&&Imagine this film in the style of Hardcore Henry.&&I hope it's profitable. &&I'm sure this will turn out great.

In other news: Has anyone told him that stuntmen can't act?&&I'm cautiously optimistic about this approach.  I really enjoyed Act of Valor where they ended up casting SEALs in all the roles because of their capabilities during action sequences. Their acting abilities were really terrible but the action was awesome.&&As long as it is in no way about zombies it sounds fantastic. An artist's artist's film would be so appreciated when they can guide their craft. &&Directors who transitioned from stunts are usually surprisingly attentive to detail and can do any kind of tongue-in-cheek with a straight face, so I have a good feeling about this. 

As for acting, stuntmen almost universally do some ranging from extras to speaking parts, but they rarely transition to leads and that's, usually, for shame. &&That’s awesome, hopefully the movie turns out great&&Does anyone care that the grammar used in this summary is awful? “ of a renown stunt doubles and performer in its lead no roles”!!! That’s fucking awful.&&Steven s deknight produced daredevil and then Went on to direct Pacific Rim 2.  Look how that turned out. 😑&&Def seeing it. Loved working with stunt doubles, generally, most were easy going, easy to work with and fun. Except one stunt person to director I worked with, that person was a god damn disaster lol&&Sounds like it will be action packed asf&&So do Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, and Jason Statham count as stunt performers?

I kid, even though, yes, they are. I'd love to see this being the next big movement, to get Hollywood to recognise and create a stunts category. &&I'm in.

&&Despite how successful the Netflix show has been when ever I hear about Daredevil on film I think of the movie&&So... great fight scenes but shit acting? I can get behind that.&&There’s a reason they’re the stunt double..&&To all the people who are bothered by the idea that these people can't act:

When you're seeing an action film, aren't you there to see the action? Shouldn't the priority be that the action is well done?

An entire film CAN be carried by this, just look at the Raid, these people were not actors and it worked out just fine.&&I think stunt performers are criminally under appreciated but I don’t really get excited for projects like this. If it’s just gonna be an action extravaganza that’s one thing but just because you can choreograph a fight or be an amazing stunt double doesn’t mean you can direct or act. 

Like everything I’ll judge it on its merits when it’s released but this doesn’t get me saying “this will be awesome” just because I might respect and appreciate the work of those involved in their other roles. &&When will this come directly to Amazon prime?&&Reuben Langdon, Dan Southworth and Johnny Yong Bosch.  

Make it happen.&&I am actually looking forward to see the outcome &&His teeth are HUGE!&&Hell ya!

Fuck yeah man. &&Are you referencing the game or another Dying Light?&&T&&Omg yes! Loved this game.. parkour ftw&&and Ray Bark, from Air Bud&&I appreciate the hell out of them, sincerely, but how bad is the acting going to be? Stuntment and actors have completely different skill sets, and I think it's hubris to assume they'll be just as good as even amateur actors.&&true, but can they act?

Those are two different skills.&&And Zoe Bell&&and Scott Adkins.&&Yea, but if they become a star they are gonna need stunt doubles because it costs too much to have your star actor hurt.&&Most stunt people are terrible actors. That’s why they’re stunt people. There are the rare exceptions but as a rule, it holds.

The first “every actor was a stunt person” movie I can recall was the original Gone in 60 Seconds, which was like a porno with no sex followed by a killer 45 minute car chase.&&Or maybe Ray Park managed to break into acting because he was good at acting, and the other stunt actors that haven't managed to get regular acting roles are bad actors. Just cause one stunt actor is good at regular acting doesn't mean all stunt actors are good at acting.

That said, I'm still gonna check this movie out when it comes to streaming. Acting isn't the be-all end-all of movies, and it will probably have some great action scenes.&&>  the ones that manage to break into acting are usually awesome

You know, maybe there's a good reason behind that. Maybe there's a reason to not direct a movie with no actual actors, only stunt doubles, as the lead roles.&&I ain’t fraid of no ghosts!&&Oh yes, Ray Park has a truly illustrious filmography.&&I hope he gets a non-speaking role. That’d be hilarious.&&He was so good in Heroes

Darth Maul.  Toad.  He's got such a unique style and I thought he was hilarious in Accident Man.  &&its too bad ray park got the lamest role in all of x men history. should have made him gambit or something, hes obviously godly with staffs&&Oh no, not those poor stunt doubles!&&This movie could be good; might depend on what kind of thing they're going for.

There's a whole subgenre of action fighting B-movies from the 80's-90's starring only stuntmen. Most of the time, the acting is awful, but depending on the tone that might not matter. 

Usually the ones who try to get a few serious or sentimental scenes in there are just cringe-inducing. But the self-aware ones, who know that you're there to see cool fight scenes and explosions more than plot, often are very entertaining.&&Don't they get paid more than everyone else below the line though?&&Wasn't Scott Adkins a stuntman before he turned actor ? &&They deserve proper credit for their craft but stunting is very different from acting and you can be an amazing stunt performer without having much skill at acting, and that is fine. As far as recognition, they sure do get more of it, and often more pay than many other film workers and technicians that perform key roles in shooting.

When's the last time you saw public praise for a great Gaffer, key grip, art director etc. So many jobs are more important in shooting than a stunt double. Stunt performers get respect and very high pay to do a job they love. Lacking in public adulation isn't something to be too concerned about. Literally 10x as many people on a film set are just as important and are in relative obscurity and that is perfectly fine. The credits exist for a reason. Anyone who is interested can learn about them. Fanfare isn't necessary to most of these people&&Was it a trend during that time to have flirt-fights in fro t of children? Catwoman did that too&&How does that get worse every time I see it? &&I couldn't even make it through half. That was truly horrible. This scene should be used in film schools as a contrast to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. &&Lemme guess, it's Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner on a seesaw&&I'm glad i'm not alone in that! When I first saw ""Daredevil fight choreographer"" I immediately thought ""I hope OP is referring to the Netflix series and not that weird movie from back in the 2000s"".&&Mmmm, Electric Nachos.&&that was the slowest-moving mock-fu i've ever seen. My 95 year old grandmother could dodge those half kicks.&&before klicking the link i guess it us the stair case scene

edit: i am disapointed&&Haha I totally forgot about that movie! Before I clicked the link I was racking my brain for a horrendous fight scene from the TV show&&My first thought was this, not sure which would be better to watch for 90 minutes 

https://youtu.be/B66feInucFY&&lmao her name is Elecra Nachos. She missed a chance to tell Daredevil that ""It's Nachos business what my name is!"" &&That's so bad&&I love Daredevil but I still can’t not picture electric nachos every time I hear her full name... like nachos in an ad from the 90s with lightning in the background.&&Holy fuck that was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. &&My name is Electric Nachos &&Haha I remember really loving that fight and when I saw the thumbnail I thought, ""Heeyy that's a classic!""

Then I actually watched the video again. *sigh*&&Jesus Christ, I can't believe this is real. I've never bothered watching this movie before because I heard it was bad... But damn. That is **baaaaad.**&&Oh my god. Someone bleach my eyes. That cannot be the actual Daredevil movie. Holy fuck. That’s so terrible. Oh my god. Honestly I am in shock. I heard the movie was bad, but that didn’t even come close to my extremely low expectations. Oh. My. God. &&I couldn't watch more than one episode of daredevil because of the awful fight scenes. The first episode had some scene on a dock and the fighting was just so bad and unrealistic. &&My name is electric nachos&&I've said it before, and I'll keep saying it. I'd have forgiven everything else wrong with Iron Fist, if they'd hired some good fight coordinators and had made it ""the best kung fu tv show"" ever made. They have the money, and it's not like there's a shortage of guys making pennies in comparison to that Netflix money. 

But no, I could have coordinated better fights when I was a teenager doing martial arts twenty years ago.&&Apparently the lead literally had to rehearse for the scenes *that day.* He isn't a stunt man, and since IF doesn't wear a mask using a stunt man was kinda difficult. That show was blah, regardless though &&One of the reasons Daredevil's fight choreography was so good was because the main character's face is obscured during the fight scenes. So instead of having to train an actor fight choreography, they could have stunt performers who've been training with each other for years.&&I tried my best to really like Iron Fist, but it was just so fucking corny. Daredevil is a much better show.&&Iron Fist knows it fucked up the fights in S1. [They are bending over backwards to let everyone know they took it way more seriously in S2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyTuFZ83sP4)&&Want a show with good fight scenes? So good that you can forgive some of its downfalls? Watch ""into the badlands"" best fight scenes on TV,  period.&&God Iron Fist was such a let down I'm honestly surprised they were green lit for a 2nd season &&Iron Fist had such bad fight choreography that it forced me to watch Into The Badlands to make up for it (which I HIGHLY recommend)&&It was definitely a liability that IF didn't wear a mask and they couldn't have a stunt double do the fighting scenes.
&&Danny should have been a zen, positive guy, instead of Gloomy #4.&&I have great news for you. They fucking fixed everything wrong with him in his Luke Cage full episode cameo in the newest Season. Like literally I hated Iron Fist so much for how the writers ruined him+Shit action scenes but in Luke Cage, Danny & Cage raid a drug runner place & its fucking amazing & what Iron Fist should have been like.

Also they made him happy/carefree like he should be instead of a whiny bitch. As a past Iron Fist hater, I highly demand you check out that single episode or scenes on YouTube of it. &&none of those roles you mentioned required much speaking.. its fine if 90% of the role is actually doing stunts.

he was ""great"" as Darth maul, a role with less than 10 lines.. &&I imagine Sam Hargrave would be a good fit. Hes been the stunt double for Chris Evans in the captain america movies and hes been breaking into acting with Atomic Blonde,&&They’re actually making a Snake Eyes spin-off...&&So true about the Superhero actors getting ""FaceTime"". The masks/helmets looks so fucking cool, but they almost always take it off. Just watched Black Panther again and I'm pretty sure anytime T'Challa put on the outfit he would take off the mask intermittently.&&Why not?

That's the same logic behind sending miners up to drill an asteroid instead of training astronauts to use a rock drill.

Oh wait...&&Why have I never heard of this movie? Is it actually any good?&&Most of the mooks in John Wick were stuntmen (buddies of the directors, who were also stuntmen)&&They should hire A list actors to be their stunt performers. It would be hilarious and awesome.&&Actors don't do stunts... And generally stunt performers can't act.&&they should good idea to finish shooting the acting part first then do action part later. since anyone on the set can stunt  
*oww main actor got hurt*  
-hey you  
-me?  
-yea you. youre the hero now&&How dangerous is stunt work?  I know they have only had like one fatality (in the USA) in like a decade, but I imagine they probably have a lot more breaks and other minor injuries.

Edit: My fatality comment was due to only being familiar with the on set death during The Walking Dead.&&I’m sure they know this&&They will use stunt double doubles.   Wait, or is that just a stunt triple?&&Yes! Came here for a Jessie Graff shout out&&Is he a stunt performer? I only know him as Joel Edgerton’s brother who’s also quite talented.&&Most likely. One or two stuntmen as actors is fine, the movie can work around their limited range while still benefiting from their great stunt work. An entire cast of non-actors will be painful.&&This guy co-ordinated the famous one-take fight scene in Daredevil I am pretty sure he will try to top that.&&Most indie are shitty movies.&&Helen Mirren and Danny DeVito&&You’d be shocked! My brother is a stunt double but also an actor ! Lots of actors got their starts as stunts /doubles. 

It is one of the best ways to book hours working on a union (need to get in to the union to become a “real” actor) sets before actually being in the union. Booking those hours is a good way to get to know assistant directors and people who can get you more jobs, thus making it easier to get in the union / climb the ladder. 

There are actually a lot of people who think its total bullshit that there is no award in any (Oscars etc) ceremony for stunt doubles, considering those are the people doing crazy flips off shit while stealing capt americas shield (or whatever) , often times the most used shots of the films for trailers and such. &&[deleted]&&I don't know what a stunt devil is, but now I want it to be a thing&&FYI they're stunt **doubles**. Daredevils are a completely different thing.&&Nope, acting doubles, because, you know&&Did I miss a joke or something?&&Are ya fuckin around? The game is about zombies.&&lol I got scared for a second, thinking I actually typed Ray Bark 😂&&and Ray Shark from Water Pal&&And Jackie Chan&&[deleted]&&Don't kid yourself

It's gonna be bad

It's rare that an actor is able to cross the lines of those skill sets professionally

Directors occasionally try to do novelty casting for one reason or another, and it always

Always

Just reminds everyone why professional actors are professional actors, and not just people off the street

They might get one or two that can do a good job, if they're absolutely lucky&&It is a zombie movie right?

You don't exactly need a ton of range or skill when your movie is consistently in one mood.

Like Keanu (who I love) works when the script fits. This script fits most.&&It could be good if the take a page from The Raid’s book and keep the dialogue/plot intricacies to a minimum and just use a simple set up that showcases the physical talents of the cast. Although with that being said I’m not so sure that it’ll be as easy to disguise bad acting in an English language movie as opposed to subtitled.&&Considering that this poster's best example is Ray Park, who really isn't much of an actor... Yeah, it's gonna be bad.&&70% of acting is in the edit anyway&&Except: when your film focuses on action shouldn't the priority be that they can fight well?

When you go to an action film you in the end want to see good action and the rest, well, how much time should you spend on it?

It worked out perfectly fine for the Raid.&&""Okay, so you can cook... CAN YOU FARM?""""&&But will it be entertaining? That's the question. They ain't trying to win Oscars. As long as their acting is halfway decent, the action will more than likely make up for it.&&Yes! My girl &&Cyril Raffaelli was alright in that Die Hard movie. Dudes got a great stunt reel. &&Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!&&He needs to be cast as Kraven the Hunter...&&Scott was always an actor not a stuntman &&And the Rock. Professional wrestlers are basically stunt men that perform live.&&I was going to mention him too, but couldn't remember if he started out as a stuntman or not. Obviously he's incredible. &&I love him in 30 Rock.&&Tom Cruise&&> Most stunt people are terrible actors

I wouldn't say terrible. From what I've seen, it's not that they're terrible so much as having very limited range. Delivering stirring, inspiring speeches, wooing the female lead, or expressing the depths of despair and regret? Yeah, probably not their forte. Delivering varying shades of panic, excitement, terror, and rage? Seen plenty that can manage that in spades. Strikes me as perfect for a zombie movie.

So long as the casting director knows what they're doing, this could be awesome.&&Darth Maul isn't exactly a great example of acting prowess. It was a role based almost entirely around stunt work. He had like... two lines. Same goes for Toad, who is mostly remembered for Halle Berry's awful one liner about what happens to him when struck by lightning. I'm not sure about his role in Heroes. I recall him being in it, but I've pretty much blocked out everything after season 1. He's an amazing stuntman and choreographer, but I wouldn't cite him as an example of great acting.&&Alexa, play Catwoman Basketball Scene.&&I'm not entirely convinced that that isn't the same playground from both movies. Just that one of them used the see-saws and the other used the basketball court in the background.&&Crouching tiger was truly awesome. First kung fui movie i saw in theatre. The sequel I couldn't make it half way though.&&As soon as the jackets came off I nope'd out. &&Well, it's not the Devil of Hell's Kitchen slamming his way through a hallway full of Russian mooks. :P&&Holy shit. I just remembered that I have never seen that version. Looks like it's for the better.&&""But there weren't any. This makes no sense.""&&Thats was a homeage to *Oldboy*.&&Thanks for posting this. One of my favorite pieces of filmography. I know I can look it up. But it’s nice to see in ze vilde&&Dude as a fucking kid I remember liking it. Watching that scene now, I almost cringed myself inside out. My friend and I.... Fucking paid money to see this. 

Where's my katana, time for seppuku&&EXACTLY. It could have been totally campy like old kung fu movies and people would have devoured it whole. Plus that could lead to the Heroes for Hire dynamic waaaaaaaaay easier than getting super brood boy to lighten the fuck up. Mr. Fist was better in Defenders I think.&&Watch the first 5 minutes of *Into the Badlands* and it is better than any fight scene in IF. IF was so terrible.&&That one scene where Bakuto shows Danny footage of the old Iron Fist beating up the chinese soldiers was the best scene in the whole show. So obviously they're capable of good fights. &&It's not just the coordinators and choreographers, though. John Wick isn't one of the best American fight movies in a while just because they have a bad ass stunt team, it's fucking amaze-balls because Reeves puts in ungodly time and effort to MAKE IT believable. &&The reason none of that happened is because they didn't have the money or time. The schedule was shunted for DD2 and they sent to much of the defenders budget on the first 3 shows. As a result they brought on Scott Buck to get it out as per contract. Unfortunately that makes it some what of a sacrificial lamb.&&[He was learning his choreography 15 min. before shooting](https://www.criticalhit.net/entertainment/iron-fists-finn-jones-learned-shows-fight-choreography-just-15-minutes-scene/)&&Season 2 is out soon, I'm expecting better fights. &&From what I can tell from vaguely skimming internet articles, it was very rushed. Like, lead actor learning the fights 15 minutes before filming, rushed&&Have you watched Into the Badlands?&&Netflix is no longer trying to aggressively grow their market share and prove themselves that they can compete with ""prestige cable"" shows. They pretty much shit out their originals with bare minimum quality and rely on big names or concepts people will binge watch, talk about for a few days, and forget completely. &&I think one of the issues was that the actor didn't have the time to learn any kung-fu or learn anything important about the character, they cast him and then began filming pretty soon after.&&One of the biggest issues is that the actor can't fight. 

Honestly the should have gotten a martial artist for that role. &&If nothing else, that show introduced me to Anderson Paak which I'll always be grateful for.&&Word is season 2 is going to fix that part at the very least.&&I was hoping for a straight camp homage to 70s kung-fu flicks and we got something really fucking weird and not anything close to that. Like you said, the one redeeming quality could have been excellent fight scenes but nope. Can't do that apparently. &&> if they'd hired some good fight coordinators

They got the people form Marco Polo, which were pretty great. It was a schedule/budget/time issue, which comes from the rushed production.&&That just shows they really don't care about the fight choreography at all.&&>  and since IF doesn't wear a mask

This is one of the dumber things the show runners did. In the comics, Iron Fist wears a yellow mask that covers half his face. So it would have been very easy to have a stunt double for all the fight scenes. 

The only reason I can think of that they didn't do it is because it would be too close to the DD costume from Season 1. &&Wasnt that because they rushed it to make room for Defenders? Which my buddy and I have rewritten 3 different ways to make it wayyy better.&&Too bad Iron Fist doesn't normally wear a mask (I do get that he can't wear it all the time). &&I liked Harold and Ward Meachum, feel like they were the survivors in that trainwreck.&&If only they could have casted someone else. It would have A)gotten rid of what's his ass and b) given us anyone else who could maybe do some martial arts.&&I heard he was also making up the scenes there too, not just rehearsing on the day but making it up. Fun fact: the show runner for season 1 of Iron Fist is the same guy who did the last season of Dexter.&&Yeah iirc they mostly used the double for Captain America.&&Reviews for season 2 are mostly positive to mixed, meaning it might actually be good!&&Oh shit. I didnt realize the guy who did Creed and Black Panther was the new SC. I'm even more pumped for Friday. He works really well with Cooglers long take style so we shouldnt get tooooo much quick cutting nonsense &&And this is how I found out IF S2 is coming out in 2 days. I'm in the minority that thought it was great, but I admitted know nothing about the character outside of the series.

I enjoyed it more than JJ or LC. Looking forward to this&&Downfalls? You shut your dirty mouth. &&Banshee imo has the best fight scenes, some of them can rival big budget screen fights too.&&Probably only because they had to in order to make sense of the defenders. They couldn't just write off a main character to the series. That being said I see LC and IF not getting a 3rd season and just combining into H4H. Gotta lower the # of shows anyway to make room for others like Punisher and Moon Knight.&&There's plenty of ways around that using camera angles.&&Also, that’s not his voice as Darth Maul actually.  In episode 1 it’s actually Peter Serafinowicz, the Tick on Amazon or the other Nova corps. guy who isn’t John C. Reilly in Guardians 1.   But, Ray Park was alright in the last season of Heroes.  That show wasn’t great at that point in its life, but Park had a good amount of speaking lines that season.&&He didn't even speak those lines in ANY of Mauls appearances. He was dubbed by another actor in both films and cartoons.&&He had lines in Accident Man and I thought he was fun&&I didn’t remember Darth Maul speaking at all&&It's not great except for the fights. Don't expect anything deep ;)&&Pretty good, not fantastic, but does a few really cool things in terms of fight scenes. Excellent modern kung fu movie.&&But clearly show the A-lister's face doing the stunts, almost like a strange cameo. &&Tom Cruise would 100% be up for this.&&It honestly depends what is in the movie. 

To put it into perspective, there are numerous places Tom Cruise could’ve died if something went wrong in the Mission Impossible series&&Some woman lost an arm and had her face degloved from the last Resident Evil movie.  Someone died doing DP2.  Someone got paralyzed doing The Deathly Hollows, &&[Interesting article](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/18/film-stunt-performers-injuries-deaths-hollywood) from The Guardian after a stunt double was killed on the set of Deadpool 2&&It's definitely dangerous.  Not just speaking of the obvious you could easily be killed stuff, but in the long-term this kind of stuff is EXTREMELY taxing on your body.

  I used to be roommates with this girl who did stunts for major movies.  She was only in her mid 20's and had taken countless blows to the head after only a few years of stunt work.  She also broke like a dozen different bones.  

So while it might be financially lucrative for the amount of years they do it for, they pay for it in the long-run with the long term damage on their bodies.

Obiovusly people are built differently, with different genetics, etc, and some could last a lot longer than others…but ask anyone who works or had worked in major stunt work and they will tell you the same thing.&&2 people died within weeks of each other on different sets last summer,
One was on [The Walking Dead](https://deadline.com/2017/07/walking-dead-stuntman-dead-john-bernecker-on-set-fall-1202128636/) , another was on [Deadpool 2](https://deadline.com/2017/08/deadpool-2-stunt-death-crash-details-investigation-joi-harris-1202152152/)  (although Deadpool was filmed in Canada) and in the same timeframe, [Ike Barinholtz](http://extratv.com/2017/07/26/actor-ike-barinholtz-suffers-broken-neck-after-fall-stunt-went-wrong/) broke his neck.

They should take notes from Jackie.&&can you name any that are recognizable, working actors?

id rather have actors learn to do their own stunts than an entire cast of stunt workers you have to teach to act.

im guessing this will be, at best, CW soap opera-ish acting. &&I don’t know anybody who does stunts for a living personally. &&How many people do you know that do stunts? &&sonofaresiii, OUTBREAK Z will be an ACTION/horror flick. it's not like they need Meryl Streep or Laurence Olivier level actors in the roles. &&Your analogy doesn't really work because chefs aren't getting hired to work as farmers.&&I thought the original B13 movies with David Belle were pretty awesome

But I first remember seeing him in Kiss of the Dragon.  That was a great role.&&He already appeared as some henchman in Dr Strange&&He did stunts for Ryan Reynolds for that shitty Deadpool &&I think you're thinking of Scott Adsit. Totally different person.&&Tom Cruise got so much paper he's billed as a producer.  He can do whatever the fuck he wants.&&And Darth Maul was voiced by Peter Serafinowicz anyway. &&I guess I meant more is fighting style.  Very acrobatic with a lot of aerials and flourishes he does with staff weapons / one time as Toad with a length of rebar he used to fight Storm.  

You're right.  The only acting that I'd every really giving him good marks for is Heroes.&&Oof ouch owie my bones &&Alexa got unplugged two minutes after Google Home arrived&&It's amazing how <movie> Basketball Scene can provide such a different response. Compare ""Catwoman"" Basketball Scene to ""Alien Resurrection Basketball Scene""&&The same diner from Punisher is the same diner from *Goodfellas*. There’s also that conspicuously well lit NY street that shows up from time to time in movies and TV. Hollywood reuses a lot of sets, so I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if you’re right. &&See, that's the scene I was hoping it was.&&mooks...havent heard that word in years...John Woo was the master at throwing mooks at the protagonist.&&I didn't like the show after first couple episodes but by the time I finished season 2 it became second favorite behind punisher. The guy that plays kingpin is awesome at it. &&heh. Staircase fight was best fight&&And well deserved too.  If you have any interest in these fight scenes and you like suspense you owe it to yourself to see *Oldboy*.
&&Danny (Rand, the Immortal Iron Fist, Sworn Enemy of the Hand, Protector of K'un Lun) was so much better in his short Luke Cage s2 appearance.&&> Mr. Fist was better in Defenders I think

And in Luke Cage

At this point they should just merge they two shows into Heroes for Hire. I don't know anyone who was asking for a second season of Iron Fist.&&Iron Fist needed to be like Luke Cage. Where Luke Cage took influence from 70s ""blaxploitation"" movies and subverted them, Iron Fist could've done the same to the martial art movies of that era. 

But no. We got 1 episode of that where Iron Fist took a Hand challenge, but the rest was boring corporate-family drama.&&Yep, and I'll go so far as to say that you, me, and the poster above you have all sat through many movies with some truly terrible campy plots and acting because the fight choreography was so good.

It's like the Iron Fist people completely missed the point.&&Dude, I started watching that last weekend. It is absolutely mind-blowing, and it even looks like most of the actors are pretty capable fighters. Daniel Wu certainly is.&&That damn costume tease...&&John Wick also looks real, and tried to look real. The Marvel shows made no effort to pull of the same thing when half the time they're flipping around. 

&#x200B;

Not that there's anything wrong with flipping around, but it's a different style and a different intent.&&> because Reeves puts in ungodly time and effort to MAKE IT believable.  

Well I mean, he does know Kung Fu.&&I don't disagree that Keanu put in the work on John Wick, but I think he'd be the first one to tell you that his badass trainers and stunt team were every bit as involved in designing action sequences that play to his strengths and what he ""looks good"" doing and can do in a smooth manner that looks badass.&&[removed]&&Ah that’s the million dollar professionalism we expect from big budget Netflix series! That’s more last minute than any of the homework I’ve done in my life&&Any idea of a ballpark date? I lapsed on my Netflix shows after *Defenders* and only just started JJ season 2. Still got season 2 of Luke Cage after that.&&To my knowledge Charlie Cox (Daredevil) is by no means a martial artist and they made him look like a god damned genius, even in the scenes where he isn't wearing a mask..&&It's literally just IF getting knocked around for a little bit until his hand glows. It's a joke&&The reason would be because he wasn't a vigilante, the conflict he dealt with in season 1 was personal. Plus what would a mask do when he told literally everybody who he was?&&Nah they rushed it to make way for DD2. It was originally contacted as 1 season of each followed by defenders. When they saw the success of DD they threw another season out but that left no space for IF. And Defenders was contractually obligated to come out at a set time so they had to rush to catch up.&&Well...that doesn't surprise me in the least. &&he's also a pretty big fan of the actors actually doing the stunts, so that's always a bonus.&&Luke Cage has ridiculous writing, like here's a guy wearing a back pack and is obviously not luke punching a cop but we'll lock Cage up anyway.&&Some of the eating isn't great. But Its not the worst either. I'd guess it's better cause those actors for the most part are doing there own choreography.&&That's why it's such terrible shit. Ever seen Liam Neeson jump a fence?&&Yup. That's why they used so many of them!&&Also lots of quick cuts like in the Cat Woman basketball scene.  You'd never know she couldn't really play.&&Peter Serafinowicz is also the roommate in Shaun of the Dead who's annoyed with Ed. He's also the ""sommelier"" in John Wick 2. He's also the main bad guy in the Pickle Rick episode of Rick and Morty.

Just to name a few more roles people should definitely recognize him (or his voice) from.&&Yeah but his stunts in the cartoons were phenomenal! 👌&&Tom Holland too!&&Jackie Chan has broken a countless amount of bones as well from doing his own stunts. &&In case anyone is wondering what it means for a face to be ~~devolved~~ degloved [autocorrect strikes again], I’m 99.99999% certain it means the skin is removed and I’m 100% certain I am not personally googling it to make sure. Do with that information what you will. &&[Article about the Resident Evil set injury. ](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4130008/Resident-Evil-stunt-woman-reveals-twisted-crash.html)

Her face was not completely degloved like you're probably picturing, unless plastic surgery is incredible. She's just got a bit of scarring, but her back and neck are super fucked up and she did lose an arm. 

Apparently someone else died in that movie as well after they were crushed by an SUV. &&Just checked. Damn, Nash was Ewan McGregor’s stunt double in the prequels.&&If mama ain’t happy, nobody happy!&&*real shit*&&Count me in for the inevitable sequel

I wondered who the heck could possibly be built like The Rock - the answer was, Another Rock.&&It's actually a dialogue heavy movie. Everyone just sits and talks about their feelings. &&[Zoe Bell](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1057928/) is a common one that gets brought up. She is most well known for doing Uma Thurman's stunts in Kill Bill, but I believe she has appeared (often as both an actor and stunt person) in every Tarantino film since. She's also had a decent amount of roles in movies and TV apart from Tarantino, such as having roles in Oblivion and Lost.

Definitely not a huge name, but her frequent work with Tarantino gets her a fair bit of recognition for a stunt person. Two others are the previously mentioned Ray Park and I believe Donnie Yen also started as a stunt person&&Do we count Jackie Chan since he’s better at stunts than acting?&&Ray Park?&&Not 100% relevant to your question, but I'll say Burt Reynolds, although he's not working much/at all now - still has a substantial body of work&&You can still have bad acting in an action/horror movie ruin it and make it a terrible movie.&&It's an old Mitch Hedberg joke, which your comment reminded me of&&District B13 was my intro to Cyril as well, my favorite french flick. And Yeah! one of the blond brothers, holy shit i forgot that was him. &&Haha, so happy to see someone else with the same experience as me.  Recognized him as the guy from kiss of the dragon when I caught some of district b13 on TV one day.&&""Strong Zealot""&&and most of the roles he does take are of the more action oriented type as either a bigger badder henchman, the hero, or the first guy to get shivved by Taylor Kitsch.&&No doubt he's an amazing performer, but most of his big roles rely primarily on stunt work and choreography. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but as far as acting ability goes he's average at best. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just a completely different skill set. I wouldn't expect Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg to be able to act worth a damn either. &&Couldn’t share with the rest of us huh?&&Alexa, don't cry&&[deleted]&&Mooks, twin .45s, and doves.&&THE MONKS TAUGHT ME MOTHERFUCKING PEACE!!!&&I was pretty unimpressed. Do you think they shot all these shows and episodes simultaneously / back to back? It's been over a year since IF S1 but it doesn't look like Finn Jones has spent any more time in a dojo actually learning martial arts. And with the bash lash from the first season I feel like this would have been his personal priority if not one set upon him by the studio... I am suspicious that S1 and S2 were filmed in sequence or at the same time.&&I asked for it, and I am so hyped for this weekend :D&&I liked Iron fist more than both Luke Cage seasons but I understand I'm to be stoned to death for it.&&Daniel Wu was a kung fu/action star in China, so yeah, he's pretty adept at the fighting choreography. Super happy for him getting his own show too. He's pretty great. I think Season 3 was my favorite so far. Seaosn 2 was only OK and took too long to finish. &&[deleted]&&Yes, JW and other great fighting movies (Jackie Chan) use way more wide shots, and it really shows. Most blockbusters these days use loads of close tight shots, cuts, and artificial camera shake to hide the fact that the actors can't fight for real and can't make fake fighting look good. I think it's over the top for no other reason than they cant make the real thing look good. There's no lack of WOW factor when you watch Jackie Chan do a fight, i can't remember the last blockbuster action sequence that i thought was cool. Their obvious fakeness makes them boring. But that's probably me just getting old. &&Except for the scene in the club where one of the guys *waitsvfor him to get up*!! That would **never** happen if you're fighting for your life. Worst part is that the guy had a fun the whole time, I would've popped him when I knocked him down.  &&But the Daredevil fights look real(alistic). The Jessica Jones fights look convincing. And in both cases you can feel the personality of the character through the fighting style. With Danny it looks awkward and fake.&&Show me &&Only because he put in the pre-production time :D&&Absolutely, there's no doubt you need a great team to correctly choreograph and photograph a fight sequence - but it's just as important to have an actor that can successfully sell the physicality of that choreography. Just as the ballet choreographer and the ballet dancer both deserve credit for their rolls. &&From what I gather, Scott Buck has a reputation in the industry for ""salvaging"" projects that are over budget and / or behind schedule. He takes something that won't be at all ready for its scheduled release and gets it out there as cheaply and efficiently as possible. That's why he keeps getting work - the projects he gets called in on are dumpster fires, and he manages to turn them into smouldering piles of rubbish rather than letting them rage out of control. 

That's not to say that his name makes something worth watching - if I see he's attached to a project it automatically becomes a ""watch it *if* it gets glowing reviews, otherwise don't waste my time"" show. But when someone's brought it to a troubled project like that, chances are the outcome isn't going to be incredible. Hence why we consider him being attached to a show a bad thing.

I don't have sources for this, it's just something I've read a few times over the years. &&Friday. &&Yes, this Friday actually!  I'm pretty sure you will want to watch season 2 of Luke Cage first.&&The 7th&&The worst part is that the character is actually supposed to be a martial artist.  So this is the one show where they should really pay attention to good fight scenes.&&The mask doesn't hide his identity. It's a part of the Iron Fist attire if I'm not wrong. &&Yeah and the last I heard Finn Jones was really disappointed because he was brought in so late that he didnt have the time to practice choreography and it ended up being a double for most fights, I thought I heard him in an interview about this season and him actually doing the fight scenes and his excitement.&&The lady who plays Mariah Dillard is soooo unbelievably bad. When she is trying to show emotion she just comes off like she's in a high school play. I can't. &&The show does what it’s supposed to do, it’s perfect. &&Liam Nesson was always more of a comedian to me than an action star.
&&He's also Mild Mannered Pate in Dark Souls 2&&And Keanu&&He's pretty amazing, guess that's part of having such an athletic background as a dancer. &&Degloved*.

I've only heard it in reference to hands (ie, the skin of the hand is stripped away) but I am 99.99999% certain it can happen to any part of the body with lots of motion muscles (like the face). Like you, I am 100% certain I am not personally googling it to make sure.&&The medical term is just as horrendous sounding, ""avulsion""&&I highly recommend Nash and Joel’s short Spider.

(The other two best things in Death Proof are the lap dance and Kurt Russell.) I would watch a Zoe Bell headlined movie in a heartbeat.&&I was excited when she appeared as one of the crew of the boat in *LOST* but they didn't use her for much.&&The girl in the red bandana&&His most notable role is one where he was covered in paint, rarely emoted, and all the dialogue was replaced with someone else’s voice. 

Great stunts, but his acting resume isn’t particularly noteworthy. &&He said ones that are recognizable &&I can only think of one, the 13:17 to Paris. I feel like stunt workers will be better than straight up random people. Keanu Reeves is not a good actor, but he's fantastic in the Matrix, Constantine, John Wick, and they honestly have a lot more nuance in them than most action movies. 

If they get a talented choreographer who can capitalize on what the stunt doubles can all do, it really won't matter, especially if they write the story expecting it. &&Ah okay. I haven't heard that one. Carry on then.&&I'd for sure rather watch him fight than act&&Alexa, this is so sad, play des-oh wait &&Your comment doesn’t make much sense as a response to the previous one, but I fervently agree with all of your unnecessary points, so I’m upvoting anyways &&> Iron Fist was a mess, and I hope they turn that around, because I think it could be really cool.

The cameo the Immortal Iron Fist made in Luke Cage S02 gives me hope for Iron Fist S02. He was more mature, zen, and mastered his powers. If they shitcan the horrible showrunner, get rid of the goofy supporting characters (Meachum twins), and tell us wtf the Rand Corporation actually does, then it might be a turnaround.&&I loved season 1 of Daredevil. Then I watched Jessica Jones s1. I don't know exactly what happened but nothing else held a candle. I barely finished Iron fist s1. I couldn't finish Luke Cage s1 because as much as I wanted to love it, I didn't. I ended up watching The Defenders despite the unfinished seasons of the other characters solely for more JJ. I still haven't started The Punisher.  
  
Jessica Jones was so great to me.&&This is like every reddit comment about the Netflix MCU. &&Good action, great villain.&&Fight wise, yeah he could still use some work. Personality wise, it was a drastic improvement. He wasn’t nearly as annoying as S1. He was chill and it played off of Luke’s seriousness pretty well.&&[deleted]&&The thing I liked the most about Iron Fist was the Rand/Meachum plot, Ward Meachum completely stole the show.  
The same way Shades stole the show in both season of Luke Cage  
  
That said Danny was extremely boring and unlikeable in IF S01 his short appearance in Luke Cage was better than everything we'd seen from him in Iron Fist.  
  
&&Yeah, that's what I learned after pausing in disbelief halfway through the episode to look up if the actors were actually doing the stunts. The quality of the martial arts and stunts is truly impressive, and it only helps being paired with a good premise and good acting.&&I grew up watching Jackie Chan and love his movies but I don’t really know what to do with the idea that they’re similar to John Wick. &&> Yes, JW and other great fighting movies (Jackie Chan) use way more wide shots, and it really shows. Most blockbusters these days use loads of close tight shots, cuts, and artificial camera shake to hide the fact that the actors can't fight for real and can't make fake fighting look good

Chan said and explained the exact same thing in video&&I’ve seen it happen in a real fight, although not a fight to death obviously. 

There are people who enjoy real violence though. &&Oh man, I got a lot of watching do to! Haha thanks!&&Sounds like they're betting in nobody watching it considering Spider-Man PS4 comes out the same day. &&I don't care for the shows anymore except for Punisher which I thought was great.

Daredevil - good fights and Wilson Fisk was amazing. Electra's plot is absolutely insane and is beyond farfetched 

Jessica Jones - David Tennant was captivating as fuck but it's exhausting watching JJ mope around and be miserable about her powers

Iron Fist - Just dumb but has never been a compelling super hero in the first place

Luke Cage - literally just walks slowly towards people while they shoot his clothes up and then he flicks them. When the fuck is he going to do something cool

Punisher - Doesn't need an enticing villain to be good, it's just cool watching him be a vicious bastard&&Not just A martial artist, THE martial artist. He is pretty much the single greatest fighter in Marvel comics. Idk if it's been changed at all recently, but he mastered just about every form of fighting known to man, and some that weren't even known to them.&&Ohh don't get me wrong. I love the show. Just telling people, dont expect John wick level acting. But they can expect the action to be on that level if not more. &&I always knew him as the list guy&&I know right, I wasn't sure about his Spider-Man casting until I saw his Instagram the day the news broke, I was like, kid's got some moves.&&I know someone who got their face degloved from being ran over by a car! Everything got reattached pretty nicely and now he just has a badass scar over his eye. Shits wild&&Narrator: And then it did happen.&&Less of a rumor and more of a guess but a lot of people seem to think they are going to be either fetching the infinity stones or other heroes. &&We forgetting Ray Narc from Drugbusters?&&Hey he also had that role where he wore an all black ninja costume, didn’t say a word, and rarely emoted. &&Get rid of the rand corporation and force him to start up Heroes for Hire with Misty and Coleen. &&I've read a couple of initial reviews of Iron Fist S2 (both reviewing the first 6 eps) and say is a massive improvement on S1, better fight choreography, better character development (even the Meachums.)&&The Meachum twins were great though.

Also isn't it clear that Rand has its hand in several enterprises? S1 shows Rand's medical development (the drug Danny wanted to sell at cost) and the chemical plant they ran that gave people cancer &&Honestly I hate to be a pessimist but the Defenders shows are basically a linear downwards trend. DDS1/JJ are the best, then DDS2, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and I reaaaally was bummed out by Defenders (great banter, but man the plot was awful . . . 8 hours of them eating Chinese food would've been way better). 

The obvious exception is Punisher, which people really love, but personally I wouldn't rank it above DDS2. &&There are handfuls of us!&&sorry if similarity in film genre was insinuated with my post. I'm comparing cinematography exclusively. Specifically, what makes fights believable. Could be Jackie chan, John Wick, or Superman. The film doesn't matter, the filming techniques do. &&Luke Cage season 2 is an easy binge.  I really enjoyed it.&&Well not all the shows are the same style so it's not crazy for people to not like them all. JJ was more like a fighting your inner demons kind of emotional drama. And LC is more like a race/class showcase drama. DD and Punisher are really the only action oriented shows. IF is just a dude getting beat up and then talking about being the Iron Fist and then getting beat up some more until his fist glows and he punches them.&&Electra's introduction felt like a romantic plot tumor to me, which is a shame, I kept hoping for more of Punisher and Kingpin whenever she and DD were in focus.......&&Ya I found out about the comedy after hearing he had aids. &&I don’t understand how that works. I Googled the pictures of the stuntwoman that got her face degloved and it looks perfectly fine after her recovery, all I could see is a small scar on her cheekbone. Am I imagining degloving to be much worse injury than it is or is the medicine so advanced nowadays that they can pretty much re-attach most of your skin back to your face with next to no visible damage?&&I’ve made a huge mistake.&&Or the lead character from Carry On Stuntman?

Ray Fark?&&Don't forget the role where he had a really long tongue and a green face, didn't say a word, and rarely emoted.&&So we are mostly on the same page except i have not been able to complete most seasons or even watch Punisher. &&Fistfuls even!&&We don’t use *that* word around here. Fist or bust. 

...but then again, *paper does beat rock*&&Ahh, I was talking about style. But yes from a cinematography perspective I totally see your point. That’s my mistake. &&The actress was amazing but the scriptwriters couldn't make her subplot interesting&&Riddled with it.&&Think the technology nowadays is just that good, I think if they have most of the skin all they have to do is disinfect and do some real fancy stitching

Wonder what happens to those who lose skin. Maybe take it from other parts of the body and slap it on and wait for it to heal up? &&I was thinking Ray Blart: Segway Cop&&and Ray Stark from Ironguy.&&IMHO Punisher is probably the most true to character comic book hero/anti-hero that has ever seen a screen...The casting is really well done and the fight scene choreography is pretty great in many spots(I’m a martial artist so I’m pretty picky too) but it’s the attention to detail that really sets it apart from its peers. DDS2 being its equal due to Vincent Denafrio’s stellar portrayal of Kingpin...Again, all IMHO. &&And Rachel Ray, from that one cooking show&&",2018-09-05 14:35:49
Roscoe Arbuckle's The Cook was released 100 years ago today. For decades it was thought to be a lost film until a damaged print was found in 1998,30049,9g1ee6,https://v.redd.it/4w1s2qkxkem11,701,1537017632.0,,"People 100 years ago were not different from today&&did he just kick an omelette &&Big man with moves. &&Fatty Arbuckle is one of the saddest stories in entertainment. The man had to go through 3 trials where he was accused of rape and murder with no substantial evidence. By the final trial the defense tore into the witnesses and Arbuckle was finally acquitted,  even ending with a formal apology from the jury recognizing that he had been wronged. Unfortunately it was too late and his career was already dead as all the papers and new outlets blasted him as a rapist for months and public opinion was so negative no studio would work with him. Finally, years later he is able to put out a few shorts and eventually signs on to star once again in feature length film, he reportedly told friend Buster Keaton ""this is the best day of my life"" while celebrating the signing. He died in his sleep that night. A tragic story almost no one remembers, but they should, false accusations of a crime can and have ruined people's lives.&&“You Must Remember This” has a great episode about Fatty Arbuckle. It’s a fantastic podcast if you’re interested in classic Hollywood. Highly recommend. &&He was such a great talent. Shame what Hollywood did to him, even though he was acquitted of all charges in the death of Virginia Rappe.&&Chris Farley and Louie Anderson were both greenlit ""signed"" to play Roscoe ""Fatty"" Arbuckle for the biopic at one time.  Chris fell through for obvious reasons. Louie, it wasn't so clear, but he has proven with his performance and multiple Emmy nominations and one win (so far) for ""Baskets"" that he would of turned in,  at the very least an interesting performance. &&My socially insensitive but 1950’s culturally common parents frequently referred to a fat person as “Fatty Arbuckle.”&&Obviously whenever Fatty Arbuckle's name is mention people who know the name will think of him as a murderer or at least a man who was involved in some heinous crime. These are persistent myths and have been proven false. For those interested, a fantastic book named ""Room 1219"" by Greg Merritt which I read this year thoroughly details the Arbuckle trial, his life and that of the woman who died Virginia Rappe. It's really fascinating. Many myths are debunked in the book (the coke bottle for example) so I'd highly recommend anyone interested in this incident find it because it's the definitive story of Arbuckle.&&Have you seen the film Chef by Jon Favreau&&after he was acquitted in the third trial, the jury foreman read the following statement;

&#x200B;

 Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great  injustice has been done him. We feel also that it was only our plain  duty to give him this exoneration, under the evidence, for there was not  the slightest proof adduced to connect him in any way with the  commission of a crime. He was manly throughout the case and told a  straightforward story on the witness stand, which we all believed. The  happening at the hotel was an unfortunate affair for which Arbuckle, so  the evidence shows, was in no way responsible. We wish him success and  hope that the American people will take the judgment of fourteen men and  woman who have sat listening for thirty-one days to evidence, that  Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from all blame.  

&#x200B;

and now, almost 100 years later, many people STILL think he was guilty.&&RIP Roscoe, they did you dirty &&We love to raise people up and then tear them down in this country. &&Fatty Arbuckle my man&&Nice hackey sack moves.&&Today I learned that Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle never actually murdered anyone. I spent the last 5 years thinking he had. Looks like bad press takes a while to go away.&&Arbuckle really enjoyed playing pranks on people. Him and Buster Keaton used prop bottles at a dinner party and started smashing each other on eachothers heads to the shock of his guests. 

If people called him his stage name ""fatty arbuckle"" in public he would politely ask them not to call him that. He was very agile for his weight and never used himself being fat as a punchline of a joke. &&Tried for rape. Found not guilty after 2 hung jury trials  but career of course destroyed &&I highly recommend the book  [I, Fatty](https://www.amazon.com/I-Fatty-Novel-Jerry-Stahl/dp/1582342474)  for anyone who is interested in learning more about his life. Super interesting take on how hollywood and heroin (legal at the time) affected his already depressing upbringing.&&Wasn't he known as fatty arbuckle? Remember my grandpa talking about him.. &&For anyone else curious, the run time was 22 minutes and OP's gif is just a clip from the full film.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook&&He was horribly smeared by a mentally ill woman who accused him of sexual assault, an accusation taken up by the media. Though he was totally innocent, the campaign destroyed his career, fortune and health. Something similar happened to Clara Bow who was accused of being the willing subject of a gang-rape. Both of them found there was no effective way of fighting such whispering campaigns and had to leave the industry.&&Pretty clean copy, obviously.&&Ok, so where can we watch this?

It was part of a series that expanded on the lives of people who appeared in Hollywood Babylon, a book about scandals in early Hollywood.

&&Actually, in a way that story has a happy ending. How many people get to die in their sleep having had the best day of their life. Not only was e out celebrating the signing of a contract, but also his 1 year anniversary. To me it would have been sad if he died never having gained any sort of solace.&&He died acquitted and happy. There are worse endings. &&Very fucked up indeed. It sounds like this Rappe girl died from an illness, but coincidentally she was at his party when she started dying. One of her friends mistakenly thought she was assaulted/raped which is what caused her death. Which could have all been easily cleared up, except this DA Matthew Brady comes along and wants to further his career, so he bribes/threatens witnesses across the board into giving false testimony trying to convict this guy of the death penalty...&&> The man had to go through 3 trials where he was accused of rape and murder with no substantial evidence. 

Reverse Cosby.&&There’s a film in waiting. Where’s a screenwriter when you need one? &&Chris Farley wanted to play him in a movie. Something I wish happened. I miss Chris Farley.&&>  A tragic story almost no one remembers, but they should

I think it's pretty well remembered by those with even a passing interest in that period of film history. It was a defining event in movie censorship. There have been plenty of other people and controversies that *have* been largely forgotten since then, but Arbuckle's isn't really one of them.&&Fun fact, Fatty Arbuckle is a distant cousin and silent film star Harry Langdon is my great great uncle. &&Most definitely. He was a victim to Hollywood’s hyper moralization in the early days of the Hays code. When his scandal broke out, people were astonished at the so call s deviant behavior of its stars. The media really leaned into the moral complex of American exceptionalism back then. So homosexuality, sexuality of any kind for females, any kind of drug or alcohol consumption, association with minorities, etc. would get you in trouble with the tabloids.&&Ironically, the woman who died was named Virginia Rappe.

The woman who totally ruined his life was Bambina Maude Delmont, a woman known for setting up celebrities in order to blackmail them.&&I've read numerous profiles and stories of Arbuckle and yes, this sums it up. There's also a whole story of tabloid journalism making stuff up to sell papers, friends turning their backs on him to save their own careers, and the reality of how kind hearted he was and what a shit upbringing he had. This needs to be made into a movie already.&&Also sad: he went by ""Fatty"".&&But listen and believe.&&Chris Farley was heavily invested in preproduction of an Arbuckle biopic where he was to play Arbuckle. He considered him one of his comedic kin and really took to the story, excited to show off his sensitive side in the dark comedy, something different from the “fatty fall down” schtick he was so tired of. Unfortunately, like Arbuckle and his dream picture, Chris Farley died before his project came to fruition.  &&Holy shit. I actually said oh my god out loud after reading he died that night. Jesus Christ. &&From what I remember of some documentaries I saw on the subject long ago, my personal belief was that he was targeted by his studio because he had negotiated a huge contract (first million dollar contract or something? I forget the details, but it was a ground-breaking contract for its time) and even though they signed the contract, they didn't want to hold up their end.  EDIT: Evil B\*st\*rds&&Really thought this was going to be a shottymorph.&&I heard that Chris Farley was considering doing a movie about Fattie Arbuckle and the events around the Rappe death and trials. I believe it was going to be called I, Fatty. However we all sadly know what happened to Chris Farley :( &&It's over for silent period Arbucklecels. &&Obviously, the press/media didn't learn from their mistake...&&You know what? At least he died happy. That's a lot more than most people get. He died knowing that he was going to be in a movie. That's a pretty good last feeling. 

&#x200B;

Really tragic though. :( &&Meanwhile Charlie Chaplin was a horrible rapist and abused of underage girls, even throwing pies at their naked bodies and then refusing to hire them if they flinched.  But he gets celebrated on Reddit every time he gets posted &&Poor guy.. we know his innocence now and he shall live on in this video. &&It's not that sad a story when you realize he passed away with a heart full of hopes and a second chance. It's sad but I'd rather he go happy with a feeling of joy then having made a second attempt and failed or never gotten the chance at all.&&> ...no studio would work with him. Finally, years later he is able to put out a few shorts...

As I recall, he *did* do some work directing in the interim under a pseudonym.&&The me too movement.&&I read somewhere that before his death, Chris Farley had wanted to make a.biopic of him&&Sounds like a fantastic film waiting to be made.

A rapper could be accused of murder, acquitted, and it just probably boosts his career. Same person being accused of rape, even if they didn't do it their reputation would be tarnished.

There's a great documentary on the subject where they interview a contemporary gynecologist. It's very possible her it burst spontaneously and that it didn't happen with any kind of force. Unfortunately, his lack of doing that research might have shaped his ultimate conclusion. However, it's very possible there was some brief flirting or encounter in the bedroom, which Arbuckle did lie about after the fact given the mores of the time.

True, but the studios were in it up to their ears. 
  
A famous director, King Vidor, researched the murder of William Desmond Taylor (a famous murder at the turn of the previous century), whose conclusions he did not publish to protect many people who were still alive at the time, but which was published later by Sidney Kirkpatrick under the title ""A Cast of Killers""  
  
A statement in wikipedia claims (with no link and no provenance of the source) that a newsletter claims that there were ""over 100 errors"" in the book, but even if that's true, the book provides a mind-opening view into how the ""Industry"" was really run.  
  
Here is what it says about the book in King Vidor's wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Vidor:  

""In 1967, Vidor researched the unsolved 1922 murder of fellow director William Desmond Taylor for a possible screenplay. Vidor never published or wrote of this research during his lifetime, but biographer Sidney D. Kirkpatrick posthumously examined Vidor's notes. He alleged, in his 1986 book A Cast of Killers, that Vidor had solved the sensational crime but kept his conclusions private to protect individuals still living at the time. The widely cited newsletter Taylorology later noted over 100 factual errors in Cast of Killers and strongly disputes Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but credits the book with renewing popular interest in the crime.""  

EDIT: added phrase about provenance to statement about link&&They weren't a victim of Hollywood's hyper moralization, but of morality in general. Hollywood, even back then, was the sort of cesspool we talk about today in the #MeToo period. Casting couch seductions, drug and alcohol addiction, and worse were relatively common in a business that had little oversight until the 30s. &&And this is all because the Supreme Court in the 1910s ruled movies were not subject to 1st amendment protections leaving the states to regulate their content at will

Hollywood wanting to sell to the whole country as one market adopted the most restrictive bible belt and backwards southern state codes.

That book I mentioned initially is amazing -- it covers everything and goes deep into the ramifications of the Arbuckle scandal on Hollywood as well.

And of course this scandal also has a lot of importance today as well with the #MeToo movement and the idea of trial by media.&&Oh yeah, I do believe Arbuckle lied about certain details -- but it's understandable given that he was initially being charged with murder and then manslaughter after that.

Gabourey Sidibe. She was pretty big compared to most people.&&Over reaching severe judgements on the interwebs are what kills.

Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, was put on trial for rape and manslaughter, (murder 3) for those who watch too much tv.

He was accused, tried, convicted, and hung, but by the jury of the 'time'.  The media.  Sound familiar?

If anyone is interested in looking up the circumstances, the meth/heroine addicted actress who had the misfortune to come to his house died.  Hollywood and the press made a monster out of the Man who had been one of the most popular actors since C. Chaplin.  The reason was because of his freakish, abnormal, grotesque, abnormal size for a man who was 5 foot, 9 inches.   288 pounds.  That's #LBS 288.  Incredible for a human to be that large, right?

Roscoe was acquitted of the murder charges, but was blacklisted and shamed and never worked again.  He died less than 10 years later. Broken and reeling.

Taking a small step back 5 foot 9 inches, 288 pounds. 
This was freakish in the early 20th century in the US.  It's becoming almost the mean normal now in 2018.

&#x200B;

The podcast episode is okay, but really underplays much of the exonerating evidence - particularly Delmont's history with extortion, Rappe's medical history and testimony from her friends about her  problems while drinking. Arbuckle had a longstanding date at 3pm to go for a drive. He entered his bedroom just prior to change. Previously Rappe had gone in there to use the restroom, after banging on the door of the other bathroom - where Delmont was having sex with a man. Whether or not Arbuckle was aware Rappe was in his room is very much up for debate, but there is no  evidence he raped her - thought it is possible they had brief romantic interlude, based on some vague statements Rappe made. Everyone involved just thought she was drunk and Arbuckle got her another hotel room. She lived for a few days afterward and all were shocked she had died.

Let’s not forget someone else died&&Right, but early Hollywood promoted its own form of self censorship to avoid government overreach and censorship from the Hays code and McCarthyism. It was a reflection of society, but amplified by the tabloids. The oversight was definitely there though, but it took a couple of scandals for it to kick in, no? &&By all accounts I have read, he hated the name but you do what you gotta do when the nickname made you famous.&&No it's not. Just points out the double standard. Such as this case.&&Can you explain to me how it's sexist? A brief glimpse shows a bunch of articles focused on a double standard where treatment that wouldn't be acceptable for women or girls is acceptable for men or boys.  A great example is the borderline pornographic pictures of prepubescent boys being published as art, while similar pictures of girls would get someone into serious trouble. Nothing there seems sexist.&&Don't buy into the hysteria that men's rights is somehow anti woman. It's generally not, it's to raise awareness for men's issues too, like suicide and workplace death.

It's not a feminist issue and no one takes it seriously, so we need a group.

Karina Longworth is a treasure. &&The You Must Remember This was a decent episode but perhaps a little bit too set in the ""#metoo"" era. It really underplayed evidence that the whole thing was a setup by Maude Delmont and Virginia's odd history of behavior. There was little evidence anything violent happened with Rappe whatsoever. &&Here you go [You Must Remember This](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/you-must-remember-this/id858124601?mt=2&i=1000415989911) &&And an episode of My Favorite Murder!&&Which episode?&&I really like this podcast, she kinda comes off as pretentious though. She seems like she would be such a know-it-all at parties. Her podcasts are very well researched and through so I over look her obnoxious manner haha. &&His story is told in the most recent episode, ""How Hollywood Helped the Nazis"", specifically part 2, I believe. It provides background for the moral scare Hollywood was in during the Nazis emergence in Germany. He wasn't a focus of the episode, which is why he doesn't appear in a title.&&And the one on ""The Non-Nazi Bastards Who Helped Hitler Rise to Power"". So many parallels with U.S. politics in the last couple years. &&The wonderful thing about podcasts is the sheer variety available. I have a rather diverse interest base, and as a result I listen to a wide sampling of shows. My favorite political podcast is ""Left, Right and Center"", where two guests from opposing sides sit down for a discussion of the week in politics, moderated by the host. To sate my curiosity in the realm of science, ""Stuff to Blow Your Mind"" from the HowStuffWorks network (who also produce ""Behind the Bastards"") covers a wide variety of interesting topics. General discussion of Philosophy and society I get from ""Waking Up"" with Sam Harris. Then there's the giant striding through a field of puppies ""The Joe Rogan Experience""; where comedian and MMA enthusiast/commentator Joe Rogan speaks with whoever he finds interesting that week.  What are you interested in? If I'm not familiar with a podcast in your wheelhouse, there's a good chance I know someone with a recommendation, or perhaps Reddit itself will come through!&&He really made the world an all over worse place &&The fallout from Hearst after Citizen Kane came out could be made into its own movie. One of his underlings tried to frame Orson Welles by placing a 14 year old girl in his hotel room and had journalists waiting with cameras. A detective warned Welles and he took the first train out of the city. &&They weren't new friends. They had known each other for several years.&&The ""venereal disease"" charges - like allegations she had had an abortion - were part of the attempt by the defense to smear Rappe's reputation. Arbuckle's ex-wife, Minta Durfee, for example, would go on to live a long life and would utterly demean Rappe, claiming all sorts of nonsense along the lines of execs having to fumigate chairs after Virginia sat in them. 

There is no actual medical evidence Rappe suffered from any venereal disease, or that she had an abortion (which, at various times, has been put forward as a cause of death for her, in spite of the very clear findings of the autopsy that show nothing about venereal disease or botched abortions). Nor, for that matter, was Virginia drunk as is sometimes asserted.

The best book about the Arbuckle-Rappe case is ""Room 1219: The Life of Fatty Arbuckle, the Mysterious Death of Virginia Rappe, and the Scandal that Changed Hollywood"" by Greg Merritt. Merritt disentangles a lot of the mythology around Rappe's death, using primary sources such as her autopsy. The story has been so muddled by Arbuckle's defenders and detractors (and just generally sloppy, salacious Hollywood 'histories') that it's hard to get to the bottom of it - only he knew what really went on behind those closed doors. But Merritt puts together a good case for a consensual sexual encounter that went wrong due to Rappe's underlying cystitis, and the subsequent shitstorm as a result of both the defense and prosecutorial side attacking Arbuckle and Rappe in turn. Rappe never actually accused Arbuckle of rape in the time it took her to die a prolonged and excruciating death - her words in the immediate aftermath of what happened - ""he did it, I know he did it. I have been hurt, I am dying"" - could easily be the words of a woman in agony due to her ruptured bladder as the result of what was a consensual encounter.

Arbuckle lost his career, Rappe lost her life, and both had their reputations destroyed.

Have you seen him in ""Crashing""? &&While I agree with you that the movie probably won’t get made in today’s Hollywood atmosphere, I think that the “ugly” part is both harsh and a little irrelevant.&&Yes, the code was created in the 20s thanks to a number of pretty big scandals, but didn't get taken seriously in a major way until the mid-30s when it looked like the government was going to step in. But that self-censorship and the morality clauses that went with it were a product of *real* issues within the industry, which have continued right up until the modern period. 

The censorship itself definitely went too far, especially if you contrast it to films coming out of Europe (onscreen kisses were limited to certain lengths, crime never paid, plenty of mundane topics were considered taboo). It resulted in censorship that severely limited what creative types could get away with, and made a lot of films pretty vanilla, but I think it's good to remember that it wasn't wholly without cause, and also, there was a depression going on, and that had to have an influence on what was deemed culturally responsible. 

I think one of the issues I take is this idea that audiences back then were more puritanical than they are today, and I'm not so certain that's true anymore, or if it is true, it's degrees of separation than it is nonexistent. Certainly you can get away with things today that would have been pornographic back then, but there is political and social influence on film today that I think correlates well with 1930s self-censorship. There are certain topics today that mainstream Hollywood shies well away from so that they don't rock the boat, and look at the number of scandals that are completely reshaping careers, and films themselves. Whether it's recasting Kevin Spacey after the film's been shot, cancelling popular television shows, cutting scenes out of Predator, etc. For right or wrong, I don't think we're much different than those living 90-100 years ago, we've just sometimes changed what is acceptable and what isn't.&&Menslib does that but without the thickly veiled sexism. Mensrights is definitely a hotbed of toxic masculinity that distracts from men specific issues. &&Fair play. &&aw fuck&&Not saving lives. &&""I give him enough MSG kill elephant! He still keeps going! You can't stop him! YOU GO NOW!""&&Nay nay&&> you mean the media was in pursuit of maximum profit at the expense of the truth? I've never heard of such a thing.  
  
True, but also Arbuckle had just signed a groundbreaking contract with the studio (maybe the first million dollar contract?), and it is my personal belief that the studios created the scandal and paid for the horrendous untrue coverage so that they could get out of that contract and other contracts for which it would have set a precedent.  &&

Jonah Hill Had a Four-Hour Meeting With Martin Scorsese & Got Advice From Ethan Coen Before Making Directorial Debut with A24's ‘Mid90s’,29019,9d01jz,https://www.indiewire.com/2018/09/jonah-hill-mid90s-four-hour-meeting-martin-scorsese-ethan-coen-1202000327/,1244,1536097455.0,,"Sorry Evan, but the Coen Brothers don’t direct the porn that I like. They’re hard to get ahold of.&&Gretta Gerwig did something similar when she was prepping Lady Bird. She sent out a ton of questions to every director she knew about learning the basics of directing. It must be awesome to know so many talented people willing to help you on your own artistic journey. &&Really holding out for this to be the next big step in his career.&&A few weeks ago I was visiting NYC and happened to run into Jonah Hill in the streets of SoHo. I said what’s up and he looked afraid I was gonna be an overbearing fan, so instead I just asked him if he knew where the Carhartt store was (my phone had just died) and he told me which way to go. I didn’t want to bother him (plus the store was closing in 20 min) so I just said thanks and walked away. I heard him call out, “Yo, have a good one!” as I walked away and I turned around and said “Yeah you too.”

Anyways just wanted to share that lol. I hope he was left thinking, “Damn that was a super casual encounter.”&&The way it’s filmed gave me a Kids (1995) vibe. Super hyped for it.&&As somebody who came of age during that time, in that scene and in Southern CA, the barrage of nostalgia hit home.  It really captured the mid 90s, low income vibe of that part of the world.  I think it will be good.&&He directed a music video for Danny Brown a couple years ago that is pretty top notch.  I hope his skills translate well to a feature film


Edit: [found it here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7L4JnAuW00k)&&[I hope Jonah gains the respect he deserves one day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZKiRRYNn1s)&&Jonah Hill can’t get through an interview without 35 billion namedrops. &&My wife and I were eating at a restaurant in New Orleans and she spotted him at the table behind me. I didn’t believe her at first but I turned around and it was him. 

I asked him if we could get a pic but he said not now because he was with his family. I told him my bad, and he said na you’re cool. 

A few mins later his mom comes to our table and asks if she could take a pic of our food. Of course we obliged. 

The restaurant is Jacques-Imos in case anyone is wondering. &&Guess that’s the same as film school&&A24 is the shit.

Looking forward to this, especially as a 90s kid.&&This is the sign of a promising debut...somebody who knows what they DON’T know and takes time to learn from some of the greats&&I find it funny that A24 is mentioned in this title. They produce some great cinema but if it were any other company, the name wouldn’t be mentioned. Good for Jonah, tho.&&Put some respect on his name. Dude is branching out and the movie looks incredible. &&Wow an entire four hours&&Am I the only one who thinks that sounds wicked short? 

I'm a programmer in the video game industry.  If I had a four hour meeting with John Carmack, I'd probably have the greatest moment of my career, but I doubt it's make me any better of a programmer, I might learn a little about his process and all. 

Now if Carmack and me worked on a project near the end, or he helped me debug (think of this as editting) or evaluated my checkings on a daily basis (took a look at the dailies and gave feedback).  Then I would improve as a programmer, perhaps becoming a significantly better programmer, but four hours... especially before working on something?  I just don't know if that's a huge thing. 

That being said, I wish Hill the best, and more, He's a talented actor and Hollywood finally realized it, I hope directing works out, but he better come back for 23 jump street no matter what!   

I just think it's a feel good article, but I question if it's that big of a difference?&&Saw Jonah Hill on Kimmel recently...getting a weird vibe from him. All tatted up now too. 

I honestly completely empathize with celebrities losing their shit eventually. It’s got to be a weird life.  &&Should have had a meeting with the director of Kids.&&He seems to get a lot of sympathy from guys that identify with him. I still think he came off like a huge self important oversensitive douchebag in that Rolling Stone interview. He expects to go from comedian to serious actor/director in no time. Well, shut the fuck up and do the work, let it speak for itself, and continue until it does. He so god damn lucky and should be counting his stars. &&He should have had a 4 hour meeting before he got those tattoos &&Comedic Actor to Serious Actor to Director. This man is gonna go to places we can't ever think of.&&[deleted]&&no one advised him to write a more interesting title?&&This PR fluff isn't news. It's an ad trying to get Hill to look like a better director such as the big name directors mentioned. 

I got a better idea if you want to look like a better director: just be a better director.&&Why are we rooting for horrible people to succeed?  Read into this guy, I hope he fails.  &&Jonah Hill out there living his best life. &&I love Jonah’s passion for cinema and his will to be taken seriously in the industry. &&Paid ad&&Misread as Martin Short and was very perplexed&&Jonah looks like Post Malone with no face tattoos&&I think there's an outtake where he uses the same line but says Scorsese instead of the Coen Bros. I could be wrong it's been a while since I watched the deleted scenes&&I hope the title's changed to Perfect Ten.

Something like that, you know? Like ""perfect ten""? Cause that could be any number of things you know, they can't really get you for that, that could be like a bowling website.&&What about like perfect 10?&&I’m a a simple man, I see a Superbad quote and I upvote it&&That's Vagtastic!&&This should be the top post in the thread.&&I love superbad still to this day. I've recently watched it and still relavant in lots of ways. What gets me is that's one of the last images I have of House parties before smartphones. The dude had a flip phone at the house with the fight. But that's how I remember house parties. Just talking to everyone of sitting in a corner with friends. &&wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic. &&They were seemingly being pretty nice with Greta Gerwig and Jonah Hill then. I remember I heard Mel Gibson say before his first directing job, he called all the directors he worked with for advice on the phone and apparently they all individually laughed and said something like “you’ll figure it out like we did” and hung up. &&Joseph Gordon Levitt was mentored by Nolan before he made his directorial debut in Don John.&&Even better if you are married to someone who's a well known director.&&Wasn't she previously an accomplished co-director? I mean obviously I'm not saying she didn't do this, but she's not an absolute rookie, right?&&Remember when he was just the fat kid that wanted to buy the sparkly knee high boots in 40 Year Old Virgin?&&He had a career-best performance this year in *Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot* and no one seemed to notice. Really hope this is good. He seems ready for his Oscar.&&He's in that new Netflix series with Emma Stone and some others also.

Maniac&&At this point, whenever I see the logo A24 appear I expect nothing but good things no matter who is directing, I’m sure this is gonna help him in the future &&It's just crazy to me that the guy who drew dicks in Superbad is now an Oscar nominated actor.&&I was sure that was turning into the grocery store  yawning copypasta. I’m glad Jonah didn’t do you like that.&&That sounds really.... nice. &&i like to think he thought ""damn that guy had beatiful eyes"" &&absolutely genius viral marketing by Carhartt right here. &&I couldn't imagine what it's like. He (among other celebrities) likely deal with *very* overbearing fans pretty regularly, some that could even come across frightening at worst, at the best of times easily a nuisance. And you never know what to expect. But then there's the fact that they have to be 'on' and if you're having a blah day trying to be super polite to complete strangers trying to be your best friend so you don't garner a reputation for being an asshole and possibly tarnish your career. And if that interaction attracts attention from other people nearby you might get mobbed by people when all you want to do it go about your business.  

He must have been very relieved with how cool you acted lol. &&So where is the Carhartt store?&&That’s awesome. Not to be presumptuous, bet I’ll ~~bet~~ hope he still thinks about that exchange, and appreciates it. &&So funny. I actually live across the street from him in a tiny old studio that is a piece of junk. He lives in a nice loft with a doorman. But we are neighbors and go to the same coffee shop. I’m still too scared to talk to him but one day I hope to tackle a paparazzo for him so he can get his coffee in peace. &&[deleted]&&>~~""Yeah you too.""~~

""Also fyi you should probably know, I technically don't have a hearing problem it's just when there's a lot of noises I'll hear them as one big jumble""&&Whoa whoa, there’s a Carhartt store in SoHo?&&You should have said, “Yeah, you too Jonah!”&&I wish you replied, ""Yeah, you too, Jonah""&&Did he have a Chinese menu in his hands? Was he looking for a place called  Lee Ho Fook's?&&I bet his next movie is about this encounter&&Is he jacked now?&&I had very similar experience with Aaron Paul. He seemed very grateful. &&First time I saw jake gyllenhall on the street i thought he was someone I actually knew, but I was on the phone so I just gave him a head nod. He nodded back, and then we proceeded to run into each other everywhere for like a year and always gave each other a nod or a wave, with him often initiating. I always wonder who he thought I was...&&Wholesome af&&I want to run into a big star and just casually mention how much I love them into the stuff they do, except for like all their biggest roles/box office hits.  Then be like, nah jk your good and just walk away without asking for a selfie. &&why is there a Carhartt store in SoHo?

Are they like... A fashion thing now?&&When I first moved  to NYC I was late for an appointment that I was cycling to. I was in west village and stopped and asked directions from a couple ladies pushing strollers. The lady turned to me and was really helpful, pointed me which direction to go and how far. It was Julianne Moore. I thanked her as I rode away and said I enjoyed her movies.&&I had a good encounter with him at the grocery store once. I was walking down the isle from one side, and him from the other. It was kinda awkward and kinda funny. I think I couldn’t stop smiling and didn’t know where to look. He kinda smiled too cause we were acknowledging it was awkward. He’s awesome though. &&My experience meeting Jonah Hill was a bit different. 

My dad briefly dated Jonah Hill’s mom in high school and they ended things on good terms. They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories (they are all retired) and occasionally even skype on holidays. Last thanksgiving, I was over at my dad's and Jonah was visiting while they were skyping. His mom knows from my dad that I'm a huge fan of his movies and she offered to introduce us. Well, Jonah would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear her while she awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind her coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers. Fucking Jonah Hill. &&Yoooo wtf are the replies here.

Is everyone star struck?

Congratulations, you didn’t bother celebrity. Why would they be so perplexed? They’re just normal fuckin people &&A few weeks ago I was visiting NYC and happened to run into u/deathwish_ASR in the streets of SoHo. I said what’s up and he looked afraid I was gonna be an overbearing fan, so instead I just asked him if he knew where the Carhartt store was (my phone had just died) and he told me which way to go.

Anyways just wanted to share that lol. I hope he was left thinking, “Damn that was a super casual encounter.”

&&Carhartt? Really?&&I always thought he was conceited and full of himself, from what I saw in interviews and appearances, but this makes me think maybe he isn't such a bad guy.&&i guess he really appreciated that minute where he went back to before his fame started hounding him every second of his life.&&similar story. I live in Winnipeg and we had JUST gotten our hockey team back after 15 years of them being gone.

it was opening night of the first season, also our home opener. the first hockey game in Winnipeg in over 15 years. No way me and my friend's got tickets so we went to a restaurant downtown to watch the game in the lounge. 

We got pumped. I think it was like 6-1. Anyways. We were drinking in the lounge after and Dustin fucking Byfuglien walks into the restaurant. Everyone started murmuring and shit and you could tell the entire room was focused on him instantly. He looked PISSED and had a steady stream of people coming up to him and shit. He disappeared into the restaurant and we talked about it for a minute and just kept hangingout. 

I ended up passing him on his way out of the bathroom and without thinking I said, ""oh hey!"" before I could catch myself. I could tell he was not into it at all and my better sense caught up to me and I threw out, ""best Jets game, I've seen in 15 years. Heh heh. you're gonna love playing here."" and went on my way. I was pretty star struck and kind tipsy but I swear he half-heartedly cracked a smile and said ""thanks man"". &&Yesterday my wife saw Paulie D and shouted “Yo! GTL!” He gave her a nod but didn’t seem too happy about it &&That’s great, I do the same thing. I was at a resort in New Mexico and realized I was in the same hot spring as that dude from silicone valley Thomas Middletek and just nodded at him. Him and his partner seemed really anxious about being recognized though. 

I’ve had a few other casual run ins with celebrities and people are always like “why didn’t you take a picture?” I hate pictures. Best was Richard Gere in Dharmsala, India we did that thing where we were trying not to run into each other shuffling left and right.&&There's no such thing as a casual encounter in New York. 

We'll remember shit like this for years, it's a beautiful thing. 

One time I was walking to work at 6am. Normal day. Normal morning. ""Casual."" I was heading up Ave A and about to turn onto 7th st. (Right at Tompkins Sq). But then to my left I heard a dude sitting and leaning against a wall while kinda cheerfully telling someone nearby, ""Yeah there you go, but be careful and just make sure you catch it!"" I turned to see who was talking to, and there was a woman crouched and she had one leg hiked up against a car, and her ass was spread and shit was coming out into a pizza box. She wasn't even facing the crap side of her body away from the main sidewalk. And the dude was just watching her and smiling. I only saw it all for a split second before immediately regretting looking and not staying in my own little world like usual, but yeah, I'll remember that for years.

Also, hell yeah, Jonah Hill used to come into my restaurant and order two burritos each time. One steak and one veggie. FOH said he always tipped.&&I've dealt with him when he was starting to peak. I love him, such a sweet person. My favorite encounter with him was when I was serving him at bar, and he hollered to my husband, ""She's terrible! Love her with all your heart, or shitbags like me will!""&&I honestly don’t even understand fandom. In my industry I’ve had to be in close contact with a few high profile celebrities and politicians, I’ve never had any issue talking with them as long as you treat them like a normal person.  I mean,  most people would probably rather small talk about the weather than talk about some project they did 10 years ago that you are a fan of.   And for gods sake don’t take pictures of people, it’s so rude and really what does it do for you? &&He ate at my restaurant one night and came in with his mother and a few other people I didn’t want to bother him I didn’t say anything plus he was sick/hungover so I couldn’t tell people about him being there. Yeah Jonah hill came in and ate last night he got sick in the bathroom! Not the coolest story to tell people.&&I love you, really, or people like you at least. I have a standing life rule that whenever I run into anyone of any kind of celebrity I just treat them like any other person unless it's like an event they're being a celebrity at.

I can't remember who it was but some time ago I read a story about some celebrity eating dinner with family or something and just being bombarded by a fan/fans causing them to lose their cool a bit. It was one of those things that made me thing about a situation I normally wouldn't think about. I mean I bet being a celebrity is great when you're actually being a celebrity, but the constant on guardedness from fans running into you or being photographed has to be incredibly stressful.

I be Hill gets pretty happy when he has a casual encounter with people that doesn't turn into a photo op or a string of superb ad quotes being flung at him. It gives him a chance to just feel like some guy for a second. 

Good on you for keeping it in your pants. I've got a good bit of respect for that.&&Also This Is England &&🎶 *Casper the friendly ghost, the dopest ghost around* 🎶 &&every day I beat myself up for not buying a KIDS VHS tape I found at Salvation Army years ago. I thought about it but passed it up for some reason and now I am motivated to find another in the wild but all the thrift stores around me don’t have VHS tapes.

fuck&&> The way it’s filmed gave me a Kids (1995) vibe. 

Yeah, unfortunately I was thinking the same thing.

> Super hyped for it.

Oh.&&I have no legs!  I have. No legs!!&&Honestly, Skate Kitchen is much more like Kids than this seems to be.&&Man everything changed in the 90s.  Popsicle sticks became the thing, sk8 tv, x games.  Less punk rock, more hip hop.  The trailer looks like it catches the vibe alright.  Looks a bit like a more viewer friendly version of a Larry Clark film, but I’m down.

Edit:  Alright people.  Yes punk rock and ska became very popular in the 90s, but the 80s subculture of skateboarding was dominated by punk (dri, circle jerks, DK, suicidal tendencies etc.) and thrash (anthrax, slayer, metallica etc). The 90s saw “less punk” and “more hip hop” come into the subculture of skateboarding.  &&Almost as if this movie has a targeted demographic.&&I just watched the trailer.  It's impressive - I mean, in a dark way.   My ex grew up like the kid in this film; he's in his 40s and still dresses like a mid90s skater dude.  There is an enlightening bond I think that kids make to their peer group when life at home is shitty.&&Damn that's crazy that song and video was what got me into Danny Brown. I always thought of him as the type of actor to literally play himself in every role he takes and that he doesn't have a lot of skill in the business. It's great to be wrong sometimes!&&wtf did I just watch&&And he got gus van sant to make a cameo in it lol... &&Some of those interviews seem like friendly jabs, but others are just straight vicious. &&God. That was actually a little painful at times. &&No doubt. The dude has spent a long time trying to be taken seriously. &&:( protect this man &&Wow, that's fucked up. I'm sure Jonah Hill is an asshole in his own way but not anymore of an asshole than every other person on this planet who is also an asshole. Those are some low effort lines from people in the media who are genuinely not interesting and not funny. &&FeelsBadMan&&Shit that was actually pretty tough to watch &&That was the most brutal thing I believe I've seen in quite a while&&Jonah Hill is awesome.&&What the fuck.....you would think Jimmy Kimmel would have a little more tact, being a talk show host and interviewing people for a people for a living.&&When you’re made to feel inadequate, I can understand&&I really like Jonah Hill in everything I’ve seen him in. It’s weird though - in almost every interview or press appearance I’ve seen him in, it seems like he’s clamoring to be taken seriously. Obviously I’m just speculating, but it must be tough being genuinely talented and by all accounts “successful,” but many people still associate you with a comedic persona.&&Ive seen a few celebs at nice restaurants in New Orleans. Ive seen two famous actors at Commanders Palace at lunch during Mardi Gras

Good place to visit, you see all kinds of people if you go to the right places.&&Totally. Just make sure you consult the masterminds who did the soundtrack of Suicide Squad.&&No, but if you were an aspiring game developer who had previously written a physics engine or something relevant to the field, sitting down and having John layout his philosophy on how he approaches game development might have a major impact.  &&Jonah Hill is already super established as an actor, writer and producer so directing isn’t a foreign concept to him. He likely has the right skill set and mentality to direct a movie, but having a conversation and getting tips from a legend like Scorsese is just icing on the cake. &&He looks pretty bad with the tattoos.&&Agents fault &&Your story seems weird to me, if Jonah Hill is able to contact Agent by text why was there a big back and forth on the phone with Mabel? Seems more like Agent fucked over Mabel to keep Jonah around, not Jonah being a douche for trying to contact his agent.&&I actually think the title is dope. The story seems very character driven but the title opens up the scope of the project. He’s not just trying to tell a story he’s trying to capture the feeling of an entire era through the eyes of one story.

Edit: Spelling&&My favorite was ""Sorry the porn I watch isn't a Spike Lee joint""&&There's a bunch of alternative takes and he lists several prominent directors lol&&Yeah... but they don't show dick going in, which is a huge concern.&&It could be anything, like a bowling website. &&People don’t forget. &&I’d be like the iron chef of pounding vag&&I'm afraid I don't understand.&&It doesn’t help that he always opens with the Jew stuff, before asking his questions.  Really sours the mood.&&Mel Gibson was known to be a bit of dick. I'm surprise they even took his calls.&&creatively speaking, I think we're in a significantly less fickle time then we used to be in.&&Well, Mel Gibson turned out to be a fucking fantastic director, so I guess it worked out.&&It didn’t show, unfortunately.&&They're not married.&&Who r u talking about? Gerwig? &&She worked very closely with Noah Baumbach -- her partner -- on 2012's ""Frances Ha"". 

Not only did she help write it (great practice for ""Lady Bird""), she also essentially received a personal masterclass from one of the industry's most respected directors. Right in her nichè genre, no less: drama / comedy
&&He killed that role, too. &&I remember when he just wanted to suck some titties in Grandma's Boy&&I just watched Accepted the other day and holy crap... The dude lost like 2/3 of his weight.

- Him wearing a hotdog costume from Accepted

Or lol in Grandmas Boy where he is sucking on a titty for “16 consecutive hours”

You’d never guess where he’d end up. &&Don’t forget I❤️ Huckebees! I think he snotted up his milk in that movie!&&Also I Heart Huckabees. &&I remember when he was the fat kid who sucked on his first titty in Grandma's boy. &&It's all because Jonah wants to prove himself to Brad Pitt, b/c of that one time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwZD0pthP9Q&&I haven’t even heard of this movie. Damn... I feel kinda bad. Definitely gonna have to check it out. 

He was fantastic in Wolf of Wall Street, and even more-so in War Dogs. I loved his role in that. It was at that moment that I was like “Woah. This guy has a bright future in dramatic films.” I’ve always liked his comedic roles, but since then, I’ve been curious to see what he has to offer in more serious roles. He brings a certain charm to his characters that you don’t come by very often nowadays.&&didnt hear about this movie . has it come out already ? who's in it ? what's it about briefly?...I know I can Google these answers but i might endup reading spoilers &&I noticed! Holy crap he was amazing, and I’ve said so to anyone who will listen. &&I find it interesting how the young lead actor in his film is also in *Don't Worry* and skates with friends. I wonder if that was how he met and/or was inspired to make *mid90s*.&&You mean the Superbad sequel.&&A24 is always the mark of an interesting film. I don't like them all, but I admire them for putting up the money for someone's vision. &&Just watched Hereditary last week (another A24 film). Loved it!&&>whenever I see the logo A24

For every awesome movie they put out, they put out a dud.

Ever heard of [Backstabbing for Beginners](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/backstabbing_for_beginners)? How about [The Vanishing of Sidney Hall](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_vanishing_of_sidney_hall/)? [Woodshock](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/woodshock_2017/)? [The Adderall Diaries](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_adderall_diaries/)? [Cut Bank](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cut_bank/)?

When they realize they have a dud, they try to bury it quickly. Seems like they're doing that for the upcoming *Slice*.

EDIT: There are a hundred more, just go [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A24_(company)#Filmography) if you're curious

EDIT2: Apparently some are not convinced. [Mojave](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mojave_2016/). [Dark Places](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark_places_2015/). [Barely Lethal](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barely_lethal/). [Revenge of the Green Dragons](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/revenge_of_the_green_dragons/). [Life After Beth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/life_after_beth/). And more. Just saying they are not invincible. Neither is Pixar, Marvel, or anyone. But again: A24 is not perfect.&&Annapurna is also doing good things.&&lmao as I was typing it I knew people might think it was a copypasta but I swear it happened lol it's too mundane to be fake&&And then Jonah Hill breastfed his niece.&&This will now become a copypasta, though.&&That's the sort of social interaction i strive for&&I was visiting Boston and my wife and I were walking to go to the theater to see Book of Mormon.

Silicon Valley had been out for a little bit, and I spotted Kumail Nanjiani walking on the sidewalk coming toward us.

I elbowed my wife and tried to get her to look up as we passed, but what happened was Kumail and I made eye contact and he saw me elbowing my wife.

Later, he tweets something about ""not sure if someone noticed me, or just racism."" (I'm a large dude and was sporting a pretty rad duck dynasty length beard at the time.)

I tried searching for the tweet, but I couldn't find it that far back (2015).

Kumail, if you're out there: I promise I wasn't being racist. I just think you are hilarious and was trying to get my wife's attention. I also didn't want to stop you on the street and disturb you.&&It sounds kinda like finding one cookie left in the package at home. More cookies would be better but, that one cookie was pretty gosh darn good.&&Next time I run into a celebrity I'ma ask him where a store is then leave.&&It was probably the first time he heard the beatles&&That’s what my significant other tells me, so I suppose it’s possible. 🤔🙃&&""He's the sweetest guy ever""&&“Would you believe me if I told you that I was once considered very beautiful?”&&I like to think of him wearin' a Tuxedo T-shirt, 'cause it says, like, ""I want to be formal, but I'm here to party too.""

'The one that got away.... '&&Lmao you got me. Nah but for real they had cool stuff in the SoHo spot, loads better than a regular Carhartt store.&&he seems to be really afraid of overbearing fans to the point that leonardo dicaprio used it to prank him.

https://imgur.com/gallery/pabgF

i cannot imagine a life like that. must really suck.&&Despite his insanity, Tom Cruise has great advice for handling fame. One of his big things is setting expectations - he will entertain crowds and take selfies and sign autographs but beforehand he will put a hard limit - announce he has 20 minutes before he has to be at something. 

People handle not getting an autograph or picture better in that situation. But you have to put it out there ahead of time otherwise you can piss people off when you abruptly leave and they weren’t able to get their pic or signature. 

Also does a great job at shifting blame. Instead of being mad at Tom Cruise fans are mad at whatever/whoever caused him to leave. &&Yeah, for real. I saw Colin Kaepernick in the Chelsea area of NYC. I was like ""damn that guy is tall and looks weirdly familiar"" (I'm from Seattle and a Hawks fan so I of course saw his face all the time) and I locked eyes with him and just gave him a ""what's up"" nod and he nodded back. I made it to the end of the block before I was like ""oh shit that was Kaepernick"". Wouldn't change a thing though, besides maybe just saying ""keep it up!"" or something.&&Yeah but I mean he went to Jonah Hill day, so he probably doesn't hate it.&&Eleven up and one over, ya simple bitch!&&""Oh yeah, I think it's just around the corner on Lafayette right there""&&Near Supreme on Lafayette&&Yeah I’ve wondered about that and I hope so too. I figure it’s not too often that celebrities get interactions like that, where who they are isn’t a huge deal and they’re just treated like a normal person.&&""I hope Carhartt's doing good, he seemed like a decent dude.""&&He probably doesn't. He's probably been full on Mid90s release prep mode in his head. It's the first movie he's ever directed. I'm sure it's occupying most of his thoughts until it comes out. &&When you go to jail for assault so he can get a coffee at least you'll already be primed for the living space.

You sound like a nice fella so ill tell you what my dad told me: ""don't take a bullet for anyone who wouldn't take a bullet for you..SHIT..damn speedbumps, I always forget they're there...boy you still recording?""

Then he went on an hour long rant about the government. Anyway, the lesson is don't record random conversations cause it's weird.&&Pretty sure I know the coffee shop you're talking about because I've seen him there a bunch of times. One time I was outside with my boss's miniature poodle sharing the bench with him on the Mulberry side, and all the people on the sidewalk were only interested in the dog and didn't even notice Jonah Hill.&&I was walking around the Staples center in my way back to my hotel in LA when a Land Rover pulled up beside me. Quentin Tarantino steps out of it, and I almost hit him because he didn't bother to wait for me to pass. I apologized, having not realized it's him yet, and he says ' no pictures'. I stopped walking, looked at him confused and replied 'what the fuck are you talking about, sir'. He then puts his hand in front of his face and jogs inside. That's when I realized who he was. Haven't watched any of his films since. &&I met David Schwimmer once, and failed so hard at being super casual haha. 

For one, I didn’t want to bother him while he was eating, so I hatched a plan to grab a drink and sit outside while he finished, and I could stop him when he was leaving to say “hi mr schwimmer, I just want to say I watched Friends so much growing up, and still rewatch it to this day and want to let you know how much I enjoy your work”. 

Well, his dinner turned out to be some sort of business meeting, and over the course of 3 hours I may have had about 6 whiskey cokes, I almost missed him leaving, and rushed over going “ROS-mr schwimmer!” 

Did manage to say my thing, and he shook my hand and said thank you, before rushing off when someone else started running over. &&I ran into Mick Foley (Mankind) at Hershey Park on UPS day. He was with his kids. We passed each other, locked eyes, he saw recognition in mine... I nodded and got close to him and whispered “miiiiick” he whispered back “what’s up brother” and clapped me on the shoulder. We never broke stride and he appreciated it. Just having a day with his family. Who am I to ruin that by asking for an autograph?&&Al Borland from Home Improvement is a miserable boring man. He came into the store I worked in the local mall at the time (~97). Rude to every employee and fellow customer alike. Thought he was a lot more famous than he really was.

Walter Payton was the most genuine person I had ever met. Was completely kind and happy to see anyone say hello, even me.. a lowly cart pusher at the local grocery store in '94. Even stopped to ask me how soccer was going (played against his son Jared a few times), though I'm sure he didn't remember that. Once in heavy rain he even told me to feel free to move his car from the illegal spot in front of the store if the cops came. Shame it was only the Lexus.&&Only celebrity I ever ran into was the bass player for Cinderella, who made fun of me for going to the Duran Duran show.&&Weird fuckin fantasy man.&&Go to Manhattan/happening parts of Brooklyn. You run into famous actors all the time on the street, in the deli, the park etc. Celebrities like living in nyc because people give them space and treat them just like everyone else.&&/r/DunderMifflin &&Yeah, it's actually Carhartt WIP which is their more urban/streetwear-oriented selection. It's on Lafayette St. I got some pretty sick sunglasses on sale right before it closed. It was the last day of my trip.

He shook her hand and said “I loved you in ET.” She flipped the fuck out and got him kicked out&&I just checked eBay and there are a handful for sale at reasonable prices.&&You didn't like Kids? Wtf &&To each his own.&&Punk Rock was never any bigger than it was from like 1995-2005. All the bands that came up aping the Ramones started making the millions they never would. There was even a low key ska revival phase in there too. 

edit: sometimes i lay awake at night wondering if CJ ever got any of that t-shirt money. &&That Brad Pitt clip was brutal &&The editing/music makes it seem 50x worse than it really is. &&Jonah’s starred in some of my all-time favorite movies, real bummer to see him get shit-on by the Hollywood elite.&&When you're seen only as a comedic actor I'm sure it hurts too, not to mention a ""Fat"" actor.  Take Adam Sandler, for all his recent shitty movies, probably went down that road when he realized he'd never be taken seriously as an actor, and decided to sell out. 

He made punk drunk love, which is well liked, but I bet you he kept getting told he's a ""comedy actor"".  

You know what?  Fuck it, I'll say it, I like Sandler, his selling out means he makes shitty movies, but he makes bank doing it.  He wants a vacation with his buddies? He makes Grown-ups 2  He wants a couple million, he makes Jack and Jill or Pixels and product places the shit out of it.  Dunkachino with Pacino, caching!  

Edit: Since I'm already getting downvoted let me be clear.  I don't support his movies, or think he's making good content.  I support his selling out, which is clearly working because he keeps getting tons of money to make movies that take ""minimal"" effort from him.  I also don't think Hill is on the Sandler path, and I hope he never has to go that route.&&He killed it in a very good Martin Scorsese movie.  That alone in top tier.  But yeah, it's hard to break the general public perception.&&Which movie?&&And have you ever seen a vagina by itself?&&Yea but they don’t actually show dick going in which is an issue.

Until, well, that fateful day. 

But as a coworker and an acquaintance, I’ve never heard anyone having troubles with him. And they did it in a joking way. Directing is baptism by fire and they wanted him to find out the same way they did. &&This is the right answer. I knew that the antisemite stuff would come up but it really shouldnt have. Its all about being nice. Greta and Jonah both seem super nice so of course people would want to help them.&&[deleted]&&I kind of liked the film. Spoiler ahead, be aware. It's a film about addiction but in a _soft_ way. Porn ruined is love life, without him even noticing. It made him not enjoy his sex life and left him loveless. Then he find the personification of his porn dreams, a bombshell, that has nothing in common with him but has him by the balls. His _salvation_ comes from the first woman that really likes him for whom he is and shows him what love could be. It's ""strength"", IMHO, comes from the fact that it's a light film, it has not the usual pace of a romcom and the protagonist are still a little broken (but healing) at the end of the film. Still it dabble in some cliches already seen that kinda ruins the vibe, like his sister that speak only one time like the father in along came Polly (fuck I really miss P. S. Hoffman). It's enjoyable, not bad as a debut. This is of course my opinion, I'm not a critic, so it's not an in depth analysis of the techniques used, just of the final output in his entirety.&&I mean, that's a good thing though. Don John was a rom com, I don't think Nolan's style would have served it well&&I loved It.

Lady Bird was ok. Sort of like a prequel....its like Frances Ha is Lady Bird a few years into her move to the East Coast.

I didn’t want to bother him (plus the hooker I paid for would be gone in 20 min) so I just said thanks and walked away. I heard him call out, “Yo, have a good one!” as I walked away and I turned around and said “Yeah you too.”

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.&&A few weeks ago I was visiting NYC and happened to run into Jonah Hill in the streets of SoHo.

I didn’t want to bother him (plus the store was closing in 20 min) so I just said thanks and walked away. I heard him call out, “Yo, have a good one!” as I walked away and I turned around and said “Yeah you too.”&&Well, maybe if you didn't wear your Batman costume everywhere.....&&Or maybe he just turned and ran but you flowed only to find he was waiting for you at the entrance.

My partner and I argue-whispered back and forth whether or not it was him. Ultimately, the only thing we could really say to him was ""Hey, you're Oscar from the Office... nice"" and deemed it to be more annoying than complimentary so we opted to say nothing and just order a shitload of fries.

That’s Shaq!” I turn my head back as we keep walking and he’s giving me this look like, “You’re damn right that’s Shaq”.

CJ is legit though he's worked at Home Depot and shit to support his family.&&iirc it was a running gag between Jonah an his circle. They knew he was trying to be a serious actor apart from a comedian so they were giving him shit for it.

i really hope its unintentional as in he's talking about ""actors who normally play serious roles because that's what he personally likes and is able to relate to"" as opposed to meaning ""comedic actors arent serious actors"".

either way, it sucks for jonah to be caught in the crossfire like that.&&Yeah no doubt of that's how it went down, what a dick. &&[deleted]&&Sandler and PTA made Punch Drunk Love, which was a goddamn masterpiece.

I really disliked *While We're Young*. So much. You know every Woody Allen movie ever? Take the most faux-philosophical pretentious line from them (and every unlikeable character) and put them into a movie. There, you have *While We're Young*.

It's the only Baumbach film I've seen so I'm still going to give his really acclaimed ones (*The Squid and the Whale*, *The Meyerowitz Stories, Frances Ha*) a chance.&&¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&&Pitch forks you **SAY!?**&&I haven't been fucked like that since Rick Astley.&&How has this copypasta not been adapted into a feature-length film starring Jonah Hill?

I see it all the time lately.&&God bless your heart.&&I was getting into an elevator with a coworker and there’s this big guy standing in there. I got in last and saw him say something like “Hey, what’s up X” and shake his hand. I was confused as hell and my coworker just said “this is X.” I look at him and go  “oh nice to meet you” and the guy kinda smiled back and waved. 

When we got off the elevator he told me the guy was a really famous rapper from the 80s/90s, one of the guys who you prob wouldn’t know unless you were a big fan of rap since he helped lay down the foundation of it. Just thought the exchange was cool and respectful and it looked like the guy appreciated it.&&#WHERES THE CARHART STOREEEE&&And he was at the entrance... I didn’t expect that I would ever find love like this. Jonah Hill became my life I never thought I would ever find someone like this, without him there was no beauty in the world, he brought out the real me. 

He took me to the centre of a night club near NYU on the brightly lit dance floor that my eyes locked with his. At fist glance I knew it was love. We boogied over to each other. Our eyes never broke gaze and when our bodies touched for the first time sparks flew. 

I was in love.

It started to get very crowded on the dance floor when Jonah asked me “hey, wanna go somewhere quieter” to which my answer was an obvious “yes”. 

We walked out of the night club hand in hand, I had never felt like this before he made me feel wanted and safe. I was very quickly falling in love. 

We had been wandering round for about 10 minutes talking about everything and anything when all of a sudden a large group of very macho men came over to us, Jonah being ever the gentleman stood in front of me  and puffed out his chest to show authority, this turned me on slightly. The men came closer to us, all of them had puffy red eyes like they had either been crying or smoking shit loads of weed, I was so scared but my baby Jonah was here to protect me. 
One of the larger men stepped closer to us he had no shirt on, his body was covered in green tattoos and scars from previous fights, he got closer.

“No, get back” shouted Jonah making me jump, the man moved back, I looked at Jonah, he had rage and fury in his eyes, yet again this turned me on. 

“Shut up pretty boy, and give me the redditor” the large man with tattoos shouted, the other men in the group laughed, I was so scared it hurt, I didn’t know what to do would the love of my life Jonah stand up for me or would he leave me for dead?&&Unrelated but sort of related. A few years ago one of my roomates went out of town. He left an open bag of Chips Ahoy Chewy on the counter. One night when he was gone on his trip I ate like 5. I then thought to myself, if I eat the whole box and throw away the box I’ll never get caught and he’ll second guess if he ever had cookies in the first place. It worked. &&Brothers of Beelzebub or my sisters little boys. Both are competent cookie thieves.&&At my house snacks get opened and eaten super fast until it gets down to the last few.

hard to say about leo though. maybe he got a friend to film jonah's reaction before joining in.

maybe it's just a starstruck fan who was filming jonah because he was just standing there, and then by coincidence caught leo joining in.

maybe it was paparazzi who tend to follow these people around.

And 2) well, I was there for an hour because I was having a couple drinks anyways, and by that point my roommate also came over because she loves friends haha.

Whenever I think of CJ I think about him asking about the t-shirt money. I've always wondered if at some point, after Johnny died, they might've cut him on it.

I'm kind of surprised Marky doesn't get anything off Merch sales. He was in the band way longer than Tommy ever was. &&It amazes me people still don't get it's a joke they're both in on.&&It was a joke. It was obviously a joke. &&I haven't watched the clip yet, but BP is one to say that. lul.&&Spanglish is definitely worth checking out as well for a more serious Sandler. I kinda think he just makes fun movies with his friends (through his own production company) by choice though, not because people didn't appreciate his serious roles. 

He still does serious roles here and there, but he makes an absurd amount of money making his own movies. And yeah, they're varying quality, but it's not really all that divergent from what he's been doing his whole career, so it's weird people hate on him. &&Reign On Me was even better-- guy whose family was killed in 9/11.

Maybe a little unrelated, but check out Resolution, if you haven’t seen it. Then watch The Endless. &&you're a legend. I have a couple but haven't watched yet, and just watched SAM this past weekend. Happily adding more yo my wishlist.&&Sidenote to 7. The Disaster Artist.

You are welcome sir/ma'am.&&A few weeks ago I was visiting NYC and happened to run into Jonah Hill in the strets of SoHo. I said what’s up and he looked afraid I was gonna be an overbearing fan, so instead I just asked him if he knew where the Carhartt store was (my phone had just died) and he told me which way to go. I didn’t want to bother him (plus the store was closing in 20 min) so I just said thanks and walked away. I heard him call out, “Yo, have a good one!” as I walked away and  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.&&Cause it's just cookies&&Looks like an under armor tee, the hat and shoes are probably the worst elements price-wise.&&[deleted]&&thanks for filling in the info!

https://youtu.be/F96wbQ698Z0&&Harder to get a crushed skull when you're wearing a space helmet. *taps noggin*&&SPACE IS BACK BABY

We've got this coming out, we had that beautiful shot from *Ad Astra* with Brad Pitt, we've got *First Man* out in October. Make more films set in space, Hollywood.&&Well, for now, the synopsis and poster look really good.&&In light of Burt Reynolds passing. Can we get Pedro a role to play Burt in a biopic?&&The is Movie is a fantastic slow burn. Saw it at SIFF this year. Don’t go expecting a big sci fi epic - it’s a very grounded “western”

The dudes that made this put sooooo much into the costume design, it is remarkable. So much so that they’re doing an art instillation with all the pieces here in Seattle soon (where this was made).&&Guarantee the directors of this get snapped up by some big studio. Those visual have no right to be in a movie with such a low budget. &&Seeing Jay Duplass' name makes me want a mumblecore set in space. &&Man Pedro Pascal is in everything at the moment.&&Looks almost as good as Prometheus, wait let me take my helmet off to poke this alien with razor sharp teeth.....&&Narcos goes to Mars&&This is such a great nostalgic retro poster - fantastic work and posters lately became boring but this one is outstanding.&&Great poster. &&Wow that is one good looking poster! 

I remember hearing/seeing a teaser of this film a while back, looks very promising. 

And I gotta say, it feels good seeing Pedro Pascal in interesting projects like this! &&I will always upvote Oberyn! &&Teaser trailer for this film, and one of the best trailers I can remember seeing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt81Q-6BigI&&I've been waiting for this since the first images/ teaser were dropped. Does it have a release date now? I can only find some dates for film festivals, unfortunately. Can't wait to see it!&&I saw a special screening in a graveyard as part of a big film series over the summer as a prerelease screening (not a film fest or something). I recognize that it's not entirely accurate, but when I was asked what I thought immediately after I said, off the cuff, ""it's like Beyond the Black Rainbow but in the woods and in space."" Atmospheric in the same way though more cohesive and with a coherent plot. It made really good use of it's setting. The relationships are sparse but dynamic, and that fits the film well. I'd say it's better going in cold, though I didn't spoil anything.&&Trailer- https://youtu.be/F96wbQ698Z0

Looks good!&&Hot damn old school late 70s early 80s sthle poster love it. Also anything with Pedro Pascal is amazing 🍻&&That poster reminds me so much of Aliens.

Also Pedro is in it.

Also sci fi 

Please be good.&&an *original* space movie featuring people Iv'e personally never heard of before??

sign

me

up!&&Now *this* is a great looking poster!&&This was at SWSX but I never saw it come to theaters again. When is it being released?&&I got to see this at SXSW this year - it's very much in the spirit of Firefly. It's about damn time we had another true space-western.&&is this the remake of the 2013 prospect?&&In light of Burt Reynolds passing. Can we get Pedro a role to play Burt in a biopic?&&JAY FRIGGIN DUPLASS? I've been following these brothers for years, Mark and Jay are fucking brilliant. Fantastic to see him in something (presumably) high budget like this! Their documentaries are amazing, but I feel in love with Jay watching Transparent, so we know he can pull off dramatic acting. &&I worked on this movie! A bunch of it was shot near me in Seattle. Pedro was pretty funny. He does an impeccable impression of the “Honey Badger Don’t Care” video. &&I can't wait for this. They don't bring out enough sci fi movies&&If you are in Germany between 20 and 29 Sept, you can watch it during the Fantasy Film Fest. Pick your city here: http://www.fantasyfilmfest.com/dt-film/Prospect.html&&Wow, holy shit.  Planet looks Earth-like and they're still wearing environment suits.  Fucking solid man.  See this, Ridley Scott?  Fuck you, dude.&&I like Sci Fi with Tension and atmosphere. Close Encounters is my favourite. A lot of new Sci Fi is just Superheros in space. &&I've already seen Pedro Pascal die the worst death possible... nothing scares me.&&I acted in a musical in downtown Chicago with Sophie 4 years ago.  I quit acting after it and had no idea what she’d been up to since. Clearly she’s been working hard haha. Congrats sophie! &&one of my film professors is friends with one of the director/writers, Chris Caldwell. im literally sitting in class listening to an interview he's having with him as i scroll through reddit to see this poster. so cool&&Saw an early screening of this. Really good and really fun. Pedro and Sophie play well off each other.&&Saw this @ SXSW last March! Definitely one of my top movies from the fest.  It follows like a western/suspense thrill ride & does not disappoint. &&YOU KILLED HER!

YOU RAPER HER!!

YOU MURDERED HER!!!

So I’m going to space 

/s/ The Red Viper&&Damn dude, I don't know if I've ever gone from knowing nothing about a movie to being completely sold just based on a poster...&&I hope they don't put stupid lights in the actors helmet so you can see their faces, this small detail irks the hell out of me in scifi movies.  No way is the actor going to see out in a dark place with lights beaming in his fucking helmet. &&Going to see that at Fantasy Filmfest next week, am very excited!&&The box art sold me. I don't even need to know the plot. Just point my wallet in the right direction. &&Don't forget your helmet, Pedro!&&Now that's a fucking poster.&&Looks good&&Yesssss, I love me some space sci-fi. &&Getting heavy annihilation vibes from this poster. Nice art.&&I literally know none of those actors. That kind of makes me want to see this. &&Every few weeks I look up this movie to see if they've finally announced a release date, good to see that we finally got one. &&I am sure this movie will be 
#mindblowing&&The trailer looked dope.&&this gonna be good&&Love the poster, giving me new hope nostalgia.&&I'm not surprised to see Pascal getting more work, which is awesome, because he's fantastic. But I am surprised to see Jay Duplass getting more mainstream work because he's known as such an indie guy, but I fuckin LOVE IT, the world needs more Jay Duplass in everything. I want that motherfucker to start getting that ""renowned character actor"" steady work, I want to see him pop up in everything. &&Two thumbs up. 👍👍&&I swear there was a short film with this exact same premise that came out a few years back. It looks just like this does, anyone have link or know what film I'm talking about???

Edit: Here it is [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeekearl/prospect-a-handmade-sci-fi-short), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448526/) Its even called Prospect.  Description: Prospect is the unusual coming-of-age story of a teenage girl on a toxic alien planet. She and her father hunt for precious materials aiming to strike it rich. When the father is attacked by a roving bandit, the daughter must take control.

Edit 2: Its the same people just making it into a full length film. So cool!&&The poster has an early 1990s direct to video vibe to it. And I mean it in a good way.&&I'm glad sci fi like this film gets made, where the sci-fi part is less important than the people. I like most Sci-fi anyway, but I always liked the stories where the tech was just normal and the film is more interested in the people than showing off cool gadgets, long shots of space ships, etc.

Like Moon, where it cool it's on the moon, but the film could have been in Canada and still been impactful.

Alien is also like this.&&Why does this look like Deadspace to me? &&The trailer looks pretty damn good. Excited for this one!&&This looks better than the promotional poster for ‘Venom’.&&This looks intriguing, I can't wait to watch the trailer to show me the entire movie.&&Fuck yeah space sci-fi movies are coming back this year&&PLEASE LET PEDRO LIVE OKAY.

I don’t think I could take another meat-grinder or Mountain again... 

Anyway this looks fantastic! I cannot wait for more Pedro!!&&I’m a simple man, I see something with a Duplass brother I watch it.&&Saw this in Utah earlier this month. Really enjoyed it. &&Now this is what i call a movie poster (looking at you Venom!).&&I don’t know anything about this movie, but that poster is amazing.&&This is a great damn poster. Love the aesthetic &&What a unique looking poster!!!!!!&&I loved this film.&&More Sci fi is always positive and the cover looks interesting I guess? Hope it turns out good&&Already out in limited theaters.  My friend just checked it out last night.  Can't wait to talk to him on Monday about it.  Still have to watch the short beforehand so I know what I'm getting in to.&&Beautiful poster.&&Will they be taking of their protective suits and equipment to touch strange looking alien life for no reason?&&How long was I asleep for? Don't know any of these people.&&Bummed I missed the local showing :/ looks cool though!&&Why is there a man in a glass port-a-potty?&&The trailer started out a ""No"" for me, but quickly changed. Now, I'm pumped for this. &&I'm so excited for this movie. Showed it to my friend who likes sci-fi and westerns, kinda bummed he didn't seem too keen. &&Why does IMDB say this was released in March but I haven't heard of it before, and the first poster is only being released now?&&Yep. That's what it says. &&I don't know if this movie will be any good, but that is one fine ass poster.&&Fookin laser sights&&Space movies, so hot right now. &&For a second I thought that was Neil Degrasse Tyson at the top left&&Damn, seems like 'people in spacesuits' is so *HOT* right now.&&I love Pedro Pascal&&So happy Pedro Pascal is a leading man on the big screen now &&Calling it now: he dies from explosive decompression with his eyes popping _out_ of his skull this time&&Nova Prospekt&&Is it just me or does Pedro Pascal look like [Black Space Man](https://i.imgur.com/aQ3HfIR.jpg) but with a astronaut's helmet on in that pic?&&Deep fried poster&&So this is Oberyn in space?&&I have not seen anything about this movie nor heard of it until this poster. I'm sold from the poster. Also, I'm always very interested in anything the Duplass brothers are doing.&&What’s the synopsis?&&Looks like dead space the movie. &&Since Burt Reynolds died and my youtube is full of YOU MAY LIKE ALL THESE BURT REYNOLDS vids, i do believe Pedro could play young Burt in a Deliverance remake. &&I heard about this ages ago, and the internet says it's already out but I can't for the life of me find where to watch it. Any ideas?&&Sci fi thrillers are back. Between the Martian, Interstellar and kind of Passengers it's been building back up &&Space Agent Peña&&Agent Peña, are you familiar with the Mars drug cartel?&&Outland?&&What's with every poster nowadays looking like the old star wars posters&&Corpus in bottom left?
&&8/10...too much water. &&Who? who? and who?&&Looks like a SyFy movie filmed in Vancouver BC.&&I don’t trust it just yet&&I was just wondering, is there any subreddit for movie posters?&&Is it really a thriller when they put the whole movie in the trailer? &&[looks like a Drew Struzan poster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Struzan)&&So is this movie going to be released to theaters soon? How can i watch it? ive rewatched the trailer 10 times.&&Hmm everywhere on the web it's said that it comes out on march 2018 which is like 4 months ago??? What's the real release date?&&I like the aesthetic of the poster, it reminds me of Star Wars&&The Red Viper of Mars&&Please don't be Jupiter Ascending!

Please don't be Jupiter Ascending!

Please don't be Jupiter Ascending!

Goddamn, I remember when I first walked into the theater to watch Jupiter Ascending on my birthday, and it took me 10 minutes tops to realize I made a horrible mistake.&&Is he gonna be the bad guy? Every movie I’ve seen with him which is two he was the good guy gone bad. &&Oof &&Is it just me, or does Pedro look eerily like Burt Reynolds?&&Honestly they had me at “Pedro Pascal”&&Pedro looks great

&#x200B;&&He really finally made it. In Kingsmen 2 he didn't even get billing in the trailer (I guess his agent had to work with what he got) , and now he got top billing.&&I’m really happy he’s still getting work post Game of Thrones. Sometimes actors will be great in shows, then just disappear afterwards&&This and that one with Brad Pitt are both looking to be great. I'm glad sci-fi/space films are getting more attention in recent years.

Edit: the Brad Pitt one is apparently called ""Ad Astra"" &&No Man's Sky - The Movie &&Please God bring back tight 70's sci-fi scripts again. No bolted on love interests, no bloated comedy, no over the top action sequences. I hope this is good.&&Uhhhh 82% Rotten Tomato score on an unreleased movie? &&[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7946422/?ref_=nv_sr_1)&&How does it have a score already?&&So no aliens/monsters?&&With Sheila Vand! Very excited for this cast!&&How can rotten tomatoes give it an 82% already when it’s not even out????&& I hope there's no Mountains in space.

&&No. It’s Spanish Jeremy Renner in Space Hurt Locker&&I'm hoping this is a warmup for him playing Marco Inaros in the upcoming season(s) of /r/TheExpanse.&&Soy el fuego 🎵 &&He's really had quite the career since Game of Thrones, where he was pretty much an unknown actor. Narcos, all sorts of movies and he's going to be on Broadway next year too in a production of King Lear. Good on him!&&Pedro Pascal?


Fucking

Sold&&Saw it at a screening in June in Seattle, it's a rad movie and Pedro Pascal is great.&&My thoughts exactly. &&That should have been the title: “Pedro Pascal in Space.” DOUBLE SOLD!&&he looks like  jeremy reiner

the same way benicio del toro looks like brad pit&&That was my exact thought process.&&""You killed my planet. Prepare to die.""&&I don’t even know what the film is about and I want the poster on my wall&&I love the super classic style &&When a poster gets you interested in the film, it's done its job. That's rare these days.&&I like the guy on the space toilet in the middle.&&No comment on this movie in particular but I’ve noticed a lot of budget b-movies nowadays have way better poster design than most Hollywood movies. &&This work is awesome! Did you notice how the characters are stacked in a spiral like a drill! Colors and everything great too. Lol one thing would have changed posture on guy in the tank but I could never make a movie or poster so what do I know. &&Completely agree. Looks like the work of Drew Struzan to me. &&It looks like it has been made to look like a Drew Struzan poster.&&I feel like they could have done without the lens flare. But other than that, I love it. &&That’s the first thing I thought of as well. One of the best posters I’ve seen in a long time.&&I wonder if it’s Paul Schipper?&&I'm kind of a low budget / hobbyist filmmaker and I remember the filmmakers showing off their work in the camera forums I frequented at the time Prospect was released. They were just another one of 'us', putting together little short films. This is a little surreal to see them at this point making a genuine sci fi theatrical release.&&Is it the one with the weird practical effects? I feel like I saw something for this movie a year or two ago.&&I saw it at SXSW, it was a great indie sci-fi flick. Up there with Moon for me. &&I was thinking the same thing thanks!&&Thanks for sharing this. That made my morning.&&Is this the same movie? https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448526/&&Yeah. I remember when the film was announced. The short was so good that I was super excited for a feature. &&Holy shit this movie is going to be an incredible emotional bummer.&&cool! nice find&&Thank you for the link! I see that Dust is part of the production, I wonder if it originated from one of their short films.  They have some great stuff that I would LOVE to see made into full-length films.

As far as this movie, I'm intrigued!&&Bubbles!&&Well you can always get a exploded skull by removing it&&I like when space movies highlights the human qualities like grit, perseverance, and sheer ""I don't give a fuck"" that makes amazing feats in space possible. A pretty cliché example of this would be the docking scene in Interstellar. To me at least, it tells me that it's NOT impossible. Pretty stupid actually, but I'm doing a degree in mechanical engineering simply because Interstellar inspired me so much when I watched it fresh out of high school. I wanted to build rockets.

On the other hand, I also love it when movies or sci-fi stories are set where humans have *already* colonised the stars. It shows a ""what-if"" scenario that I hope when young people watch it they think hey, let's make this possible.&&BRING IT ON!! &&[Claire Denis’ High Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4827558/) also looks really good and had been getting great reviews out of film festivals.&&Not sure about whoever Sophie Thatcher is given her IMDb but hopefully she'll be a pleasant surprise and new face in the acting world.

Edit: Thatcher not Turner&&I'm glad I'm not crazy thinking that he looks JUST LIKE Burt.&&Yes please!! I remember something floating around where his inspo for Agent Whiskey was Burt.&&Old white people would burn America to the ground if they saw a non-white actor playing their precious Burt Reynolds. It'd actually be entertaining to watch all the commotion..&&I'm a big fan of space westerns. Firefly was awesome. Sign me up!&&Greta Gerwig as the first woman on Mars. I want that so bad.&&Seeing Jay without Mark was kind of shocking. I guess they really did “break up.”&&Does he ever not have a mustache?&&The spice must flow.&&Marscos.&&Spaaaaaaceeee Cooooooookkke!&&Nostalgic. I was thinking it reminded me of Stranger Things in some way. I want to see this now.&&I can't remember where I saw it, but there's a video out there about the artist who designed all the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movie cover arts, and this seems to really be inspired by his style.&&The new trailer is out now as well: https://youtu.be/F96wbQ698Z0 &&Nov 2 according to [io9](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-sci-fi-gold-rush-gets-dark-and-dirty-in-the-latest-1829119486)&&They just got the film picked up over the summer so I don't think there's a date quite yet. Saw a trailer a while back and have been wanting to see this since. Looks like Apocalypse Now in space or something, ha. &&On trailer 2 for the film on YouTube, I saw it said in theaters November, but I don’t think it mentioned a specific day yet.&&Welp. I’m sold.&&
I've been waiting for half a year for any information about release. I think the film is coming to theaters in November and a digital release will be in 2019.&&November 2nd in LA/NYC and November 9th it will expand nationwide. International details coming later&&Same guys! They made it into a feature.&&It's indie, very much not high budget.&&Ya know, if they didn't do this people would complain that you can't see the actors' faces very well.&&Judging from the trailer posted above, that won't be an issue in this movie. &&I was the Production Designer on this film, I can guarantee we don’t have lights inside the helmets and we were very conscious of this during production. The DP/Director cleverly used external and natural light to light up faces when necessary. &&The color scheme and the fact that the guys on the bottom left have ribbed armor like the Engineer Suit. &&Not even Pedro Pascal? He's been in a lot of cool shit recently. Narcos, Game of Thrones, Kingsmen...&&I'd watch that... crew are inside the ship, Neil opens mouth... gets floated.&&It’s been at festivals up to this point. It is getting a wide release in November. &&Star Wars sells&&Pedro Pascal achieved popularity through his role as ""Oberyn Martell"" on HBO's Game of Thrones and has featured in a few larger films since then like ""Great Wall"" and ""Kingsman: The Golden Circle.""

Jay Duplass is the brother to Mark Duplass (best known in the independent scene for films like ""Creep"" and ""The One I Love"") whom he has worked on multiple projects with, mostly smaller productions. He's acted in a lot of TV, like ""The Mindy Project.""

I don't know much about Sophie Thatcher, but it looks like she was part of the cast of 2016's ""The Exorcist"" TV series. Hope that helps.&&Washington State / Seattle actually!&&Played festivals last year - got picked up for distribution over the summer. I caught it at SIFF&&The Red Planet Viper?&&Burt Reynolds #2&&This sounds like something out of the Red Rising series.&&fighting the space cartel&&I was so pumped for that film. Managed to talk my girlfriend (not a SF fan but always partial to a bit of Channing Tatum) into seeing it; with popcorn, drinks. sweets and parking the cost came to SIXTY FUCKING QUID (maybe $85?).

I'd rather have taken that money and given it to a homeless man to spend two and a half hours punching me in the face and pouring scabies mites into my eyes and ears.&&I fucking loved Jupiter Ascending and I don't care who knows!! 
  
Edit: There are dozens of us! Dozens!!&&The only fun part of that movie was the impressions we did of Eddie Redmayne and his unintelligible asthma voice.&&What a let down that shit of a movie was. Bad casting for the two lead characters is what killed it for me. &&At least you didn't go to watch Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children thinking you're going to watch new Harry Potter movie.

A mistake realized while sitting on a coffee inside cinema, 5 minutes before it started.&&[deleted]&&Kingsman: The Golden Circle! Which other one?&&Not Narcos and GOT but they’re tv shows. &&I like Pedro. I swear if the next movie I see with him does the same thing I'm gonna be so pissed. &&I'm glad sci fi like this film gets made, where the sci-fi part is less important than the people. I like most Sci-fi anyway, but I always liked the stories where the tech was just normal and the film is more interested in the people than showing off cool gadgets, long shots of space ships, etc.

Like Moon, where it cool it's on the moon, but the film could have been in Canada and still been impactful. 

Alien is also like this.&&It’s the new western. Firefly once again shows it was ahead of its time &&What’s the one with Brad Pitt?&&One of the big flavors that studios, agents, and prodcos have been clamoring for in the last year or so is ""grounded sci-fi"" so expect the market to be saturated with them for the next couple of years.&&What's the Pitt one, and do either have trailers?&&Two hours of Pedro Pascal shooting lasers at rocks.  Well.  Until the directors cut two years later when they actually show whatever this is supposed to be. &&*Units Recieved*&&*extreme sentinel planet*&&More like Cannibal Holocaust... in space&&With Danny DeVito and Doug Jones as Polo and Nada, and Andy Serkis as everybody else in the universe. But I mean literally Andy Serkis, countless identical iterations of Andy Serkis. Loop 16 is really acting out.&&> but there are others

Nope&&I’m getting more borderlands vibes by that to be honest&&I saw this movie at SIFF earlier this year and it has none of those things. It was one of my favorites of the festival; it's really good.&&Have you watched The Expanse yet?  Pretty much ticks all those boxes.  It's fucking amazing.&&It's been shown at festivals.&&It's actually quite common for composers to record the music ahead of time rather than play it live .&&I'm guessing it played at a few film festivals, which allowed some critics to review it early. &&I have such a big crush on her. She was awesome in A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. &&It's been shown at film festivals&&SAY HER NAME&&Those aren't mountains.&&YOU RAPED HER!

YOU MURDERED HER!

YOU KILLED HER CHILDREN!!!

edit: he's going to have a bad time at Disney Land...&&**TOO SOON**

^^^^^^^^^cries&&Didn't you see interstellar? There are waves. &&He shouldn't forget to wear a helmet.&&I swear to God I consistently forget over and over that was Pascal, despite that being (I'm pretty certain) my first introduction to him. I just can't look at him and not see Javier Pena from Narcos. 

Huh and apparently one of his first roles was in an early episode of Buffy, I'm gonna have to rewatch that one.&&*Those aren't mountains...*&&There are waves though.&&IDGI?&&El Hawko Eyeo? &&Man I just finished the first season yesterday! I'm not even thay big into sci-fi but that show is SO good. Worth a watch for anyone that can appreciate a good story and characters!

Edit: spelling&&I hadn't even considered this, but it would be *so fucking good*.&&Hopefully season 5... season 4 should pretty much exclusively be set on New Terra, or at least I hope. &&Question, cause I haven't seen the second season yet, but Inaros doesn't appear until like book 5 right? After everything with the gate and the new colonies, are they that far into the series already?&&That... Would be marvelous.&&oh holy shit that would be amazing.

oh wow holy shit that would be wonderful.

(mind totally blown, he would be perfect)&&Waitwhat he's going to be in The Expanse?  Yeeeeeeeesssssss..&&He is playing Marco? Damn, I would rather see him a good guy, then crazy ~~freedom fighter~~ terrorist. &&Que arde tu piel 🎵&&He got one of the most memorable characters in the entire show. Even ignoring the show, Oberyn Martell is a huge fan favorite in the books. Quite remarkable considering he was only in a few chapters in one book out of five.&&Pedro Pascal?

Fucking&&Dude I am so happy this guy has succeeded in his career. He was awesome as Oberyn and then took it too another level in Narcos. He’s the cool guy I aspire to be. &&I was there too! Incredible movie, gives me the shivers just thinking about it.&&Sometimes other redditors just know me.&&This was one of my thoughts too, love the classic look. &&Looks like an old Atari cartridge, nice&&Immediately it reminded me of being a kid in the mom and pop VHS rental store, seeing the illustrated art collage covers of movies from the late 70s through 80s and even I think up until the very early 90s they still did them. 

It sure did the trick to beg and plead my parents to rent it, no matter how crappy the movie ended up, I judged movies by their cover at that age wholeheartedly. &&It's a mini bacta tank! &&That's just how people claim mining prospects in the future. You can't call something ""yours"" until you crap on it.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I don't know if it was one of theirs, but it is based on a short film that came out a while back. I'm really excited because the short felt like it could expand really well into a feature.

Let's make it real. &&I went into mechanical engineering partly because of Ghost in the Shell, so I wouldn’t call it stupid.&&> Pretty stupid actually, but I'm doing a degree in mechanical engineering simply because Interstellar inspired me so much when I watched it fresh out of high school. I wanted to build rockets.

I'm sure that everyone involved in making the film would be enormously pleased to hear that. Don't be ashamed that art inspired you to tackle a challenging path, that's a wonderful thing. &&Sophie Turner is Sansa Stark. The actress in this is Sophie Thatcher. &&I saw this movie when it played at Seattle International Film Festival earlier this year and while Pedro is the definite star of the movie, Sophie holds her own and develops a good chemistry with Pedro. For it being her first feature length film, I was quite happy.&&I've been finding ways to say it for a while now. I'm happy YOU make me not the only one!&&Take it to the bank boys, this one's just like Burt&&Maybe it was just the accent, but he reminded me of Nathan Fillion in the trailer&&As a Malaysian I can't tell the difference. Pedro Pascal looked m white to me.&&Ummm, hispanics can be white. Spaniards are white. Many Chileans are white. Pedro Pascal is white, descended from Europeans. Not sure if you’ve studied history, but lots of Spaniards and other Europeans immigrated to south america.&&Like how black people got upset when Joseph Fiennes was going to play their precious Michael Jackson? That commotion was entertaining to watch too right?&&It reminded me a lot of Bone Tomahawk (from speech, to pacing, to cinematography) but in space. It very much takes a “realistic” route on future space state - it’s not lasers and galactic warfare - it’s simple folks trying to get by on the new frontier of space.

This movie LOOKS gorgeous. See it on a giant ass screen. &&What do you mean? Jay and Mark have been doing separate stuff in terms of acting for ages but still produce together.&&They broke up? That sucks. &&So you're telling me he should be Mario in the next Super Mario movie?&&Cool!&&Good! That pretty much gaurantees it won't be an overblown CGfest&&Yea exactly, I hate this as well but at some point you gotta make it a little easier for some people to make the connection. Like Game of Thrones, no one wears a helmet anymore, if you're important. &&Awesome! I will definitely watch this then.&&Brilliant, thank you&&*The Viper of Mars (Red)*? First of a trilogy?&&Wait, Scabies are mites? &&I haven’t seen the movie, but I liked this comment.

‘Amid the criticism, the film picked up an enthusiastic following, particularly among female sci-fi fans who have embraced the film with the general attitude of: ""This movie is garbage, but it's OUR garbage!""’&&You are going through regular highway robbery if you're paying that god damn much for a movie date. What the actual fuck. Pay for parking, too? What the hell? &&I live in the UK now too and did the meerkat movie thing. Two for one and it still came to like £22. Absolute ripoff. Last time i was in a movie theater was 2016 and have no intention of going back.&&Holy shit. The plot was that bad?? Was it horrible writing all around or? &&[deleted]&&Just did this (not quite as much though luckily) to watch the new predator movie. It was so bad. &&I like Quasars also. &&Well, I'm consistently amazed by the diversity of the human race.&&The storyline sucked but the worldbuilding was INCREDIBLE.  I was so sure it was based on some existing comic/series of novels that had been years in the making and so disappointed that it wasn't (because I was looking forward to reading whatever it had been based on).&&'Anonymous cleaning girl by day, famous space princess by night has to thwart her evil intergalactic suitors from marrying her and stealing Earth' is a pitch that should've been a billion-dollar franchise. &&It had major problems, but I liked it and I knew what I was getting into when I went to see it.

Would have helped if Mila Kunis could act (Channing Tatum wasn’t great either, but has been good in some stuff). Sean Bean was obviously the highlight, though. Oh, also Eddie Redmayne, who seemed to be having a lot of fun.

Doors and corners.&&I’ll try it again. I just couldn’t get into the first episode and I quit after that. I don’t even think I finished the first episode, now that I think about it. &&It'd be perfect casting. Inaros needs to be evil and charming. Pascal or nobody.

And, man, talk about giving Holden an inferiority complex in the looks department. You [Steven Strait]. The guy Naomi tells you not to worry about [Pedro Pascal].&&The show runners have said that S4 episodes will alternate between Illus (not ""New Terra"", you Earther scum!) and the Sol system. I'm betting that you start to see elements of the start of Nemesis Games introduce themselves including perhaps scenes on Mars of everybody there freaking right the fuck out about the future of the terraforming project in light of 1300 new systems.&&New Terra? Surely you mean Ilus.&&I *hope* he'll be in The Expanse. 100% wish on my part and 0% based on actual info from the showrunners.&&Fuck yeah! I saw it at the Shoreline theater which ended up being a really cool venue, met the director, talked with him for a minute too!

""Nah, I'm good, doc gave me meds."" Fuck outta here with that shit... Literally, go home, away from people, especially coworkers.&&It could have - should have - been *so* much better, that's what's even more infuriating. The Cinema Sins bit on *Jupiter Ascending* is really hilarious if you have quarter of an hour or so.&&I can't remember but I think it was 3D - which adds another £2,50 to each ticket - and the parking would have been £2 or £3. Parking in London is a fucking *joke*, mate. There are parts of Central London where you can pay £10 or more for FIFTEEN MINUTES.... Most places, obviously, are nowhere near that, but it's still a fortune.

I've just learnt, however, that [New York is even more expensive](https://www.aol.co.uk/2016/12/03/the-most-expensive-place-in-the-world-to-park/?guccounter=1) - so fuck New York *and* London very much.&&Cinema prices are unreal over here. If you don't get *any* snacks/drinks etc  it's just about swallowable - but it's hard getting a kid (I have a seven-year-old) to accept that popcorn, sweeties and a drink aren't on the menu for the evening... ""Well, love, you can either get popcorn now, or have meals for the rest of the week: up to you.""&&It was just.... *silly*. It looked beautiful but there were so many plot holes and just general nonsense it was ridiculous. If you want to get an idea of what's up with it I really do recommend the Cinema Sins episode on it: it's one of the funniest ones IMO.&&Waterworld was a great movie. &&I really wanted to see more of that world.

While space opera can be shitty and played out (hell, people were saying it was a tired and uninspired trope as far back as the 50s and 60s), some of the best sci-fi there is is space opera. For example, many consider Iain M Banks' Culture series to be some of the finest SF literature ever written.&&Hey now, Space Opera can be *good* Sci-fi. &&Fringe is super tight, though. &&""It's the space toys, Woody!

It's become cool to hate mainly because Kevin Costner became cool to hate, but the movie itself isn't bad- it just wasn't what people expected at the time and it was marketed badly.

Something can be space opera but not sci-fi and vice versa, think star wars vs gattica. However, just because they are 2 seperate things doesn't mean something can't be both.

[We launched a plastic Rocinante into space to save the show](https://sentintospace.com/blogs/corporate-case-studies/spread-the-word-the-power-of-grassroots-campaigns)&&They're excellent. The book authors are also heavily involved in the show. I can honestly say the question ""is the book or show better?"" is totally pointless in this instance. They tell the story in one way with the books but have very smartly told the story differently for the show. It's like a case study in how you should know the media you're producing for and how best to use it. A visual medium like a TV show shouldn't just line-by-line retell the books which were intended as a literary medium.&&Yes! Really good, which is why I think the show has done so well. The writing is great and in some places a lot better than the show, my biggest gripe with the show is Chrisjens character. I think they absolutely got the right actress but in the books she is quite liberal with her swear words and was disappointed they didn't carry that little part across. It shows how well they have done when my biggest complaint is a character not swearing enough! If you like sci-fi and liked the show I can highly recommend the books, the audio books are great too!&&The books are absolutely fantastic, among my favorite sci fi series ever&&not as dark...much much weirder&&> Also, you can't just grab a freighter and burn out to a newly discovered planet and just have it magically be yours. That's now how this works!

[TRIGGERED]

Me gonna come down ta Eart and kick you ass, wellwalla! ... after I take a shitload of Osteo-X, hit the gym to build up my muscles so I can stand up in 1G ...&&Same here - except this was a bed, not a couch - and it took fucking *months* to get rid of those little cunts. After a while I wanted to burn everything I owned and live naked for long enough to be absolutely sure that the ointment had worked; luckily it didn't get that far but, my God, it was close. 

You and I understand the intensity of that hell: people reading this without having gone through it won't have a fucking clue. It'll just sound like hyperbole to them. I tell you this, though: if I'd been told there was no cure for that, I would absolutely have killed myself. No question. &&Tbf a lot of cinemas here in the UK  don't charge for parking - and even in London there may be some that don't, but land/rents cost/s so much here that most businesses will take any chance they get to recoup some via parking charges. 

And woe betide you if you try to avoid paying. Traffic wardens (don't know what you call them in the USA: parking meter attendants?) here are a different breed of bastard. The road where I live is just off a busy shopping street, and within walking distance of four tube/train stations on lines going into the city centre; there's a big multi-storey car park over the shops, but it's often full and people come down my street looking for parking spaces. There are a few open to the public, but only at certain times of day; most spaces, and the rest of the day, are residents only.

There are frequently up to *four* traffic wardens walking this beat and the number of tickets they write is unbelievable.The pressure they're under to fill their quotas is diabolical and they're merciless (even amongst themselves: I watched a pair of them *running* to get to a car they knew was about to go over time, and one *tripped* the other one to win the race like something out of a cartoon). I've seen them take tickets off cars that have already been busted (the tickets are just left under the windscreen wipers) so they can write fresh ones (not sure how that works internally but presumably they do it to hit quota, just saying the original ticket wasn't there - and if it's your car I guess if you complain and take it to court you'll only have to pay one fine - but that's on you and if you *don't* protest, boom, that's *two* lots of eighty pounds to pay); I've seen one give a ticket to a woman who got back with her kids *one minute* after time, who broke down sobbing because she couldn't afford the fine and the guy just looked at her and said ""Well you shouldn't have been late then"" (that one almost got him laid out by my psycho neighbour who was watching this with me just by our doors and was actually *trembling* with rage and hatred).

They're absolute fuckers (and always have been: when I went to see *Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels* at the cinema two decades ago there was a round of applause at the scene where the traffic warden gets a beating) - and yes, I know it's wrong to generalise, they're just human beings doing their jobs, etc etc, but you won't be able to convince me that the interview process for becoming a traffic warden doesn't involve torturing small animals to death orinjecting a random passer-by with HIV or a fatal dose of radium.

There are various reasons why I don't own a car in London but parking is absolutely one of the most prominent.&&""Oh thank god"" *fiery explosion*&&I find that people come up with ridiculous reasons to not like a movie. As if it is cool to do.

Waterworld was entertaining. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the movie.

Like... I could spend a few million on my business pretty quick, but after that I just don't see the appeal of being super rich most of the time. That said, if I had Bezos cash, I would definitely do things like float Firefly and The Expanse. Why else be that stupid rich? I know the fact that I think that way makes me likely fundamentally different from the Bez.&&Yeah, I'm not a reader, partly because I enjoy the show so much I kind of don't want to spoil the plot reveals. I think I'll likely read after the show wraps for greater detail and space minutia.

I know they change some timelines of travel, and that totally makes sense. It would be so hard to capture a tense space battle broken up by a day of down time accelerating around a planet for a sling shot, or a week getting to or from the belt or something like that.&&I think Avaserala's lack of swearing has more to do with FCC regs than the character. We could possibly see an increase with if moving to Amazon.&&her swearing was limited because SyFy is on cable tv. now that it is on Amazon there is no restriction. they have said multiple times they are going to take advantage of the change! so get excited for the next season! &&It was genuinely a traumatizing experience. I was having phantom itching for years after.
&&It really was hell. Feeling disgusting and contagious and scared to touch anything, and never knowing when it was going to end.

Just kidding, it's freaking amazing :)&&In this context, it's fucking incredible. Season 3 of the expanse was better than the last season of GoT. They actually cramped a full book into half a season and fucking did it well (tbf that book had a lot that could be skipped and we're getting introduced to characters early so no need for exposition). &&Its an amazing scifi show and book series. Highly suggest it. The show starts off slow because the first season is only half of the first book but it really picks up near the end. It sets up a lot of world building for the next seasons in the first season though.&&[deleted]&&This is so weird.  This is reddit.  I was expecting this to turn into an argument by now.

I'm sure the campaigns didn't hurt but I also got the impression Bezos was all-in from the start anyway.

The international version does not.&&I'm getting it now just remembering it. FUCK THAT.&&Yes, I'm there with you! This actually happened towards the end of a year at university and I was back home with my family for four months - I was utterly terrified that it would spread and everyone else in the house would get it, and for a while I was contemplating living in my car to avoid that risk.

Altered Carbon though, that show’s the shit &&Yea, they really quickened the pace for season 3, however deffo my fav season so far. Can't wait for the free navy storyline and I'd absolutely love it if they got Michael Mando to play Naomi's ex, he'd fucking nail that role. &&Wow. She could cosplay as that superhero. Elektra.&&Nice. &&Hey fuck your mom&&o no&&That's definitely true. I'm sure it's way easier when all his other high level employees and investors look at it like a good idea, and he can use business money to float the show and make money off it instead of just ponying up a billion of his own skrill just to get a favorite show to keep running.

I definitely wrote Amazon and threatened to quit forever as a prime customer and shopper if they didn't save it.
