"Hey everyone, Guillermo here. I wanted the Reddit community to be the first to see the official artwork for my new film, The Shape of Water. Enjoy!",130227,77helj,https://i.redd.it/a7u9b600rusz.jpg,2847,1508447469.0,,"[deleted]&&Where’d you find a merman?&&*Premise*

*In 1962, a mute janitor and her colleague work in a government laboratory and eventually discover an amphibious creature in a water tank, known as ""The Asset"". The janitor, out of loneliness, befriends the creature and falls in love.*


Currently sitting at 97% on RT with 60 reviews. Really excited for this one.&&OCEAN MAN TAKE ME BY THE HAND LEAD ME TO THE LAND...&&I have this funny thought in my head where Fox's marketing head is like

> Let's try to hype up this movie by using Guillermo's old Reddit account to promote The Shape Of Water. Anybody remember the password?

and then they end up having to call Guillermo to be like

> Hey can you please check your inbox for the Reddit password recovery link and then choose a new password and let us know what it is?&&Is that a Drowner?&&I love your work, and thanks for what you do. Just wanted to put that out there before the inevitable flood of comments.&&im ready for sally hawkins’ oscar&&Is that Abe?&&Well done Pappy McPoyle!&&Does she get her shoe back?&&Amazing poster, also, I am super exited for the movie!!!&&All the best with your new movie dude. You've got great character style with a character behind them which I really love in my movies.&&Your name’s on this poster 9 times. Do you think that’s a bit excessive?&&Little did we know this would win best picture...&&Was very surprised to see that Guillermo from Jimmy Kimmel had a movie in the making. Then I realized I’m an idiot. &&I just want to say whether you see this or not, Mr. Del Toro Pan's Labyrinth changed my life and how I view film in general. I thank you for creating that film from the bottom of my heart. &&My wife is calling this the movie where the girl fucks a fish. I have to remind her that GDT is known for great movies with great storytelling.  
&&Can't wait!! 

Love me some Del Toro and pretty much anything Michael Shannon does :)&&So my wife and I have this running joke about how our 7 Year old son is like a mini Guillermo Del Toro.

This kid can spend hours with a pencil and a pad of paper, fill out the WHOLE thing with creature after creature that he's drawn from his imagination.

Sometimes it's animal hybrids (crossed a bear with a gorilla, called it a bearilla.  That was my personal favorite), sometimes it's dinosaur hybrids (I remember an ankylosaurus crossed with a triceratops he called an ankylotops).  

But his main thing is different variations on giant monsters.  He LOVED Pacific Rim and Godzilla.  He likes to do different versions of Godzilla where he combines him with his favorite super heroes.  He's done all the Guardians of the Galaxy, all the MCU Avengers, every X-Man.

I honestly don't know what to do with all these drawings.

Edit:

Had some requests to see some stuff...  Here are just few things I happen to have on my phone from pictures I took to send to family members...

https://imgur.com/a/JQLLY

First I figured I'd put on the artist himself.  Chillin in his Teen Titans Go! shirt.

Next is a spread I made after finding a stack of these on my kitchen counter.  Top row is Bumblebee and Optimus Prime.  

Second row is an Orca Godzilla, some kind of skunk monster (?), Pterodactyl, then an Incredible Hulk Godzilla.

Third Row: Honestly not sure.  The second one I know is a Girl Godzilla we had to convince him to draw.  He's seven so anything girlish is a big no-go.

Fourth Row:  Iron Man Godzilla, then the rest I'm not sure.

Next pic down is a picture he drew of Gollum that I loved...

Then we get into the Guardians of the Galaxy.  First is Drax Godzilla, Groot Godzilla, Rocket Godzilla.  Then below it's Ego, Yondu and Star Lord. &&Thank you, Guillermo. This movie looks like everything I love about your style and aesthetic. &&Looks like a Drowner. How’d you like that silver?&&OCEAN MAN. TAKE ME BY THE HAND&&The poster sure says Guillermo Del Toro a lot.&&Hey, Tell Hideo i said 'hi'. he'll know what it means&&ooooooooOOOOOOCEAN MAAAN&&Dear Mr. Guillermo, 

I just wanted to say how much I love and am grateful for your creations. You are one of the many reasons I am glad to be alive at this time in history.  Because you create new worlds and characters that reflect reality in such a powerful, but understated way. Because you have followed your heart to write and direct, this world is a better and more interesting place to live in. 

I was 16 when I went to see my first R-Rated movie. It was midnight, the opening night of Pan's Labyrinth and knew nothing about the movie. When I got there, the theater was close to empty, which I thought was odd.

But when the movie began, I was entranced.  I didn't expect this movie to combine history and fantasy in such a sublime way. I didn't know it would be so violent and terrifying. I didn't expect Ophelia's innocence and vulnerability to bring me to tears and make me wish I could reach in and rescue her. 

Seeing this movie full of violence, kindness, and bravery changed me as a person. I decided that people who refused or didn't like to watch subtitles, were stupid and didn't know what amazing art they were missing out on. I have felt empowered to write, even if I can't seem to do it well. Seeing that movie on my own was basically the first ""grown-up"" thing I had ever done. And it's a precious memory. Pan's Labyrinth will always have a special place in my heart.  

It is not the only film that I love, however. The Devil's Backbone is another personal favorite and masterpiece.  Pretty anything you have written, as well as directed, blows my mind.

You never go overboard. Everything is tastefully understated, but powerful. 

My only hope is that you continue to follow your unique aesthetic, your muse in creating more and more art. Whether they are movies, books, illustrations, virtual reality, open world games,  or poetry....  Please keep creating more and more. 

I am a huge fan of Pablo Neruda and Federico Garcia Lorco, by the way, so I am really hoping you also publish poetry one day. Because knowing what a beautiful mind and heart you have through your work makes me certain that you also write poetry. ☺️ 

I try not to see trailers or read synopses for your movies anymore. Because I love the surprise and experience of finding out on my own. I have only seen posters for The Shape of Water. I wonder what it will be like when I finally get to see it. Is it a moral tale? Will there be great love and suffering? Will there be tenderness and faith? All these questions just from a poster.... It's driving me crazy. 

I can't wait to find out! 
&&Just wanted to say that I saw the film at a critics screening a few weeks ago and loved it, everyone should see this if they have a chance.&&How the hell does this post earn 34k upvotes?&&He hasn't used this account in 3 years, I have a hard time believing he just randomly thought ""I should share this with reddit I bet they'd love it!""

Until he verifies that it's actually him this is PR pushing advertising on Reddit and we're currently upvoting  the shit out of it.&&You're really damn awesome, man.

Thanks!&&is this Bioshock: The Movie?&&Sir? You make amazing movies. Most of us like watching movies, and when I watch one of yours I am transported. You are a genius, sir. I could go on for pages about how the world you have made has affected millions. Suffice it to say that you are well-respected from people who have no idea the hell it must take to make a movie, and we appreciate your work more than you can ever know.

Please keep doing what you're doing!! &&You know, just once I'd like to see a romance movie between a man and a monster girl&&I had the wonderful opertunity of watching this film at TIFF on its first viewing.

People aren't upvoting this for the poster, they're upvoting because it's ""Guillermo"" but he hasn't verified it's actually him all.

He hasn't used that account in 3 years, the account hasn't answered any questions. It just dropped the post with the line ""hey it's Guillermo"" and ran off. Meanwhile the official Twitter and Facebook accounts for the movie have shared the same poster.

And even if he did verify it's him, if he isn't in the thread participating and taking questions, then this is no better than a celebrity using Twitter as their platform for advertising. It's setting a shitty precident that celebrity accounts can be used to get your ads to the front page easy.&&And it's now gotten more than 100k upvotes... I can't even remember the last thing that got that many. This is literally just an ad for a movie and got more upvotes than groundbreaking news stories with global, generational impacts.

In the last couple of days we've had Butch Harmon (creator of Fairy Odd Parents) post a picture in r/oldschoolcool before later posting a video that was essentially an advert; both times the title said 'hi, Butch Harmon here'.

Could be but I don't think so because just look at the creature, he looks just like Abe.  Also there is an intelligence factor to this creature, Abe was super intelligent and thoughtful, this creature does look ""like"" Abe but almost younger in a way, also when she plays the music the creature does a very familiar ""back flip"" swim thing in the tank, just like in Hellyboy, I think it is Abe Sapien, just a young Abe. &&I really want this to be the case but i feel like I'm just dreaming of a world where that's gonna happen.&&Oh fuck!!

edit. Sorry, these are damned lies. I tried to find sources to backup my memories, but turns out all I was remembering were rumors. I can find no source that definitively names Del Torro as officially being apart of the cancelled Bioshock movie. I did however find an article interview with Del Torro where he does say he was a huge fan of the game and would be happy to be apart of any film adaption. This is likely the source of the rumor. &&Well, the problem is that Abe Sapien *already* has an origin story:

http://hellboy.wikia.com/wiki/Abraham_Sapien

... and this isn't it.

I guess maybe what happened is that the IP holders wanted to stick to their canon and GDT decided to do something different.  Which is fine, I guess.  I would have preferred they stuck to the HellBoy mythos vs. making a romantic ""Mute meets Merman"" story.  But I guess that's me.&&[deleted]&&Okay now I'm excited.

Then the next 2 were in an empty theater. With just me in it. 

Went after work on Tues and Wednesday and the evening showings and was maddd super legit.
Tried sitting in every different spot too.

I found middle (obviously ) but a bit close to the front perfect.
Like first row ahead of the entrance level to be the best even for the Audio.

IMAX is obviously best, even LIEMAX is better than digital while it is good and my local one is really small so I didn't get digital the third time around, it made a difference.

That's absolutely possible.  Abe himself was a transformed occult researcher:

https://comicvine.gamespot.com/abe-sapien/4005-25795/

He could communicate with humans once he woke up.  Nothing like the wild animal in the movie. 

&&Except they found him in the tube he was imprisoned in, including the a paper note with the name ""Abe Sapien"" and the date of Lincolns assassination.  He was brought to B.P.R.D. immediately after he was discovered:

>Abe's real name was Langdon Caul, he was a scientist and occult investigator, and member of a secret society known as the Oannes Society. Langdon found an creature that looked simillar to a jellyfish and him and other members of the Oannes Society performed a ritual on it which ended with Langdon becoming a different species labeled Icthyo Sapien. The society imprisoned Langdon in a large tube of water in Washington DC. However, the Civil War forced the society to leave the building he was imprisoned in. He wasn't found until much later by a group of workmen.

>With no memory of who he was, Langdon took a new identity as Abe Sapien, from the last name of his species, and a piece of paper he recieved with the date of Abe Lincoln's assassination. Abe was taken to the B.P.R.D. where he was studied and almost dissected until he was saved by an empathetic Hellboy. After he was saved by Hellboy, Abe became a valuable field agent of the B.P.R.D.&&I adore Simon's confused look as he goes on, and is never corrected.

Then you come across a giant syringe full of glowing blue liquid; your guide doesn't mention it, you don't ask about it, you have no idea what it is. So, what do you do? You pick it up and jam it right into your forearm and inject all that glowing blue stuff into you. 

That part has never made sense to me.

Edit: people were asking, so I watched a couple Let's Play videos and they are never told to inject themselves.

We have *very* different opinions on movies.&&This is incredible.

That said, Upstream Color? And a section for experimental arthouse films that focus on cinematography?&&The Good, the Bad and the Ugly needs to be added in the Western's area. If it's there ignore this. &&I did the math. Assuming you actually watched all of these movies, and that you probably watched most of them 3 times or more in order to become familiar enough with them all to place them here, this map is probably the accumulation of 10 to 12 years of time spent looking at the screen.&&Kudos for u'r effort bro&&This..Is fucking awesome.&&I am preternaturally drawn to Mindfuck Forest.  This is brilliant.  Thank you!&&Brazil
Thx1138
If I knew you personally I would offer to kiss you on the mouth for this beauty. Thank you for introducing people to some of my favorite films.&&My life story has me blissfully alone after many hard years. Besides reading, I have decades of movies I've missed and wanted to catch up on, but I never know what to choose. I am SO out of touch I can't figure out how to choose movies. I was out of ideas after ""The Godfather"" LOL! This is going to be priceless for me!&&This is one of the most amazing thing I have ever seen regarding movies. I've contemplated the idea of making/someone else making this for years now, but I never thought it would be a reality. I gotta go change my pants now lmao.&&Wow. I am continually amazed by internet strangers who put a shit load of work into stuff like this that you share for free with other internet strangers...you da real MVP :) 

Thank you!!! I'm legit going to print this out and working my way through the ones I haven't seen. &&This is the greatest thing I have ever seen! You are a goddamn god to make something like this, seriously it's beautiful and extremely helpful when chosing a movie to watch. &&You, sir, are like well awesome.&&This is a great definition of ‘labor of love.’
Truly humbling and fascinating.
Int'l flick titles in the original language is a great touch.&&This is awesome. &&I am going to print this as a dart board. On movie night, we will throw three darts and pick one of the movies it lands on to watch. :)&&This image made my night!  I really appreciate all the effort that was put into this.  It's so fun to just wander over different parts of the map and randomly see movies I have seen/enjoyed.  Really like how you organized all of it!&&I want to make a poster of this and put it on my wall.&&5 gold? Deserved it. &&This is absoluteely fascinating&&You are a cruel, cruel person for putting 'Western Desert' in the East&&Please tell me you’re planning on making this interactive. It’s just begging for it. And if you’re not, can I do it?&&Holy fuck I can only imagine the stockpile of fucking adderall this guy/gal stumbled upon. Bravo &&Reservoir dogs is next to a reservoir lol&&westerns in the east. mind shattered. &&Makes me nearly want to start making my own. Great job.&&""Lolita"" in the valley of love? Gross. &&Jupiter Ascending is a must see movie?&&this is the most dedication with something I've seen in a long time. Congrats and beautiful job!&&Iron Man 3 is on that list. ""Must watch films"" yeah right.&&[deleted]&&This might be the biggest waste of time I have ever seen&&Sorry but Gravity is not a masterpiece. As a showcase of special effects, maybe.&&But... why?&&Where's Short Circuit? I would definitely have that in place of Wall-E&&Autism is gods gift to the world&&Great stuff.&&Glad to see that Andrea Arnold has multiple films on the map.&&This is a nice map. Will you be making any more in the future? &&So awesome! Nice work. How long did it take? Do you have a higher res image? I can't zoom in very far on mobile. Don't own a computer.


&&Very cool. Well done, lad, &&Man, this is amazing work! Just incredible  
  
^(why no Captain America: Winter Soldier tho?)&&Wow, /r/MapPorn will love this. Gonna spend my time reading this later!&&If you don't label Ghostbusters a masterpiece you're a goddamn monster.&&What's the resolution and could you make it bigger? 10/10 my friend &&Wow!Wow!Wow! Great work, if I had gold to give, I would surely.&&I was on board but then you threw your entire credibility out the window when I saw Dawn of Justice as a ""must see"" lol...jk I'm just giving you a hard time, still a nice map.&&[deleted]&&Oh my gosh this is really neat! I'm not much of a movie person so where do I start or do I just find a movie I've seen and go from there? &&This is legendary.&&Why is Casablanca in between Fantasy, Horror, and Action?&&Awesome. I'll be using this personally. Cheers&&This is amazing&&This is so awesome and it’ll take me days to go through and see all the connection you made with different movies and genres. Would LOVE to see one about TV shows, both old classics and more modern hits &&Well this will be my to-do movie list now! Gotta plan a road trip! &&Make this a poster and sell it. K thanks. &&This is actually super cool. I’m going to print it out and just start putting X’s over the ones I seen already and watch the rest. It’ll be like an actual destination roadmap.&&This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.&&Do you have a super hight resolution version that I could print out on multiple sheets of paper and hang it on my wall?

I want to take on this movie watching challenge 😀

Edit: I've just seen the Kickstarter 👍🏻

Edit 2: It would be great to see other colour options and styles. &&It's beautiful&&Thats a life time of movies for some people.&&Fucking amazing &&I will be referring to this map for what to watch next for awhile. Thanks for making this OP.&&My god this is unbelievable! Insanely good work!&&I don't see any Ken Burns films in Documentary Ground. Surely this is an oversight? &&this reminds me of mapofmetal.com great job! &&I love this! I'm thinking about picking up a print of this off the kickstarter, it would look awesome on the wall. I am a little curious why the Harry Potter's are in a mismatched order, I wouldn't be able to get to each one in order! Awesome work nonetheless

EDIT: I also think that Unbreakable should lead into Superman rather than Superman II but keep all positioning the same. That way people can start on Superman then either go the modern route or the classic route, if that makes sense.&&I want a poster of this, can anyone put this in the proper format?&&I would buy this poster &&This is incredible. Serious talent and your hard work shows, OP!&&Logan should be closer to Western between it and Super&&This really is incredible, one of those things when I think about how you put it together it gives me a crazy headache. Amazing.&&Is there a way to get the picture in like 4K quality? It's worth getting framed. &&When the western desert is on the east...&&This is incredible! You seem very knowledgeable of most of these movies seeing the intricate ways you place and connect them thematically. How many of these do you estimate to have seen?&&Are there really people out there who think that ""Kids"" is a 'must-see movie'?&&I would seriously buy this as a gift for a movie-mad nephew.&&This is so fucking cool. I want to buy a print I can mark off as I watch because i am too poor to buy a real map for travel brag purposes. &&This is really good and really impressive, but some of the placements are a bit odd. I'm not really sure why you would place Princess Mononoke in the coming of age region for example, besides it being animated. I would put it in the Fantasy region for sure.&&Oh, thank god ""Bridges of Madison County"" is on there. /s&&Everything has such a nice name, then there's ""drama area""&&I love the idea of info on a map.  Pretty cool.  I’d love to see one done with music as well.&&This is the heart of Movieland ;) I started the map by drawing this place: https://imgur.com/Kjvoyvc&&David lynch greets you with some coffee and donuts before you're thrown into an interdementional abyss&&Happy I found interstellar close to Mindfuck Forest, right next to Inception &&I see the much deserved Man from Earth but not Coherence, Coherence can always fuck your mind a little more&&wristcutters: a love story, should also be in mindfuck forest&&My first thought when I saw that phrase was ""Solaris better be in there."" I was not disappointed.&&Any list of must-see movies that features Inland Empire, Enter the Void, and Cube is a good list in my book. I've got to watch all the other films in Mindfuck Forest.&&It's oddly missing Funky Forest.&&Yeah, and you can visit Donnie Darko right outside of Mindfuck Forest on the other side of Paradox Lake!&&I love how shutter island is an island in the lake of madness.&&shouldn't there be special areas in MindFuck Forest just for David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick and Philip K Dick movies?&&I love how many David Lynch films are in Mindfuck Forest. Where else would they be?&&Everything is relative, Movieland may be on a round planet ;)&&https://i.imgur.com/ms73TyQ.jpg Fixed it for yah pal&&Also Serious Creek is an inland sea.&&This map has no orientation, therefore I will assume the South is on the top so that the Western Desert is in the west and all those Japanese films are in the East.&&What's crazy is how many of these ""Must-see"" movies I've seen and regret.  I mean how is Green Hornet, Superman Returns or Hancock on there.  That said, I will definitely be dropping by ""Mindfuck forest.""
&&And Reservoir Dogs in an actual reservoir  &&It is ;)&&Right inbetween Shaun of the dead and Hot fuzz lies the Cornetto lake&&[deleted]&&Is it not a western first?&&I think this movie should get a masterpiece tag. &&Just make it it's own noncountry&&I was actually thinking the same thing. It’s been my favourite since it came out. Where exactly is it on the map?&&I've hear it called a neo-western before. I think that fits pretty well.&&I'd say 70% are movies I recommend, 15% are movies I haven't seen yet but heard or read very good things about, and then 15% are noticeable movies that I don't like that much but thought they are part of movie history or pop culture (like the one you're referring to).&&Seems like a huge project. If you assume 1 in 4 movies you watch is a ""must-watch"", you have to see 6000 movies and keep track of them and their genres&&I made a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/XBNvtt1.png) showing the frequency of movies on the map sorted by year released. Apparently OP doesn't like including movies after 2014.  
  
EDIT: [more interactive version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSGi41VlvifOvzUUtx_u0MYxpyfOSw0IdymfOD3XsuIBDQucgyjoCGPoYNIwiVvXA8O9PKvkb5irPHT/pubhtml?gid=1240060426&single=true)&&Here's an animated gif that shoes the evolution process: https://imgur.com/Kjvoyvc&&/r/dataisbeautiful&&Thank you so much. I'm still working on it and trying to improve the design so if you find odd connections or misplaced movies I'd love to have such feedback.&&It’s basically a claymation remake of The Great Escape, which is sadly not in Jail Woods.  
  
Edit: correction, in Jail Woods but not connected.&&Eets-a-raace!

Edit: Thank to kind stranger!

VEE ARE HAWLING ASSSS!&&Agreed! I didn't see it right away when it first came out, only a few years later, but laughed so hard at it! Probably the best Will Ferrell when not directed by Adam McKay.&&Howard Hawk's Scarface is such a great movie! It includes one of the best murder scene of all time <3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqFrbW60Mc&&r/imaginarymaps&&Thanks a lot :)&&[removed]&&It's in the top row of the D block.&&I would also add Blade Runner 2049 for sure&&I was feeling the same way. I saw Jupiter Ascending, a piece of filth not worthy enough to be called turd, on the map but not Blade Runner.

Thankfully it's in column D top row.&&that was quick&&Top right of F3&&yeah, i mean what kind of creek is that?&&I immediately wanted to get this printed and framed, and mark off the movies I watch with red pins. Like some people do on actual maps with places they've visited.&&Kind of. I wanted to have some hierarchy between the movies and also visual diversity. Red is the ""highway"" with the most obvious unavoidable films...&&This is something I have to improve. It had to be close to the Cop River, it's a bit less comedy than Beverly Hills Cop or Rush Hour, and I wanted to have The Fifth Element transitionning from Car Park to Sci fi with a connection to Taxi Driver.&&Haha damnit! You're right I have to improve this :)&&Wow thanks!&&I don't know :) We should vote!&&Superman IV&&“We Bought A Zoo”&&It also has Twilight listed as a must see.&&Jupiter Ascending, Mission to Mars.&&I was just about to say the same thing... what are the hobbit movies doing anywhere close to this ~~list~~ map??&&Listing all movies of the Hobbit Trilogy next to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is one of the biggest insults you can make.

&&Thanks! Noticing this kind of details is the best possible compliment <3&&Of course it would need another entire poster to go deeper in Bollywood :)&&and at least have 'must see' status&&the prestige between shrek/snow white and superman?

Did OP confuse 'prestige' with 'princess'?&&Pun intended ;)&&It's also kinda noticeable how almost no Michael Bay movies are in that bay.&&Don't worry I'm multitasking :D&&[deleted]&&I wish I had this much creativeness to do something with my time.&&Thanks! Great suggestions, I'll try to add these.&&I was looking everywhere like crazy for Office Space.&&Sicario*&&[removed]&&Nice. Another interesting map I'll have to check out later.&&Thanks a lot! I counted 300hrs of design.&&Thanks ;) I was about to answer you that it needed a little boat to appreciate Mr. Wright's trilogy. I'd love if he could have a look at the map by the way :D&&Quite a few of these range from ""Eh"" to ""Really? That one?""

I mean, Jurassic Park 2? Really? American Sniper isn't good by any stretch, but I'd understand that more than the Lost World.

Granted, this is still a really cool thing to do, so I'll survive.

Edit: *Batman v Superman?* But... why??&&I'm really trying to make it as little random as possible. That's why I'm looking for feedback to improve the design. For instance High Noon is close to Rio Bravo which is a very similar story (Hawk's reaction to Zinnemann) ans then Rio Bravo is connected to Assault on Precinct 13 which is a modern day take on Rio Bravo. And The Thing is connected to The Hateful Height which it inspires in many ways... There is a lot of things to discover by exploring the map!&&Since I'm French it wasn't so obscure for me :) &&Well it shouldn't. I realize there are too much must see on Teenage Islands. I'll make a few changes there. By the way, hierarchy between movies is kind of local, which means that a must see in a certain area crowded with masterpieces could have been listed as masterpiece somewhere else on the map (example: Contact).&&I loved it so much!&&D5 Empire Strikes Back and the rest is close. I also thought they were missing at first.&&There are a few Jackie Chan movies on the Kung Fu Island next to Kill Bill, maybe I could add Ip Man there too.
Dead Poet Society is great but there are a lot of very good movies in this area hierarchy choices are difficult :)&&Good point :)&&I've looked in the western area and battlefield area and could not find it. Op kinda has shitty taste imo. &&Thx a lot :)&&I also love Red Road which isn't featured on the map yet. Not sure where I should put it. Do you have an idea?&&[removed]&&Thx! Oh you're right I guess I got lost in extended universe ;) I should add it.&&I couldn't ignore the Marvel and DC extended universes, but I have to say it's not my cup of tea ;)&&I know, it's actually on a space exploration road close to scifi. I'm having issue with this whole area :)&&Casablanca is at the source of the Love River next to Eternity Lake :)&&Clickable link:
https://mapofmetal.com&&You should xpost this to /r/ImaginaryMaps this is wonderful!&&I love that Shutter Island is on an island! &&Shouldn't Primer be in mindfuck forest?&&i need this poster size and on my wall&&I'm sure everyone is claiming you missed a movie they loved. But am I just missing Memento? Seems like a wierd movie to forget&&I wouldn't be surprised if I missed it, but is The Prestige on there? Great thriller/mindfucker&&Definitely add Predestination to MindFuck forest&&Is PREDESTINATION in a hidden cave in Mindfuck Forest? Or maybe it's *under* the lake??? &&I'm not sure if I didn't look hard enough, but ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" would be a great addition to mindfuck forest. &&I not only love that you included 12 Monkeys in Mindfuck Forest, but also connected it to La Jetee.

(for those who may not know, is the French short film that inspired 12 Monkeys)&&[deleted]&&This is VERY cool. Can I order a print? &&Wanted to give you a direct comment but: Thank you for having a man from Earth here. I'm one of the typical action-movie oriented viewers who rarely find good 'what if' movies and a movie that takes place is like a living room entirely made me feel as if it was going to be awful but

I watched it. Then I watched it again. So far I've watched it like 5 times I can't explain why, but I feel this is one of my most favorite movies only because it's pretty much the only one I've watched multiple times in my life.&&Amazing! 

Itty bitty nitpick: 8 1/2 and Eraserhead should be closer together.

But more importantly, Mindfuck Forest is the place to be.&&Just finished The Shining and noticed it was in there. Awesome map!&&Some DAMN fine coffee.&&I know right! I was upset it wasn't at the top of Sci-fi mountain but I guess it makes sense as a road from one to the other &&Time paradox lake would be better. Coherence is a great movie but not everything can dwell in mindfuck forest&&I’ve been trying to remember the name of this movie for days. I love the Etgar Keret story it’s based on.&&That movie is great, but for me personally it was not a mindfuck, just a good ol' dark comedy with a touch of surrealism.&&It's okay.  West, Texas isn't in West Texas.&&stop perpetuating round Movieland fake news&&Don't tell that to flat Movie-Landers&&Now everything is backwards silly ?:(&&My guess is the ""must-see"" movies are the ones that had some sort of cultural impact, whether they were successes, bombs, and/or anything in-between.&&[removed]&&Shutter Island is on an island only attached to the land by a bridge, the detail is so insane. &&I also like how you put Shutter Island on an Island&&But where's the bridge to terabithia?&&Which is shaped like a Cornetto. The detail is insane. &&Do the Coens get in the hammock with me?&&Yeah, it's *clearly* a Western. It's just a transgressive Western, unlike the John Wayne-styled morality plays. But being a transgressive film where scumbags kill people for money doesn't confuse anyone from properly categorizing *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.*&&Absolutely one of the best movies ever made&&Yeah definitely.&&That’s good to know - this should be higher. I think a lot of people think you made this list as “best films of all time”, but counting a culturally significant movie as “must-see” makes a huge difference. 

I now forgive you for adding twilight. &&I see Magnificent Seven but can't find Seven Samurai.  help!&&I can really recommend you to check out the documentary Bitcoin: The end of Money as we know it

It's more about money, banks and it's history than about bitcoin.&&I love that you started with ""Mindfuck Forest""&&/r/restofthefuckingowl&&Well done, OP!&&What application did you use to make the map?&&This is so amazing! You should seriously consider setting up a patreon and making stuff like this on a consistent basis. 

That said: ""The Happening"" is really worth listing in the horror section? It was a forgettable flop.&&I think this idea could be turned into a website or app. I always look on the internet and IMDb for what good movies to watch next. Something like this where I could see all the places I've travels and cool little things like that would be awesome. Like you could travel down roads and check off what movies you've watched. &&How about potentially movies that have Been left out? Maybe Space Jam???&&A beach in the comedy area called “Pauly Shores”, of course. 

Edit: Also that lake in Mindfuck Forest: Lynch Lake&&I am dumb, but could you explain to me the significance of the highways and roads? &&Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece in my opinion.&&You should definitely add a kung fu/ asian area for the old Shaolin and bruce lee movies&&Thinking about printing this and putting it in a frame for the office. Well done.&&I saved the image. Now, thanks to you, I can have a fresh movie every night for the rest of my life.&&First, you did an utterly fantastic job. Second, I think Interstellar would fit quite nicely in Mindfuck Forest.&&Feedback: some of the series are weird. Take Harry Potter. First, I think Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets need to be switched. Second, even if you do that, there is now way to visit each city exactly once, in order. You'd have to do some backtracking. Which is weird. Same with the Star Wars movies. There is no direct path from Empire to Jedi. With LotR, they are all in order, but the the Hobbit is backwards, so you couldn't do a loop with all six in order. 

Unless there's something I'm missing. &&The worst thing I found on here was that you put Mrs. Doubtfire as a ""small town""&&Why no Friday the 13th and Slasher Lake? I feel like it belongs there more than any other &&Why do movies like Taxi Driver and Gran Torino appear in the sci fi mountains?&&Is Rat Race on the map? Can't find it&&Never watched the movie but my math teacher would always reference that in class.&&Yea, it had some good scenes, and I liked trying to spot all the X's.&&Awesome, thanks!&&""$44,267 pledged of $5,807 goal""

Now that's the power of Reddit.&&You've done a man's job, Sir.&&https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/79js4l/i_listed_more_than_1800_mustsee_movies_and/dp2u3gk/

I'm strongly considering doing the same.&&Is there a searchable version? Was thinking of typing in the last movie I watched to see what’s next&&Also, good work!&&Well you've done a hell of a job so far. Fantastic &&I'd make it toy story! pretty revolutionary film (first fully animated feature, leading the push in computer graphics that makes lots of other films possible - seems very 'modern') and also geographically it's in a nice bay.&&(I'm rooting for Rio Bravo)&&Their should be a capital for each district&&Well according to the [IMDB Top Rated Movies List](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=ft_250) it should be The Shawshank Redemption.&&I would list it as a ""must see"". Not because it's good, but because of the enormous cultural impact the books & films had. I feel it was worth it to watch the first one even though I really hate everything about twilight.&&There's 1800 movies. &&You're welcome.  I also liked how one of the teenage islands had Clueless (Emma retelling) and Never Been Kissed (loosely As You Like It).  If this is teen classic retellings, 10 Things I Hate About You is based of The Taming of the Shrew while She's the Man is based off of Twelfth Night (both Shakespeare plays).  Your map is really impressive, and I loved finding the little details throughout.  &&Maybe because most Michael Bay movies are not must-see movies &&Mad respect bro.&&Kickstarted. This is awesome.

My girlfriend and I are going to use pushpins and plot our travels! &&Cool I will definitely look at getting one.
I couldn't find the good, the bad the ugly... until i saw the Spanish name. What is the thought process on that?&&I feel that &&Wait, you *didn’t* add spaceballs?! Fantastic map by the way &&Thank you for the link! My husband and I were just discussing how we could support this and we would both like a poster. Your devotion to the subject is wonderful. We are both big movie/story lovers and I enjoy maps myself. They are a great way of laying out interconnected information that doesn't rely on just one or two variables. The amount of data in the world now is just too complex for simple organization. I think more and more we will see projects like this coming out from people who love their chosen subject.&&That's just design! How many hours it took you to watch countless films to come up with a list of this 1800!! That's like a LOT OF EFFORT&&Yeah, I think this is more of a popular culture movies roadmap, but Jupiter Ascending feels really out of place anyway (neither critically acclaimed nor liked by the audience, big monetary failure, not ingrained in pop culture at all and barely anyone knows/remembers the movie exists).&&Looking at it further I had noticed that, like how Cop river connects Mad Max all the way to Hot Fuzz. This map is incredible, I'd estimate at least 15k karma by tomorrow  &&It's a little odd that The Wizard of Oz is a must see but Monsters Inc (right next to it) is a masterpiece.&&Ahh yeah I didn’t see them, again great job &&The book sounds like a great idea. I love TV shows too ☺️&&I personally think the Avengers and Captain America Civil War should switch places. While Avengers paved the ground for it, civil war as a movie showed the best parts of the superhero genre as compared to the Avengers&&It feels a bit overkill that you have to watch *A Dangerous Method* and *The Jacket* twice if you want to watch *Shutter Island* and want to watch anything else afterwards.&&And the Found Footage section has a pond called ""Pond Footage""&&Yes, it could, and maybe Triangle too. Maybe I can improve this area.&&that's what's even more of a mindfuck about that movie.  it's in the ""It's Totally Not Even On This Map But It Really Should Be"" caverns.  &&[removed]&&Maybe he has thought of it already but then just forgets it again every morning.&&It's there. SW of Mindfuck Forest, north of Citizen Kane, on the highway.
&&It is, it's in Fantasy Gardens, below Mindfuck Forest, past the Horror Lakes and the Tolkien Holt.&&Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check it out.&&Standout movie, one of my favourites.   The one time both leads got to break out of all their typecasting.&&Good catch! I was wondering where Jacob's Ladder was.&&Fuck you Gordon&&Cof-fee.&&There's a fish in the percolator!!

That joke had to have been inspired by a dream!&&Can confirm. Source: Live in Lubbock &&Huh, I’ve often heard talk of West Texas but I assumed they were talking about the West part of Texas, I didn’t know there was an actual place called West&&[Fixed it for yah pal](https://i.redd.it/jmqqav1dmuuz.jpg)&&Jupiter Ascending is in there.&&Can someone let me know if Jupiter Ascending is in there?&&The Green Hornet is a must see movie because it was a crappy comic/TV show movie no one cared about?

I guess the guy didn't watch the movies and the fun for him came from making some software to generate this from IMDB lists.&&Jupiter Ascending is in there. &&Does ""Must See"" necessarily mean good?&&Twilight and Frozen have definitely made a cultural impact, which is probably what puts them on the list. &&What no, Reddit is the honest mans internet&&Do you dislike Spring Breakers? If so, could you explain why? I really enjoyed the film myself, but i most people i talk to about it say they didn't like it.&&I mean its 1800 movies, at some point the movies are gonna stop being great just because there aren't that many great movies&&Spring Breakers is legitimately a really good movie. I feel like the people who trash it just saw the ads for it and looked at the cast and assumed what the movie is about instead of actually watching it.&&Spring Breakers has a surprisingly large cult following. It's directed by Harmony Korine, who's a strange guy with films like Gummo and Julien-Donkey Boy being pretty avant-garde.&&Spring breakers is a must see&&Must see doesn't necessary mean good to everyone. 

I watched Twilight at home after the last (5th) one was on theatre. I then proceeded to watch the rest of them because I feel like finishing the series. To me they are not great movies, and they are worse one after another. But the first one is definitely a must see because of the cultural impact they have made.

Edit: corrected 8th to 5th.

To those who asked, the success of Twilight encouraged movie studios to produce more young adult films; more young adults books; mons naming their babies with the characters/actors names (like mons naming babies Anna/Elsa after Frozen), team Edward/team Jacob thing.&&frozen is a solid movie though



^^^get ^^^it&&Is Star Wars anywhere in this map?&&Yeah I'm honestly surprised this hasn't been pulled down for self promotion violations&&I see you're getting downvoted but you're completely right.&&I'd take a gander and say shutter island is what started this whole project&&He was just kidding. Do you know who invented the hammock? There’s something for you to do.&&but why Jupiter Ascending or Jurassic World...

Jurassic Park is a must-see. It nearly single handedly redefined how the movie going audience sees CGI today...but Jurassic World? Even if you liked it (which I did)...it's not in any way a ""must-see"" film unless you're a Jurassic Park fan.&&Probably what prompted the whole thing! &&Illustrator, probably.&&Sketch&&it'd be nice to list the movies you watch and what order you watch them in. it could find matches and recommend movies they've watched around the same point in your journey.&&Space Jam is there, C5&&My thinking is that you can zoom through the highway to get the tl;dw of the area - all the genre-defining stuff. If you like that then hey, why not come back, take your time and explore the back roads a little?&&Are you dying in less than five years...?&&Can't find Nacho Libre either. It is like OP knows nothing about fine films. &&Seriously, searchable google map type thing for this would be amazing. &&Yes this would be perfect&&Assuming the OP created this in Illustrator or similar vector program - and the text hasn’t been outlined - exporting it as a PDF should make it searchable.&&I agree that it has had a cultural impact but I don’t agree that that alone makes it worth watching, and definitely not a “must see.” &&I mean I haven’t seen it and I don't think I’m missing anything.&&Which cultural impact...? How did it influence other movies or society? Nobody even talks about them anymore beside a shallow meme ""still a better love story than twilight"".

""Must see"" is more to me than ""many people saw this movie so you have to watch it, too"". &&Yes. So?&&I was thinking the same thing. Put this up next to the TV and pushpin everything. &&Same here ☺️&&Thank you so much!&&I mean, I don't usually stop at every place I go through on my way somewhere. Maybe look at the movie poster, if you want to respect the concept of traversing the map to the letter.&&Mindfuck forest needs more Donnie Darko. But 99% of this is so spot on its scary. Amazing work.&&Yes! Whatever gets more people to see Triangle&&You could also add Holly motors, Mr. Nobody, love(2011), Melancholia, Antichrist, and Brazil &&And upstream color&&Holy Motors and Upstream Color are as mindfuck as it gets&&Just curious if you considered inception cuz i expected it to be in mindfuck forest but maybe I missed it&&Jesus dude you're a genius. I've seen a lot of different methods of people getting their Kickstarter Project viral and often times it's either usually not that interesting enough or has rediculous rewards, but everything you did to posting on Reddit to pre-setup of a Kickstarter and reasonable rewards is spot-on. 
The quality is there.

I’m debating getting the last spot to add a movie and make it an absolutely terrible suggestion! You know? An outlier of sorts? &&I was thinking this was a crazy waste of time till I saw that the Movie Map is a business venture.  Good job marketing it here.&&[to quote the great Philip J.

West, the city, isn't referenced much outside of a couple notable events that happened there such as the fertilizer plant explosion. [Video 1](https://youtu.be/on-M7z_xFBE), [Video2](https://youtu.be/Ba8jTkRWiwI) Also interesting is that depending on who you ask, west Texas (the region) begins in North Texas. Fort Worth to be specific. It's a widely debated topic.&&So is John Carter. I guess you can't have 1800 movies and every single one is a winner...&&I recommend watching Jupiter Ascending; It's a good example of a movie made by people with lots of good ideas, a few cool things, but nonetheless fails spectacularly.&&it is. up near the top of sci fi. the matrix revolutions and matrix reloaded are also in there&&I think this is a valid point. Movies can be bad but still be genre defining or hugely influential.&&exactly, you need to see it so you can dis it&&Frozen and spring brakers are very decent movies Imo. Are they ""must-watch""? No. But are they in my personal top 1800? Obviously, I haven't even seen that many movies &&There seems to be a giant cognitive rift in this world.  
On one side are those people who really enjoyed Spring Breakers.  
On the other side are the people who'd rather flog themselves than ever be exposed to it again.  
Honestly, the difference is so extreme that I wonder if we're not all being pranked and there are actually two completely different films circulating out there.  
I fully recognize that different people can have different opinions on media, but I fall into the latter camp. I found the film to be a stupid and unpleasant story about stupid and unpleasant people.  
This doesn't invalidate anyone else's enjoyment of the film, but I do sometimes sit in complete wonder pondering how there can be quite such a disconnect.&&To be fair he delineated between regular movies, must - sees and masterpieces&&Exactly. It's a bit of an annoying aspect of movie culture. Lists and alleged ""must see"" movies are chosen waaaay too generously. If a movie is just coming out and half-decent, sure, the people behind it deserve to get paying audiences for it.

But when it comes to laying down lists of important films, it's time to select and cut, cut, cut, cut. What's cut off can go into lists for bigger movie nerds.

There aren't 100 movies that I would actually call MUST-see. There are more than 100 that I would call very good, but going around calling everything a classic and a cornerstone of something is plain delusional.&&> there aren't that many great movies

Yes, there are plenty. But if not, then...


> at some point the movies are gonna stop being great

....that should be the point you stop putting them on a ""Must-see"" map.




I mean, here are 11,000 food items you should have in your fridge at all times! I mean yeah, no one like ants and they don't taste good, but you *can* eat them and I have to put 11,000 things on a list to shill my Kickstarter so, ants!&&And at that point you stop before you have to begin throwing half baked films in there just to take up space&&Trash Humpers is a masterpiece of....I can’t.

Not every movie on this map has to be a masterpiece/classic or a mind changing experience, some of them are there just to complete the area they are put in.

If i were to edit this map i'd delete the ""super valley"" and let the batman trilogy by itself.

I saw that that was a kickstarter link and I immediately thought ""oh, another guy trying to wring money out of reddit.""

He should be able to ask for money for it and he did it about as gracefully as possible. &&The Room&&Howard the Duck&&You're welcome!

Real life is way crazier than what we can make up!&&I don't know the place but it sounds like a sick burn, congrats&&And on that note, North Texas is pretty far away from the northernmost part of Texas.  What any sane person would label as North Texas is called the panhandle, which isn't very ergonomic.&&That doesn't make it a must-see. That's can-see-if-you-happen-to-feel-like-it at best.&&Those aren't bad movies, just not as good as the first.&&[deleted]&&That doesn't make them Must See necessarily imo. Much like 2pac didn't start Hip-Hop, it would be tiring to tell people interested in animation to absolutely always start with Ahmed's Lamp. Toy Story was way more important, to give two extreme examples. I also think that the Blair Witch Project should yield to more successful found footage movies as the more important movie. Yeah it started it, but I would prioritize the qualitative aspect over the historical one when building a canon. In literature, canons are also focussed on quality, that's why there are many works included in your typical canon that satirize trends that can't be found on the same canon. Don Quixote is a major novel, but none of the novels satirized by it are ever on any canon. Frankenstein includes many trends and ideologies that were around at the time, but few people really care about reading that, while Frankenstein is what we're really interested in.

OK, I understand now that maybe we aren't talking of the same thing. It's not bad to have a list with historically influential movies. I guess what I'm arguing now is that the two aspects, quality&influence, shouldn't be associated too closely and move lists should ideally concentrate on only one of the two aspects.&&Well, that's just the thing, I don't think it is possible to make a list of 1800 must-see movies. Somewhere beyond 150, it stops being a list of must-see movies and becomes a list of movies.&&haven't seen spring breakers either. but to me personally, frozen is a masterpiece. especially in 3D. (dude above 25, below 30)&&I haven't seen Frozen yet but I've literally never heard a single bad thing about it, and tons of people recommended it highly. &&In my opinion, the biggest difference is that one group of people took the movie at face value. If you think you are supposed to root for the main characters, well you're going to be disappointed. If instead you approach it as a totally ridiculous movie that is built to criticize pop culture, it is enjoyable and the last scene is hilarious and ridiculous.&&Precisely. OP's the one that labeled ""1800"" and ""Must-See"". If adding 1800 great movies to a list was too difficult that he had to fill it with shit movies, he should have made the number more manageable.&&59 on Metacritic and 71%/6.7 on Rotten Tomatoes isn't exactly critically acclaimed.&&Isn't all this possible, btw?

Damn, dude.&&No, a bad movie. Not a cinematic masterpiece.&&Have you heard of Iraq? &&I was born there.

The dusty flatness of the landscape is akin to the homeland of one Skywalker. Only there are no blue jews, no pod racing (trucks are far too slow to be pods), and a total lack of lightsabers. There exists just an ever stretching vista of dirt, cacti, and debris from the last windstorm.&&You sound knowledgeable and make interesting points, but I highly disagree about Blair Witch...  Blair Witch is the best found footage movie, barring maybe REC. Others might be scarier (VHS, Paranormal Activity) but as far as defining a genre and just being a great movie, Blair Witch takes the cake imo.&&Depends. [This list](http://1001films.wikia.com/wiki/The_List) is pretty good for encompassing 1001 movies. Just think about the fact that there have been movies for 100 years. So you just need 10 movies every year for there to be 1000 movies. And surely you could make a case for 10 must year movies per year.

If you want to add it up to 1800 you just have to include 8 more movies each year. Sure, some would debate the term ""must-see"" but at the end you'd still have 1800 great movies. That list would very likely still include Frozen but not green hornet or twilight&&Let it go&&Or just get rid of the descriptor ""must-see.""&&I can't see Predestination &&It needs Timecrimes in it too.

I quit my day job to make what I genuinely think is the most helpful movie suggestion website in the world: recommending highly-rated BUT little-known movies. Would love to hear what you guys think,76586,740tkq,https://agoodmovietowatch.com/,2920,1507041641.0,,"my thoughts:

1. Good luck - this is a very difficult space to be in (20 year veteran of building products in this category, including the Slingbox, Boxee, and more)

2. It's a nice start, but I *highly* encourage you to have a recommendation appear on the very first page. Making a user click for anything is just room for losing traffic, and a lot of it. Give us something right away, then let me explore *from* there.

3. Have fun!&&“Error establishing database connection”. I haven’t seen this but I’ll give it a watch! Thanks OP! 

All jokes aside good job OP, the site finally loaded for me and the first recommendation wasn’t The Godfather. 👌&&Never underestimate the reddit hug of death.&&I think it needs to have categories for recommendation. I briefly clicked through the Best Films on Netflix and it's like 80% documentaries which most people will not have any interest in. 

If a random person goes to your site to find something to watch on Netflix, and all you're doing is seemingly pointing them towards documentaries, most of them will exit the site and never come back. 

Yes, i'm aware you have the ""genre"" section but that's not the intuitive path to take at first, which is exactly when you need to be hooking someone. 
&&Is there a reason why you couldn't build the site in your free time instead of leaving your job?&&I'm thinking about building a site to recommend sites that recommend movies.&&It suggested ""Error establishing a database connection""&&Sounds like an excellent premise for a highly rated BUT little-known website.&&Suggestion: When hovering over ""Login/Register"", provide a reason(s) to register. *""Registered members gain benefit x, y and z""*. Can I save a watch list, for example?

Great site, though - esp. with the separate sections for Prime and Netflix. &&My thoughts are:

1. Cool site

2. You really didn't need to quit your day job for this&&A few technical tips to prevent the dreaded:
“Error establishing database connection”.

1. Do not make DB connections from your landing page. Make your landing page static so you're using the least amount of resources possible. A reddit hug-of-death can easily be prevented.

2. If you must show some dynamic content then read it from a cache rather than fetching it directly from the DB. Fetching from DB for each request is how you max out on available DB connections. You can also fetch dynamic content from the DB once every hour and keep it in a shared memory space that can be accessed by all requests hitting your application.

3. You should also rate throttle the incoming requests to keep your server running under load. Also, you can timeout requests that are waiting to be served that have waited too long and redirect them to a nice message that says, 'We're under heavy load at the moment, please try again later'. Ideally, you should never have to show that message to users if you can scale your application elastically.

Good luck!&&I hear Moon is pretty good. In fact, it's very widely known for being the most good-but-little-known movie.

EDIT: added the second sentence&&why would you do that?&&This is a good idea. Something I have wanted to do (and may still do :) ). I find the user experience a bit confusing though.

1. I don't want to select just one streaming service. I want an option to select multiple (see justwatch.com) and also ""all released""

2. User login - Provide google/facebook/twitter login in addition to email

3. I want additional filters after streaming services selection. Primarily genre

4. Can i bookmark movies to watch?

5. Can I remove movies from recommendation?

6. Movies & TV shows go hand in hand. Ideally don't just restrict it to movies.

7. The information density is bit low. Quite a lot of whitespace.&&Programmo here. 

If you are hitting database for each hit on the front-page you’re screwed! 

Let me suggest a cron job to generate a static front page and then use cloudflare. Free options that scales to 10,000 hits per sec easily. 

If you are using a framework like laravel, you can make a cached service provider in front of your queries. 

Or if you are using react or vue, it’s the same but for your api

Good luck! We all need a site like this &&Looks like we hugged a bit to tight.&&Yeah bud, don't quit your...Oh. 

Well best of luck &&UK netflix option please. &&New Website, meet Reddit. Reddit, meet GODDAMN IT REDDIT GENTLY.

The optimism is strong with this one.&&I love your site man! Been using it for about 2 years! 

Keep up the good work. &&Sounds cool. Something similar can be achieved by IMDb advanced title search: ( http://www.imdb.com/search/title ). I've used it to find most movies I've watched the past 5 years. 

1. Select feature films
2. Set the rating you want it to have. Say 7.5 and above. 
3. Set # of votes to for example above 5000, but below 50000. So you don't get EVERYTHING, but a fine selection of lesser known movies.
4. Sort by year to get new movies or old movies.

And voila, bookmark the link:
http://www.imdb.com/search/title?num_votes=5000,50000&sort=year,desc&title_type=feature&user_rating=7.5,

Very versatile tool. Can search for country, actors, award winning, genre, etc etc. Can find anything that you could never dream of finding otherwise.&&I love https://agoodmovietowatch.com/

I totally appreciate the effort, and there is a need for something like this. It can just be subjective. And maybe it can be a simple algorithm of box office and polling of some kind. Next to star rating or somewhere is some kind of fun but informative rating of how ""unknown"" it is to the public. Although Hot Fuzz might be unknown enough for the website, it might rate kind of low as far as degree of ""unknownness"". I think most people have heard of Hot Fuzz. But few have heard of Slow West, for example.&&Web development 101:  The entry point to your website should not have a call to an external service that can hijack the page from rendering.

You should have the HTML load and whatever call to the DB be asynchronous (through JS). That way if the db connection goes down, there is some content there. Additionally, you won't necessarily have the issue of people refreshing the page over and over and attempting to request a new connection from the DB pool.

I.e. say it's written in PHP, ok, put your site on multiple web servers each with their own NIC.

Configure NginX as a Rever Proxy load balancer distributing traffic evenly to your multiple PHP web sites (all the same site), and all pointing to the same database.

This should enable you to handle a metric ton of traffic, even being hugged to death by reddit.

It also adds security, because none of your websites have public IP's, only the reverse proxy server (NGinX) is on a public IP.

OP, this link http://agoodmovietowatch.com/all/ has been my chrome homepage for a long time now. I've been using your website since many months now! Thanks a lot!&&Reddit hug of death?&&""I plugged your symptoms in and it says you may be suffering from...network con-nect-ivity problems""&&Saw this last week. The SQL was terrible!

I’ll see myself out now.&&I've never seen it is it a good film? &&I want a reddit hug of death but I’m scared. Hold me. &&Lesson of the day: 

Don’t quit your day job. &&I also did this and when I did find a movie to watch it wasn't available on Netflix.&&I haven't gone to the site yet but you've hit upon something I hate about review websites like Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic - reviewers are *always* WAY too kind to documentaries. Seriously, most of them are like 99% or 100%, and that sucks for two reasons. One is that if I'm reading any 'best of' lists using the ratings that doesn't purposely leave off documentaries, the list is cluttered with them. Second is that when I do want to find a documentary to watch (because I do actually like them), the ratings are useless because they're all so high so it doesn't help at all.

If this site uses ratings from sites like those to find the 'best' movies, then the problem you mention is probably inter-related to all this.&&First recommendation: increase your server capacity before making an announcement on Reddit. I look forward to seeing it once the site comes back to life&&This is a valid question. It's hard going on without a paycheck, but this sounds like more than just a hobby to OP. If it's a passion project and something that he may start a career from, I think a full time job may hinder his ability to pour his heart and soul into this project. I can't speak for OP, but I admire his courage and drive to build this site and pursue something he truly cares about. As for me, I will wither away at my 9-5 desk job. Good day everyone. &&Anytime someone says, ""I quit my job to do..."" The first thought that comes to mind is, ""You got fired didn't you?""&&I was going to say that. Currently running my own website and I wish I could devote all my time to it but it's not going to make revenue quickly. I couldn't quit my job.&&Seems like it would be a pretty bad idea considering that like every day someone posts their movie-suggestion site&&Well that doesn't give him the story to go with it, you see.&&answered this below.&&I'll finance this venture for 70% stake. What do you need? Like 20 bucks?&&Great techo-thriller&&Same&&Actually this.  OP hurry and register similar sounding domains for books, websites, podcasts, subreddits, etc.  Then basically copy your site with different source data.&&Great idea!&&I feel like OP needs a ""hook."" Him quitting his job gives him that. Just my two cents anyway. &&Also: why even say that in the title? Every time it happens people actually try to pass it as a selling point somehow. It changes nothing about what your product brings. Let it stand on its own.&&Caching has saved my butt many times on my crappy Wordpress site when reddit tried to give it a hug.&&You need the /s tag

There are already two replies legitimately fawning over it and not realizing theyre being made fun of&&It's a bit of a complicated situation but for the most part: calculated risk. I come from a culture that is all about complete and utter avoidance of risk (I'm from Morocco). Growing up my dad refused to take a loan for us to have a place to live, and kept saving until he could pay it all in one take. We were 4 children, and we lived in a 54 square meter apartment. All so that he would never risk not being able to pay the loan back (he had/still has a steady government job). I really don't want to live that way.

I started the website about 2 years ago, and did it as a side gig while working at a big tech firm. But it never felt like I was giving it my ""all"". So I quit the moment it felt like I had enough savings/revenue for the coming year. 

I also really believe in its potential as a concept, especially with the rise of Netflix and similar services. 

One other thing that helps is that a haircut in Morocco costs the equivalent of $1.5 (living costs are very low.)

**TL;DR: quit when I had enough savings/revenue for a year, wanted to take a risk, and really believe in the concept**


edit: added the meter to square

edit 2: I feel I should mention this somewhere because I don't think it's very clear - I've had a lot of people help me get the website where it is now. Lots of advice, guidance, etc; and in very direct ways: 2 freelance writers and 1 freelance developer + my genius writer of a girlfriend who proofreads a lot of the branding messages

edit 3: *technically* I started the website in 2013, I'm just bad at math. Lots of redditors are really into investigative reporting. &&The directness of your question made me giggle for some reason, thanks for that.&& I also found the information density to be low.

Now is your chance to try and address issues you have with the site.&&[deleted]&&I use Taste pretty regularly, they do a great job in my experience &&Noted, thank you. Movies like that are flagged ""ICYMI"" and inside the movie page also flagged in red ""well-known"", but the idea of a scale is very interesting. Thanks!&&It insists upon itself.&&> You should have the HTML load and whatever call to the DB be asynchronous (through JS).

Gross. Just use backend caching and stop hitting the DB every call.&&His website hasn't even worked in 6 hours. &&He is clearly asking for feedback on a well put together movie website on r/movies of all places! The audacity! 

We all use this site as a billboard. It's called Reddit karma. The r/movie mods can do whatever they want to, it's their sub and the upvotes clearly show support for these types of posts in this community. I support posts like this in r/movies and I support indie devs making cool products for us to use for free. Go start your own sub if you don't like what gets posted here.&&Easy to get a new day job in this line of work&&Yea but it's click bait headlines and people like hearing about underdogs, even if said underdogs end up failing. 

I also fail to see why making this site necessitated quitting his job.  &&What if his day job was at McDonald's?&&Makes me very happy, thank you.&&Why even say 'no offense' there is clearly plenty of 'offense'. &&Especially when it's not really all that complex of a website to run. It could be maintained easily in off time. &&Cache your pages man! Every request seems to be hitting the database.&&Rapid suggestion for what could be on the front page:

A ""random recommendation of the day"" or something of the sort. Or popular suggestion, or trending suggestion, anything like that.

Then you describe the movie briefly, the main actors, and most importantly: Show a picture from the movie.

I pressed ""Random"" and a movie came out -- but no picture of it, just a trailer. I highly recommend that you have picture samples for every single one of your movies. It could be a poster, or a random still from the movie, but a picture. Letterboxd does that, IMDb has lots of pictures too, every user who makes popular imgur recommendation albums in here does too as well - pictures are worth a thousand words and are often the main selling point of a movie.

Making the trailer picture sample bigger would be a good start I guess, as it's often a random still from the movie. But still, I think having the poster in there would help immensely.

Those are my suggestions!&&Yeah, I gotta agree with him on #2. 

I really liked the design and layout, looks slick.  It's not super intuitive as to where you should go first or how to really use it, but all the info is great.

Good luck OP!&&2: While I agree this would add new user interest and retention in the site, I really like the clean 'Random' button front and center because it seems to serve the same purpose. It effectively gets me to a movie immediately with no navigation, and makes me feel like I'm going to receive a unique recommendation. After clicking the button I found myself reading the synopsis and then interacting more with the website in general. 

I will say, the ads are somewhat cumbersome in the way they are currently presented. Maybe section them off more clearly? &&I've seen it.  It's rubbish.  Just two hours of Liam Neeson on hold with tech support.

""Yes, yes. I've already updated the config file and restarted Apache. At least three times now!"" &&I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ad-based revenue, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a database administrator for people like you. If you let me see your database, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will debug your database and share it to all. &&Pffft.

I think it is the same issue as for foreign films -- the only ones that break through to the mainstream are the really popular ones.

The many, many worthless ones just kind of fall by the wayside.&&>First recommendation: increase your server capacity

1 year of fulltime work is 2 years of half-time work, and you are in an insanely competitive market with algorithmic ""recommendation"" bounties going for millions of dollars for even a small % increase in efficiency.

What are you offering that is a distinguisher, here? Elevator pitch me...

because frankly if your connectivity is down I don't think you have the database/horsepower to intelligently recommend anything better than the myriad other choices out there.

Is this a social aggregate? Is this a ""tastemaker"" opinion-file?

What do you do with the edge cases of someone who likes every al pacino movie, every gangster / mafia movie but then gives godfather 0 stars?

How do you determine WHY someone rates a movie low? Maybe they'd like the movie if it was a different actor, same with rating it high. If I give something 5 stars how do you know WHY, to base future recommendations on?

&&Best of luck OP. I'm going to use your site to prepare for the next ""What do you feel like watching?"" moment.&&This concept did not require you to quit your job.

It's like that 19 year old girl who had an AMA because she wrote and published a book. When I saw that thread I immediately thought; okay who does she know that gets her this attention?

Fantastic movie!&&This is what pisses me off so much about die hard EEDC fans. Just because it doesn't stick to the original canon doesn't mean it's not a great film. I thought Liam Neeson really came into his own, and the associations between Natalie Portman's childhood trauma and the errors she had establishing the data connection were beautifully naunced. Plus the understated cameo by Steve Buschemi as a self-questioning pop-up ad was just sublime. 5/5 would watch again.&&Thats fucking hilarious&&You've seen it? I tried to look up 404, but I couldn't find it.&&Fuck /u/MrOddJobs, why did you do this?!&&I've got a lot of problems with you people&&Yep, just replace the text on the page with that and we're golden.&&No. This is Patrick.&&[deleted]&&Dynamodb and RDS absolutely do have scaling policies.&&AWS will help with the database layer if it's on RDS, giving it scaling capability.&&(Spoilers below) 

Synecdoche, New York is my favourite movie of all time, and I wouldn't say it's *necessarily* depressing and disheartening. Cayden's own experience is overwhelmingly negative and disheartening, but the film's overarching message allows for interpretation as to whether this is the way all life is, or whether we have a choice --- are we to live our lives as Caydens, or Adeles? 

If we fear our every sniffle and scrape, and lament every bump in the road, while seeking ever more unattainable goals, we're sure to suffer the fate of Mr. Cotard; but, like Adele - who ""Lacks"" not - we can choose to ""suck the marrow out of life,"" and enjoy every single moment, celebrating the beauty in raising children and creating even the smallest (literally) bit of art that we can bring into the world. 

So, yeah, you're not wrong in saying it's depressing and disheartening to watch Cayden's miserable existence slowly (and finally abruptly) slip away from him. But it can also be one of the most uplifting films a person can watch, in my opinion, in that - if we are fortunate to find our ""second little person,"" who understands who we are - and if we choose to live our lives ""the right way,"" i.e. more on the Adele spectrum of things (ideally with a stronger moral code), we can avoid ""Cotard Syndrome"" and live out a worthwhile existence full of enjoyment. &&The first time I saw Synechdoche, New York, it finished up around midnight.  I was home alone, watched the credits roll, and stared at my TV for what felt like 20 minutes in numb amazement.

There's been very few films to have that kind of impact on me.  Incredible movie, and to this day I can't exactly put my finger on why it is so moving to me.  I blame Philip Seymour Hoffman. &&I feel like every thread that references Parks and Rec always references these two facts above.

I just want to be able to search for a movie or show and have it tell me every service it is available on, specifically ones that are subscription based, I'm never going to pay to watch individual episodes of a show. I'll pay for a subscription though even if just for a month for one show.

I think you're over thinking it. Everyone gets upset because they're bored and does the best to antagonize everyone else.

Fuck those guys.&&No, what do YOU mean ""you people""?&&Appreciate the kind words mate. I definitely think you have a point there, and that there's far more 'beauty' and 'worthwhileness' in Cayden's life than is usually recognized, for the sole reason that he's unable to perceive either of those elements and only sees the negativity in it. 

His romance with Hazel contains more 'Real' moments than many people get to experience in a lifetime, all he can think about is himself, so he repeatedly loses her to other men who actually give a shit about her. His daughter is fucking adorable but he, again, cares only about himself, can't explain things in terms that don't upset her (""Daddy, I don't want blood!""), and ultimately loses her too. He wins global recognition and funds via the Macarthur Grant, and commands an ensemble of hundreds of devoted actors and support staff, but, again, perceives the entire endeavour as a failure because he fails to recognize the crucial fact that **it's about the journey, not the destination** -- and perhaps this is most true when it comes to the creation of art. 

He never performs his play in front of any audience (setting aside the fact that he seemingly doesn't even care about ever doing so, as everyone else is suffering outside in some dystopian reality he ignores wholly), so his life is deemed a failure...when really he's created something incredible and True every day they step onto the set, he's employed and substantiated the lifestyles of countless people who would be out of work and in that hellhole 'outside world' if not for him, and so forth.......but he'd set out on an unattainable goal to basically depict 'all that there is,' 'as it really is,' and in doing so he forgot to enjoy (or even REALIZE) the fact that - exactly as you mentioned - he really did create something True along the way. 

And finally (to actually address your question, got a bit sidetracked there, can you tell I'm a little obsessed with this film!?), in terms of it being 'enough' for Cayden to be undertaking the act of creating, I completely agree. Think of the alternative; he could be 'just like everybody else,' either an actor/stagehand directed by some batshit crazy delusional boss, or a victim of whatever the hell is going on outside the walls of his set. If he could just wake the fuck up and see it, he'd realize he was literally the luckiest person remaining in that entire world. At the very least, he was oftentimes complacent, and occasionally happy, while he was creating/living, but his consistent internalization solely of the negative events in his life caused him to die alone and with a life wasted, not recognizing what he had had all along. &&[You can't just drop the comeback story without linking the comeback story bro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-7bVZYy_ds).&&What time zone is smh&&I wrote a perl script to pull the page, what's the smallest time increment for a cron job...&&Elderly animals&&[Interesting...tell me more.](http://i.imgur.com/LW8apyP.jpg)&&...Bernard!&&Heavy is the head that eats the crayons.&&Where have you been?

She *does* say what happened in the book. Weinstein threatened to sue her and...well, here's an excerpt from an article she wrote:

""It wasn’t until I published my memoir in 2010 that things turned nasty. The moment Harvey read it, he went ballistic.

He called me and started to threaten me. He said he was going to ‘f****** sue me’, that I was a liar, that I made him sound like a pervert and that I was ruining his reputation. His publicist ordered me to take out everything in the book about Harvey. I refused.

Bob shouted at me too, and the next day there was a piece in the New York Post calling me a liar.

I told everyone I could what had happened but no one seemed to care or wanted to get involved. Harvey had become untouchable – until now.

Many people have asked why those in the industry didn’t raise the alarm.

Well I did, or at least I tried to. Harvey called me a liar, just as he called countless other women before and after me liars.

Now the whole world knows who the real liar is."" https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0307387402/ref=tmm_pap_used_olp_sr?ie=UTF8&condition=used&qid=&&Hypocritical bullshit.

What about Roman Polanski?&&When are the rest of the pedos and rapists going to be ostracized?&&All I have to say is... I’m in the industry and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Record executives must be shaking in there boots. Because all it takes is one person who was done wrong with nothing to lose to watch the dominos fall.
For years people made fun of the casting couch, now it’s not a joke.&&The thing is he isn’t the only Hollywood player that does this. I worked in the industry for nine years and even at the little shitty company I was at, this shit happened. However, unless people come forward and go to the authorities and persecute, nothing will happen. And nothing usually happens because these types of predators tend to punch down. Which is to say they target young starlets and bit players who have dreams of actual stardom. They don’t go after the established “a-list” actresses that have clout. No, they go after their employees, they go after the extras, they go after the up-and-comers that depend on them for their livelihood. These predatory assholes know this and take advantage. You want to make a big deal, sure go ahead, you’ll never work again.   &&I hope all to high hell this starts an avalanche of outings against abusers.

Let's hope this is the first of many sexual predators having justice served to them at last. 

Edit: for the record, Weinstein absolutely deserves more punishment beyond being expelled from the Academy. I was simply referring to his career lying in complete ruin over the situation, as it rightfully should. &&*The Academy’s 54-member board of governors — which includes such Hollywood luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Kennedy — held an emergency meeting at the organization’s Beverly Hills headquarters today and voted to strip away Weinstein’s lifetime membership.*

*Following the meeting, the Academy issued a statement saying the board had voted ""to immediately expel him from the Academy. We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over.""*

That's a pretty strong statement and hopefully begins a new way of conducting business in Hollywood.&&This first statement might not be the most popular thing to say in /r/movies but bear with me: I fucking hate the people who populate the film industry. It's a complete cesspool filled with absolutely shitty people who, through highly insulated social bubbles and multiple yearly self-congratulatory events, have convinced themselves that they're good people. It really clicked for me when I kept seeing their award show speeches the last few years and saw how out of touch these people are.

As far as Weinstein goes, I'm sick of everyone in Hollywood acting shocked about it. Even if his victims were afraid to go public with it, it's not like it was exactly a well-kept secret. Brad Pitt threatened him in the 90s for creeping on Gweneth Paltrow, 30 Rock had a joke about him, and Seth MacFarlane took a crack at him at an Oscars event.

The Hollywood types only acted shocked and outraged once us rubes really got an insight as to what was going on and even then their own cognitive dissonance is sickening, everyone knows the clip of Meryl Streep giving adolescent ass-raper Roman Polanski a standing ovation. This shit has been going on ever since Hollywood has existed and will continue to do so and all the actors, directors, and producers will just keep covering for their actor, director, and producer friends.

Nothing will change, but when the Emmys, Oscars, and Golden Globes roll around they'll just go back to jerking each other off about how important they are and how much they mean to the world and all the good they do while they're wearing $250,000 in diamonds some emaciated 12 year old African kids fished out of a creek.

Sorry for the rant.&&Courtney Love warned about Weinstein's M.O back in 2005. http://m.tmz.com/#!article/2017/10/14/courtney-love-harvey-weinstein-2005-warns-actresses-sexual-harassment/&&We at the academy do not and have never condoned this kind of behavior.  Ever.  Starting--everyone, is everyone ready?  Okay, we would never, ever condone this lascivious, despicable behavior starting now.  So it's settled, just now.  You all just saw us settle it….&&In LA, everyone kisses the ass of anyone who can do anything for them.  

Now that they are sure he absolutely cannot do anything for anyone, they throw him out for doing what everyone knew he was doing for 20 years.  

But back then, he could still do something for them, so all these people, so quick with their ""moral outrage"", the very same ones who threw him out today, for 20 years, did nothing, and said nothing.

That's LA in a nutshell.

Edit: I should have said Hollywood (the industry, not the city), not LA.  Leaving it so the other comments make sense.&&Sacrificial lamb

Bill Cosby, too, maintains his membership despite well more than a dozen women coming forward to accuse him of drugging them and committing sexual assaults.&&So Polanski is fine but Weinstein is out. &&Can they expel bryan singer now?&&This is the perfect time for someone to convince Weinstein to call out all the other abusers, rapists and pedophiles in Hollywood (and let's be real political and financial) high places.

_____
Hollywood is so hypocritical it's hilarious.  Harvey Weinstein sexually harassing Ashley Judd and jerking off in front of a reporter in a restaurant?  Big fucking deal.

[Victor Salva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva) videotaped himself fucking a 12 year old boy, and then made the film [Powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(film)), a film where a child has  mythical power over an adult. Even better, Disney found out about it and didn't even fire the guy (let's pretend they didn't know about all this beforehand, they just got caught knowing about it so they lied). Listen to Rogan's podcast (#[679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izr3Jsjee0s)) with Barry Crimmins and Bob Goldthwait for more information.  Sickening.

> Disney officials reported that they learned of Salva's crime only after production of Powder had begun, and stressed that there were no minors on the set for the film

Oh ok, perfectly fine then!

He fucked a kid in 1988, filmed it, got caught, and then Disney hired him to make a movie about a kid who has powers over adults. Who would ever work with such a monster?   Surely his career was over after that, right? 

Oh my, no.  He's made 10 movies since getting caught fucking the boy on video, including the Jeepers Creepers trilogy.  He's worked with Sam Rockwell (edit: maybe Rockwell didn't know as he worked on an early film, as pointed out by /u/vardulon in a reply), Rose McGowan, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen, Justin Long, Nick Nolte, and Dean Stockwell.  All of these actors knew their director fucked a 12 year old boy and filmed it, yet they all agreed to work with him.  But at least he didn't flirt too hard with a beautiful actress or pull out his dick in a restaurant!  

Fuck Hollywood.  &&People are so ignorant. Removing Harvey Weinstein is like a building inspector removing one single cockroach's leg from a building that is infested with cockroaches and then saying, ""We have solved the problem."" This whole witch hunt on Harvey Weinstein is all for show. The entertainment industry has known about Harvey Weinstein for a long time and has never done anything about it. The only reason they are doing something now is to save face because the shit hit the fan. The industry is full of people like Harvey Weinstein that the industry knows about, yet everyone turns a blind eye to it. &&The Academy was well aware of Harvey Weinstein’s actions, its just that now everyone else is too&&Hypocrites. Weinstein is an awful person but I bet many of the ones who voted to expel him are bad people too.&&Doesn't mean shit for their reputation if Polanski gets to stick around.&&So a bunch of elite pedophiles expelled a guy for harassing adult women. only after he's caught. And everyone is satisfied. Wonderful.&&We know that there's been chatter that Harvey Weinstein is a sexual predator, and that chatter has been around for years. It wasn't until it became highly publicized that any action was taken.

I find it implausible that Weinstein is the only person in Hollywood who has this chatter going on. Expelling Harvey is just an empty action grounded in ""well, everyone knows now, so we have to do something"" unless they start looking into and then expelling every one of those other sexual predators that are all over Hollywood.

We're going to be looking at a Catholic Church level of coverups of sexual predators in Hollywood.&&Dunno if this will change anything once the shock has settled.

I’ve read a bunch of articles by women and men in the industry alluding to gross mistreatment/abuse by men still in the industry.

But until they give the names to journalists and until journalists expose them, things will likely go back to normal.

I thought Kesha’s accusations against Dr Luke would have the same effect in the music industry. But while a load of female artists came out to publicly support her (Adele, Lady Gaga, Pink, Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato etc) no one came forth with testimony against him or others.

No one wants the hassle of being embroiled in an ongoing abuse case, understandable especially when they have a new blockbuster or pop song on the horizon to promote.

You have to do a fuckton of press and I can’t imagine anything more annoying than some E! dolt looking for a big headline.

Plus, without receipts cases of sexual abuse are near impossible to prosecute, and you risk a career destroying lawsuit and public scrutiny + inevitable backlash.

So the industry will go back to normal in a few weeks/months while the thinkpiece industry booms.&&They're all enablers. Fuck them.&&We’re only days away from him ending up dead in a West Hollywood hotel with no one to give a shit. &&Harvey Weinstein is the first of many rapists/sexual predators that will be exiled from Hollywood.  This is the time.  More victims will come out. &&Harvey being pushed to the top to push the narrative *yay we got him it's over*

DON'T LET IT END THERE, KEEP DIGGING.&&Every member who gave Polanski a standing ovation should be expelled bunch of pedo apologists &&Doesn't it seem so disingenuous to expel Weinstein, only because the media are covering the story. Open secret for years, when are Bryan Singer, and the other members of the paedophile society going to get the same exposure and treatment? Do we have to wait for another few years of abuse to continue?&&I'm wondering why everyone in Hollywood has been so quiet about it if they knew about any of these things. 

I get that some don't want to be blacklisted a la Feldman, but a few rich douchebag perverts can't blacklist all of Hollywood. 

Like if someone at the level of, say DiCaprio, knew then why not come forward about it? Weinstein isn't blacklisting DiCaprio, nobody could. 

And if even he could, then why wouldn't those actors team up with other actors and come out about this? They can't blacklist everyone. 

I'm not trying to be antagonistic or anything, just genuinely curious of how a situation like this might work within Hollywood.&&What Weinstein has done is reprehensible, but he is not the only guilty party here.

Anyone who stayed silent about sexual assault or harassment for money or career advancement has betrayed every women who suffered assault or harassment after that decision.  To come out 20 years later with a “Me too” or “I am sickened” self serving press release is a slap in the face to all the women you could have helped years ago.  Fuck you if you do anything attention grabbing other than talking to the Authorities.  You make me as sick as the actual criminal here.&&If Weinstein is expelled *before* he has been convicted of anything, couldn't it be argued that this is just a form of virtue-signalling?

For example, just to play devil's advocate, how does expelling him contribute to the goals and mission of the Academy, if it hasn't been proven in a court of law yet that he has done anything that violates it's mandate?&&Hollywood has finally found its sacrificial lamb/poster boy for the  Let's-Clean-Up-Our-Image Propaganda Campaign..

Now, what about the multitude of other sexual predators in the industry?  &&Let's be honest. The Academy didn't expell him because he's a sexual predator. They've known that for a long time. They expelled him because his dirty little secret was no longer a Hollywood secret. If this had never been reported they would have been fine ignoring it.&&Which town is worse... Hollywood or D.C.?&&insensitive take, but I keep hearing all these women come forward about refusing his advances.  
I'd like to hear from a Hollywood A-Lister whose career was made by sleeping with this guy. &&I'd like to believe he was expelled for helping The Artist win Best Picture. However, remember that this is Hollywood, a place where Elia Kazan got the stink eye during his honorary Oscar for ratting out artists during the Black List era (a horrible action, don't get me wrong), while a rapist like Roman Polanski gets a standing ovation. There are more people like Harvey pretending to be woke this week, and many more that silence the victims of today.&&Bill Cosby is still in. Hey hey hey!&&They're doing everything they can to make is look like this guy is the sole evil hollywood man. Takes the heat off everyone else getting exposed &&Does this mean Shakespeare In Love has to give back the Oscar he bought so that Saving Private Ryan can get it now?&&Hollywood isn't mad they found out,  they are mad we found out. &&All these articles about Weinstien getting kicked out of the academy, losing his job, being booted off projects, etc, are only there to distract you from the fact that he isn't facing charges for his widespread sexual assaults. Media big shots get away with whatever they want.&&Good! What about Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, and Bryan Singer? And while you're at it, how about NOT giving Casey Affleck another Oscar, ever?

Edit: look at the comment posted by u/stevejust  below for those of you (u/rawdenimkid) asking what Affleck did. Sorry for not posting the link myself, I'm on mobile and I don't know how (copypasta not working).&&[deleted]&&Hollywood in general is the epitome of hypocrisy. &&I've hung out with less powerful producers and the abuse still continues at lower levels. I've seen older men offer ""jobs"" to girls specifically under 18. People know. The women don't care because they've gone through it and it's ""not a big deal."" The men don't care because they've done it or witnessed it before.

People do not care. &&Too late. Many, many, many years too late.&&1 down; 80,000 left to go

&&People act like the ""casting couch"" isn't a well-known thing. I'm sure there are hundreds of others just as guilty, many who are condemning him now.&&I wonder if and how the 2018 Oscars will handle this?&&The deplorable lack of admittance of guilt from Hollywood continues. As painfully predicted, their whole narrative is being centered around the ""rich white man problem."" 

Hollywood must admit that its greed and decadence has failed the people, and its political divisiveness and demonization of people who don't agree with their worldviews has greatly contributed to the toxic atmosphere in society. Hollywood needs to refocus on actual stories and movies, rather than playing politics and diving people. Too many like Weinstein portray themselves as heroes and are top donors for political ideologies, when the truth is they are wolf in sheep's clothing.

But even speaking just of the sexual assault allegations - screw anyone in Hollywood who says ""I heard rumors but didn't know."" Anyone in that circle is complicit and needs to go down. &&A lot of people throwing stones at Hollywood are missing the entire point here.

I was young and didn't understand her back then, but now I get it. &&smh at all these celebs coming out now saying ""oh we knew for years..how I wish I had said something"" MFer, you didn't say anything when there was a risk to your career.

For those curious Carmine Caridi was kicked out for leaking his screeners online. 

**Edit:** Screeners are DVD or digital copies of films that are trying to be nominated for awards that are sent out to Academy voters. Most of these people are pretty busy so this is the only way they can reasonably see all the eligible films. Also most of these films aren't available publicly on DVD yet so leaking them means leaking a pretty good quality copy online before the public could buy them legally. 

Here's what a screener looks like:  https://i.imgur.com/oTtr6UH.jpg &&[deleted]&&Man, what a fall for Weinfuck. From having the Academy dance to his tunes and showering him with Oscars year after year to getting disgracefully kicked off it. &&When will they do something about Scientology? &&They got rid of him because we (the public) found out not because the academy or any actor guild was made aware because let's be honest, people in that industry have known about this kind of shit since the beginning. &&For sure. He's messed it up for the rest of them.&&That’s what’s so hypocritical about everyone coming out to “condemn” that behavior. They’re just piling on once it’s already known, saying it’s horrible how nobody did anything beforehand because they were afraid of the repercussions. 

So why isn’t anyone naming names of the others in Hollywood who are guilty?  Why aren’t they using this as an opening to expose *everyone*? Now should be their opportunity to expose it so it doesn’t continue for decades like it did with Harvey. 

They’re all still afraid and complicit. &&I'm pretty sure that the industry is just throwing him under the bus because tha masses demand a sacrafise. People are getting wise to what's a massive problem in Hollywood. My guess is that the industry is trying to distance itself from this man be cause if there is any speculation about who's side they are on, we wouldn't have to dig too deep to find that Weinstein's offenses may appear mild compared to other big names in the industry.&&They'll all give an Oscar-worthy performance.

[Lea Seydoux on Harvey Weinstein:] (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/11/harvey-weinstein-lea-seydoux)
> One night, I saw him in London for the Baftas. He was hitting on a young woman. Another time, at the Met Life ball, I saw him trying to convince a young woman to sleep with him. Everyone could see what he was doing.

>That’s the most disgusting thing. Everyone knew what Harvey was up to and no one did anything. It’s unbelievable that he’s been able to act like this for decades and still keep his career. That’s only possible because he has a huge amount of power. 

Edit: Added Lea Seydoux’s comments &&This 'Hollywood' being mentioned as a person gives me real 'the hacker called 4chan' vibes.&&Her name was Samantha Geimer. Here is her [AmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/65gqla/iama_samantha_geimer_the_victim_in_the_1977_roman/), if anyone is curious.


The AmA starts with the question:

""*Do you think that this sort of thing is common in Hollywood? Why or why not?*""

Her response: ""**yes, because it's true and we all know it is**""&&Drugged then raped and all while Angelica Huston was next door&&And his peers gave him a standing ovation when he won an Oscar. The inconsistency of Hollywood is mind boggling.&&Goes to prove that you can survive the Holocaust and your wife getting brutally murdered by Charles Manson, and yet turn out to be a shitbag.&&Whoopie Goldberg: ""but it wasn't rape rape"" &&But he served 42 days!!!

/s, in case it's not obvious &&[deleted]&&If Polanski was convicted of that today he would be similarly ostracized. It’s like the bastard got grandfathered in, like it doesn’t matter because it was a different time or some bullshit. &&I think the NYT revealed the existence of payments from Weinstein to actresses to buy their silence.  Other facts like that Brad Pitt confirmed to reporters that he confronted Weinstein over his approach of Paltrow were in the recent developments too.&&If news doesn't go viral these days, people don't care. It has to become big first before anyone goes ""Oh.."". It went off this time because of the New Yorker article (big publication, several victims speaking out, article was probably posted right when most were online etc).

edit: Also in general the social justice movement is showing no signs of slowing down or being a brief trend, so people become more and more aware as time goes on, making them less likely to ignore things like this.&&Ditto, I'm totally confused as to why this became big news recently. I'm not in the industry and I knew...&&Makes me think of when Corey Feldman cited that Corey Haim [had been raped](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/corey-feldman-elijah-wood-hollywood-897403) , but due to statutes, he couldn't safely state names.

Everyone wants to be a star, but this is the dark side of the marquee.&&The people in power knew and were probably too scared to do anything, for fear of repercussions or being blacklisted.

I'm not excusing their decisions. At the end of the day, it was cowardly to put their careers ahead of their ethics. But it seems like they all saw what was happening to Weinstein and seized the opportunity to do what they've wanted to do for decades.

At least that's my interpretation. I don't want to completely write them all off as horrible.

One thing I know for sure is this: This could be a one-off occurrence. Or it can be proof of changing times. It all depends on public reaction. If people are less motivated into action for the next creep, then it will be a one time example for Weinstein. But if people truly believe that they're part of changing an entire culture of complicit silence, then it'll no longer be acceptable to even remain quiet on the matter.&&What exactly were they supposed to do without any evidence or victims coming forward? Why is it so easy for you people to condemn others when you have no clue what's actually going on? Is it literally just an angry manifestation of your own feelings of powerlessness? 

Are some of these people hypocrites or also guilty of similar things? Almost certainly. But I bet some of them were also just waiting on an excuse to get rid of this guy. Shit like this is complicated. 

This isn't just a Hollywood problem, we as a society need to seriously examine how we deal with issues of sexual abuse. The fact that one of these scumbags was literally just elected president proves this is bigger than any individual group or sect or party or class or any of that divisive bullshit. But we can't just get irrational and reactionary every time one of these assholes gets exposed. Instead of attacking the academy we should acknowledge they did the right thing here and then push them hard about taking real proactive steps towards exposing more of this predatory behavior. Everyone loves bringing up the Polanski incident years ago but what about getting statements from these people about him today? Put them on the back pedal in a meaningful way instead of just empty, angry curses.

&&Call me crazy, but I think, beyond the touching, this is Hollywood getting rid of someone who had a reputation for being universally disliked. &&You could argue that, while Polanski and Cosby's crimes are just as egregious, they aren't abuse of *the Academy's* power, just abuse of their own. Polanski and Cosby used their fame to get away with absolutely disgusting acts, but Weinstein used his position within the Academy as leverage to commit such deeds, making it all the more important that he is expelled from the Academy - as punishment, as a symbolic gesture, and to distance the Academy from his crimes.

EDIT: just got my first piece of hatemail on Reddit, which is very gratifying. Apparently I'm a rape-apologist now. No, I don't think Cosby and Polanski should be let off the hook, but the Academy isn't capable of punishing them as they should be - namely, by sending them to prison. Clearly both men have committed crimes, but they haven't committed crimes against the Academy, and that's the difference I'm trying to highlight.&&Also fucking Brian Peck and Victor Salva are not only not ostracized but continue to work in the industry!

If people don't know, Brain Peck is a convicted sexual offender and child molester who can not interact directly with children but yet somehow still finds gainful employment at Nickelodeon studios working on childrens shows and being on set. He is also very good friends with Brian Singer who, while not been convicted, has had a myriad of sexual abuse and child molestation allegations. 

And Victor Salva who is the director of the Jeepers Creepers series who was convicted of not only raping one of his child actors on set but also of producing child porn of the aforementioned rape, and has charges of possessing unrelated child porn. And his new movie just got fucking released!

Obviously, Harvey deserves this and so much more and it's great one person is getting brought down so he can't abuse anybody else but come the fuck on Hollywood! &&Bryan Singer too.&&And Woody Allen and probably dozens more.&&Never.

Harvey Weinstein is just the good PR patsy.
&&People need to speak out and expose them. I think if that starts happening it will avalanche into a huge ordeal. Would be quite a culture shock...&&Better idea, actually charge them with the alleged crimes instead of pretending that kicking him out of all this stuff matters.

He's going to retire with his millions and not care&&Dunno. Ask Ke$sha how that works out. Scum will get away with it because women don't carry body cameras.&&Kaya Jones / Pussycat Dolls has just tweeted that they were more of a prostitution ring that sings. Also hinted at a suicide related to the revelation and referred to someone as the 'den mother'.

Pretty full on. Power to them all.&&Films like Breakfast At Tiffany’s or specifically The Apartment I think portray the culture back then pretty honestly.&&and that's hollywood for you, if you won't do it, you clearly didn't want to be a star bad enough. This industry is in need of a serious purging. It's why I always laugh when at the Oscars, Emmys, and Tonys they always have so much to say about how progressive and great hollywood is and then this.....&&Tiny little production companies are the worst because they don't even have HR departments - just a line producer or production manager or someone who gives out deal memos. If that's the guy perpetrating the abuse and harassment, there's no one for the younger staff to complain to...a friend was pretty seriously sexually harassed by her boss and the witness was her boyfriend who worked at the same company. She never complained because they both needed the money and her boyfriend was afraid of being blackballed - he talked her out of saying anything. I think that's one of the ways why so little of this gets reported. It's not just the victim who is scared of not working after reporting something happened, it's everyone around them too.&&I was reading some old posts on reddit about Hollywood rape and pedophilia, and the one thing that people kept saying is that this case or that case is going to ""blow open"" the hidden sex predators in Hollywood.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to ever go anywhere.  Even the ones convicted go right back to their old jobs and probably raping and molesting a whole new group of people.&&He may be a few fries short of a happy meal, but I think that at this point there are very few people who don't believe his allegations of sexual abuse/pedophilia in the motion picture industry.&&I’ve completely lost respect for Ben Affleck after this whole ordeal. He released a statement saying how surprised and disgusted he was to find out about Weinstein. It turns out he knew about it. One actress even told him about an incident and Affleck responded by saying “I told him to stop doing that!!” (Paraphrasing).

Affleck bothers me because he always tries to portray himself as this shining light of morality in the darkness of Hollywood. Him releasing that statement demonstrated his hypocrisy. &&""If only we had some sort of talent to make people believe our emotions.""&&use your ACTING, Gary!

""I know it wasn't *rape* rape.""&&As if. I would bet a lot of those board members do or have done the exact same shit, or know of a ton of people who do. Weinstein is only taking this flack because they have no other recourse. I'm happy he's gone, but this won't change shit unless a lot more people start getting called out soon.&&Statements like this do little to shift the actual balance of power. The actors who are preyed upon are often powerless or rising in their fame when they’re attacked. Either that or they’re attacked by someone who will strenuously deny the allegations and has enormous amounts of influence. 

You’re talking about a culture change here, and while statements are useful to a degree, there’s a long way to go from this point.&&[deleted]&&I wish California didn't have a two-party consent law for recording.

If I had a kid going into showbiz, I'd tell them to set their phone to record any time they're alone with any exec ever. So many slimeballs. But I live in Texas where it's one-party consent.&&It really makes me wonder if there are any people in Hollywood that are actually genuine decent people. It seems even the ones who aren't abusers are still at least complicit in it, and the rest are probably too scared to step out of their lane. I try to separate the art from the artist, and you kinda have to, but it's kinda difficult to when you know someone is a shitbag. It's probably hard to really know for sure, but it'd be nice to be able to reliably enjoy an actor or director's work and be pretty confident they are a decent person.&&>“If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party at the Four Seasons, DON’T GO”

Well, he couldn't have, since it hadn't happened yet. Sam Rockwell filmed ""Clownhouse"" with him in April - June 1988, Salva was arrested for the first time in September 1988. (Also worth noting is that no states had public sex offender registries until the 90s so even if he'd been arrested, no guarantee that anyone would have known.) ""Clownhouse"" was the debut movie for both of them so it's not like there was a chance to learn of a reputation, either.

Just clarifying so Rockwell doesn't get an unfair knock.&&Rose McGowan, the same one who is a righteous crusader now, had this to say about Victor Salva when asked about him being a convicted sex offender:

>""Yeah, I still don’t really understand the whole story or history there, and I’d rather not, because it’s not really my business. But he’s an incredibly sweet and gentle man, lovely to his crew, and a very hard worker.""

Please let's all listen to Rose's outrage some more on Twitter.&&Only the most naively optimistic - or those paid to pretend to be so - think that Harvey is the beginning and end of it. This is one of those industries practically designed to encourage abuse.&&Not everyone. We turn a blind eye to the nebulous concept of it, because without details or anyone coming forward, we can't so anything. We can't even know anything in particular. It's not like all us working stiffs can go be detectives in Hollywood. The victims are afraid to come forward, so without accusations there's no action to be taken.


On the one hand, we could say Hollywood should be more closely regulated. But on the other hand, what are we going to do? Assign an FBI agent to every producer, director, investor, etc. to permanently follow them around and make sure they aren't doing anything?


Weinstein got kicked out of the academy because he got CAUGHT. Not because Hollywood found out, as that recent tweet said, but because the public found out. The public is quick to call for a rapist's head, but not until we have a victim come forward. And it can't be Corey Feldman and his ""I won't say any names"" shit, because if he won't say names, what the hell can anyone do? Arrest all men in Hollywood older than Corey Feldman and question them? And hope they confess?


It's not that ""everyone"" just ignores it. Hollywood does. Because half of them are abusers, and the other half are afraid if they out the abusers they'll stop getting work. What we need is people like Rose McGowan who doesn't give a fuck and is willing to risk any consequences. Boldness like that is uncommon, but I hope courage like hers will inspire others to be specific. There have already been a few more accusations coming up. If they keep going, there could be a tipping point soon. Then we might see change.

Destruction of their life, their career, their character, the threat of harm to themselves if anything came out (Be they victim, active or forced participant, or just knew), will shut people up tighter than anything.

It's why such situations come as a shock no matter what industry is exposed for having such power-corrupted monsters leading it, the blackmail always shuts people up.&&Wait.

There's nothing wrong with either of those things though (assuming she's not talking about minors). The number of people who are equating rape or sexual assault with hitting on women while being ugly is shocking.&&People are really dumb if the seriously think that there aren't any more pedophiles in Hollywood. The more sad part is that no one wants to do anything about it.

-Edit: Why are there replies making this a political issue? &&[deleted]&&That whole case was such a shit show. That girl became not only a victim of sexual assault but also a victim of the media and the judicial system. The judge and DA played up the case for media attention and the judge secretly decided to not go along to the terms of the plea deal for Polanski that he himself accepted. The judge bragged about how he would not honor the plea bargain and would sentence Polanski to 50 years in prison causing Polanski to flea the country before sentencing. So not only was she sexually assaulted, she was dragged through the mud by the media and by lots of Hollywood celebrities, and was used by the judge and the district attorney to bolster their own careers. Such a fucked up situation for everyone involved but especially her. &&I would also like to point out that another statement of hers was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/65gqla/iama_samantha_geimer_the_victim_in_the_1977_roman/dga6dcu/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=IAmA).

> However, my opinion is that you do not throw a person's life and accomplishments away because they have committed a crime or done something you feel is heinous. His art, his employment, his achievements have nothing to do with me. They should be judged on their own merit, and we all make mistakes, should the rest of your life and contributions to society be ignored.&&""well it wasn't really RAPE rape."" 

-Whoopi Goldberg commenting on Polanski's raping of a 13 year old girl. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXnNOBj26lk

Gosh, you wonder why their official youtube channel censored his award so you cant comment or vote.&&*Pregnant wife, and 4 friends.&&... or have that turn you into a total shitbag. Polanski's backstory is like a supervillain origin story. Its disturbingly close to Magneto's, actually.&&This is a thing that bothers me about a lot of our political/social discourse around power and privilege... There is absolutely nothing about being a victim or powerless that makes you a better person in of itself. Implicit in a lot of discussions about these issues is that being a victim somehow makes you a better person.

You could argue that these experiences push some people to think deeply about injustice and thus become better people, but just the act of being a victim does nothing.&&There was a time I thought of her as an icon.  Now I’ll just call her Whoopi Shitberg. &&You're tearing me apart, Hollywood!&&>Brad Pitt [...] confronted Weinstein over his approach of Paltrow

Good on him. &&And if it doesn't it gets easily dismissed. Rose McGowan has been vocal for years about this, but ""oh she's angry she's not working anymore"" gets tossed out and people equate her with crazy. Ashley Judd has been vocal for years, but due to her profile not being A-list as it once was ""She just wants to be in the news"" or something.  And if you get one mention here and there, it gets dropped because ""Well if there was anything there, it wouldn't disappear from the news!""



Except that it totally would because people have jobs to do and sometimes (a lot of times in this case) there's a gag order in place. And ""why take the deal?"" because again, Harvey Weinstein owns/owned) a HUGE portion of Hollywood jobs and had Miramax's and TWCo's lawyers behind him. One not-so-successful actress isn't going to try to bring the hammer down publicly because (as we've seen constantly) A) No one will believe her since she's trying to make a name for herself, 2. She doesn't have the money behind her for a long legal battle, d - She'd like to work again.&&Yeah 2 years ago. I don't know how to link but search Ashley Judd in r/movies. It's the top one. Some guy straight up called him a rapist in the thread. &&This was how I felt about the Cosby thing finally coming out for good.  I'd known about it for at least 15 years from when it got mentioned the first time, then it went away.  Then finally it came back up again.  &&Video posted a day or two ago about Corey Feldman discussing the pedophiles in Hollywood:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rujeOqadOVQ

Bonus Barbara Walters at 0:48 attempting to shame Feldman for speaking out against pedophiles, Walters is a piece of shit. &&Think about how fucked up a lot of these child actors end up. Think it is because of drugs and too much money and power early on? I'm thinking it is more about drugs (supplied by creeps like this) and years of sexual abuse that everyone around them knew about but didn't act on.&&And yet, parents just dying to get their kids to Hollywood to be the next big kid actor. They have to know, at this point, they are leading their kids into the fucking lion's den and yet, coins and fame > health and well-being of a child.&&It gets to a point where I don't even think just careers are on the line. People with this much money and power, I wouldn't be surprised if that did even more drastic things to keep people quiet.&&Crazy thing is we may never have heard of many of the biggest female actors out there if they hadn’t passed through this creeps hotel room. &&> The people in power knew and were probably too scared to do anything, for fear of repercussions or being blacklisted.

See, that's the thing: actors are not ""the people in power"". The people in power are the heads of big studios who would not be blacklisted but chose to do nothing and work with the guy. &&As frustrating as it is, well argued, totally on point here, And a side I hadnt considered until you pointed out the obvious&&> Apparently I'm a rape-apologist now.

The complete inability in some to grasp nuance and context is truly astounding. Your statement was clear.&&What the fuck?&&Victor Salva, yeah. Also directed Powder.

I loved that movie, then after learning of his past misdeeds, I watched it later and yeah, lots of allusions to sexualizing young boys. Jeepers Creepers too. Wasn’t there some scene where a bunch of young dudes take off their shirts and sunbathe on top of a school bus? Might be an innocent scene from another director, but not Silva. &&[deleted]&&What happened with Bryan Singer?&&""Dozens"" I like your optimism&&I find it somewhat fitting that Ronan Farrow (Woody Allen's estranged son) was the journalist who broke the Harvey Weinstein story&&If they only did..80% of these pieces of crap would be gone  
And people can get on with there careers. &&Yup! And what sucks is that the rec company and A&R’s know that a lot of these no talent girls and guys what to be the next big thing. So they pimp them&&[deleted]&&I think people believed him (except that fuckhead Barbara Walters) but they weren't going to bite the hand that feeds.  &&Maybe because he was raped as a child.&&Hollywood is a sick, gross place, but for reasons entirely separate than what you are claiming, which is unfair.

Powerful people from any number of walks of life abuse their power in horrific ways.  Weinstein wasn't part of some rape treadmill that's exclusive to Hollywood. He's an inordinately wealthy, powerful man, and he used his power for vile things.

There are surely many others like him in Hollywood, just as there are in real estate, banking, anti-dandruff shampoo, or whathaveyou. Give a bad person money and power and they will do bad things.&&If drugging and sodomy aren't rape rape then nothing is.&&""Did it feel good, though?""&&How is she even on that board?&&I think they're throwing him under the bus, and hoping it makes people think that they're dealing with / not tolerating this (anymore).

Of course, as social media becomes bigger and harder to control, you'll see *more* allegations, not less. And even more scumbags will be outed.&&I would be near tears if it turned out Tom Hanks was in the same category as Weinstein. &&This is exactly why California has two party consent laws.&&As someone who works in the film industry, you're right. People in this thread seem to think that the entire city of LA is just a group of 200 actors and producers who get together once a week to decide who they're going to molest next. &&And who could forget the groundbreaking work of Powder and Jeepers Creepers?

Convicted boy raper.  Still in hollywood making movies.

Warning, don't look at the talk page, you'll lose faith in humanity.&&Was she trying to compare violent rape to date rape?&&Years of rumors and speculation point to it, yeah.&&Yeah but the point being look at the things these people consider controversial or divisive. Granted naming names during the 50s red scare is not an honorable action, but at the time of this ceremony that was something that had happened over 40 years ago. Where's the polarized debate in Hollywood over Polanski? Where are the few good souls who gave up their careers to make sure people knew about Weinstein? (There are none) There's a widespread attitude in Hollywood that crimes against others can be kept secret as long as it's not harming ""them"" directly. Underage actors, below the line talent, female/male actors thought of as only pieces of meat- these are the people in Hollywood who are by and large considered expendable. And it is right that Hollywood should be ashamed of this. There is more to life than a career or money or fame and a person should have enough of a moral conscience to know what to do in these situations.&&I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Harvey Weinstein is just as bad as Carmine Caridi.&&Yea.... I mean what Harvey did was bad but leaking your screeners? That's some next level shit! &&Right? That guy was at least helping out.&&My layman's assumption would be that they were gunning for two awards. If they list both leads as leads then they can only get one award.

Sadly untrue. 
  
>Woody Allen, David Lynch and Martin Scorsese today added their names to a petition demanding the immediate release of Roman Polanski from detention in Zurich.  
  
>The petition has now been signed by more than 70 film industry luminaries, including Polanski's fellow directors Michael Mann, Wim Wenders, Pedro Almodóvar, Darren Aronofsky, Terry Gilliam, Julian Schnabel, the Dardenne brothers, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Wong Kar-Wai, Walter Salles and Jonathan Demme. Actors Tilda Swinton, Monica Bellucci and Asia Argento, as well as producer Harvey Weinstein, have also put their names on the petition. Yesterday, Weinstein stated he was ""calling on every film-maker we can to help fix this terrible situation"".  
  
[Source](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/29/roman-polanski-petition). Like so many other closed circles in the world, Hollywood has some truly shitty cadres of rapists and apologists that need to be illuminated and shut out. If I had a bit more energey, I'd be curious to look up what these people had to say about Weinstein.
&&Now google Victor Salva&&Which is interesting because it's come back full circle.

His biological son, Ronan Farrow was the one who did the investigative piece on Weinstein and exposed him.

He is estranged to Allen and says he believes his sisters accusations against Allen 100%.&&Cathartic for his peers who envy him, or cathartic for all the people he hurt along the way?  Because, I'm okay with the former hurting him for the same shallow and selfish reasons that he hurt the latter.  Consider it part of his punishment.&&They're so pissed at her half the ads on Youtube I see are them trying to discredit her. I don't even watch this crap, why is it like 50% of the ad content. They must be spending fortunes. &&Only when they have money. &&And yet the ""church"" of scientology infiltrated over 100 government agencies and embassies in one of the largest known espionage attack on the US government.  They stole hundreds of documents incriminating their ""religion"" (and don't forget the rumors claiming Hubbard was a pedo, they targeted any government info on fearless leader as well).  When caught executing ""operation snow white,"" they threw a few members under the bus but the rest of the organization got away scott-free.  

They are a very powerful cult with looooots of money and connections to powerful people. Even worse? I don't think any of the convicted members served more than 6 years in jail for what amounts to treason against the US government. &&Yep, and she got the consequences of that come down on her too. She's talking about it on her Twitter now.&&That's it. Now who is going to report on the ones who orchestrated his demise....&&Maybe it wouldn't be a terrible idea for the Department of Justice to investigate the entire industry. &&This, he is the fall guy for the rest of them. It's how banking works, there were hundreds of madofsf, but he was the only one to go to prison &&The bigger problem here is that many of the young girls have careers that he could potentially influence. It doesn't matter if he will or not, as long as the girls felt this way, he had power over them.&&Also how young? Like it's scummy and gross but he's allowed to hit on 18 year olds all he wants.&&Both of you are obviously right, but damn... Hollywood needs to deal with this shit&&Guy who's worked in Hollywood here. I'm only a low level audio engineer and I knew. EVERYONE knows. It's a big industry but still small in a way, only a few real power players. Everyone knows that's how it goes. Harvey's not the only one, I am certain.

The thing people don't talk about, because it's not as deplorable as outright sexual abuse, is that the industry is comprised of people in extreme positions of power and thousands of people who just want a job. Many... MANY of those powerful people are abusive in non sexual ways. They degrade people, humiliate them and place them under emotional stress regularly, simply because they are in a position to take out their personal frustrations on others with impunity. This is because there are hundreds of millions of dollars at play in this industry and at the end of the day, talented people are needed to keep it flowing. I no longer work in the film industry and it was largely because of this. I have more respect for myself than I have desire for money or status. I don't enjoy being in a position to just take shit from awful people. Unfortunately, many people desire money, fame, status etc more than dignity for themselves. It's kinda gross to say (or type) but the fact is, many people know what they're signing up for and do so willingly in order to advance their careers. That's not to say there aren't unsuspecting victims though. 

Long story short, Hollywood has a lot of great things going for it. There are true artists and inspirational people there, but it is also a pretty disgusting industry in many cases, depending on your values. As long as things are primarily driven by making money, that will take precedence over morality etc. The truth is, the only reason they are shit canning Weinstein now is because he has become bad for business on account of the recent PR. The only way to stop it is to make things public knowledge and threaten profits. Morality is expendable any place where millions of dollars are being moved. I hope more people learn this. Same goes in politics, but i'll stop here.&&I’m not in the industry or even close and I’ve been hearing about Harvey for a decade. &&To be fair, there's a lot of people who want to do something about it.  They're just not the right people for it to be effective.&&[deleted]&&I think everyone wants to do something about it. But what can be done? People trying to eke out a career are worried that they'll lose their livelihood, including the victims who have the shame of being assaulted on top of it. 

I'm not saying nothing CAN be done, but if it was easy, it would have happened already. &&She has said for many years that she wishes the whole thing were over with and that the state of California and the U.S. would drop the case.

I can respect her wanting to put it behind her, but still: The guy pleaded guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl, then fled the country to avoid punishment. I don't see how the government can just let that go, even if the victim wants to move on. If you start just letting criminals go because the victim wants to, you set up a really dangerous precedent where wealthy criminals get away with anything because they can pay off their victims to get them to go along with it.&&I don't know how often they're made, or how often they're granted, but a 13y/o isn't able to give consent- at the time or 20 years later.&&How is it weird? Imagine living your entire life as ""that woman who was raped as a child by a famous director"". 

She made it pretty clear over the years that she just wants to be left the fuck alone and that 40 years of constant media attention at this point does her more harm that Polanski ever did. &&It's highly likely she felt like she was the one to blame for his social life being soiled. Abuse makes victims believe some depressing things.&&No.  You've missed several key facts.

The judge rescinded the plea bargain *because Polanski already broke it after being pictured at a party with underage girls*.  That is the right of the judge.  He didn't secretly decide anything, the deal was made then Polanski broke it so the judge didn't accept it.

And Polanski vaginally and anally raped a drugged up young girl who was crying and pleading to be taken home as he was doing it.

This apologism for Polanski on here is ridiculous.  Read the actual case. &&[deleted]&&Have a source? It's just for the catalog after the Barbara Walters/ Corey Feldman post yesterday.&&She also defended Bill Cosby for a while. It's funny how easy it is for people to compartmentalize the behavior of people they care about it. 

Your friend is a rapist? But he's a good friend! That's not the friend you know. Better ignore than part and focus on the good parts.

Your relative is a racist/homophpbe/anti-semite? But they're nice to you, and they've always been a good person to *you*, so better ignore that.

Just dismiss or ignore the bad parts until it's impossible to do otherwise. Unfortunately, by then you've enabled them and given them tacit permission to do horrible things.  &&She was trying to spit it as statutory rape. &&Christ, you can seen Harvey Weinstein in the last crowd shot... how many of these sick fucks are pedos and rapists?&&3 friends and one other.

And Whoopee Goldberg defending Roman Polanski's drugging, sodomizing, and raping of a 13 year old girl because she doesn't think it was ""*rape* rape"".  Is *anyone* on The View not a total piece of shit?  Seriously, how do they defend these kinds of people without thinking ""I am completely and utter human garbage"" every night before they sleep?

Here is the clip of her saying it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZskUvAGyjQ

Here is the Barbara Walters clip where she victim blames and tells Corey Feldmen that he's ""damaging an entire industry"" because he was simply trying to expose the rampant sex abuse of minors in Hollywood that was posted above: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rujeOqadOVQ&&But then what really frustrates me is we all join in bashing on them when they fuck up.

My opinion was changed actually by Britney’s treatment back in 07. At first I was laughing at her along with everyone else. But I remember one day in class my teacher started tearing into her, mocking her for going crazy and I realized for the first time “holy shit she’s going crazy” and I was really disappointed in my teacher, who must have been in her 40s, for her complete lack of empathy.

Since then any time one of these stars (or even one of my friends) have a momentary lapse I judge it based on did they hurt anyone (ie fuck Chris Brown) and if not I’m pretty fucking forgiving cause who knows what they’ve been through, even if it happened years prior.

Cause I know even without fame, I could be a shit especially with alcohol/drugs involved. A lot of that stemmed from me coming to terms with a lot of shit I’d gone through when I was a kid and had suppressed it until I was like 15. From 15-17 I went crazy, then I shut down for college to the point where I got suicidally depressed, then I ended up becoming a full on alcoholic from 22-25 and doing some stupid fucking things. 

I wish we were more understanding of people in general and instead of looking for heroes, looked for people who were our kind of fucked up.&&The best scene in Bruno is Bruno interviewing stage parents about what they will be OK with their children doing in a movie.

He gets his kicks and disappears until he's ready to strike again.

Apparently Salva tried to make it more blatant with JC3. He had a character's entire backstory revolve around being abused by her stepfather, and had one of the other characters sympathizing with the abuser. The reviewers who attended the preview screenings who knew about Salva's crimes did not take that lightly. The studio ended up making Salva cut it because of the backlash, but it's clear Salva's still the same sick cunt he always was.&&Powder was like a love letter to NAMBLA once you know what you're looking at, just awful.&&[deleted]&&Holy shit.

Sorry, bad taste of humor. I just wanted to reinforce: the film industry is literally thousands and thousands of people, most just hard working people following their dreams of working in this industry.

Most, if not ""all"" of us are hiding nobody, protecting nobody, and are no more certain of rumors we hear than others. Many do hear things, or see things, and do nothing, and that's their moral burden to carry, as we all wish they'd done more. However, condemning film industry for the crimes and sins of the ""powerful"" is to condemn any major industry for the moral failures of the few.

Being able to separate all the good or worthwhile things we like about someone while still holding them accountable for being fallible or corrupt is important. It's not easy by any means but it's essential to moving forward. unfortunately a lot of people have a hard time with holding two conflicting ideas about a person at once  - that kind of cognitive dissonance is hard to process and reconcile.

But this *human being* was tied up and robbed. She was terrified out of her mind and people were mocking her and saying she deserved it. People said she actually *deserved* to get robbed like that because of a couple of social media posts. Nothing gives anyone the right to do that to someone else.

People see these celebrities and judge them harshly because we put them on a pedestal and then laugh when they fall off. These are real people with thoughts, feelings, hopes and dreams, just like us and they deserve at least common decency. 

But obviously fuck Chris Brown. I turn the radio off when I hear his songs. &&^ All of this.&&My brother is a heroin addicted scumbag. He's a criminal. He's stolen from my father, he wasn't there with us when Mom died, he would call my dad every day and ask ""to borrow $10""

My brother brought me American cheese slices when we were locked in our rooms with piss jars. He would climb out his window, sneak across the yard and bring me food from his stash.

My brother kept a friend of his from spiking a drink when I was 14 and trying to rape me. The friend punched him in the jaw and eye, and my brother and I had to hitchhike home. He never ""let"" me tag along to parties after that.

My brother, Michael, my brother, loved to draw Hot Rods; he drew them perfectly, he colored them pixel by pixel in Mario Paint and sent the pictures to Nintendo Power. He painted, he played guitar, he wept when we watched Schindler's List together as kids.

My brother was beaten senseless by our mom, and could never forgive her. My brother was overweight in school and beaten up by bullies. Someone brought a gun to elementary school in the fifth grade and blamed my brother. My brother was too scared to admit who actually brought the gun. He was scared. He was always scared. My brother. Michael. Was himself molested in a shed, laid next to me, and raped, next to me, by a pair of teenager neighborhood boys, 14 and 15..... while my mother slept a slumber of wine in the living room.

Michael *was* my brother.

Michael is dead. Only heroin remains.&&Sure, just look at Judy Garland. Her parents were complicit in forcing the drugs on her from the time she was a child. There's no way she was the only one. &&Not just that but Singer was named in the Open Secret documentary as one of the people who helped drug and rape pre-groomed male teens in hot tub parties ran by a production company called Den.&&Wow.

Mostly Disney films. They had the scrolling text every 15 minutes or so that said something like 'for promotional use only'.&&And it's a beautiful thing. &&Weinstein has [publicly stated that he thinks Polanski should go free.](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/harvey-weinstein-polanski-has-served-his-time-and-must-be-freed-1794699.html)&&Meryl Streep, she of the moral-rectitude, also clapping wildly. &&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Whale&&Pretty sure that's Cage's default setting.

These people are depraved sickos.&&That makes absolute sense, but I do wish they'd be a bit more... proactive, from now on.  I'm one of the simple fools who didn't know about Weinstein - so it's been a bit mind-boggling to find out that not only is the man scum, but to also find out that everyone knew and nobody had done anything.&&Unable to do anything about it?

All it took was for a handful of ladies to talk to a reporter and his world came crashing down in 48hrs.

Seemed like it just took a couple people with guts.

Now it's time for Corey Feldman to speak up and start naming all the Hollywood dudes who molested him and many others.&&yeah, but reddit is anonymous. you dont know what i look like, nor do i you. i can try a hundred times to identify you in a line up, and odds are i'd fail.

we dont have extensive established social contacts and companies whose job is connecting people for a living. 

we dont have that 10 or so conglomerates that control 80% of our posts and karma.

we dont have people that we can piss off and they can wipe our account off the face of the site.

there are whole COMPANIES, thousands and thousands of people, whose living is to know everybody and connect one guy to another.

we dont have supporting staff like waiters and valets rubbing shoulders with the rich and powerful in clubs and restaurants who's looking to join the industry and probably memorized all the bigwigs looks and names hoping to land a job.

saying hollywood dont know their members crimes, particularly those at the very tippy top of the industry and the politics they are pitting against each other daily trying to gain an edge, and the exclusive galas and events they like to throw for the big and powerful, saying nobody knows what's happening is frankly, bullshit.&&What better place than here, what better time than now?&&Ashton Kutcher is going after pedophiles like crazy, i wonder if something happened to him or someone he knows.&&The entire place is dirty, he’s going to fall on his sword, walk away quietly with his hundreds of millions of dollars,  and everyone will forget all about this by year’s end.&&The best time to plant a tree is seven years ago. The second best time is now.&&Corey Feldman is a shining example of what happens if you speak out. You wanna keep working? You keep your mouth shut.&&People gave a shit, they just weren't the right people.  Plus, Corey was still fearful of repercussions.  And, he's got no evidence which turns it into an out-of-work-has-been-actor says, rich-powerful-movie-mogul says.

Just remember that there still is no evidence against Harvey except anecdotal hearsay and a police witness wire that a State Attorney says process nothing.

People want to do something, but these people have money and the future ability to make money which makes them powerful in the absence of criminal evidence.&&[deleted]&&She fucking knew about Polanski, even gave him a standing ovation. His crimes weren't even covered up.&&Crimes are technically wrongdoings against the state. It’s not so much to punish him for what he did to someone in the past, but to prevent him from doing it again. Of course, civil cases would be the person to person dispute.&&Or if it had been *her* 13 year old daughter.&&She recently did a 9/11 movie called..

""Yeah, but they had sex before.""

Oh okay, so if you have sex once, it's not rape if you drug them and do what you want to them after that. Hollywood logic.&&Here's something that also blows my mind: she's actually on the  Academy’s board of governors (even says so in the article).  I wonder how she voted, and I also wonder how she compares in her mind what Weinstein did to what Polanski did.  I wonder if she's had second thoughts about it.&&Despicable. Thanks for the link. &&Fucking detestable. How she still has a career after making those statements is repulsive. She must have sold her eyebrows to maintain her career. Fyi have never had anything gainst Whoopi except for those nun movies.&&Jesus Christ what the fuck&&pretty much the reason OJ Simpson got so much support as well&&You are absolutely right. They have immense wealth and immense power and we don't know their names.

I'm sure if some investigative journalist really wanted to do an expose they could look up public records for settlements similar to the ones Weinstein's had in LA/California.&&Reminds me when Raven Symone said she [wouldn't hire someone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyG0sDA8D4M) with a ""sterotypical black name"" on the View.

Wes Anderson, Terry Gilliam, etc. not to mention all the people who worked with him recently, like kate winslet and christoph waltz :( bums me out&&Her statement regarding Harvey was practically a love letter (""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported."") 
He helped her career so I guess the mass raping doesn't count for much with Meryl.&&Trust me, Roman Polanski is a piece of shit in my eyes. Hollywood pisses me off cause 90% of the people we idolize over there talk a big game but knowingly support these fucks like Weinstein until public opinion turns on them. If Polanski was splashed all over the news tomorrow with a new scandal I bet you the majority of the people in that Academy video that we're cheering him on would be turning against him. Polanski and Allen and them got lucky. Their scandals happened before the proliferation of the internet like we have today. As a culture we condemn this shit more now and the internet can turn public opinion really fast. A lot of people dislike Polanski but they don't talk about it very much so Hollywood will just continue on praising him in the shadows. But just imagine if Polanski got splashed on every website starting tomorrow like Weinstein has been in the last 72 hours all these actors would turn on him to save their own asses.

But they won't. Cause Hollywood is two-faced. It's easier for them to just play stupid until it looks better to turn on the bad eggs. The vast majority of these actors and directors and producers know who the bad eggs are but they are too afraid to turn on them cause public opinion hasn't shifted. It's easier to turn a blind eye now until it is profitable to come forward.

I'm not blaming the victims. I know it's hard on them to come forward and rightly so. I'm blaming the powerful people who just let it happen cause they don't want to shake up the golden goose or change the status quo. Hollywood could Purge the bad eggs tomorrow if they wanted but they don't care to until we the public actually freak out. Things like this are only going to keep happening because Hollywood is just gonna keep turning a blind eye until they are forced to make a stand. Easier to talk a big game than actually do anything about it.&&He made money for allot of people, that in turn made many protect him. Its an extremely deplorable norm in hollywood.&&Check out roman polanski and woody allen.&&The problem is that if Corey Feldman publically names names without any proof, there's a very real chance he'll spend the next 10 years in court fighting defamation lawsuits and accomplishing nothing. He's suggested that the people he's talking about are of the Weinstein level of wealth and fame, which means they have swimming pools full of money to keep him tied up in legal misery for the rest of his life. &&Corey Feldman has done his part in talking about what's going on, and people haven't really taken him seriously or kept asking questions about who/where/when. Elijah Wood could certainly name some names since he's also talked about pedophilia in Hollywood.  I'm sure any guys who grew up in Hollywood have their stories about sexual harassment and/or sexual assault. &&A professional admitting she slept with someone to get ahead in her career = she does massive damage to her reputation because, even if Harvey goes down, she's still a ""whore that slept her way into roles"".  And there is huge risk because if he doesn't go down, you've taken all the heat for being a ""whore"" AND are blacklisted by one of the most powerful and well connected guys in your industry.  &&> we dont have that 10 or so conglomerates that control 80% of our posts and karma.

CAN'T STOP US NOW.&&yeah, Demi Moore hit on him&&Harvey does seem to have a fascination with Mila Kunis.

It’s pathetic.

Like with police, if you witness something and do nothing about it then you're absolutely culpable and making it worse by saying nothing. But if you're not surprised at all that Officer Dickface is caught raping someone because he's sketchy AF but you've never actually seen it or enough to make a verifiable report then there's not a lot you can personally do. Your credibility is shot and you're usually the type people stay away from because you can't be trusted with their dirty secret. 

It seems like there's groups in this: the victims, the predators, and the culpable witnesses. Everything else is hearsay and that narrative will be pushed by the best lawyers money can buy. &&Meryl Streep stood for Roman Polanski she doesn’t give a shit about about women other then herself.

They drugged and raped boys, children, for years and years, not just isolated incidents, and they got away with it. It's a circle of pedophiles that are basically untouchable. It's fucked up.

You can have both been a great contributor to the art of filmmaking, and a sexual predator scumbag.

Despite what many here may think his transgressions while heinous, do not invalidate the fact that he and his companies were responsible for supporting thousands of hours of art, giving hundreds of people a shot in the industry, and put thousands of people to work over the last several decades. 

Those worthy contributions to filmmaking do not forgive his transgressions either. He is wrong, has wronged many and needs to be held accountable. &&Sad thing is she will be back to lecturing everybody with her moral sanctitude by next Tuesday.

There are many police, teachers and health care providers who don't report colleagues for fear of retaliation.

At least that's what he said when people followed up on his first comment.&&There's a pretty big difference between someone who willingly and actively pursues a quid pro quo with a man like Weinstein, and women who were forced into situations that made them feel deeply uncomfortable, harassed, or straight up sexually assaulted. Some of these stories coming out, the audio that came out, it was Weinstein forcibly grabbing or assaulting women, exposing himself to women, coercing women, and then those women keeping quiet because going to the police or the public about this could harm her career. That's not a quid pro quo. That's a woman being terrified for her career and job security after being forced to experience something she did not want to experience. Weinstein isn't being cast out of Hollywood because he slept with actresses who may have wanted to advance their career. He's being cast out after multiple women have come forward about sexual assault.

Props to him for standing up, almost alone at the time, and speaking up about this then *if I am recalling his statement correctly, I am not certain!&&A lot of the responses to this headline are not taking some important details surrounding the circumstances into account.  
  
* Corey Feldman is one single, regular human being. He cannot take down an entire pedophilia ring, single-handedly.  
  
* Naming names will not dismantle a pedophilia ring. It will put him and his family's lives in danger.  
  
* Naming names without going into depth will fall on mostly deaf ears. It will not compel people, and it will not gain the amount of support needed to take it down.  
  
These are the reasons why I believe that his plan is the only way that he might have a chance at making a difference. The money is to make a compelling documentary, and to ensure the safety of him and his family. I'm hoping that there are people who are willing to give testimony if he can offer them protection. There is strength in numbers and I commend his bravery for fighting this battle alone, but he can't win it alone. 
  
Edit: Another point I want to add is that this is not about Feldman. There are children, **currently,** being abused, and it will continue to happen for as long as he is left to fight it alone.

1) what do you expect someone whose been systematically abused to act like? He’s fucked up and that is a symptom of the problem! You’re not going to get an abuse victim who had got all their shit together. 

2) “why does he need all the money?” While this may be a good question to ask, it is microscopic in importance compared to the amount of pain and suffering that could be prevented if it gets made. It is healthy to remain sceptical but this is a poor focus of concern, especially when people are crowdfunding peanut butter sandwiches for $50k. If you have a problem with giving Corey the money, then help him get money to pay to have experts on the payroll. Watch his video when he announced this, he needs support and love, it doesn’t seem like he’s scamming anyone, he seems hurt.&&Normally I agree with name names instead of making money off it but in this case you need money because they if you call someone famous a pedophile he will sue the hell out of you whether he is guilty or not.&&This is an issue more complex than most of us know. We can say name names all we want but as it is, the[ statute of limitations](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/california-statute-of-limitations-on-sexual-abuse.html) on any of his cases is long over. Not only does he not have to say anything at all, it's not in his best interest to do so. The only legal battle to come from that at this point is a liable or slander lawsuit against Corey. So the people who violated him for years get to come back and do it again by taking the money he endured untold abuses to gain. I can't imagine voluntarily putting myself back in the control of my abusers and I can't blame him for not wanting to end up in this position.

He could also name names tomorrow but that doesn't mean any one has to give him a platform. For all the years pedophilia has been an ""Open Secret"" in Hollywood, the pedophiles have to have a pretty strong hold on the media to keep it from turning to public knowledge with accompanied public outcry. He's already an eccentric guy with a rep for being crazy, so even if the platform is there, many will discredit what he is saying.

So a documentary with thorough investigation, legal oversight for what can be said, multiple victims coming forward with their own stories, with independent distribution seems like the best way to be heard and make it count. $10 million seems a bit steep, but Indigogo will take it's cut off the top, plus distribution of donation incentive items, plus security for everyone involved, plus lawyers since it's a documentary calling out rich, well-connected people for being pedophiles, a very serious accusation, one to sue for. Not all of the $10 million will go directly to production. 

It's your choice to support him or hate him for this, and I understand both sides of the coin. But given the circumstances, I think his is going about this in the best way he can to see that his story and other victims' stories are heard loud and clear.

Edit to add: ([from a different comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78xgsh/corey_feldman_fundraising_10m_to_make_documentary/doxyxwc/)) The pedophilia issues of Hollywood are an ""Open Secret,"" there is even a documentary on it! Just because Feldman is the one guy rearing up to tell the secrets to the public, doesn't mean he is the one guy who knows who the real creeps in Hollywood are. And doesn't mean the parents child actors haven't been clued in to who the creeps are in a more private setting.&&Has he still not said the names of any of the people responsible? For years, decades maybe, he's been saying powerful people in Hollywood are doing  this and that, which may be true, but never mentions any names. Is this documentary going to be a long episode of Finding Bigfoot?&&Claims he is ready to ""name names"".&&I'm all for donating to fund some private investigators to expose pedophile rings.

I have no interest in giving Feldman money to do a hack job expose that will be likely done in a manner that it is easily dismissed even if factually true due to a large amount of hyperbole&&It's an important story that needs to be told but I fear that with him 9.8 of the ten million will go to ""Corey being Corey"" stuff and .2 million will go to production resulting in a train-wreck of a film; much like his musical career....&&I feel for him as I would anyone who was molested as a child....but his vagueness over the years has always bothered me. Either be a crusader against it or don't, name names or don't. The obscureness of what hes been saying for years that really bugs me..But I get he's not obligated to do anything, there's no right or wrong reaction to being a victim of abuse. I hate that I do, but I cant help but feel he uses what happened to him as a way to cling on to the small amount of celebrity he has.&&Or you could, you know, just fucking release the names of the Pedophiles already. Why protect them? &&Or he could just tell everyone who the pedophiles are for free.&&Serious question: What would someone trying to make a documentary determine they need ten million dollars for?  I ask because I can't help but imagine that most people are going to be aware that documentaries don't normally cost anywhere near that, which will lead to some negative impressions of this fundraiser.&&As much as I hope that this works to end the fucked up shit in Hollywood, this campaign has a very scammy vibe to it. While he may have completely honest and moral intentions there were some things that were somewhat off putting to me.

-The 10 Million dollar goal

-Flexible funding (all money goes to Corey regardless if goal is met)

-The extremely high reward tiers

Now I'm not 100% certain, but it appears that the minimum you can  donate is $100? That seems like a very steep amount to ask anyone wanting to get involved. If you can donate less, it wasn't immediately apparent to me.

edit: Nevermind, I'm used to Kickstarter, you can donate whatever amount by clicking the ""back"" button.&&Not to be cynical but why not just come out and provide the names. Why is a ten million dollar documentary a necessary prerequisite for outing wanton criminals.&&You can see a sadness in his eyes if you watch stand by me&&As someone that was affected by childhood trauma even half a million would be nice in the wake of having everyone abandon me leaving me to fend for myself with a disability due to the abuse.

It takes 10 million to make a documentary? Couldn't the money be better served to rescue or help current victims? I'm sure awareness has its place but meh. Maybe I'm jaded. I don't care about Hollywood anymore. There have been plenty of warning signs since child actors even started being a thing.

I never had money or fame to fall back on. There are plenty others without the luxury that live on bug ridden mattresses in hollowed out holes too. Stories of suicides. It's all sad.

I feel terrible even suggesting it but I wish I'd been as lavished in the midst of the abuse I encountered even under the eyes of the church. Anyway.

I wish him the best. I really do.

Still can't shake the feeling this is all reverse publicity or something.. like they're somehow recruiting through this near advertisement like clickbait style interviews he does. Always says the same stuff. Always vague. Never gets to names. Only eludes to the conduct. Begging for attention without actually helping the people that need it. The kids. Like.. why not become a manager and see fit that none are harmed. Be a leader in change of the industry.. as opposed to perpetuating it by advertising the atrocities.&&As a survivor of sexual abuse, I understand and share the desire to see names called out and justice served. What I can't understand is the impetus to profit from whistle-blowing while delaying any potential for justice in lieu of servicing your greed, and while these perpetrators and pedophiles are still out there. As Corey said; at least one of the men who abused him is still working in a very powerful position in Hollywood. This means it is possible or even likely others are suffering and will continue to suffer until Corey raises $10 million and writes, produces, directs, and releases his, ""movie.""

So, yes, good on Corey for expressing a desire to expose these assholes. But fuck him for asking the public to pay him to do it. And fuck him for staying quiet while others may be suffering. This is bullshit.

Let me give this some context:

I am not trying to be sanctimonious. I am in my forties and have worked in the film and television industry my whole life. I grew up in the Valley hanging out with Corey at parties when he wasn't off shooting movies. I know the guy. I watched as his life and career careened off the track. Corey is magnificent at playing the victim. That's not a judgment on his character, it is just who he is and to be fair he absolutely has been victimized. There are, as everyone now has firm proof, predators within our industry who prey on the young and vulnerable.

When the story about Harvey broke, the industry became awash in a desire to see more of the truth exposed like I have never seen before. It's quite remarkable. This is a watershed moment, to be sure, and one that can make real change.

I saw the footage with Corey and Barbara Walters, and thought to myself, 'Now is his chance. He has a real audience ready to listen to his story and dozens of industry professionals who will back him up. All he has to do is come out.' But, somehow I knew he would screw this up, which is exactly what he is doing.


He is muddying his message with bullshit about safety for himself, stories about nearly being killed, and a plea to raise $10 million to protect himself and shoot a bullshit movie that no one will want to see in theaters (no one goes to theaters anymore, by the way). Others are donating profits from their projects and their work (see Kevin Smith) to causes that are close to this subject. Meanwhile, Corey does the exact opposite. He looks to personally famewhore and profit. That's what he always does.

Meanwhile, assuming Corey's claims are true, and I have no reason to think they couldn't be, there are predators out there who are probably victimizing other young actors and actresses. Predators Corey could stop RIGHT NOW. But he is choosing to wait.

The reality is, that movie will likely take 12 months, minimally, to make. Releasing it will take another period of time; months at least. That's 18-24 months, at least, that these people continue to victimize unabated because Corey wants to ride this wave famously and fiscally and make his movie, instead of just going on 20/20 or 60 Minutes or GMA or Pick-Your-Show-Here to name names.
That's shameful. Honestly. What if the movie NEVER gets released? What if he just takes whatever money he is making from his GOFUNDME - the same GOFUNDME he used to finance his albums and lifestyle - and says, ""I couldn't finish it,"" or, ""I couldn't get it released."" That's a possibility, too.

I understand wanting to support Corey. I want to support him, too. But as one character famously said in The Matrix, ""Not like this.""&&Talk with journalists! Jesus, go to the Boston Globe! If they can expose worldwide institutionalized pedophilia in the Catholic Church, they can handle some Hollywood rings. Go to the FBI! Jeez 60 Minutes maybe? With all the hype now about sexual abuse, I'm damn sure someone would like to make their career with this story.&&Let's be honest, this sounds more like a cash grab rather than him wanting to do good. The issue is *because* he had a sad past, people feel like you can't fault him for trying to abuse the situation. They get very protective of him because he suffered in the past.

Which is fair enough, but it's still healthy to stay skeptic. If he truly wants to make a change, he'd do an interview and name the names instead of getting 10 million to do so and make it all dramatic. This is just so... American. Don't have a better word for it. Sensationalizing something deeply disturbing. &&Corey is the last person I would want spearheading this campaign. Have you paid attention to him in the past 10 years? He's beyond fucking mental and it's sad seeing people take advantage of him.&&Ashton Kutcher needs to get on board&& I guarantee you if or when he doesn't raise the $10 million, he blames some cabal of illuminati and more Hollywood paedophiles for not getting the money raised it's going to be a big joke; let's just admit the truth with this guy, he needs some psychiatric help that's all &&So Corey is complaining that he has been almost run over twice and arrested and feels threatened since making his proclamation to expose the pedophile ring.  My first thought was ""hey buddy, what's the takeaway lesson from this?  Maybe next time, instead of announcing your intentions and giving your targets time to cover their tracks and maybe even time to try to kill you, how about you don't announce it first and just do it next time?""....It leads me to think that maybe he doesn't have as much evidence as he is suggesting, or that he is hoping to recruit help with his announcement.  Because otherwise, that seems like really poor judgement to me&&Seems like way too much money for a Documentary. I'm not saying he shouldn't make one, but honestly, most documentary makers would be ecstatic about getting even a million. I would think he could do it for $100K and it would be great with today's tech and whatever connections he has.&&Something tells me this guy's motive isnt what he claims it to be&&He's damaging an entire industry! - Barbara Walters with Harvey Weinstein's dick in her mouth&&Budgets of other documentaries:

It’s really sad. &&Okay I'm in full support of this, but has Feldman never crowdsourced funds before for a project? The perks are way too expensive for what he's asking for. Not to say that some of it doesn't make sense but in my experience a good way to get funds faster is to have perks cheaper than $50-100. And the $50 perk is already gone (because most people would like to contribute smaller amounts en mass) Digital copies, etc are often an essential part of getting funds faster. That being said I really want him to be successful.&&I have to wonder though, if he was really doing this for the betterment of people, he'd just say the names, now... before they can kill him .... or come up with their defence story .... he just wants $10 million. I'm not saying bad things didn't happen to him or he's lying by any means... I'm just not understanding if he clearly doesn't care if he dies .. why he doesn't just point all the pedos out... why does he have to do it through documentary? :s &&This is a front in order to ""scam"" in the form of fleecing gullible vulnerable people out of donations for someone who desires to push that cause yet is a very poor person to donate to and is going to keep a large portion of the funds&&Please don't give Corey Feldman $10MM... he is going to OD.&&I hope all if this happens legally (police investigate current abuse, those same pedophiles are probably still doing it) and a solid documentary happens.

I commend him for that.

Weinstein produced some of the best films in the past like 20 years or so, but it doesn't matter. Shut him down, shut the studio down, whatever the hell is supposed to be done. I don't know if anyone is suing the studio or him or what's going on exactly, but I want that piece of shit blacklisted.&&[removed]&&After some deep digging, I have come up with a list of possible names that match all of the criteria Haim, Feldman, and the people in ""An Open Secret"" provided. The two most likely candidates are Bryan Singer, and Rob Reiner.

**Singer** is more or less confirmed to have been involved in a number of legally questionable sexual situations, but a court case against him was recently dropped after the plaintiff was shown to have committed fraud. Others directly related to, and implicated in the Singer case include Garth Ancier, Garry Goddard, and David Neuman. All 4 of these men were principal investors in DEN, the network covered in An Open Secret. Singer himself is seen promoting DEN in the documentary, and was accused in multiple accounts of either knowingly, or unknowingly taking part in the alleged drugging and sexual assault of minors during his involvement in DEN.

The owners of DEN, Brock Pierce, Chad Shackley, and Marc Collins-Rector were all arrested for the sexual abuse of minors, with only Collins-Rector facing actual prison time, after being accused of raping drugged minors at gunpoint. Singer also was close friends with former Nickelodeon actor and producer for numerous kids shows, Brian Peck, convicted sex offender who plead guilty to sexual assault of a minor. Peck was featured in dual DVD commentary with Singer on one of Singer's films, the two having worked together closely at points in their career.  

There are several other anecdotes concerning Singer, some even made by posters in this thread. But a prominent rumor about him is his preference for young-looking gay men, while obsessively checking their IDs to confirm they are of legal age.

**Reiner** fits all of the criteria perfectly, from his level of power and success, to his public image, to the age range, as well as having been directly involved in the direction or production of films/shows which Feldman and Haim starred in exactly around the time their sexual abuse is alleged to have happened. In a Comedy Central roast in 2000, former SNL writer-turned-Senator Al Franken made a tongue-in-cheek allusion to child rape and pedophilia when joking about Reiner. Haim is known to have spent time with Reiner at Reiner's home while auditioning for the film Stand By Me, which also featured Feldman, whom Haim accused of introducing him to the alleged pedophile. 

There are others who make the list that are less convincing, such as Dominick Brascia (who a friend of Haim accused following his death), Oliver Stone(friend of Harvey Weinstein who defended him following recent sexual assault allegations, and accused of molestation of a Playboy model), and Stephen King (writer of several films direct by Reiner, including Stand By Me). 

And to be clear, I'm not saying Singer or Reiner did anything at all. I'm simply saying they are two people who happen to fit the criteria.&&I see it as him trying to do what Leah Remini has done with her Scientology documentary. she has been saying all these things against scientology for years and nobody gave a damn or listened, but once she formatted her story and that of others who suffered as she did, it got way more attention than she ever had before.&&Sadly, he did name names in 1993 to the police while they were investigating Micheal Jackson. He said Michael Jackson never molested him, but others did. This was just before the statute of limitations expired. Nothing was done.
http://www.dailywire.com/news/22793/flashback-corey-feldman-named-his-abusers-1993-paul-bois&&Seems like this is flying over people's heads. &&Replying to the top comment for visibility, here is the indiegogo campaign. Really should already be higher up...

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/corey-feldman-s-truth-campaign#/&&Why is he fighting it alone? There are lots of groups dedicated to fighting child traffixing and pedophila, including some deep pocketed media figures like Chris Hansen. Why not tie up with them? Even if he raises $10 million, he's still a private individual. Better to have a resourced and experienced organization behind him. That will put the victims at ease as well, as otherwise they only have his personal word.&&This would have been true in the old days.  Right now, naming names is likely to start a giant chain reaction.

Nobody talked about Cosby out in the open for years. Then the cascade happened. Nobody talked about Weinstein out in the open for years.  Then the cascade happened.

If Feldman can name names and he's telling the truth, the cascade will happen.&&> Naming names will not dismantle a pedophilia ring. It will put him and his family's lives in danger.

I don't agree with this at all. He needs to name names NOW while people are paying attention to this. Not a year from now while more people are victimized. It gives the pedos doing this time to clean house of all evidence by the time this comes out. If he fears for his family then he needs to get the police involved asap. Not dangle that fact that he's going to drop names in front of these sickos. Thats just more reason to take him out before he gets the chance to talk.&&[deleted]&&I disagree with some of this. 

If Feldman is in a position to damage people then his life and his families lives would already be in danger. If you're considered a threat to someone who would do that sort of harm to you, then you're always considered a threat. They're not going to wait for you to announce your movie. 

Also, naming names also literally just brought down Harvey Weinstein. &&Why can't he go the police and/or the press? The press is ultimately what brought down Weinstein and, in the UK, Saville. 

Journalists have an entire process and legal protection that allows them to protect sources. You don't need to donate millions to do this in a documentary when The New York Times will do it now. That seems a preferable source of action since they will likely ensure they have enough to go on before naming names too. &&One other thing I'd add: This is his story and HE gets to decide how he tells it. Even if you don't think a movie is the best idea or that he's trying to reinvigorate his career, it doesn't really matter. It's his life, his knowledge, and his story. People are acting like he has some kind of moral obligation to do this the way everyone else thinks is best.&&There are pedophilia rings in politics as well. They exist in centers of power. Nebraska had one exposed in 2002. &&How will getting 10 million help protect him and his family? If they want them dead 10 million isn't going to do shit. I don't like to be cynical but Corey is going about this entirely the wrong way. &&Exactly. Somebody read the article and thought critically about the situation.

Great comment in a sea of nonsense.&&Not only that but do people really think those kind of people will let him make this documentary? They will kill him.&&>Naming names will not dismantle a pedophilia ring. It will put him and his family's lives in danger.

source? Seems to me that if they knew he held all this information, this mysterious murderous paedophile ring would have killed him long ago. And I'm sure they definitely will now, since he's planning to unmask them? Right?

It was a compelling documentary about a current event. Now, the entire case is being gone over with a fine-tooth comb because of the public outcry.

Cory Feldman does not expect his documentary to literally take down the ring single-handedly. But he knows how powerful bringing things out of the shadows can be.  It will help others find their voice, and hopefully compel enough people into action that these horrible predators will be taken down.&&I just watched that netflix docu about One Of US. Apparently there is still counseleors at Hasidic Jew Summercamps out there with propensity of raping young boys.  Yes, you are right, lest us forget other power dynamic institutions.&&Even worse is that in the article it said that Haim was only 11 and not 15.&&It’s not fair to refer to the nurses as “enablers”, Savile had ties to the police and to organised crime plus he was loaded and had top lawyers which is why no one stood up to him. There’s a transcript of a police interview with Savile where he allows the officers to question him then he makes a statement about how he’s a well connected man with a lot of money and is very litigious. He says that should charges be brought then he’d sue his victim and that the police officers would find their careers ruined for making such allegations against him. It’s not even a thinly veiled threat but he said it all during a recorded police interview because he was untouchable. 
  
If the police couldn’t do anything to him then some nurse had no chance. If they did stop him they’d either be sued for everything they owned or they’d turn up dead in a canal. &&Electric Boogaloo&&Yeah I can't understand it.

Can we not give this man, this victim, the benefit of the doubt for one fucking time in his life?

Edit: A lot of you really need to take a step back and ask yourself ""why do I care so much about this?"". If you don't believe in this cause, then don't fucking donate. If you're actively going around and trying to convince others not to donate as well, you should feel absolutely fucking disgusted with yourself.&&ITT: People who have zero experience with film production acting like executive producers.&&Every single one of these stories has broke because one person named a name then dozens of others came out and corroborated it.

The entire 8 episode series of Planet Earth cost £8m to make. Even adjusting for inflation, that's £10.6m... Not far off $10m really. 

And that was one of the most expensive documentaries the BBC has ever made. It took 5 years to make, sent camera crews deep into harsh nature..

Cory wants $10m to interview some people? Outrageous. It's a cynical cash grab by him as he attempts to remain relevant after years of not being relevant. &&Think about it like this. The Panama papers were a HUGE deal. We heard about them for months. They came out...some people cared. A few famous people were named, but the list was there to read. The information was available. I can only name a few things off the top of my head from that. People wanted something juicy. This is going to be similar. Yea....maybe 10m is steep. But the bigger and more catching the story is, the more it will catch peoples attention. Now and for years to come. There was also a post around here that mentioned Leah Remini and Scientology.  You have to go big, or no one cares, regardless how important the issue is. &&You can see sadness in MY eyes after I watch stand by me&&I was a victim too, and I feel exactly the same way as you do. It reeks of money grab.&&Well said. I'm thinking most of the people arguing against this are naive and can't see the bullshit Corey is doing. I've been around long enough to know when something smells fishy and this certainly does.

I fully support Corey but how he's doing this is wrong.&&Fuckn right tell the truth without benefit of said truth.&&It’s almost like naming names would be so much easier...&&He has his own women cult the angels..
&& 5 million in 1994 would be about 8 million today. &&Probably for lawyers, I suppose?&&Can you imagine the lawsuits that are going to drop on his head once he starts naming names?  I don't blame the guy asking for a boatload of money to secure legal protection.  &&HBO hired/contracted/retained (I'm not sure) 160 lawyers to review the final product and in preparation for potential lawsuits from the CoS when ""Going Clear"" was made. They also had to handle security for the filmmakers, author, and those who participated in the documentary, who were being stalked by CoS due to their participation. I'm sure that cost much more than $10 million. 

Corey is in a position to name insanely powerful, rich people with insanely wealthy backers. For example, if Corey named someone like Tom Cruise, he could end up dealing with the wrath of the CoS legal team that even HBO was worried about. He and his family may already be in danger if anyone guilty of molestation believes that he'll name them directly. I'm thinking the bulk of the money is for physical and legal protection for himself and anyone that will also name names. &&He has, and the whole idea is half baked to begin with.

I suggest an alternative idea, one we've seen at least twice so far, if he names some names and those names get into the media, of which they absolutely will.

It will then grow the courage of the countless others who fell into the clutches of the people he named. Then a-la CosbyStein. We then have some results.

Most people always brushed it off because Jackson was 'weird' and that fits with our stereotype of predators being 'different' from us which clearly isn't the case.

Conversely, both Cosby and Weinstein seemed 'normal' like the rest of us and I think that's part of the reason that they got away with it for so long.  They were hidden in plain sight because we expected monsters to look like monsters.&&> Nobody talked about Cosby out in the open for years. Then the cascade happened. Nobody talked about Weinstein out in the open for years. Then the cascade happened.

Sorry, but that's just not true. People did in fact talk about Cosby and Weinstein openly over the years. ***It's just that nobody cared***. Newspapers and TV outlets were pressured to drop the stories, journalists' careers were threatened, etc. especially when each of them were at their prime as sexual predators.&&Well he's already been marginalized by the industry and he's been trying to tell people his experiences, but nobody takes him seriously. He needs to be bang-on with his message or his story will fall on deaf ears. A compelling documentary is probably the best way to do it in his case.&&People talked about Cosby and Weinstein for years. There's a reason they were known as 'open secrets'. It's just that nobody cared. 

Feldman's been talking about his experiences for years also, and so far nobody has cared there either. &&That's why ""me too "" worked. Hell I wasn't molested but harassed as a teenage by older boys because I had boobs before other girls and I felt like shouting me too . I haven't until now. Odd. But here it goes...I was in 7th grade our bus was k-12. Usually the oldest kids would sit in the way back, especially high school boys. I was one of the last kids to be picked up and the very last seat was empty often. The h.s boys moved up to the middle and would push me as I walked down the aisle to find a seat. They pushed me into each other hoping the could feel my boobs. It was awful. I didn't tell anyone and I don't know why. I guess I thought the bus driver would tell them to stop pushing me but bus driver didn't say anything. One of my brothers friends was a culprit too then stopped being part of it when he started actually hanging out at my house with my brother. 

One of the boys, an older senior, probably at least 17 or 18 at the time started passing me ""love"" notes.. our middle school and h.s were in the same building, shared some common areas. My brother found out and told my mom. My mom, culturally not aware of how inappropriate it was for an 18yr old to express interest in a 13 yr old, in response only reminded me I wasn't allowed to date until I was 16.  Pft. I had a ""playground"" boyfriend in 5th grade, he was In 4th. He rode the same bus but never did or said anything either though.. we didn't even talk since it was 2yrs post breakup and he was still in elementary school when I started middle school. Lol

The boys on the bus were a menace, eventually I learned if I missed the bus I could get a ride to school or I was still within 2 miles so I could walk. I did walk home. 

Sorry about my personal cascade. But they happen. If one of the boys on my bus was famous and a female came out and said he assaulted her, I'd cascade again and speak up to help be supportive of the initial person reporting. &&We're probably naive to think big names like Weinstein and Cosby were brought down because their victims started to come forward. I'm sure their victims have spoken and been silenced for decades. They each probably pissed off the wrong powerful person and got destroyed as a result&&in each example it took decades and tens upon tens of victims coming forward, and even then in each case it was a hard slog and the victims were treated poorly.&&yeah, i agree. 

He is fundraising a documentary, why would naming names put his family in danger but a whole documentary is completely ok? And after he got the money, made the documentary everyone involved will ether destroying all evidence or fleeing the country.&&> He needs to name names NOW while people are paying attention to this.

The problem isn't that his life will be in danger, the problem is that he'll be sued for more money than he'll make in the rest of his life. 

Let's picture how it'd go down:

* Corey accuses Mister X, a successful producer.  

* His allegations are widely publicized. Hollywood, still reeling from the Harvey Weinstein debacle, jettisons Mister X instantly. Mister X used to be a successful producer, now he is unemployable.   

* Mister X then sues Corey for defamation of character/slander/libel/etc.  

* In court, Corey can't produce a shred of evidence or corroborating witnesses.   

* Mister X is then awarded all the money the court estimates he would've made had his career continued. 

* Mister X further asserts that this is essentially fraud, because Corey is profiting off of this case via fundraising, publicity, etc. That means punitive damages kick in, and now Corey owes more money than he'd make in 10 lifetimes. 

Disclaimers: 1) I'm not a lawyer and 2) haven't been following this story. If Corey has a few witnesses, that changes everything.&&Have you fended off a libel lawsuit from a very wealthy and powerful person? This would easily bankrupt him and tie him up in court for years. This is why people are leery about naming names. &&They couldn't have taken Harvey down without the number of people that came forward. For some reason the victims of this pedophilia ring are too scared to come forward still. &&> his life and his families lives would already be in danger

I  don't know if this is the first time you're hearing about this, but... yeah dude, they have been. He's been involved in a few suspicious car wrecks, people have tried to drive him off of the road. Unless you're willing to, yet again, say he is lying about this when he only has everything to lose, here, then I mean what's the fucking point? 

And, he can't just come out and name names, because they'll sue him for slander, in a climate where not everyone is able to come forward about this and back him up. It's easy to dismiss one guy. Obviously this isn't about making a movie, it's about being able to afford the journalistic venture that it is going to take to cobble together enough evidence to prove at least circumstantially, enough that a real investigation will happen and people will take him seriously. Do you know the story behind the film ""spotlight""? 

think about this for 5 minutes, yknow? &&Because Weinstein is one person; not an entire ring. He also had enough victims come forward. If only one person came forward, he would not be the villain he is today. He would simply be the accused. 
  
But, people are too scared to come forward about this, and for many years they were scared of Harvey. It's not that simple. &&Making a documentary is using the press. He could try to hand it off to someone else and hope they’d understand and attack the situation the same way someone who’d lived through it first hand does, but why when that would expose his story to more political spinning, more outside influences, and more people to challenge what he’s saying while he’s trying to say it? No one needs to donate millions. If people are interested in funding it they will in smaller amounts.

Going to the press and police didn’t touch Saville, it only hurt the victims. Only after he was dead, 48 years after the first allegations, did the truth come out and they were believed. Just because the press doesn’t run with it and the police don’t arrest anyone doesn’t imply it was never reported.&&A few reasons.. 

1) He will be sued immediately.  That in itself is not an actual significant issue

2) No one will work with him.  He'll be completely out of hollywood, in total

3) There is no way that a Journalist can protect him.  He knows that.

4) Police will not protect him.  He also knows that.

5) He is aiming to both Ruin a TON of people's careers, call out people who we see as respectable, piss off people who have more money than sense (people will literally hire hitmen, like I said, no sense), get himself into legal trouble and get a whole bunch of people into CRIMINAL legal trouble (aka, arrested, indicted, jailed, etc).

You need resources like a full research and investigative team, an office to run an operation, other lawyers to prep the case, and most importantly the time it takes to follow this process through.

They see Corey as a voice for them.  I also think Corey still has a shit load of fans out there and that's reasonable too.

I don't know Corey Feldman.  What I do know are small tidbits we see on reality shows and interviews.  He seems to have a personality disorder.  He struggles to see anything outside his own problems.  I saw him on the Surreal Life program basically hijack the show and direct the final episodes to make it all about his impromptu wedding.  I thought the guy was fucking insane on that show.  He apparently said it was all edited out of context.  Ok I'll give him that one.  Then he goes on that Celeb Wife Swap show and I watch it only because it's Corey and I wanna see if he's gonna trainwreck.  Sweet jesus the guy was brainwashing troubled women into following his strict vegetarian diet and forcing them to exercise every day as one of his ""angels"". In return Corey will help them break into the industry.  It really seemed like a sex cult. He's gone on record that they don't ""have to have sex with me"" but it certainly helps.  From third hand stories, no men are allowed around Corey's harem unless they're bringing him more girls. If an ""angel"" decides to defect there is evidence that Corey leaves them threatening phone messages that he will black list them in Hollywood.  He wife swapped with some guy named Tommy.  Tommy got Corey's main angel or as he called her, his ""maingle"".  Corey treated Tommy's wife like a sex object, expecting her to follow his regime.  When the wives are given an opportunity to impose their standards on their swapped ""husbands"" she suggests that Corey's angels think for themselves and do what they want.  Corey flipped out.  He almost cried.  He literally said that he will not allow anyone to come into his house and ""reprogram"" his girls.

If Corey was victimized then he deserves justice.  But I don't think Corey understands what justice is.  Justice for Corey means ""I've been through a lot and now the world owes me fame for the rest of my life"".  And that isn't going to solve Hollywood's pedophile problem at all.  In fact he's getting in the way of it.  Corey isn't naming names for a good reason.  Once he does the spotlight will shift, and he can't have that.  He needs to dangle this information and release it in the most dramatic way possible and the main focus the entire time will be Corey.  &&I think you mean high priced hooker service, Corey's Angels, he pimps out at his house parties to his friends.

That said, I 100% agree with you.

Harvey Weinstein was outed as a rampant rapist / sexual abuser.

He's probably one of the most powerful people in all of Hollywood. He's not organizing mafia hits on the people who have come out against him.

Can't think of people who are ""even more powerful"" than Weinstein, who would order executions on Cory and co.

The fact is, public are totally willing to believe now how truly depraved some of these Hollywood bigwigs are... outing them immediately will hopefully quickly prevent further abuse and also start the process of prosecuting these foul people ASAP.&&It's a fine theory and tbh I don't doubt a few people would also come forward. I do doubt, however, that it would be anywhere near ""countless"".

There's a big difference between this type of child abuse and what Weinstein did. Weinstein manipulated adults and weilded his power of industry in grotesquely unethical ways; he coerced and arguably forced dozens of women into sexual acts by effectively withholding their livelihoods. But they were all *adult* women. They were old enough that they knew what he was doing was wrong but, because of the power Weinstein wielded, they couldn't deny him.

What Feldman is trying to bring to bear is an entirely different beast. We as a society look at sexual deviants and pedophiles in wholly different lights. It is almost inarguable that the average pedophile is worse than the average rapist in our collective eyes. The amount of control and manipulation these people do to children is magnified because their victims *are children*, meaning their minds and behaviors are exponentially more malleable than an adults'. An adult women harassed or raped by Harvey Weinstein has the wisdom to know that if she comes out against Weinstein then his power crumbles. But to a child of abuse the power their abuser held over them doesn't work like that. Weinstein held success and money over the heads of these women, but an active pedophile (or group of pedophiles, in this case) have much, MUCH more to lose than Weinstein. He's facing a life in jail, but those pedophiles would be facing death. Plain and simple.

There are plenty of sexual deviants and sexual abusers in prison. They survive. You know who doesn't survive? People who fuck with kids.

A ring of pedophiles is infinitely more likely to bust out the big unethical guns to avoid discovery than any abuser of adults, and the children they abuse who grow into adults know this. That's why it's so difficult to bring these types of rings down, because even in the face of all rational thought that these formerly abused adults will be protected, they cannot get over the mental hurdle that's been instilled in them since they were a child that if they tell anyone, they will surely regret it.&&Chris Hansen didn’t do that, though. He was not a part of Perverted Justice. He was asked to be involved to get the stings put on TV. None of this was done *for* the show, it was done regardless of the show, and TCAP showcased a small percentage of it. The girls never offered sex, if the criminal was not the first to suggest sexual activity the whole thing would be thrown out. That was a very serious rule and everyone stung had approached someone they were explicitly told was under 15 and asked them for sexual conversation.

That said, it also supports your point that he’s not in this game to save the world, he’s a TV presenter who presents whatever is interesting and gets views. Dateline isn’t the forum for a story like this coming from an actual victim.&&Its actually really sad that there are people who would *prefer* to catch these people for entertainment than, say for the good of the children.&&I disagree with his methods but the sheer number of people who showed up to those houses leaves no doubt in my mind what could be going on in the circles of power in Hollywood and other places.

Of course, they'll drop the story as soon as the next big thing hits...&&[deleted]&&Even just casually browsing reddit, I read tons of people talking about Weinstein as if it were fact just waiting for enough people to care. When it finally happened, my very first thought was ""reddit predicted this"".&&Exactly. Remember the clip of him on the View and Barbra Walters (certainly a good representative of the old school ""industry""). He was speaking out about what happened to him and all she said to him is ""You are destroying an industry!!!"" She had no shock (because she already knew it was happening) she had no concern for future victims, she was just concerned about the abusers. 

There a LOT of powerful people who feel the same way as her. And to say something that can be heard over their power can only come in the form of something like a well produced documentary. &&That's because a lot of people in Hollywood are in the pedo ring. Some well known celebrities protect pedos. *cough* Roman Polaski.&&damn reading this and being able to relate bc i was treated the same way by high school boys on my bus when i was a little kid- they would tell me that i would be allowed to sit in back with the cool older kids, i just had to let them touch me in certain ways....bus driver never did anything, i was way too young to know better but it's still cripplingly embarassing to think i let that happen just so i could sit w 'the cools kids'. it's not even that bad a thing that happened to me but i still get panic attacks sometimes when i see a school bus haha. i hope you are doing well now <3 &&$10 million buys you a lot of personal security and lawyers. What was Paranormal Activity's budget again?&&How many people have evidence of Harvey Weinstein's actions? Is he suing everyone who's talking right now?&&That's not how a libel lawsuit works at all. Feldman doesn't have to prove anything. The plaintiff has to prove that the information is false *and* that Feldman acted with Actual Malice.&&I understand your argument but he plans on dropping the names in the documentary. How is that any different than dropping names now?&&And a documentary will do what? Talk about how bad it is, but without naming names? Then it's just like a fictional dramatization.&&People who don't get it- think of what happened to Gawker. And that only happened because a very wealthy man was outed as gay.

Imagine the reaction for outing very well connected pedophiles and sexual assailants. &&Have you?&&He’d be wise to transfer all his assets to his wife (assuming he can 100% trust her) before naming names.

They can’t get blood from a stone.&&Probably because they are primarily male, leading stars/formerly leading stars. 

Think of Feldman’s cast mates and crowd when he was younger. Some people didn’t fall into the hell That Corey and happened to adjust. Some could be manly men, egotistical men or men in straight denial/ashamed of what happened and feel like they will be treated negatively so reluctant to just come forward with it. &&A lot of the victims have been psychologically abused to such a degree that they're either in denial or simply too overcome with fear to speak out&&[deleted]&&A big part of the reason Savile was never arrested was because of the society that he existed in. 70s Britain was way, way more sexist, racist and classist than it is now.

What's been fascinating about things like Cosby, Weinstein and #MeToo is that we're actually beginning to get a glimpse of how widespread sexual assault and harassment are throughout society, not just in the entertainment industry.

If Savile had lived another 5 years I'm pretty sure he'd be in prison by now.&&[deleted]&&But none of that changes just because you asked for 10 million dollars to make a documentary. Seems to me like Feldman is a little despearate for the spotlight and is looking to make some money off of the Weinstein witchhunt. &&Also, the police can't do shit if he doesn't provide evidence, and likely he can't. Taking the risks he'll be through into account, we can believe him, but from a strictly legal perspective there's little he can do except point fingers and hope someone sues on his side.&&I agree with you, but such talk doesn't seem to be popular in this thread.  Corey says he has a story to tell but it should be noted that he has options on how and to whom he tells it. First off, Corey Feldman is not a filmmaker so giving him $10 million dollars to make a documentary makes little sense (and will expose him to threats of libel).  Why not work with reporters from the New York Times and The New Yorker?  They both broke the Harvey Weinstein story, have ample investigative reporters, and have large legal staffs.  They each have ample credibility, talent, and resources to help Corey expose such abuse (and at no cost to him).  A $10,000,000 documentary made by a complete novice isn't likely to have much of an impact regardless of his passion or intention (just look at his Today Show experience).  Why not work with trained investigative journalists who will help you for free and are **much more likely to help you build an iron-clad case against the people you accuse?**&&I think he's (currently) just not very self aware. It's very likely he hasn't put the time and practice into some of the stuff he's currently doing (singing, music).

Considering how bad his music is, and the fact that he's not a director (AFAIK), giving him 10 million dollars for a movie seems like a bad idea.&&Yea people keep using the ""lawyers"" as a excuse for why he needs the money but if he really does have a list and they are high ups at Hollywood you bet there will be a lot of lawyer clamoring to defend him for maybe not free but defiantly affordable.&&What evidence do you have for that?&&I heard Taylor Lautners father refused to allow him to be in that movie after getting weird vibes from Singer.&&[deleted]&&So random. I lived in LA when I was around 8 and my mother was dating a movie trailer editor. He took us to Singer's house for a party, weird. Before the party started Singer showed me pictures in an album, pictures of a naked boy. A WHOLE FUCKING ALBUM. I was being conditioned early on, I thought it was weird when he showed me too, but my mum broke up with said trailer editor and I never was thrust into that ring, thank god. I'm 26 now, this was 18 years ago, I wonder how many albums he has now.&&How Bryan singer is still making movies is fucking beyond me.

You honestly do have a good chance of being traumatized from reading it, start with Rape of nanking. They were so fucking horrible they eclipse the holocaust in, and I dont really believe there is good and bad, but its evil.

Also, the Weinstein incident was started with an exposé in The New Yorker and New York Times. Those are pretty reputable sources who probably told the first women they would fund their protection and vetted their sources. 

One person coming out and saying something won’t really do anything, I mean clearly this isn’t the first time Feldman has said these things over the past 10 years. 10 years he has been talking about this and no one has does a thing. 

I understand what you’re saying, but it needs to start with firm proof. Feldman is a tiny crack in the damn, he needs to chip away to create a small hole that will hopefully cause the whole dam to break loose. 


This would be a mafia level type take down. You don’t want to bust the soldier, you want the top brass of the organization. &&NYPD also has audio proof of him trying to persuade a woman to come into his hotel room.

He has no intention of dropping names, and if he does I would bet the only names he drops are people who are dead. I believe him when he said he was molested, I just don’t think he’s going about this the right way.

Gawker was shamed for spreading info that should not have been public.  An outfit reporting that someone is a pedophile would not be shamed.  The NY Times was not shamed for its story on Harvey Weinstein.  &&uh, what?    

Yeah, Peter Thiel funded Bollea, but that wasn't why Gawker was sued into bankruptcy... it's because they defied a judge's orders when told to take down a sex tape where the two in the sex tape didn't consent to it being released.    Had nothing to do with libel.   The lawsuit was for ""invasion of privacy, infringement of personality rights, and intentional infliction of emotional distress"". &&The thing with that is nowadays being gay isn't frowned upon. Sexual assault in general let alone on a child will never be socially acceptable behavior.&&yeah imagine if a really powerful movie executive got outed as a sex offender and rapist! I'm sure nobody would take that seriously!&&Very good point. This is purely speculation on my part, but I would imagine a majority portion of the pedophilic abuse that goes on is directed at young boys in the industry.

Plus being a victim of pedophilia is different than being a victim of sexual abuse as an adult (in no way am I saying one is worse than the other, they are both horrific, just that the pychology of the victim is different). &&I think we always like to think that our society is free of those things that burdened our predecessors. The Cosby rapes were ignored not in the 70s but in 2005. He admitted it then and no one ran with it until some celebrities made jokes about the court tapes recently, giving it a profitable pop culture spin. Things might seem better now, but the period where sympathy for victims is in vogue will pass, and things happening now will break news in another decade, and people will still say it’s only because of the 2010s society as if it wasn’t an issue in 2040.&&Because most of those points only work if people can keep it *quiet*.

The last stop was the spot River Phoenix ODed and died. He asked the parents now that they know all the terrible things that happen to child stars, how many of them want to continue.

All of them were expected to completely stop being children and become little mannequins for Mommy's Big Break. After a few weeks of watching, I would make casual comments to co-workers about how I wished I had a kid to sell or something, hoping to wake one of the ""mothers"" up to what they were doing.

It is the only movie ever made to get an NC 17 rating where there is no nudity (aside from one scene with a little side boob. The nudity in Titanic was more gratuitous), and there is literally no violence. It's a brilliant film but heart wrenchingly fucked up, and most shockingly of all, it's also hilarious at the same time. I recommend it. &&Just thinking about that movie turns my stomach and makes me want to cry.  &&Wasn't most of that book debunked? I am pretty sure the author made a lot of that up.

Not that fucked up shit doesn't happen to kids because too often it does. &&I read that book in 8 hours in HS and balled my eyes out the entire time. The rest of the series is really good. The next book is about his teenage years and life in foster care. The one after is his adult life. He goes on to live a semi-normal life with a wife and kids. &&If it helps there is a lot of skepticism about A Child Called It for various reasons by a lot of experts.  Still I wouldn't doubt things like that happen and it's depressing as hell to consider.&&That takes a special kind of depraved fucker to enjoy that shit&&Only thing that I can't handle is abuse to cats.

2) Dude made the shit himself.  A lot of people are not self aware. 

3) It's a little production, a famous singer and an interlude by Eminem away from being a huge hit.&&Someone made the point a while back that it was so bad that everyone would want to see it.. so views == ratings == money.

When upvotes seem totally divorced from the normal reddit behaviors you know you have found a clue.&&It's a bit of an exaggeration, but he's talking about the massive 1980s pedophilia coverup I think&&The Blair Witch Project

The UK is a famous example where pedo rings are found in government and media. My guess some well known names in Hollywood are in the ring he's talking about.

Still not sure how I feel about it but that's most Sandler films for me....&&Watch Cuckoo, he's great in that! &&What do you mean that the director stopped cooperating with the film? &&Hollywood is filled with pedophilia.

People really need to stop supporting this shit. &&[deleted]&&Watch the Keepers on Netflix.&&You cant believe that?   Did you know that you can’t put a life insurance policy on your children for more than $10,000.  It’s because people could get a huge policy and then off their kids for the money.   It was enough of a problem that rules had to be put in place.   
&&You really can't believe that there are parents stupid enough to send their children off so that they can become famous and make lots of money? &&psychopathic and narcissistic parents.  I've never dealt with a psychopathic parent, but the narcissistic parent is too absorbed in their own world to empathize or even have a logical line of thinking when it comes to their children.  The children are not seen for who they are.  They only exist to mirror the parent or are scapegoated if they can't meet the parent's image requirements.  They will either be the golden child or the black sheep.  There is no in-between.  The parents cannot properly care for or empathize with their own children because they never got enough in their own childhood, so they are 100% focused on themselves and the regulation of their own self esteem.  The child is always an afterthought, although they will make it appear to others that they are great parents- while others are around.  It is 100% about appearance.  The Meyerowitz stories shows on a very mild level what this is like.  But having personally been raised by dysfunctional parents, I can attest that the reality is much darker, much more sinister, and usually a near impossible situation for the children to ever overcome.  It's so fucked up that expert psychologists who deal with this type of emotional abuse actually rank it more damaging than even sexual abuse (which is 2nd worst), because it usually requires more time and effort to recover from since the damage is much more underhanded and indirect. It's hard to imagine it being worse than something that awful, but it's impossible to empathize with these children unless you experienced it yourself.&&As someone who almost got into the industry into a huge role that turned the other kid into a star, I can tell you that they look for prey on the parents too. The parents have to be slightly vapid, money hungry, and overly trusting. Fortunately my father nix'd the whole thing when he found out, because I basically had the role if I just flew out but he didn't trust the guy involved. And for a while I used to think of how rich I could have been, now I realize how fucked up I would have been and am eternally thankful. They aren't just looking for easy kids, but easy parents and groom the parents to get you alone by dangling a lot of money in front of them... Which is why you hear those stories about famous kids whose parents spent it all... That's how they got to the kids, the parents were greedy and wanted the lifestyle of the rich and famous.&&I would be like a deer in headlights in that city.&&Many people don’t give a fuck about their kids. They see them as property. No different from a sack of flour. I know that’s difficult to comprehend, but it’s a fact.&&Movies aren’t made entirely in the year they are released. 1999 would have been 18 years ago so it’s not out of the realm of possibility &&I worked on a movie for HBO 2 years ago that is STILL in post production.

Movies are rarely made the same year they are released.&&Not lying. I was there dude. Held the claws. If I remember, Xmen one came out in 2000, so I may have been 9, sorry for my terrible math. It did happen, my brother and I chat about it because he wasn't shown. But he remembers being there and getting weird vibes. He's the reason that my mother broke up with said movie trailer editor, so thanks to him life has been gravy.&&I mean they started filming in 1999. There's a good chance he had a proto type or some shit. I dunno. &&Singer was already working on the film by 1996. &&Singer was brought on pre-production in 1996. They originally wanted the film released in 1998 so it isn’t far fetched props and such were already in place while Singer was also working on Apt Pupil. 

Side note, as far as Apt Pupil, there has been speculation Brad Renfro may have been sexually abused which might have exasperated his self destruction to an early death. &&You think a movie is started the same year its produced and edited? You dont think its possible he had a prototype ONE YEAR before the movie was released.... jesus&&It's the internet so I don't know what to believe. Even if it is true, it was so long ago that I'm unsure if the information is actionable, but I feel like you really need to tell someone about what you legitimately saw. He may still have albums or digital content that could be collected with a warrant. I realize a documentary already exists, but still.&&Now that i think about it, wasn't there a subtext attraction between Rogue and Wolverine, even though the age difference made it kind of inappropriate? &&""Wolverine claws"" better not be a euphemism.&&[Wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqxwKB4Thsg&feature=youtu.be&t=11m35s)
&&Because of money and they think it won't happen to their children just because it happened to other people&&What's worse, is that wasn't his only victim.  Fortunately, the one he was arrested for was the only one my cousin had to hear about.
&&this is the case. my friends worked in digital forensics, trawling through seized mobiles phones, and said it was brutal some of the stuff they saw. Arguably worse is the job of content policing for big online media giants like yahoo, reddit etc: I read an article (just looked, can't find it) where people would get transferred into these posts to manually screen flagged inappropriate content and they're then on bullshit office monkey wages looking at CP & murder all day, reporting it to the police, but no phsy help or anything, and they just cycle through these guys, 6 to 12 months before they're completely psychological exhausted and quit.&&As a CPS social worker I had to sit through countless live forensic interviews of children as young as four talking about how they'd been molested or raped. If I wasn't present for the interview, it could hamper the court hearing, so I always went and watched determined to ensure the offenders were prosecuted. If the child was 12 y.o. or over I had to interview them myself for the details. If they were under 12 and made a disclosure of abuse I could refer them to a center to be interviewed professionally.

I think the worst, well the one that has stuck with me the most, is a 15 year old girl telling me in a very matter-of-fact manner that her father had raped her in every possible way, several times every week, between the ages of 6 and 12. He stopped when she took a health class at school and learned that he was not supposed to be doing that to her. She confronted him and he didn't rape her again, but he then started raping her older brother who had just come out to his parents as gay. He was 14 and was raped several times a week until he moved out at age 18. I met the father in prison (he was arrested the day before I met him). He never blinked or looked away for the 20 mins I spoke with him. Very creepy. He denied everything to me, but then later admitted to all of it to his wife (the children's mother). That father lost his job, his home, his family, and most of his friends. His criminal trial is still pending. The eyes of his children are forever burned in my memory.

So yes, there are people, literally thousands of people, who work in jobs that require they listen to every detail of these statements in order to seek help and justice for the victims. In my county alone there were ~100 social workers who did this directly. We worked along side the child crimes police units on these cases; not sure how many officers we have in this dept in our county. This is just one county in my state. I hate to admit how damn common child sexual abuse is and how often these sexual abuse reports came in (several every week). Unknown how many cases were never reported.&&Don't remember where I saw the documentary but at the beginning of the internet I think Microsoft had a division in house that had to filter through loads of these pics and vids and sent their findings to the FBI. They said the people that worked in that division had to be routinely sent to therapy with PTSD and the turnover rate was mind boggling. Scary knowing how prevalent this shit has been forever.&&Detective Stabler? Christopher Maloni's character? It seemed like he tried to beat up somebody at least every other episode. He was my favorite character. &&I sat through that movie not knowing what to expect. I found myself cringing and super uncomfortable throughout the entire thing. Great movie, but hard to sit through if that makes any sense. &&Holy fuck. I just looked up the plot synopsis and holy fuck. That's rough. &&Abuse to animals in general is pretty hard to take. Especially to dogs. I just can’t wrap my head around it. 

I mean, all abuse is bad. Just reminds you how shitty our race can be. &&I just don't agree. This is bad bad. It's like the few dudes they'd have on American Idol just to make fun of them. Maybe that's why it got on the air? lol...

The song itself isn't the worst. It's freaking karate-chopping arm-waving dance moves, oh my god. And black mario at the end...

Hey I have an open mind but if you are trying to be serious with your art/talent maybe some outside constructive criticism is something you should consider.

&&So if that were the case, how is he going to make a documentary? If they are all powerful and can crush him at any time, how does putting the evidence in film rather than a newspaper suddenly keep him safe? Why not release the information and when he is sued crowdfund his defense? I guarantee he'd be met with far more support and far less skepticism in that.  &&Hey, would you mind just telling me a little about those? Just curious, I'll do my own research as well but I like to hear other peoples opinions/thoughts/knowledge.


&&The documentary An Open Secret focuses on this extensively. It has already been said, but people aren't paying attention. Names HAVE BEEN named. 

I don't see a movie now without looking into the director, actors, or producers to evaluate if it's ethical for me to see it. &&Yea, and it'd totally not be [because of Taylor Dooley \(Lava Girl\)](http://iv1.lisimg.com/image/7946533/720full-taylor-dooley.jpg)&&Cant wait for the sequel with magma lad! &&I actually enjoyed Lautners character in R6. He seemed like the only who fully embraced the absurdity of the movie. Him and maybe Terry Crews, but hes great in everything. Sandler looked bored as usual, and i forgot the other characters 5 mins after the movie. I did watch it drunk though, so who knows. &&A huge part of the marketing campaign for movies is getting the the stars (actors, director, maybe producers, etc) on shows to promote the film, radio interviews, the premiere, etc etc.

She wouldn’t do that.

For her it’s actualky more. I think you can read more in the article I linked, but I believe she actually missed deadlines, didn’t meet quality requirements, etc when submitting the film back to the producers for them to release. They missed their first premiere date because of her.&&This is deeper than just Hollywood. No better way to ensure a persons loyalty than to have them on tape doing horrible things. People in the media keep giving us hints but most people would rather not believe it. && ~~Hollywood~~ *the world* is filled with pedophilia.
 People really need to stop supporting this shit.

&&Stop supporting how, exactly? Ignore all popular culture in our society? If I buy a ticket to see Jigsaw am I supporting pedophiles? &&Hollywood is basically Caligula Era Rome. &&When you say ""stop supporting this shit"", what do you propose?&&Well the problem is people don't know who the pedophiles are.&&They won't, just like people will still go to the catholic church.&&> bizarre extremes

Go on...&&Not that I'm an expert but It's not so 'bizarre'...it's more, doing things by legit means from smart people.  We constantly here about who got caught with pounds of weed, or paraphernalia or the guy that got who's house got raided but it's the educated and well thought folks that put together higher level schemes.&&I don’t know where you’re getting the $10,000 figure. My children each have $50,000 policies and [here’s a Forbes article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/barbaramarquand/2016/01/27/the-hows-and-whys-of-life-insurance-for-children/amp/) stating:

> You can buy some coverage on your child’s life if you purchase a term life insurance policy covering yourself or your spouse. You do this by buying a rider — an extra policy feature at added cost — that extends a small amount, such as $20,000, in life insurance to other family members, including children. 

And

> you can buy a permanent life insurance policy, such as whole life, covering your child. These are generally for small face amounts, such as $50,000 or less. &&That's super fucked&&Never knew that. Crazy.

Seems like the type of horrible person that would do that would be pretty happy with 10 grand anyway.&&Seriously, there are plenty of parents out there that abuse their kids for free, just because the parents are unwell, lack impulse control, are fucked in the head, etc.  OF COURSE there are people who would monetize child abuse.  

It's horrible, but where there are those who would do ____ for free, there are those who would do ____ for money.  &&Exactly- I don't think people understand the post production that goes into movies. For a typical film (not much action etc) it is between 6-12 months. Action movies with a lot of special effects can easily be 12months-2 yrs for post production. 
Source- husband works in the film industry &&Sorry to hear you were put in that situation. Good on your brother. I wish being the frontman of Corey's Angels on no one. 

&&Well if they started filming sometime in 1999, its entirely plausible that they had begun pre-production in advance of shooting. So the claws could have existed in some form in mid to late 1998 or early 1999. &&I always wondered why child actors pretty much all end up getting fucked up drug addicts. Many people stated that it‘s because they had so much money they couldn‘t comprehend it. Now I believe it‘s almost always because they were heavily sexually abused. This is so sad :(&&He probably still does continue this behavior. Look at Weinstein.&&No. The actual prop they used in the movie. It was pretty heavy and actually the highlight of the night. &&Ugh yea, reminds me of what you hear in prisons that Pedophiles are considered the worst even there amongst inmates. &&yeah that guy for sure. man that guy wanted to murder all the scum he found. &&I get you. That scene where he's telling his son what he is, that he's fucked two of his friends, but he wouldn't fuck him, he'd just ""jerk off instead,"" is downright painful to sit through. My heart sank lower than it's ever sunk before. I felt these chilling, tingly sensations all over my body, and started squirming uncontrollably. And the thing that makes me even more uncomfortable, is how often the movie was making me laugh. I was laughing so much all the way through it, which made the gut punching sensation that one scene gave me all the more painful. 

That one scene is one of the most powerful cinematic experiences I've ever had. &&I think it has something to do with seeing someone or something that can't defend itself being abused. Most of the time a child, or animal, doesn't even know why it's happening.&&I've seen animals do fucked up shit too each other for no reason, put only humans factory farm or allow puppy mills.&&I believe him to be talking about the [Westminster Dossier](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier)&&why is she in the shower with clothes on is she retarded?&&That's the only way to watch current Sandler movies. He's probably on some weird Uwe Boll-style money laundering shit at this point with his projects.&&Well I guess the real question is why she didn’t cooperate. Was it intentional because she knew of the things going on? Was it her conscience or was she just bad at her job?&& Is this why some celebrity AMAs are at least initially so focused on the publicity tour?&&You can't do anything legally on a hint though, and unless there is actual evidence in which to prosecute, it's all just conjecture.&&Right, that's it! I'm going to stop supporting the world!&&>  Ignore all popular culture 

no of course not, just ignore the stuff directed by or produced by or starring sex abusers and their supporters enablers &&You need to ask the more important question: why the fuck would you buy a ticket to see such a garbage and obviously cash grab movie like Jigsaw?&&I think he meant stop supporting the movie industry?&&Watch the doc. One guy has been convicted of child abuse and still works in the industry today on shows like Modern family.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Hmm.  My wife worked for an insurance agency about 5 years ago, and that’s what she was told.  Maybe it was just the agency she worked for.  Sorry for the inaccurate information.  &&Can I ask the very personal question of the reason you carry that type of policy on your kids? For funeral costs in a worst case scenario? Because you'd be shattered and unable to work? 

Every time I think of something devastating (sex abuse, death) happening to my children my chest gets tight. I feel like I wouldn't care if I was a homeless addict (and could quite possibly become one) if I lost them... 

&&Also if you read the X-Men wiki that he linked, it says Singer signed on to direct in 1996. &&I'm actually friends and went to high school with one of his angels. (Well now ex angel...and for a reason.) Not going to mention any names but fuck that whole situation they call a ""band"".&&",2017-10-26 14:18:08

I’m glad Fox decided that it has a large enough and loyal enough fan base to justify this move.&&I'm expecting at least four songs at minimum. Never realized how many songs the show has until a season ago, they do a phenomenal job with this show

Yes, Linda. I know. 

#A MOVIE, BOBBY!!!&&Ugh remember when 2020 was more than 2 years and 2 months away.&&Damn, so this basically confirms its renewal until 2020. This will put it up to 11-12 seasons at the most including a movie.

What a great accomplishment for a great show. Hope they give it the Simpsons treatment and release it in theaters.&&It could be two hours of “Ughhhhhhhhhhhh” and I’d still buy an advanced ticket.&&Hey Bob, do I get to be in the movie Bob? Bobby, hey Bob... the movie Bob, I don't have to say anything, I can just sit here like always, right Bobby? Bob? What do you say? 

Linda, will you ask Bobby if I can be in the movie?&&No thanks. I've seen it and I'm not impressed. - Gene Burger&&Gene is one of my favorite characters in recent television. &&Literally just got done watching the new episode with the multiple styles of animation.

Kristen Schaal's voice is an added bonus with this show.

Both are great.&&It's gunna be a musical...I guarantee it.&&Today's special: Hollywood-fired Burger (directed by Michael Bay Leaf)&&[deleted]&&Bob's is one of those rare shows that get better every season. It's such a wholesome, funny, program.

Louise> No you rube we're going to be on the big screen.  
Tina> But our tv is a big screen.

Bob> Kids I need you to get back to work.  
Tina> Hey dad did you hear we're going to be on TV.  That one right there.  I think.  
Bob> Oh my god.  
Gene> Dad if we go to the movies to watch our own movie does that mean when we buy tickets that we are giving money to ourselves?  It's the perfect crime!  We'll get rich even though we're poor!  
Bob> No Gene that's not how it works.  
Gene> YOU DON'T KNOW YOU JUST FLIP BURGERS.  THEY DON'T EVEN SERVE THOSE AT THE MOVIES SO HOW WOULD YO KNOW  
Bob> SHUT UP GENE  
Linda> He's right Bobby they don't serve burgers there  
Bob> When do you go to the movies?  
Linda> I go every Saturday at 2PM.  No one is there so I can take all the mustard packets.  
Louise> You go to the movies every weekend and you don't take us?  You're supposed to love us!

Bob> You told me you were going grocery shopping on Saturday!  
Linda> I am Bobby, I'm getting us mustard.  

&&Moaning Intensifies!!!!!!!.&&This is a perfect example of a TV show that I have absolutely no doubt it can translate very well on the big screen.

Now to get Bob's Burgers back on Netflix... &&Alriiiiiiiight! :D&&Now just give me an Archer movie and my life will be complete. &&I really hope this show goes on for many many years and the voice actors never get tired of doing it. Luckily voice acting lets the actors do other shows and stuff since putting the voices down for a show isn't THAT time consuming. 

This show has been added to my ""Watch 1000 times in the background as I do stuff"" playlist along with King of the Hill, Futurama, The Office, Seinfeld, South Park, and a bunch of others.&&I’m surprised we’re getting a Bob’s Burgers movie before a Family Guy movie, but honestly I’d rather see this&&This is awesome, I love Eugene Mirman and his character in this show.  Even if the movie is just 3 episodes loosely tied together I'd see it and drag my wife with me.&&Was listening to Dan Mintz singing ""Just What I Needed"" when I read this. Good omen. &&Holy shit this is going to be very, very amazing. The show has always been capable of telling simple stories in an epic way so I feel like they might even be more suited for a movie than The Simpsons.&&As much as I love the series, and everything it offers... 2020 is literally too far away, especially for an announcement. It's not even 2018 yet...&&Nice! would like to see a movie where Bob is on a "" Hells Kitchen"" type show in Italy (or wherever). The kids would go on some kinda adventure on there own and Linda would be the interest of some broadway producer type that gets her a role &&Linda: BAAAAWB. BAWWWB guess what?

Bob: What, Lin?

Linda: Guess what, guess what, guess what? 

Bob: Lin, I already guessed what.

Linda: Guesswhatguesswhatguess*WHAAAT*

Linda: We’re all going to HollyWOOD! We’re gonna be stars! We’re going to be FAMOUS. We’re going to eat caviar on Ritz Crackers (and not that God-awful store-brand kind, the real ones, Bob!)

Bob: That’s… kinda cool, I guess. 

Linda: *aside* Just don’t let Mr. Fischoeder hear or else he’ll raise our rent up knowing that we’re schmoozing around with Richard Gere and Cameron Diaz and Betty White! Wait, is she still alive?

Thank you, Bob's Burgers.&&Hadn't thought much of it before, but contrasted with shows like BoJack and R&M, I think you may have a point there. I love all three, but Bob's Burgers doesn't ever hit you with that crushing existential dread quite like the other two tend to now and then. &&yeah. one of the few shows that can watch regularly and it will always cheer me up and not be overly sappy. &&Bob's Burgers is today's King of the Hill.  Full of heart and good messages, wrapped in astute humor and lovably goofy characters.&&This really struck me after the season 8 premier. I had just finished Bojack and have been watching Rick and Morty and the new animated show Big Mouth on netflix and realized there is nothing quite like the simple good natured comedy of Bob's Burgers. It isn't campy or stupid humor and is wholly unique. Can't wait for this movie!&&Bob's is the closest thing to the ""golden era"" of Simpsons when they were fresh and not kids shows, but still had a wholesome feel.  &&It's just so wholesome!&&It's interesting because it was somewhat more nihilistic in the first season, where the world seemed against Bob and he was actually in immediate danger of losing the restaurant. The jokes were also more vulgar. Still great though.&&And now I miss Regular Show&&That is exactly why I stopped watching Rick and Morty.  I started watching because I want something to make me laugh, not feel existential dread or just feel down and depressed at the end of an episode.  Bobs burgers is the perfect animated show in my mind.&&[deleted]&&The show just hits some emotional tones sometimes that just get to me . The emotional moments with Louise are my favorite . &&This also basically confirms to us that the show will be renewed at the very least until 2020, likely much further.&&This is why I also like it.

That said I generally like the despicable ones in cartoons the most. I took a long time to watch Bob's Burgers thinking I wouldn't like it. I haven't been so happy to be wrong in a long time.

I think a big factor in that was that I liked Archer ALOT at the time and thought hearing his voice over Bob would be weird (It isn't).

I'm a huge fan of American Dad, Futurama, Rick and Morty, Archer, Bojack, South Park and Family Guy. I love dark humor but there is just something about Bob's burgers that is a nice break from that.

It's quickly become one of my favorite shows to just have on around the house.&&It feels a lot like old school Simpsons to me. &&Gene is a child prodigy.&&Agreed.   Best song ever?   My vote is ""Electric Love"".  So good.  I want the full 5 minute version.

Edit: full 3:45 on Spotify! I knew they put together an album, but I didn't realize it was so long!

Edit edit: it's mostly talking. :-(. I still want the full uncut Broadway version. I need Gene's original vision on my life.&&You should listen to the over 100 track album.&&They'll say Awwww Topsy at my, AUUUUTopsy!&&[The best part is that a pretty serious Alt-Rock band is a huge fan and has covered a lot of their songs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KExughc7RE0) The National, for those interested.&&[deleted]&&I hope its a tasteful erotic thriller about zombies and the one girl who could understand them.

I just finished bojackhorseman season 4 and im craving a show like it. &&Exactly. Also one of my favorite things that was pointed out to me about the show is that it shows how you can be a worthwhile human and have pride in yourself without being exceedingly competent. [This video](https://youtu.be/tmSI0Ua2Uvg) explains it better. It really is awesome that not only is the show reasonably positive but it also has an important message that nearly no other show has.  &&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Lol now and then? More like every other episode for Bojack &&When I am feeling crappy or hungover I just lie in bed marathoning Bob's Burgers, it has some cracking jokes and somehow feels full of love. &&Bojack horseman is bleak, but it isn't cynical.  Bojack has human failings- really fucking bad human failings- but the show itself believes in human decency, as firmly as it believes in human self destructiveness and stupidity.

R&M is cynical.  But I think in some ways they're trying to change that.  Looking forward to next season.&&[deleted]&&I disagree, because I think Bob’s Burgers has a different kind of dread - class dread. The idea that being in the lower and lower-middle class is a crushing wheel, and no matter what schemes or ideas you have to better your lot in life, life is just gonna crush you again. &&But I am excited for Close Enough, Quintel’s next show. &&Rick and Morty has wayyy more comedy than depressing shit.  &&The scene with Bob and Louise at the film festival where they brought the kung fu movie star back together with his daughter was just so sweet. I cried. &&I remember one episode where he realized he was actually bad at music because he just fucked around without practicing in a structured manner, and I was so confused because he has literally written, like, entire duets with musical accompaniment. No one can tell me this kid isn't a Mozart.&&He did write silent love&&I like the one where Bob is glued to the toilet and him and Louise basically do a duet and the lyrics play off of each other and their similar situations.

But they really don't have any bad songs in the show.&&I fucking LOVE this song (and episode). It’s so funny and well-done that it gives me chills when I hear it. I hope the fact that Bob says “Gene wrote this?” is an inside joke from the writers about how impressed they were with how the song came out.&&*Jazz hands*&&I hope Gene gets to play the part of Bob.

Yeah, Teddy.

You, you got any part for me Bob? I can be like a detective who don't follow the rules.

It's not a detective movie, Teddy.

And he gets married to a Russian waitress who turns out to be a spy. And a mime.

No, Ted...wait...why a mime?&&I was thinking about 5 days ago.&&Death by a thousand cuts?&&For how long the Simpson's has been on I think the fact it's still entertaining at all is a giant accomplishment. I love that they've adapted to modern issues and technology while keeping the same charm. It's not in its golden age, but I still enjoy watching it. That's more then I can say for Family Guy and Archer &&I've said it before and I'll say it again, as someone who actually watched every single episode of the Simpson's start to finish in a multiple-week-long binge, the new seasons are not bad. They hover solidly around a seven. The older seasons tended to fluctuate more between a 6 and an 8 in my opinion - there was just more variety in quality. The reason why everyone remembers the old seasons is because there would occasionally be *that* episode that was a 12/10 and was just amazing. Homer at Bat, or the monorail, or even just the sweet episodes like Lisa's Substitute. They don't do *those* episodes anymore, and I think that's why the perception of the show's quality dropping exists. From average episode to episode, they're not much different. It's the absence of the occasional really powerful, memorable episodes that make it seem less good. &&My screen's pretty big&&I don't know if it could really get bad, honestly. 80% of the humor in that show (in my eyes, anyway) is just the banter between the characters. The kids' one-liners, etc. Really with Linda and Tina's character, just knowing they're both dudes makes about 80% of the shit they say funny. ""Oh Bwobbyyyyyyyy"". Also him as JocelyyyynnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnAH.

I think, as long as the cast stays intact, the show has ridiculous staying power.&&Open up your butt cheeks, this is how our butts speak!&&Tina talks like this, Dina talks like this....&&Hopefully we'll actually meet Ginger too!?&&""You're so honest.. who raised you?""&&The first time I watched this scene my belly hurt from laughing so hard. &&The scene afterwards with the claim adjuster where she's groaning in the background is gut-bustingly funny&&I think this is the scene that converted me from ""this show is pretty funny and clever"" to ""holy shit I love this""&&I read it in Linda’s voice first then saw your comment and it 100% teddy haha&&""Bob Burgers: The Movie""

SAILORS IN YOUR MOUTH!!!!&&Runnin' down the gutters with a piece of bread and butter diarrhea *pft pft* &&Were having mashed potatoes&&Plus, every character is unique and has their own sense of humour. &&It’s definitely so relatable. I also never finish an episode feeling glum. My favorite thing to do last year around this time was getting under a blanket, ditching all social engagements, and rewatch a season of Bobs Burger with junk food the entire day. &&Bob's Burgers is definitely not overtly political but in a way that's also a political stance. For instance, Family Guy loves doing gay, racial and trans jokes for shock value, South Park likes to use its characters as proxies for what Trey Parker and Matt Stone want to say and Rick and Morty have a very edgy undergrad nihilist vibe. 

This doesn't happen in Bob's Burgers. They've consistently been able to be funny and interesting without resorting to any kind of shock value stuff which is a big accomplishment.&&I think the show is very political. but it practices ""show don't tell""&&I read that the family dynamics are so good because it's one of the few shows that actually has the cast all record their lines together in the same room.&&Some of those styles were really dope; that episode was a blast start-to-finish!&&I feel as though these networks highly overestimate their ability to drag in a profitable subscriber pool &&Fox is part owner of Hulu that is why it's on Hulu. The Fox president and FX president both said years ago they made a bad deal with Netflix and wouldn't again.   The Fox Now keeps the entire current season up through the premiere of the next season and the TBS app puts a different 10-12 eps of back seasons up every Thurs. &&""Is Pepsi okay?""&&The Man From U.N.C.L.E.

Is not like Bojack&&Also, it portrays a happy family. Which sounds like it shouldn't be unusual, but for the past few decades the trend has been to show suburban family life as unwaveringly dreadful and hopeless.&&That was a great video. Watched the whole thing. Wonderful point about how refreshing that overarching theme is, and how it's OK that none of the family members are gonna change the world or turn out to be celebrities or anything. Experiencing their little wins with all their various eccentricities sprinkled in is more than enough. &&That was my takeaway from the show when I binged 5 seasons.

1. Bob is the closest thing to a normal person on that show. He has anger problems and is overly competitive but otherwise is a fairly rational dude for the most part.
2. The family are good people. They're flawed, but they're good people.&&Thank you for linking. Watched the whole thing. Will now use this to explain my unending love for bobs burgers&&Competent*&&YES this video is spectacular, first time I saw it I was shocked at myself for getting weepy lol.&&Damn, that fucking episode.

Even better if it's pouring down rain too.&&It's hard not feeling like youre one of the belchers when you watch an episode. &&Bojack is (ironically) a more human show, and actually uses the characters' emotions and feelings to largely dictate storylines, which I think is why it stings a lot more. Rick and Morty is a lot of largely disjointed adventures with some serious elements to them and some moral dilemmas, but it doesn't really explore the characters' personalities much beyond a surface level, even for the main characters. It shows them changing over time - particularly Morty and Summer - but there's not actually a lot of layers to any of them. Bojack gives each of its individual characters a lot more layers, which in turn makes the audience feel more connected to them, which makes it more impactful when things happen to them. If Summer suddenly died in Rick and Morty, it'd be a plot twist, but it wouldn't really feel like a gut punch the way that, say, Princess Caroline's death would, or even [Sarah Lynn's death](#spoiler). &&While overall I see what you're saying, the end of the Unity episode punches you in the gut pretty good. R&M has its moments, and I feel like they are so few and far between long stretches of borderline absurdity that they're even more impactful. &&That's true. I just don't like having random episodes just ending in a really depressing way out of nowhere and it just dips too much into the depressing shit for me to be able to enjoy it as much as I enjoy other shows.&&Itty bitty ditty committee.&&I think he has talent, but with no formal training he doesn't speak the same musical language those typically gifted with music do. That's why he can create a musical, but doesn't know what chords or scales are. That and some Flanderization of the character for comedic effect. &&People without formal training are like this. My sister is stunningly talented with her guitar. She can hear something once and then repeat it with her own instrument on demand even years later. I had fun giving her random dumb stuff like anime openings and watching her perform them when we were growing up.

She went to college to do music stuff and they were horrified that she couldn't read music or had any academic grasp of what she had been doing all her life.

I think Gene is very capable when he's in his element but he's kind of fragile. You can see him lean on his siblings heavily for guidance like when he does the mascot racing. I think when he or the people around him doubt him he freezes up badly but when left to his own devices he's pretty good at what he does. He just lacks structure and isn't able to get it from anyone around him, thus he remains untrained.&&girls bein' girls bein' girls bein' girls&&*Electric Love*?&&And the entire die hard musical.

I'd say at least 80% of those episodes can be considered classics.

If you can point me in the direction of a newer Simpsons episode that comes even *close* to prime Simpsons quality, I will watch it immediately and let you know what I think.&&The best part is they're all comedians, and a lot of the banter is left up to the actors. The show is unique in that they ~~record the lines before they animate~~ they all record together in the same room, that's why the dialogue is so hilarious and natural. 

If the writers ever start struggling they can just leave it up to the actors.

It follows the standard sitcom framework, but it's sense of humor is rather unique. 

But I'm sure there is something it's similar to that I'm either not thinking of or haven't seen.&&That is definitely one of the biggest draws for me.  It eschews the dysfunctional family stereotype that was popular with shows like Married with Children, The Simpsons, or Family Guy. &&And beyond that, while the different characters have their own bits of zaniness/bits of stupidity, overall they're still fairly intelligent. It seems like sooo many sitcoms rely on having a character that is nearly retarded, [especially the dad](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad).

In Bob's Burgers, they each can go off the deep end in their own areas, but the others typically band together to try to pull them out.&&Though he might not have an anger issue, just kids.^^^^hahahIpitymyparents&&I want to be an architect.&&I thought it was brilliant how right after he's kicked out [they play the show's theme song within an episode for the first and only time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_WMFLxrfN8)

The premiere this weekend was actually a really funny episode.&&To death? Isnt it still on though? &&Everyone's taste is different, of course. It's just not for me. I appreciate them mixing it up every season, and trying new locations, but I just think the writing and jokes are repetitive and annoyingly obnoxious. I love that Archer develops as a character, you don't see that in animation enough but so much material is reused it's become a chore for me. 

I recently started a new watching and could only make it to episode 7 of season 1 before I gave in for good.  
&&Season 8 is the last season. It's a 1920s throw back season that was pretty good, but you can tell it was time to end.

Edit: I am wrong, there will be 10 seasons. I'm unsure how to feel about this.

Edit 2: Late 40s throwback. I thought Archer was in WW1. I guess Greaser Barry makes more sense now.&&I gave up watching the show when Pam was getting too much screen time. Her coke addiction causing every mishap was becoming tiring.&&Archer thread ! I love it.

I don't think Archer went downhill. I agree season 7 is a little worse, but I still liked it.

Season 8 is a whole different thing and I think it's hilarious. They are moving away from the old style. I am not sure if they will go back to the Figgis Agency, or just keep doing dream sequences.

I think the writer said he was tired of making Archer and wants it to end and write something else.&&archer may not be as strong now as it was early on but neither is bob's burgers. but to compare the slight decline in archer to family guy is a huge injustice.&&They killed the wrong show&&I'm happy futurama died with dignity though...

Who am I kidding? Give me more!&&They're definitely not unique in recording the lines before animating it. That's the standard practice for animation. Can you imagine trying to read your lines to match up exactly with the animation's pace and lip-movement? It'd be a nightmare

They are slightly unique in that they have all their main voice actors in the same room while recording, which gives them the opportunity for improv. Whereas most shows have rigid dialogue, and the voice actors record it separately.

The main character is a washed up celebrity and a horse, it's funny and feely."" &&Telling people that its occasionally dark and sad is kind of a spoiler. The reason I got hooked is because it started out like a weird goofy cartoon and the turn totally surprised me. &&Well, sort of. Shoulders up he's a horse. Shoulders down a guy. But still with horse skin tone. I don't know, just watch it &&End of Season 2 wasn't positive??? 
""It gets easier, the hard part is doing it every day, but it gets easier""
Dude that was such a positive ending&&The first episode won't really give you an idea of what the show is like. They kind of set the show up as being this silly dumb show about a washed up actor, then pull the rug out from under you as the first season progresses, and give you something far deeper than you expected. I'd give it another shot, I always tell people to just try to get through the first couple episodes until it starts to get really good. &&What else is there to say.&&I got goosebumps when I first heard Louise's part in the song say ""I guess I'm not, the forgiving type.""&&WHERE ARE THEIR ARMS AND LEGS! &&The only woman is Louise.

For example, many of the boys from Rugrats were voiced by women.&&linda is a male VA? damnit reddit&&I love how they made Tina a girl after the pilot where she was a boy, but kept the voice exactly the same. &&Were there a lot of women doing male voices?

It's so stilted. &&Bojack Horseman has great character development. &&Nope it’s gonna go ten seasons at least they’ve already been greenlit &&Although I preferred the original setup for Archer, it was interesting to see them put on a new spin on it with the different themes in later seasons. 

I didn't enjoy season 8 as much as I thought I would. Hopefully season 9 will be better. It sounds like it could be fun. &&[deleted]&&It's a throw back tribute season to Woodhouse's voice actor. I thought it was really funny, but it was a little disappointing for him to not wake up and bring it back to reality.

I think stand alone as like a spin off season it's hilarious. I fking love Carol in it.

I read that they might do similar seasons for 9&10 so I would be interested in that.&&There are gonna be 2 more seasons of Archer, then it will end.&&The best bit is that it's another Magnum PI reference. They did a whole thing with him in a coma and film noir detective stuff. It's a reference inside another reference. &&Bob's has gotten better every season imo. Season 1 and 2 are pretty skippable.&&Wrong show died!&&To shreds you say? &&It died before it completely sucked.  That's generally a better end.&&I've always wondered if Futurama was, no pun intended, ahead of it's time.  It has a different style of humor and I wonder if it wasn't enough to grasp the attention of the mainstream crowd.  I'm happy it got revitalized on Comedy Central and the ending to the series makes sense, but damn I wish there was more.&&Nah, Futurama ending gave it a sense of finality and purpose.

No episode of The Simpsons has meant anything for the last decade and a half, possibly longer.&&Check out the show animals on HBO. It's an animated adult comedy and I'm pretty sure it's mostly retrosctipted. The dialogue comes off as so natural that it seems like they're just talking over the animation. Lots of great guest stars too. &&The National did a cover version of the song. They've done a few other Bob's Burgers songs too (Bad Stuff Happens in the Bathroom, the ""Sailors in your Mouth"" thanksgiving song... I think a few others I'm forgetting)

They are all fantastic
&&The National covered Kill the Turkey, Sailors in Your Mouth, and one for Christmas (Christmas Magic, I think?)&&Also, St. Vincent did [""Bad Girls""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODPfuO5M-g0).&&Yeah. Funny people consistently playing characters across mildly outlandish situations while remaing just regular folks. Also, strong HJB presence.&&In the first episode Bart get a tattoo and Marge spends all their Christmas money to get it removed. Then Homer gambles the money he made to replace that at a dog track. The Simpsons has always been about a disfunction family, doesn't mean they don't love and care about eachother but they fuck up and do stupid things.&&[deleted]&&That's too much, man.&&It's like a Bob Saget docudrama if he were a horse man.&&Its depression disguised as a comedy.  The sad tp joke ratio is like 2:1&&It's more just the episode before that and knowing he'll have to spend a lot of time taking credit for something he didn't do (someone he isn't) when the whole point of doing the movie was to show America who he really is &&Even that was too much man&&And an amazing actress, Kristen Schaal is great. &&A few of the school kids are voiced by women&&The reason why is because they need a childlike voice that won't grow up. Women can nail that much easier than men, typically. 

Same reason why Bart Simpson is voiced by a woman.&&Not even 90s, just in general. Stuff like Timmy Turner was Tara Strong. Male kid characters are hard to voice because you either have to hire a child and have the character grow (yea right) or have someone who can simulate a kid's voice. As male's get more mature their voice deepens a lot, so you pretty much have to get females to voice kids. &&I mean, all of the main babies are voiced by women&&Yeah and from what I can tell, that's his normal voice. He's a standup comedian. I don't even watch the show, but I can't watch his act and not hear him as that character so it's really jarring for me personally.

However, that show clearly made him rich as shit, so I doubt he cares, and I'm very happy for him for getting that show and becoming rich as shit because most standups are broke as hell and die in obscurity. So any time a standup gets rich as shit, I'm very happy for them, because I've done it, it's hard, and other than enjoyment, you don't get much for it.

EDIT: I'm wrong. It was the older daughter I was thinking of.&&Haha, yep. Most of the women with like, cartoony voices like hers are guys&&women are used for most childrens voices. Look up Tara Strongs resume. That alone is a trip. Btw, almost all the children on the simpsons (unless guest or hardly used) are like, Barts VA or Lisas VA, or a chick who does a lot of voices for the show in general&&AAH, I WANNA SEE A POOP, I WANNA BE A KID AGAIN! &&Same with Family Guy. You can’t convince the average redditor there are good family guy episodes.&&The narrative here swings harder than OPs mom in an all married trailer park. Give it a week.&&But rises again, more boring and derivative.&&It's only had 4 seasons though.  Could get old after a couple more if they don't change, though it's kept itself surprisingly fresh so far&&Yeah I'm half way through it. It started off slow but I've become really invested &&Archer is in a coma and imagines it. It's pretty good.&&The writers said ""screw it"" and wrote something else with the same characters&&Archers in a coma lol&&It's a dream sequence season. I believe it's called Archer Dreamland.

They said they might not ever wake him up from that. It's a tribute season to Woodhouse's voice actor since he died.&&\>acting like archer has ever had setting consistency. && Season 9 is gonna be set on an island and archer is gonna be a pirate and Krieger is his talking parrot.&&Some of the best episodes are s1, what are you talking about?&&Wrong kid died!&&Let's not pretend that Futurama wasn't popular in its own right, just not at the insanely high level that The Simpsons had. &&Animals. is confirmed to be 100% retroscripted, which makes it all the better. They start going off on the most random tangents and my high ass will be sitting there laughing my ass off. &&Bad stuff happens in the bathroom is a fucking masterpiece.&&I MUST HEAR THESE&&I guess it depends on your personal view of what a dysfunctional family is. To me that implies abuse, drugs, neglect, etc. The Simpsons deal with ""real"" issues, but they function well to me. 

In the episode you're referring to, Bart's getting a ""mother"" tattoo with a heart. Homer picks up a second job to try to make Christmas money and after failing that, makes a last ditch attempt at the track. After losing the rest of the money, he brings home a rescued dog, the family is thrilled, Lisa says it's the best Christmas ever. It's sweet. &&I think that the problem is that dysfunctional is too broad. The Simpsons are a bunch of people who overall love each other and care about one another but the number of dumb people in their house puts them in a lot of weird situations. Family Guy is a show where everyone in the family definitely hates each other and are genuinely awful to one another, and the characters seem to throw themselves into dangerous situations almost like they're just trying to get themselves killed or arrested so they don't have to be around one another.&&*glass shattering*&&And if he swore a lot less and made fewer pedophile jokes. &&And Uncle Joey is an actual woodchuck. &&I adore her in Last Man On Earth&&Never seen a woman so ugly and cute at the same time.&&YAS flight of the conchords. &&Like Andy and Ollie are voiced by the Silverman sisters. I freaking love that. They could have just had Sarah do both voices but they didn't. &&And Bobby hill&&It's him imitating his mother's voice.&&Voice actors get online celebrity but are definitely not rich as shit &&Tina is also the voice actor's normal voice. I went to a live event and the audience could not stop laughing every time Dan Mintz spoke, simply because that's his voice.&&Holy shit, she's been harley quinn, batgirl, brainiac, timmy turner, and in my little pony. Jesus christ, she has 490 acting credits, 20 awards, and 45 nominations. She's basically like Lil Wayne in the early 2000s, a hand in everything. &&Also, Tress MacNeille&&Pamela Adlon! &&It's not so much about if there are good episodes of The Simpsons or Family Guy for me, but more just about how unlikable the characters became. In the first 8 or 9 seasons, Homer was a genuinely good person, who cared about his kids, and his wife. He was also flawed, but he did think about how his actions hurt his family. Since then, he is basically just a drunk who drops some punchlines. In Family Guy, literally every character is unlikable, and doesn't seem to care about anyone in their family. The show is just constantly pushing towards the next punchline, which is fine, and it can make me laugh, but characters who suck for no reason are hard to enjoy. &&Bojack also focuses extensively on the side characters development too. If they'd left that out they could've had time to do all the character development bojack has done in 4 seasons in a season and a half. &&> It's a tribute season to Woodhouse's **original** voice actor since he died.

Tom Kane filled in for a season after George Coe passed, but most likely those scenes were already in production. &&[deleted]&&Futurama seems to have been very popular with geek type people but didn't really have the wide appeal that The Simpsons has.

At least in American Dad it's basically the plot of the neighbourhood that the family is a bunch of psychotic dickwads that no one likes. So I can forgive a bit more of that.&&That's how I feel. Every character is so negative, selfish and dark at some times just for darkness sake. Don't feel like anyone likes anyone. Don't even know why they are even together. Don't like that &&This is true, Todd had more character development than ever in the most recent season, and he spent less than 2 minutes on screen with the main character of the show.

Edit* fixed a spelling error&&It's not really time travel, he is in a coma so they have fun taking the characters, with basically the same personalities, and just putting them in a ridiculous new scenario.  It's pretty fun&&I think that was more a comment about how the show has made its setting (year-wise) deliberately vague. It mixes modern technology and pop culture references with a bunch of stuff from the 70s and 80s. Like the Soviet Union and East/West Germany are still things in Archerverse, but everyone has a cell phone. Computers are inconsistently modern or from the 80s. Etc...

It's a combination ""homage to the spy films of the 70s""/""running gag and sometimes plot device."" &&> Futurama seems to have been very popular with geek type people

I felt bad lol. He is so very thoughtful and sweet and it's great we can share this awesome show together! I'm hoping he hasn't heard about the movie yet. He does go on Reddit however so the fact that this made the top of my front page makes those chances slim (thanks for the heads up OP; you ROCK!)

> A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.”&&I've had the oddest girl crush on her for a few years.

There's quite a bit more improv to that show than you think bc they work it so naturally.

"Watch John Wick 1 & 2. Then watch Constantine. Constantine feels like a sequel in a series where our protagonist, John, develops the ability to fight Hell itself.

Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as “John” goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it’s Keanu’s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity.

Hopefully we'll get a real movie treatment of the character and his world someday.  That being said... this theory is now completely my head canon.

John wick 2 came out on HBO, so naturally you re-watched John Wick 1 to prepare for the onslaught of awesome. After completing viewership you turned to your on-demand (xfinity or otherwise) to fill that void of awesome in your heart and saw...Constantine.

I couldn't get past the fact that Keanu looks so much younger in Constantine and his gun handling skills are noticably less developed.

Yes, it had almost NOTHING to do with the Hellblazer comics, and this John Constantine was very different from his original counterpart.

That said, the series did pay respect to the source material, and, to me, it felt like it understood what it was about, even if it was going in a completely different direction with it.  

I understand while diehard Hellblazer fans hated the film, and I won't say they were wrong to do so.  However, I, personally, really enjoyed this film for what it was, and enjoy re-watching it.  It's also one of Keanu's best roles, prior to John Wick, and is what made me realize that the bulk of the hate spewed at him as an actor is merely memetic in origin from his 90s career.  His range may be limited, but he's very good within that range.  &&This is going to be lost in the comments but I REALLY LIKED THE CONSTANTINE TV SHOW AS WELL...WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CANCEL IT :(&&I fucking loved a Constantine.

He's certainly one of my favorite actors ever. He also stars in one of my top 10 films ever in A Scanner Darkly. I fucking love that movie so much and I'm not sure why it never became a bigger hit. Is it even considered a cult classic?
&&Also Keanu Reeves doesn’t age so it’s ok&&So Constantine is just [John Wick 3 - John gets cancer](#spoiler)?&&What if Constantine is the prequel, and Wick is the life he leads after being healed by the Devil?

A sextology if you will &&Nice

Edit: anyways this reminds me of the time I met Peter Stormare. I was sitting on one of the couches they have at Cherry Berry, and who sits across to me but Peter Stormare himself! I didn't recognize him at first, but after a double take I looked up and said, ""Hey, you're Peter Stormare, what're you doing in a place like this haha."" He smiled, then replied, ""When I want a frozen treat, I can't think of a better place than Cherry Berry."" Then he looked at my bowl of frozen yogurt and said, ""Cookie dough, Oreo, and fruity pebbles? I see we share similar tastes."" He then lowered his bowl to show me that he had the exact same toppings and flavors. I replied, ""Wow, I guess great minds think alike haha."" Then he took a big spoonful of frozen yogurt and put in his mouth, but strangely enough he didn't chew at all, just swallowed it instantly. I thought to myself how the cookie dough and fruity pebbles he swallowed must be hurting his throat. He smiled even wider and said, ""Well, that's the last of my yogurt, see you later."" On the way out he put a $20 in the cashier tip jar. He seemed like a nice guy.&&A fucking *pencil*&&That settles it. Constantine is now John Wick 4, possibly 5.

Or better said, it is very well-known, but somehow there was never really a hype built around it, which is shame, cause movie is great!&&If you ever read Hellblazer (graphic novel), you will quickly understand why a lot of people hated Constantine.&&It is a fantaastically good scifi/supernatural Noir film. I get why people don't like it, I want way more Hellblazer than we got with that short lived but fantastic tv show, but Constantine is a great movie. &&Plus Shia Lebeouaueeuhuoefff’s character dies.

So that’s cool. &&See, I think John Wick is just Neo after the Matrix rebooted at the end of Revolutions.

Morpheus even comes back, but their memories are fragmented, which is why Morpheus gets the story of their first meeting wrong, while John doesn't remember it at all.

EDIT: Thanks for the imaginary internet points, guys. Glad to see someone other than me likes my theory.&&haha, this is even better. I can act that John Wick is another iteration of Neo. &&A little off topic, but he's one of the most perpetually youthful looking smokers I've seen.  

I'm sure the benefits of wealth and fame help to a certain extent, but it's really interesting how he seems to have avoided a significant amount of the apparent aging a lot of smokers go through.

&&Confused, did you fix anything? 💆🏻‍♂️&&keayes i agree with you&&Is Keano a reddit inside joke that I missed out on or has no one else noticed the typo on his name?&&She is still beautiful &&She also costarred Keanu in Chain Reaction,( a film I feel does not get the credit it deserves) and where I had my first crush on her :)&&James Bond definitely agrees. &&I super want to agree with you, were it not for Peter Stormare. 

Tilda Swinton does perfectly pull of the androgyny of Gabriel (and angels in general) better than any other show/series. &&She was really good, but Stormare gave us one of the greatest depictions of the Devil ever put on screen imo.&&Damn right. The original androgynous hottie! &&The 4th film in the series will be named BABA YAGA...... he killed the devil with a pencil... A FKING PENCIL! Who does that??&&Care to say why the name was bad/would make such an impact?&&Exactly! He took the name of an angel for <some deeply meaningful reason> to attribute to the dead wife...&&Why would the title matter?&&Seriously! I saw it before I ever knew about the comic or that it was even based on one and I loved it. My favorite 'hell' movie. &&I agree, the movie itself is underrated&&It would go against DC's character title promotions.

If DC had its way and Constantine did well in the BO, they would have continued and focused more on anti-heroes like him such as Etrigan, Swamp Thing and Deadman.  The base heroes would have still had their films (Superman, Batman, Wonderwoman), but there would be 2 sides to DC's movie universe.  

If this happened, a movie combining the stories of Justice League and Justice League Dark (which was in talks back then and has since turned into a comic book series and later adapted into an animated film) would have taken place.  

I really want this to be made and if Justice League Dark ever gets its own movie, I think it will.  If anything we'll see Batman surprise the Justice League with a ""hey look who I brought to the party"" when all hell literally breaks loose.

I've also heard Mr. Reeves is up to reprise his role as Constantine if the opportunity comes.  I've already got an actor in mind for Jason Blood (Henry Cusick) and if Paul Bettany wasn't already Jarvis, he would have made a perfect Deadman.&&Its already a beloved cult classic.&&Same with John Carter. I don't think I've seen a bigger blow of marketing budget mainly due to a terrible naming of movie than that. I think Fight Club and Lucky Number Slevin as well as far as movies really well loved that could've done much better with better names.&& Both movies are games, Matrix is the PvE server and John Wick is the PvP server.&&Keanu noted when talking about John Wick that the Matrix movies helped him train for this kind of thing, and that the Matrix is his world now. Some of the things pulled off in John Wick makes it seem like its still the Matrix.

Theory being that when Neo died, his digital self split up into several variations. This was explored in an Matrix MMO that was short lived.&&They do? Weird, I finished Constantine when I created this post and I thought they called him “John” more than they did in John Wick. &&Prob changed his name to keep the hotel guys from looking for him. &&I don’t know anything about Hellblazer so the movie Constantine was awesome from my perspective. Ignorance truly is bliss sometimes.&&It didn't exactly set the box office on fire, and was divisive among both critics and the public (and roasted by fans of the comic).

While I enjoyed it I don't think it's terribly surprising there was no sequel, shame though it is.&&Or don't, its nothing like John Wick.&&Man, Keanu’s life is pretty interesting in a lot of ways&&""Just Johnny"" has erased or suppressed his childhood memories in order to increase the memory capacity of his brain to store more data... perhaps he suppressed more than childhood memories, and in fact erased half of his previous life, where he was a killer of men and demons...&&How about Sweet November then Atomic Blonde followed by Devil's Advocate?&&""Don´t make a deal with the devil, Devil.""&&>I couldn't get past the fact that Keanu looks so much younger in Constantine

Take the beard away in John Wick and Keanu doesn't look like he's aged a day.

However, for some reason all most everyone criticises his wooden acting in John Wick. &&Without him playing the devil, the movie is average at best and I'm a big fan of Weiss and a huge fan of Keanu. 

With him as the devil, it's a must see movie. Rarely has one person had a scene that completely made the movie like the devil scene in Constantine did. &&Best devil portrayal IMHO.

The whole gimmick for that character in the comic canon is that he can't die. He seems to die, but he comes back to live. The movie scene was clearly setting up for that.

He is the one.&&4th film (meaning Jonh Wick 3) will be about Baba Yaga (John) trying to survive and get rid of every agent that is on to him, fighting through to the boss, while leaving trail of bodies behind. He comes to the boss, final fight, boss is defeated and before killing him, he asks John what his plan is.. he killed everyone there was to kill ""You are going to hell for this, never to see your beloved woman!""

""Yes.. I will do both. I´ll go to hell just to see my wife in heaven.""

He shots him, and we see him some time later (a few years) in Constantine. &&The movie was supposed to be based off of the Hellblazer comics which stars the character John Constantine, but the movie did a bad job of adapting the comics so people disliked the movie for that reason.  &&I'm copying and pasting this since I'm at work - 

Because to the fans of the character he was not Constantine. It's the first time I remember a real fan boy backlash against an actor playing an iconic role to be honest (I was a teenager when the whole Michael Keaton couldn't be Batman backlash occurred). 

&&Constantine is a DC antihero who is almost nothing like his character in the movie. It's a great movie but followed the source material about as well as Catwoman.&&Because to the fans of the character he was not Constantine. It's the first time I remember a real fan boy backlash against an actor playing an iconic role to be honest (I was a teenager when the whole Michael Keaton couldn't be Batman backlash occurred).  &&I remember seeing it in theaters when I was much younger (obviously) and thinking it was better than it was being received. I still didn't think it was *great,* but it was certainly a fun flick, with some good VFX for the time.&&They use it:

- Chad when John leaves the church and walks into the rain

- Midnite when he tells who John used to be

- Isabel before her jump

- Angela when she approaches him at his flat (not sure on this one)&&Maybe Wick is his usual normal name, and Constantine his supernatural acquired name.&&I just love the, ""Your not having a good night are you, John?"" line.&&I've found more often than not that focusing on critic reviews and fanboy feedback often destroys my own interpretations, or even my own desires to see a movie. Sometimes it's nothing but telling others why we shouldn't enjoy a movie.

I'm not a connoisseur by any means, so sometimes going into a movie blind leaves me pleasantly surprised and entertained.&&Maybe not story wise ... but the action scenes are definitely similar ... the sparring, the camera work ... 

but to each his/her own ...&&You are. It was not good. (And I say this as a die-hard Keanu fan since 1988 who watched it twice in theaters.)&&Fun fact: Stormare is from my old Swedish home town of Bollnäs, Hälsingland. The region of Hälsingland (pronounced Hell-Sing-Land) not only have a goat as their ”logo” (don’t know the English term), but also a significant amount of stories about Satan. Like the one about Hårgaberget, when he made the people dance until’ they died. So him playing Satan well might have something to do with coming from the most devilish parts of Sweden. ;)

""American components, Russian components... ALL MADE IN TAIWAN!""

Armageddon is a good movie I don't care what anyone says. I'm a sucker for father/son dynamic. &&""Dead Orbit needs your help guardian""&&He had a major role in the game ""Until Dawn"" which was just a phenomenal horror movie/video game combo. He sold the hell out of his role and creeped me the fuck out&&""This is how we fix Russian space station""&&""This is how we fix problem on Russian space station.""    

His character in Armageddon was fantastic.&&*is good?*

Loved him in American Gods &&Someone described it perfectly for me:

When we see him moving, we can tell that isn’t the Devil’s true form, but just a “skin” he’s in. Like a handpicked favorite from the circles of hell that he possesses. It’s probably his favorite “skin”. Basically, his “Edgar suit”.&&While not as good, but definitely as entertaining, Ray Wise as the devil in Reaper. &&That is only because Willem Dafoe has never played Lucifer...why, I cannot know.&&I prefer Al Pacino and his view on the devil being just a foulmouth businessman. :p&&It is a very good interpretation of the character and very well acted. But for me, although threatening, Stormares devil still is too 'cool', in control and logical.

I always preferred Viggo Mortensens interpretation of Lucifer in the Prophecy. Thinly veiled madness, menacing and ruthless. ""I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's feces... Or we can talk."" And the the way he just sits there, eating a rose.&&Oh absolutely. &&He just made me feel uncomfortable. The devil shouldn’t be scary or creepy or a huge ass demon, it just needs to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible and you have the perfect interpretation of the Devil.  &&Constantine was villified for not being Hellblazer. Fortunately i was unfamiliar with the source material and enjoyed it.&&I thought critics thought that's where his wooden acting worked best?&&And Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. Her androgynous look, her smug moral superiority, all of it, was perfect.&&""Hello Luey""  in a cold, matter of fact and not impressed manner.&&Different type of devil, but Ray Wise in the show ""Reaper"" should be ranked up there as well. &&Close, but no cigar...  

https://youtu.be/tMmcCBEyEj0&&I took that literally and now I’m imagining lucifer in Pixar movies. &&No, I liked the first one.&&I read that as regional manager at first and was gonna say having Michael Scott as the devil isn't TOO bad.

It's the first time I'm hearing that Constantine is based on a comic book series. Also probably explains why *I* fucking loved Constantine.&&It definitely has the right asthetic, albeit more focused on biblical angels vs demons"" lore and not straight up magic. The main difference is Constantine himself, Keanu's version is basically  an original character.

While watching the movie never once did I think ""Good lord, what a bastard."" He's a dick, sure, but for the most part he's clearly a decent person.

That's probably intentional, the average movie goer with no knowledge of the comics might have had a hard time connecting with comic Constantine. He's one of the most unlikeable heroes ever but you learn to love him.

Still, I can imagine Warner Brothers making them tone the asshole level down and cast a big actor rather than a comic accurate one. This was before the comic book movie Renaissance, where studios were still afraid to be comic accurate.

Hell, even today I doubt if we'd be able to get a proper Hellblazer adaptation through Warner Brothers.

But for what we got, the 2005 movie is pretty great, it's just not John Constantine.  &&IIRC the comics actually reference the american Constantine as some dude with the same name in a similar line of work.&&The issue is definitely that, for all the smoking and tricking the devil into giving him his lungs back, John Constantine from the film is NOT John Constantine from Hellblazer. 

He's not snarky, he's not British, and he's certainly not blonde. That scene where he calls the Unholy Trinity and points out the eternal war in hell his soul will cause has a much different feel in the comics than it does in the film, for better or for worse. 

That said, he's a pretty perfect noir detective, and I don't know that I've ever seen a better Devil. &&I saw that bit about the show, and I'm really excited for it. 

I'd be more excited about the LoT cameos  if I could will myself to enjoy LoT. I really wanted to like that show, but I just can't. 

Also, they totally fucked up Vandal Savage, and that is an unforgivable crime.&&Justice League Dark was bad ass. &&It's my favorite scene in the whole movie. It also kinda plays into why I like the Witcher so much, and Supernatural to a lesser degree: pragmatic monster hunters  using lore and bravado instead of faith to destroy their foes. &&I have watched this movie for years and never knew about this post-credits scene!!&&Huh.

You sharpen the human appetite to the point where it could split atoms with its desire, you build egos the size of cathedrals, fiber optically connect the world to every-eager-impulse, grease even the dullest dreams with these dollar-green gold-played fantasies until every human becomes an aspiring emperor! *Becomes his own God!* Where can you go from there? 

And as you're scrambling from one deal to the next, who's got his eye on the planet? As the air thickens, the water sours, even the bees *honey* takes on the metallic taste of radioactivity--and it just keeps coming! And it just keeps coming! 

Faster and faster! 

There's no chance to think. To prepare. 

It's 'buy futures, sell futures' ***WHEN THERE IS NO FUTURE!*** 

We've got a runaway train, boy!! We've got a billion Eddie Barzoons all jogging into the future. 

Every one of them reading to fist-fuck God's ex-planet, lick their fingers clean as they reach out with their pristine cybernetic keyboards to total up their billable hours!! 

And then it hits home! It's a little late in the game to buy out now!! Your belly's too full, your dick is sore, your eyes are bloodshot, and you're screaming for someone to help!! 

But guess what? 

***There's no one there!*** You're all alone, Eddie! You're God's. Special. Little. Creature.


Maybe it's true. Maybe God threw the dice once too often. Maybe He let us all down.&&This. At the time I wasn't aware of the source material, and the movie got me into the comics. I found out quickly, the Hellblazer circles back then did not like the movie, still don't but it's more accepted now. I personally enjoy both, but I've been on that side of the fence before, so I get it.&&Which is a weird case since the movie is great for what it is, but just because it's ""Hellblazer-in-name-only"", it's gotten bad rap. I know Hellblazer and read the comics, and I've long accepted that Hollywood will shit on everything I love for a buck, so I went into Constantine not expecting how wonderfully-directed and casted it was, even if it wasn't what the geeks were expecting. I still maintain that Constantine is one of the most beautifully-directed comic book films ever.&&She was the hottest Gabriel ever.&&Definitely agree.  The casting was tremendous in this movie.&&""No, you will live Buzz Lightyear. You will live so you will have the chance to prove your soul truly belongs in Sid's room.""&&BAH GAWD!!!&&I still haven't accepted it.  I think he was a Russian spy living in Sweden as a sleeper agent, then the Cold War ended and he got into acting. &&Yea basically OG Hellblazer through the end of Garth Ennis' run, after he leaves it's pretty down hill from there. Also, Alan Moore Swamp Thing, where Constantine first appears and has his first adventure (in terms of publication history, the Swamp Thing story does take place post-Newcastle). &&You might like this animated movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpPy3sIxbmA&&HBO series might be the way to go&&> While watching the movie never once did I think ""Good lord, what a bastard."" He's a dick, sure, but for the most part he's clearly a decent person.

Isn't the tv show Constantine like that as well? &&I thought the final twist was quite a nice, Constantine-esqe trick, even though it's really the only one in the movie.

Hollywood's never been happy doing genuinely bastardly anti-heroes. A character being a bit of a prick was conveyed by... Well, look at Peter Quill in guardians. They prioritise a likeable protagonist over a character arc.&&Did you watch Tv show? Like to hear your thoughts. He was just the right kind of bastard. Job got done. But dam sometimes. &&> and I don't know that I've ever seen a better Devil.

Tom Waits in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a pretty good Devil too.&&Which is unfortunate because that guy looked just like Vandal Savage from Justice League. The main problem was that he was too unhinged seeming and featured too prominently. The beauty of Vandal Savage is that he's able to bide his time until his plans are fully in place before he strikes. LoT turned him into a Dr. Claw-esque bumbling villain with weekly plots to take over the world. Even with the time-travel conceit, I feel like they had him doing too much.&&Season 2 was much better than 1 tho, they removed Savage and the Hawkpeople &&I wish they had placed that post-credits scene after about 10 seconds* into the credits so people actually got to see it.&&add a [timestamp](https://youtu.be/hVvyBseaXNw?t=37) to that URL.&&https://youtu.be/xsvQuJmASSk&&My favorite red carpet prank is when Matt Stone and Trey Parker went on acid and in dresses [(interview)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSxHnsddg20)&&*Even Stevens*, anyone?&&Still one of the most accurate book guarantees I've ever seen.

Best part is Trey Parker @1:48 with ""It's a night of magic."" followed by mild but uncontrollable spasms&&When I was younger, Disturbia was my jam. Now that I’m older, I think his performance in Fury was great. Especially after you read how he prepared for his role in Fury. I think he’s a talented dude. &&Bay wanted a pathetic manchild and that's exactly what Shia gave him.&&that character didn't deserve to exist as a protagonist

not only did he have no sympathetic characterization, skills, or talents whatsoever, he never grows as a person or develops any skills

he inevitably ends up in a relationship with much more attractive women, despite his lack of redeeming traits, and with Fox's character this is the worst because she's actually talented and sympathetic

the worst thing is there is no justification for his presence. All he does is be in possession of the McGuffin at the start of the movie. Yeah he kills Megatron, but any idiot could have done that, and he was told the cube thing would actually make Megatron a death god or whatever so really he ended the world, but plot armor said that couldn't happen to sam, so it saved the world instead for no reason

/rant&&He’s told not to swear by Will Smith several times. &&Yeah, Will Smith's kind of sort of sidekick.&&What Indian Jones? I didn't think he was old enough or was he some random baby? &&He's 53. I'm 35 and I've seen his entire career, so I know he's 53, but it still shocks me when I think about it.&&*::swoon::*&&[That Nefratiti fight tho](https://youtu.be/y8svNN8saeU)

I’d say less because it’s a movie and more because of the kind of movie it is, reality has to be suspended hahaha it’s one of those movies where you just have to accept one core falsity is true and you’re fine.

Then they moved it into the middle of nowhere, no fans. Just a camera focused on a US flag, nothing else. 4chan tracked it down (amazing autist work actually) and took the flag away.

Then they moved it to London, just a flag. Fluttering.

Uncontrollable tics and spasms aren't exactly the same thing as a massive collection of people assembling in one spot and dancing.

In ergot outbreaks, cattle and livestock almost always suffer first as they are fed questionable grain before humans in a region, generally. Ergot is relatively easy to spot, it looks like a mold. Outbreaks occur when people get desperate. Since don't see animals affected in dancing plaque cases, and the disorder doesn't correlate well with reports of famine or extreme need, I don't think ergot is the likely culprit. The same is true for the similar theory about the Salem witch trials.&&Fun Fact, the father of LSD worked with ergot.

&&Hopefully that Carrie Fisher sendoff they talked about isn't Kylo blowing her up with rockets...

Ah who am I kidding she probably would have loved it! &&This may just be childish naivete on my end, but what I like to think is that Luke begins Rey's training, then cuts it off after feeling her true power, leaving her hungry for knowledge. Meanwhile, Kylo is unable to kill Leia, forcing Hux or some other First Order underling to do the deed, making him turn away from Snoke and the dark side. He somehow meets up with Rey, he shows that he wants her help in returning to the light, and they work together to train and develop their full potential without Snoke or Luke, leading to a dichotomy between the scheming of the elderly and the idealism of youth.&&“I’ve seen this much raw power only once before.

It's very American Revolution-y to me, and I love it. George Washington knew the power of the British military and still went against the largest Empire the world has ever seen. It's kinda like that.

Rey is seduced by the answers she desires while Ben becomes repulsed by the answers he's found.  He'll kill his mother, find he hates himself, attempts redemption.  Luke will see Rey's true power and refuse to train her, but that this point she knows too much and needs to know more, becoming the perfect candidate for Snoke.&&I predict they flip where Kylo realizes he cant kill his mother and massively regrets killing Han, so he flips to the good side. Rey has some built up anger and is more powerful than Kylo (as seen in TFA), so I see Snoke being able to provide Rey with the end result that Luke can’t provide.



An alternative would be Kylo flips and joins forces with Rey where they become the mothafuckin dynamic duo of Jedi Knights.&&Yes. &&That final dialogue is just a bait and switch. Rey and Kylo aren't even in the same place there, she's not talking to him.&&CELLS INTERLINKED&&...like tears in Rian.&&You see a Porg in the desert, lying on its back... &&Man, if Denis Villeneuve directed something in the Star Wars universe. &&Beat it, skinjob. I have the death sentence on 12 systems.&&Finn did hold the lightsaber and fought Ren with it, though.&&The background of the last sequences - the falling comets or debris are similar when seeing Kylos face and then his hand.  Also the surreal feel makes me think it might be one of Rey's dream sequences.  Or possibly just how Kylie gets Rey to see Snoke as a prisoner. &&I can imagine them planning out this trailer ...

Edit-This is mostly a shitpost, but I'll use it as a platform to say Kylo Ren and Rey are both Luke's kids, I refuse to believe otherwise. Them making us guess who Rey's parents are is just a misdirection so we won't debate on whether or not Ben's real parents are Han and Leia or not. Han doesn't care about Obi-Wan and Leia never even interacts with him. Why would they name their son Ben?

That was misinterpreted by the news site, he even corrected them later &&It is misdirection and fairly obvious at that. Kylo and Rey are clearly not in the same room when he reaches out his hand. Movie trailers often stitch together different scenes to create fake interactions. &&For some reason I wouldnt be surprised if snoke is talking to Rey while luke is talking to Kylo.&&Yeah Snoke was definitely talking to Rey, not Kylo&&That music, the blending of the new themes including Rey's and Kylo's theme, gives me chills.

It looks to me by the background that she is inside the tree that we see her in with Luke in the previous trailer. 

So, they stitched together a scene where she asks that question and another (separate) scene where Kylo outstretches his hand to someone. &&Misdirection is my guess&&[deleted]&&I think it could be legit. It seems like Luke is too scared to train her based on her power and his past mistakes, and she's too hungry for answers and for purpose. I think it then could make sense for Snoke to promise answers and she becomes his prized pupil which makes Kylo feel rejected and realize how disposable he was to Snoke. Ultimately leading him back to becoming good. &&I think the shot of Kylo about to fire on the ship was the misdirection.

It's beautiful.&&There were a lot of complaints about The Force Awakens score but the trailers so far for The Last Jedi really highlight how good a lot of the tracks are.

Edit: a word&&I'm 99% sure Rey and Kylo are not facing each other, and that's just clever editing from 2 different scenes.

Shit I'm down with that.&&I am expecting Rey to turn against Luke, but stop short from going full dark side.  Luke is looking at her like she is diseased in this trailer, I can see that being a turn off enough to drive her away from him and convince him that she IS going to turn out bad...but not enough that she actually does turn bad.   

Finn is a link to humanity.  I doubt she will be able to  play for a different team than his for any significant length of time and he would never go dark side or work for Snoke again. 

I bet Rey and Kylo both play with shades of gray that none of the older characters can totally comprehend.  This is a Star Wars for a new generation;  Kylo and Rey will both just be seduced to the middle in this movie. Both disillusioned with what they thought their side stood for.  Neither will be totally good or bad and both will be fighting the older crowd  trying to convince them that its either one or the other. &&Kylo could still go either way and I bet Rey will take a brief trip to the dark side&&Not even close to normal.&&I interpreted that as him killing her because she couldn't reproduce.

Vader was death incarnate in his prime&&Honestly that was the pinnacle of the series for me despite not really caring for Rogue one.&&What was great was how they made it so he did it all so effortlessly.  He didn't do anything super flashy, he was just like this unstoppable force moving through, just leaving everything he passed dead.  &&The tension for that scene was absolutely perfect.

This may be the last time we see this ensemble of legendary actors under a legendary director.&&It's really starting to hit me just how *old* these guys have gotten over the years.  Glad to see them still doing work but damn, it's certainly been some years since Serpico and Raging Bull, etc.&&I keep forgetting this is Al's first film with Scorcese. Weird how it's taken them this long to finally work together.&&Good to see Pacino doing a serious role again in what should be a well made film.

&&Gran Pacino &&HOO-AH

Time flies, watch Heat then look at those guys in 2017. haha&&Why Scorsese never cast Pacino in any of his movies back in 80s or 90s baffles me, he would fit right into his crime/gangster movies. &&And here's the first view of Pesci and Deniro:

https://imgur.com/a/ByAn8&&A Scorsese film with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino (finally!), Joe Pesci and Harvey Keitel that only Netflix was willing to distribute goes to show how low the film industry has sunk. 

&&Funny how he kind of looks like De Niro in that pic.&&Pacino should have done a movie with Scorsese earlier in his career.. Seems like we missed a great one with the best gangster director and the best gangster actor.. &&I am 41 so I grew up watching peak Scorcese and these actors. As soon as I saw this pic, I thought, that makeup looks good before realizing there isn't much of it. :(

Also, Pacino should play Trump when the inevitable Oliver Stone movie comes out. &&Look at that Buick!&&My mob-movie-loving self is screaming like a school girl on the inside.&&They should re-title this film ""The Oscar Sweep""&&I don't know who's playing Mrs. Hoffa, but I bet she's got a GREAT ASS!!!&&With all that makeup on he looks like Martin Sheen. &&[removed]&&i dont know. I know it isnt right but i feel sad to see Al Pacino so old like this. i didnt even recognize him at first. Damn Godfather came out fifty years ago. Ill forever remember Al pacino as how he looked in the panic in the needle park, the godfather, dog day afternoon and scarface. He had that stare which domonated the scenes.&&Is this the one based on the book “I Heard You Paint Houses”?&&Gonna be his finest role in years&&Yeah yeah, Pacino looks great as hoffa, but LOOK AT THAT FUCKING BUICK THOUGH.

*Want.*&&$40 says Scorsese uses ""Gimme Shelter"" in the film. &&Is that the house and garage from Eastwood's Gran Torino film?&&Are you fucking kidding me? I posted an image of De Niro and Pesci from this movie a few weeks ago and they removed it for violating the rules, but this is allowed to make it to the front page?

I hope it is as good as these incredible films.

Godfather too, ofc.&&Oh, shit! They're making a movie about Hoffa? Sweet!&&Ole Alpo Chino is the greatest. Can I get a Bust-a-nut bar or some Booty-Sweat!!!!!!&&I don't know if anyone's said this but I really hope this gets a theatrical release. I'm glad that it's being made but Netflix Movies hardly ever feel like a real movie and then even if it does you gen remember it's a Netflix movie and it stops feeing like a real movie once again. And I think it's the fact that when a netflix movi is made you know it was made to be played on Netflix where like, a Scorsese film feels like it was made to be seen ina theatre and quite frankly, if this doesn't get a theatrical release it's a huge disservice to the legacy of this entire ensemble &&This is the most stacked lineup of actors in the history of films &&They should have told Al to take the cell phone out of his pocket.... I’m pretty sure they didn’t exist at that time.&&Good point, didn't think of that. Very likely the last time for this crew together. Scorsese, 75 in November. DeNiro, 74. Pacino, 77. Keitel, 78. Pesci, 74.&&Damn shame we won't see this on a big silver screen though.&&It's definitely the last time. Frankly it's amazing all these 70 somethings are working, every 70 something is not doing much of anything, or is slowly dying.&&Yeah, I like how a lot of them embrace the 'old guy' look for roles.  Rather than loads of hair coloring and make-up. 

Of course, that partially depends on the needs of the role.  He's looking like a grumpy old man here :)&&“All these crooked cops!” - Charlie Kelly&&Not to mention Hoffa was 62 when he disappeared. Pacino is currently 77 years old. Nicholson was around 55 when he played Hoffa. Just saying Pacino looks older than Hoffa ever did.&&There has to be a pic of Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino that looks similar to this pic. &&Pacino looked pretty good on this [show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3o-DZQFKB8) a few years back. Had visions of his glory days for a moment.&&[I've never seen heard of those movies] (https://i.imgur.com/BvdTzyi.gif)&&Pacino is also 15 years older than Hoffa was when he died, not that it really matters, just an interesting bit of trivia.&&They also morph into lookalikes of other actors. I was convinced for a second that this was Martin Sheen, not Al Pacino.&&Totally.  It's honestly a bit strange when you realize that The Godfather was 45 years ago.  And Pacino was 32 at the time!&&Well raging bull was 40 years ago&&Jack Nicholson never worked with Scorsese either until The Departed, and he has a much longer acting career than Pacino&&According to IMBD, Pacino was considered for the role of Jimmy Conway and also was the first choice for the role of Frank Costello. &&Jack Nicholson had it down pat.  https://i.imgur.com/y4x2w7K.png&&If we're going by Scorsese alumni, I feel like Harvey Keitel would've been better casting at least in the looks department, but then again I can't complain.&&Pacino has been doing great stuff with HBO he's still a phenomenal actor.&&From that smile I see a little bit of DeNiro, not much else really though.&&Much more youthful looking than Pacino.&&I feel like Ray Liotta woulda been spot on for Hoffa &&They're killing it with the hair!&&Wow - would not have guess that's Pacino at all&&I was going to ask if that’s the same house/driveway&&damn that was good&&Is this the same spot they filmed Gran Tarino? Looks too familiar.&&Damn, Heat is such a fine movie.&&I just revisited a few days ago.

""Why did I get involved with that bitch""?!

""BECAUSE SHE GOT A GREAT ASS! AND YOU GOT YOUR HEAD, ALL THE WAY UP IT""!!&&It's funny because in the 80's Scorcese made 0 gangster/crime movies, except for brief parts in Raging Bull which most people don't consider a gangster movie, more a character study. And even in the 90's there's only Goodfellas and Casino. Two movies isn't that many chances for Pacino to miss out on a role. Also I'm having difficulty imagining which role in Goodfellas Pacino would've taken. Too old to be Henry Hill, not Irish seeming enough to be Jimmy Conway, and not Joe Pesci enough to be Tommy DeVito.&&Think there was beef between Pacino and deniro back then&&Joe Pesci looks so old. I don't know why, but I've always thought of him as being younger than he is. Maybe it's because I watched Home Alone so much as a kid and he looks young there.&&Holy fucking shit I am so excited to see Pesci 
 on the big screen again. I hope he has a lot of screen time.&&damnnn, the fuck? pesci looking like scorcese&&What are does shirts called, that all those 70's gangsters always wear in their movies?&&Fucking super hero movie craze. Sick of it&&[deleted]&&It really is mind boggling.&&""Movies"" now have become the episodic TV shows, in every bad way possible. I guess I just want movies that actually end. No forced sequel. A story purposefully told in a contained format.&&Ya I didn’t read that title properly and didn’t zoom in, and thought it was De Niro&&Funny how? 

Edit - First time gettin gold, wanted to say thanks.  You really are a funny guy!!&&One could argue that De Niro is the best gangster actor. Either way, I’m just happy that they’re both alive and well and able to all work together. &&Scorsese doesn't peak.&&Why the sad face? He's 77, if anything I'm quite relieved to see him looking a bit more normal for his age, and not the goofy look he had the last few years seeming like he was just trying to cling to his youth. &&I'd be excited for an Oliver Stone Trump movie in the same vein as Nixon if Stone wasn't so dull nowadays&&peak? you werent even born for some of their best ones...&&> I am 41 so I grew up watching peak Scorcese and these actors

So, you were:

* Born the year Taxi Driver came out
* 2-years old for The Last Waltz
* 4-years old for Raging Bull
* 10-years old for The Color of Money
* 12-years old for The Last Temptation of Christ
* 14-years old for Goodfellas

That's just Scorsese. I doubt you were watching Pacino or De Niro for:

* Godfather
* Godfather II
* Deer Hunter
* Mean Streets
* Dog Day Afternoon
* Untouchables
* Serpico
* Scarface
* Sea of Love
&&word, that thing looks mint as fuck&&1970 Electra I think&&Buick Electra, top of the line and (along with the Olds 98) in its' day the go-to for people who wanted and could afford a Cadillac but didn't want to or couldn't be seen driving something as flashy as a Caddy. 
&&I am screaming out loud, your move.&&Isn't this a Netflix production though? I thought they disqualified Beasts of No Nation for the same reason...&&Or its badass original title, I Heard You Paint Houses. &&Pacino, Keitel, Pesci and De Niro have combined for one Oscar nomination since 1993. &&Well 45 to be fair&&Yes.&&Its sad that the last memorable role of his i remember was insomnia.&&I was actually surprised he didnt use it in Silence /s&&It happens a lot.

And shit tons of plastic surgery.&&Did you see Sly Stallone on “This Is Us” the other night? Guy looks like a fucking science project &&Essentially the antonym of John Travolta.&&I wish someone could tell that to Bollywood actors. 50+ year old actors take up roles pretending to be 20 something, and dance around with actresses younger than their actual daughters.

It would seem Pacino would be more likely to team up with Scorsese than Jack, IMO&&Jack killed it in that movie.&&[deleted]&&\* Looking up IMDB \*

Frank Whaley? I swear I thought it was Tim Robbins all this time. Known for ""wha, wha, what?"" over Robbie Krieger? That's a shame.&&It looks like he's squeaking out a high effort/low result fart.&&Damn, didn't realize Keitel is only a year older than Pacino. For some reason I had him at like 5-10 years older. &&Absolutely, the resemblance to Keitel is amazing&&I think he’s in this movie too I just don’t know who. &&I heard Keitel is in it too. &&Looking the same is very little to do with acting.&&De Niro (and Pffeiffer) were great in Wizard of Lies. &&He was amazing as Kevorkian.

It could be made into a modern mini series. It really showed there really wasn't too much difference in the end between the two characters.

It'd be nice to see Pacino in a more restrained role like that again. 

Or get this... Morrie.&&Pacino as Billy Batts. His cultural cache was big enough in 1990 that he really could seem like a made man from another crew. Someone big enough to be untouchable that killing him is a huge ""holy shit"" moment.&&He turned down the role of Jimmy Conway and cites it as the biggest regret of his career&&Well, definitely a rivalry.&&Huh? Got any source on this? Not that I'm doubting you just really interested.&&https://youtu.be/lXf0xpkZHaA&&My first thought to the T. He looks like mini-Nicholson Smeagol. &&Speaking of Home Alone, does that shot look like the same house/separate garage that Kevin checks out to see if his parents' cars are gone in the first home alone?? &&Can't agree more. I know the belief around here is that the MCU should be treated as it's own entity, somehow separate from any other rating criteria for movies, but their vice grip on the industry has stifled creativity and originality. 

It's gotten to the point that something once seen as a milestone in films (extended universes) is now no different than an episodic basic cable series like Law n Order or House. 

More and more side characters and unknown heroes get these spinoffs with multimillion box office returns. Than these truly original and great films (Nice Guys, WindRiver, etc.) perform underwhelmingly and the whole EU narrative just gets reinforced and we get more of these ""pilot"" movies, where 1/3 the time they don't take off, and thus the audience gets an unfinished story, because the execs can't separate the tree from forest.&&I haven't seen a superhero film in the theatre since dark knight rises.

Listen, I love going to the movies, but Netflix movies should be considered for oscars just like any other films.

That's how. &&Yeah he’s the oldest at 79. &&He was great in The Big Sick.&&Stallone is 71, I refuse to believe it.&&[deleted]&&Scorsese hired a few Stand Up comedians in Casino (Pollack, Rickles, King) so I'm sure Romano will work in this. &&Dude vinyl, he's actually an actor.&&No longer in their HWAT?&&This will be the 5th movie that he has done since 1998's ""Lethal Weapon 4""&&He did. Scorsese convinced him to come out of retirement for this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it's the last thing Pesci ever acts in   &&I saw Mean Streets with DeNiro and Harvey Keitel in 1973. Had never heard of them or Scorcese. All I remember was Johnny Boy saying,  ""You fucking mook."" What a screen presence.&&Pacino too. They're both on such bad streaks these days that we're in the situation where learning that Robert De Niro or Al Pacino is in a film actively puts me off seeing it since I know it's probably going to be terrible.&&The gangster movie rose with and will die with that group.&&He already did a movie about Hoffa in the 90’s&&Jack barely remembers who he is these days. That's why he retired&&Just be thankful we're even getting another Jack Nicholson movie soon.&&he's like, a 100 now trho&&It'd be crazy for them not to.  I know I'd go pay money to see it on the big screen.&&Yes, they have to. Academy rules stipulate that a film has to screen in NY and LA to qualify for Oscar consideration.

Unless you can get to the one or two arthouse theaters that will shot it in NYC and LA, you won't be seeing it on the big screen unless Netflix decides to go the Amazon route.&&I don't think it's a shame, I think a lot of the reason directors choose Netflix is they have the same budgets without the strings. As far as I know Netflix lets the directors direct, total creative control. So it's a good thing, they get to make the movies they want &&I thought he had retired from acting?&&To be fair, they might have been tempted if any of their typecasts were more 'pretty boy' and less 'working class badass/mobster.'  &&Let's see how you like *that* Spin Doctors mix!&&Oh man that's one of my favorite Charlie moments hahah

4 The Mare ... picked up by a fellow janitor and immediately tossed out.&&Goddamnit, Jack Bauer. You really are the man.&&He outranks you, Frank.&&Yeah, it’s a popularly held belief that Hoffa is buried under parking lot somewhere in Michigan.&&Ok, Mr Mayor. Feast your ears on THAT Spin Doctors mix!

Wahahahaha! Hooah!&&I remember that scene where Charlize stands up.  &&I watched that with my dad a year ago or so. There's a scene where Pacino and Keanu are standing in an under-construction building looking over Central Park and Hell's Kitchen. 

That was my dad's building. We flipped out. We looked it up and everything. Crazy how small the world is sometimes.&&And Jim Carrey has never worked with Scorsese.&&You can say ""He doesn't look like an Italian"".  Especially after Scarface.

But then again he played the Godfather, so honestly there's very little reason for it.  There's apparently was some animosity between DeNiro  and Pacino but even that doesn't really explain it. 

All I know is I'm fucking excited as hell for this movie.&&Not even mob thing. Just an Italian thing. And to add to that, an Italian from New York thing. It’s crazy they never worked together.&&But nobody knows where he buried it.&&Hoffa.&&Batman&&The Sandlot&&Mean Girls&&Joe vs. The Volcano&&The Lego Movie&&Grumpy Old Men&&Jack's off with blondes, volume 8.&&The Shining&&Rampart&&A movie that isn't that movie.&&It’s the hair. &&Harvey Kietel is at least as good as Pacino. &&GREEEAAAAAAT ASSSS!&&I’m gonna go get the papers get the papers &&Touché. Or maybe Billy Bats, but I feel like Frank Vincent did a great job there. Also I read somewhere that he and Pesci were good friends so it made the whole scene ironic.&&Damn, I feel like Pacino’ s Morrie would have been hilarious. &&No way, Paulie was perfectly cast &&What is he, a schmuck on wheels?!&&Maybe, maybe... I just can't imagine any role in Goodfellas being played by somebody else. Everyone was shoe shine perfect. 

That said, Pacino as Janice Rossi? &&No, Pacino literally stole beef from DeNiro. &&Pacino used to be a cop and De Niro is a former bank robber. &&I can't tell if Pacino is wearing his wig backwards or if he's wearing a headband over his wig for some strange reason. But he's definitely wearing a wig.&&First thing I thought of lol&&I'm really sick of all the super hero movies too. They're just so predictable and full of cringy PG-humor. It feels like they're entirely written by some marketing focus group. I haven't enjoyed a super hero film since Nolan's The Dark Knight.&&Preach! &&The Avengers is honestly the worst thing that's happened to film in the last 20 years. Terrible, hackneyed writing, shit cinematography and I could not give half a fuck about what happens to literally any character in that movie. Absolute garbage.&&Same. Every movie is just a setup for the next.&&What do you mean funny? Do I amuse you? Do i make you laugh? &&His work on the gritty film Analyze This should put De Niro on top.&&When he peaks... you'll feel it. &&**HE'S JUST GETTIN WARMED UP!!!**&&you asked scorsese? what situation? Is he your dad? I liked silence. Very dirrefent experience than say goodfellas. but always his movies make me think of violence and its justifications. in silence the violence was very bothering. its a movie that was not that great experience watching personally, but the important thing about it is the impression it leaves into your mind that then comes up as you go about your life and makes you think&&Was he riding in the back of your taxi?&&[deleted]&&Soon his hair will help him achieve lift&&That has to be wind. &&Rockin that Hades from Disney's Hercules look. &&This is from the The Cure biopic starring Pacino as Robert Smith.  &&[Say hello to my CHOCOLATE BLEND!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S6eUFbOfIU)&&yeah a movie about a controversial political figure doesn't seem like something oliver stone would be interested in&&I had a 70 Skylark years ago. Miss that car... &&Ah gotcha. Has any Netflix-produced film to this point been nominated for an Oscar?&&Doesn't matter. Netflix is hated by the Academy and they won't even recognize it&&They did the same thing with Beasts of No Nation but they also released it on Netflix the same day. If the same thing happens with this then it'll unfortunately hurt its award chances. &&Damn, and I came here to echo the ""original thoughts"" comment for irony's sake, hopefully kickstarting a running joke comment chain. :(&&I feel like that's a cop out, and yet I feel that's exactly right.  

I mean I know Adam Sandler from Opera man and from a number of SNL skits, he wasn't pure gold but he was good.  He did billy madison, happy gilmore and while people don't love it, I remember liking Waterboy.  Hell his comedy Cds were good when people bought comedy CDs. 

But holy shit, I mean I don't think I can't talk about anything after Waterboy in a positive light.  Ridiculious 6 was painful, and while I like the Getaway or what ever it was called, it just wasn't even trying to be funny for most of the movie.&&Fuck you I actually googled it.&&He's 79?!?! 
Edit: he's 59&&It's like he's from the ice age or something.&&Bastard, haha.&&I agree. Gracious performance in an excellent movie&&He really was. That whole movie was great to be honest. I tagged along with my mom cause she was going to see it alone and figured why not I had the day off. It was way better than I would have ever expected. I hope it wins something come award season &&His hairline was even better! &&I really need to see that. Quick rating? &&Everyone was :)&&Schwarzenegger is 70. I saw him in person last week and he still looks like he could take a dude out.&&Stallone is on that HGH shit tho, dude's gonna live forever. Him and Joe Rogan.&&Ray Romano is becoming one of my favorite actors, Get Shorty was excellent&&Their yoots.&&Such a shame they couldn't get him back for 5 and 6. Still great movies though.&&Okay, Okay, Okay.&&You calling me a mook? What's a mook?&&Hollywood won’t accept that. You’ll have Goodfellas 2 starring Jayden Smith as Henry and John Boyega as Jimmy and Kate McKinnon as Tommy in 2030. &&DUH TEMASTEARS!&&I remember it being pretty good too. It’ll be difficult for me not to measure the new film against that one. &&Is there more about this or is this sarcasm &&[deleted]&&Isn't he slated to be in the Toni Erdmann remake?&&At least he knows he's a Laker's fan!&&He's actually transitioning right now. Has a definite ""Bea Arthur"" kinda thing going on at the moment.&&Wait what? The Departed is seriously the last movie I remember him being in. Unless The Bucket List came out after that haha.&&Has he been ill?&&i have anxiety about going to cinemas for personal reasons but theres 2 directors i fight the anxiety over - Scorsese and tarantino. They better cinema this here in australia&&That’s what ESPN did with that OJ documentary last year or the year befor&&*The Siege of Jadotville* had a fairly wide if limited theatrical release in Ireland, and that was before it released on Netflix.

Definitely wasn't exclusive to arthouse spots either. &&A lot of redditors here hate it, but I still believe in the magic of a theater experience. To me it's a shame that a master like Scorsese has to do with showing his film on a tv screen or hell someone's iPad.  &&It's definitely a shame that this director and this cast don't get the no strings treatment by big studios. &&Nah, Shit Tons is still acting.&&No...ehh...heh I taped over the Spin Doctahs mix... &&> [After Dennis's cat emerges from an explosion unscathed]

Super hero movies are stifling the industry. There's a place for them, sure, but the market is utterly saturated and most are tired, sophmoric drivel.

And this is coming from someone who had X-Men and McFarlane posters platering every corner of his bedroom growing up...&&I thought Logan was good&&They're 130-150min ""pilots"" or episodes of a larger series. 

I mean it's obvious now, maybe not so much back then, but they kill the whole point of a movie, which is a self contained story with a beginning and end. 

You can't have a Complete story when there's no end in sight, and the longer it's delayed, the less complete or rewarding each new addition feels.

^^From ^^the ^^Movie ^^Lethal ^^Weapon ^^2.&&That's exactly what I would want you too think to get you to stop calling my house.&&There are several actors with this issue. They use earpieces to have lines fed to them. &&James L. Brooks directed As Good As It Gets, also created The Simpsons and directed a few other really good movies. Haven't seen a movie from him in a while though. &&If it helps, it really isn't dying. It's just evolving away from the sticky-floored shithole experience we're used to.

It's the same with every physical business. You can get the *product* cheaper and for free, so what they're now needing to sell is an *experience*. Hence why my city has ~8 big chain-picturehouses and about ~7 independent/arthouse ones with leather sofas, alcohol, and other luxury amenities. That's not including the museums, galleries, and bars which have little screens set up with various small-release films.

The theatre isn't going anywhere, it's just changing.&&Maybe one day a Netflix subscription will include the movie theater experience.&&I've got a tv with parking brakes&&Yes but not everyone (or even most people) can afford a $2000 TV or whatever that cost you. The nice thing about the movie theater experience is you can go to a movie and watch it in amazing quality for $10-15. Pretty much anybody can take part in the experience and it doesn't favor people that have more money, really (except in terms of how often you can go).&&No doubt home theaters have come a long way, but there is just something about sitting in a theater with a huge screen and huge sound to match. The living room may be more comfortable but for some movies the theater is always going to be the best experience. &&For me it's just the experience of being in the theater, much less the difference in quality of screen/sound

Edit: I honestly don't remember the last time I had someone ruin my movie-going experience. I always have a great time, and more theaters near me are switching to big leather recliners & reserved seating which is really nice and seems to provide an all around better experience 

Edit 2: don't give me attitude because you have a bad experience lol&&Yeah no it's not. Even small theaters have sound systems that would cost over 10k to replicate at home. 

Larger theater in nicer malls and etc...yeah your not getting that at home for under 20 or 30.  

TVs May be sharper than projectors now but sharpness is only part of the equation.  only OLEDs are actually overall better than cinema projectors and a 75"" OLED is 16 thousand dollars for an LG. Sony is 20. 

Lets not talk about the price of 4k projectors.....

When most people think talk of the line they mean top of the line in best buy.....they dont mean 40-60 thousand dollars. 
   &&No it hasn't.  Theaters are nowhere even remotely close to even the nicest, professionally engineered home cinema rooms.&&I read the book, ""I hear you paint houses.""  It was fascinating.  I don't know if it was true but it certainly seemed to ring true and I think as you point out there was some blood analysis to back it up from the house the shooter (the ""Irishman"") said it went down in.  Book said they had a mob friendly crematorium nearby and that's what they did with the body, which is why no traces were ever found.  Again, can't say for sure, but Frank Sheeran (sp?), the guy the book said did it, was a known mob hit man and close friend of Hoffa and Teamster strong man and was one of the top early suspects. &&And I have never worked with Scorsese.&&And Shaka Hislop has never worked with Scorsese.&&There was no cameraman in the room, but im sure it happened&&Hoffa? I barely even know her!&&[They settled it over coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUy2Wx_r0_w)&&You're thinking DeNiro as the Devil and Al Pacino as the Devil. Easy one to confuse.&&Right?

&&How the hell do you give handshakes?&&What's the matter? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?&&Episode? That's from the end of Lethal Weapon 5.&&Good bot&&I think it is super hard for an actor (especially someone who carry the film on his back like Jack Nich) to still show good acting while he isn't concentrating into the scene and having to listen to his dialogue via an earpiece, maybe secondary actors. Also I think he doesnt want to be put in this position + he is too cool for that.&&Some were just pretentious. Marlon Brando never memorized lines, saying it would affect the delivery in front of the camera. There’s a photo of him and Robert Duvall on the set of The Godfather. Duvall had cue cards with Brando’s lines taped to the front of his body. 

Edit: [Source with photo](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/15/robert-duvall-marlon-brando-cue-cards_n_5331270.html).&&Thank you imdb bot &&I heard the same argument when football tickets started going for hundreds of dollars a piece and they brought in fancy clubs and microbrews and shit into the stadiums.

But you know what the real result was for me and my family?
We never went to an NFL game again. It's all doctors and bankers now.

If it changes into something only rich people can afford, it may as well die for those of us who can't afford to blow a couple hundo on a night out...which is about 99% of us...not that another 9% of us aren't stupid enough to do it anyways...

Long story short, I don't want a luxury experience for $100 on a leather couch at a museum. I just want to pay $10 a couple times per year to watch a movie on a big screen with real speakers rather than on my little 19"" TV with its tiny tinny speakers or on a laptop screen...especially if it has air conditioning in the summer. That's the shit.

Ultimately, it's not just changing. It's banning the working and middle classes.&&Reminds me of high school when the teacher would squeekily wheel in the fish bowl type TV and then clamp the wheels down on it. &&Also there is the phenomenal experience of being in a dark room with 50-200 strangers watching the same thing and not talking for 2-3 hours&&And you can't get that kind of sound quality at home. The sheer size of the theatre is what makes it so good 

&&I get that. I'm just saying the home experience isn't so far off anymore. I still love going to the cinema and go as often as I can but watching it at home isn't so bad either.&&If you look at it money wise he probably saves more money than you by watching movies in his $2000 tv.

Not sure where you live but here in Dallas the smaller theaters with a bar and in theater dining are cheaper than AMC and Cinemark. &&Alamo Drafthouse is 12 bucks a ticket with great seating. They actually dont need to jam as many people in he theater because they sell drinks/food etc. They are great!&&My guy moviepass is a god damn Robin Hood in your doomsday scenario. Get in while you can and enjoy it while it lasts. I've saved easily $100 the past couple months with it.&&The ""luxury"" theaters are like the same price or just a little more than the normal ones by me though. Plus there's better food, and beer. You can order a pizza and they'll bring it out when it's ready. That's success. &&This is why Alamo Drafthouse type theaters are doing great. Not that chain specifically, but the indie offshoots. They serve booze and real food and make the theater experience interesting. My favorite one in town has a band come in and do a live score to a certain film.&&I don't get the theater hate. As far as movie experiences go, I don't think there's anything that tops laughing together with another 100 people at a particularly well timed funny scene. It's magic. &&yeah. it wont last. people will be curious about their grandparents watching these movies together in PUBLIC! driving 10 minutes away to listen to people cough and rearrange themselves during the feature.

but there is something special about it. i miss the 80's future style decor that made entering a theatre feel like you're about to get on a ride at Space Mountain or enter an lazer battle. all these experiences will be read about on tablets... but the feeling lost.&&I have yet to see a movie where some jackass or some kid isn't making noise the entire time.    &&And I’ve never worked with Andy Reid&&[http://m.imgur.com/m4Ne3](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/62/a8/b3/62a8b3f73fc4ecb4f24bf992d9a1776d--lana-del-ray-top-secret.jpg)&&Ray Romano would be flattered.&&You mean good bolt&&Just like the show!

edit: it came today. hell yeah.&&That live music idea sounds really distracting and annoying&&Those experiences are great. The experiences that bring the hate are being at a movie that you wait in line to pay $15 to have the privilege to fight for an armrest with a complete stranger just to watch the stranger in front of you checking their cellphone every ten minutes and the stranger behind you talking in between scenes asking why a character behaves a certain way. It’s sad but when you deal with the general public you can’t guarantee their behavior will be appropriate.

​Simon Pegg Admits He’s Written A ‘Ridiculous’ Vampire-Driven ‘Shaun Of The Dead’ Sequel Treatment,44429,799j1t,http://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/film-and-tv-simon-pegg-admits-to-writing-shaun-of-the-dead-sequel-treatment-20171025,758,1509188370.0,,"Since this thread has already blown up way more than the post from a few days ago did where [Pegg says the rumors of another Shaun of the Dead are false](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78jd13/simon_pegg_says_shaun_of_the_dead_sequel/?st=j9bk08b9&sh=bff1285e) I thought I'd throw a reminder up here. 

This article is Pegg in an interview saying he wrote a vampire Shaun movie years ago and discussed it as a fun idea with Edgar, but both decided to do something different instead of something the same and moved on. There is no movie in the works and I would even bet that claiming this script exists in full anywhere is also a stretch. The article says he wrote a treatment, which is more like an outline.&&Vampire biting Zombie Ed would be a decent way of bringing back his consciousness.&&From Dusk Till Shaun.

**EDIT:** I thought I was being terribly clever, but then read the article and that was actually the name. Either I’m as brilliant as Simon Pegg (unlikely) or I’d read the title previously at some point and had forgotten knowing it.&&[deleted]&&Do the vampires have jetpacks?&&Wasn't there an article just the other day about him denying this? &&Let’s see it!&&They should do this, but as a crossover with ""What We Do In The Shadows"" and have Taika and Jermaine reprise their roles and produce. I would pay a lot of money to see that crossover because of their overlapping approaches to humor and satire.&&Admits&&Please don’t open Ladbible’s clickbait&&You've got red on you&&I don't think he actually wrote a script, he says it was just pub talk with Edgar.
>""It was all about Shaun and Ed having to go up to Edinburgh, or something. I don't know. It was ridiculous. And it was a joke. It wasn't like a serious pitch. Edgar thought it would be funny to do the film again, but with vampires. But it was all just pub talk.""

Edgar Wright added that they have also toyed with other ideas for a follow-up.

>""There was a brief idea we had, that we entertained for all of like 72 hours, where I thought you could do an alternate reality sequel,"" said the director, on exploring potential options. ""It basically starts with the same movie but then it becomes not about zombies. But these films, they take three years. So, it's like, if you're doing another movie, let's do something completely different.""&&Whatever it is, I want a fourth movie in the Cornetto Trilogy, and keep going, Douglas Adams style. &&I love that the say he “admits” it lol&&Funny to phrase it “admits”. What if nobody asked?&&same&&I offer myself as tribute.&&There is no part of this sentence that I don't love.&&Simon, if you see this, I will fully sponsor the movie with my 7$. Please take my offering&&I'd much rather see a sequel to Hot Fuzz.&&I would be happy to ridicule it over some popcorn in a dark movie theater.&&Sign me up&&Really hope there’s a glittery vampire to mock twilight &&For once, it’s weird to see a news story already hit the “mainstream” blogosphere (this was on io9 about a week ago) and then come to Reddit next. Come on Reddit, you guys are losing your touch. &&please god let this happen&&We need some good comedy. Please do this.&&The other day we were taking about how it didn't need a sequel and now here I am ready to beg for this sequel. &&> *From Dusk Till Shaun*

I already fucking love it.&&From Dusk til Shaun&&Yes. Please.&&Are we the bloodies‽ &&""You've got red on you"" would fit nicely into this sequel&&Do it, it would be a red sequel and an idea that hasn't been used for consecutive disasters in the same movie universe.
Also I will volunteer my time to be in it&&""Fine! You got me! I admit it! I'm a writer!""&&I wouldn't mind a sequel to the World's End about the continued adventures of Gary King.&&This movie needs to come out quick. Loved Shaun of the Dead. 

I like all the movies where Simon’s been the lead character. This guy needs more love in Hollywood (not the Harvey Weinstein kind of love).&&Oh... please&&'Admits' make is sound so accusatory. ""So you admit it, Mr Pegg!""&&Make it fucking so&&So here’s the problem with sequels.  
Let’s say we’ve got a good first movie.  People love it, lots of people see it, and it makes a bunch of money.  

Studio sees this and says “hey, that was successful. Let’s make another.”  Now here’s where the problem sets in.  They can 1) give you more of the same because that’s what you liked in the first place, 2) give you something a bit different, or 3) something more over the top. 

So option 1 has problems because people remember the original fondly and will complain “this isn’t anything new, I could just rewatch the first one.” Prime example: Star Wars Episode 7.  They gave us more of what we liked and people complained about it. 

With option 2 you end up with people complaining that “hey, I liked the first one but this new one just doesn’t feel the same and I don’t like it.”   Because people are again saying the original was what they liked and have preconceptions and expectations that aren’t entirely reasonable.  

And then you’ve got option 3.  Sometimes this works.  Sometimes this doesn’t.  See: Fast and Furious series, Transformers, James Bond.  Here the studio runs into multiple problems.  First, you’ve got burnout.  Eventually people are just going to get tired of it and then they have to resort to option 1 or 2.   Or even worse- things just get too ridiculous and you end up with a bloated circus of a movie (Batman vs Superman, Avengers Age of Ultron)

At the end of the day people want sequels.  But they also don’t because they get set in their ways and always believe the original “was best.”&&He talked about this idea years ago. There wasn't a script written or anything at the time, but he said he had an idea for a vampire movie called ""Till Dusk, Till Shaun"" 

Kind of cool he wrote a whole script about it &&

At least release the screen play.&&I want it and I want it now. &&I'm really really close to loving all the Edgar Wright movies but they always have this exhausting 20+ minute nonstop action finale that i find really offputting&&I want this so bad.

So.

&&I'm in. Let's make it happen boys.&&Do it!!&&Well fucking make it man, Shaun of the Dead is still one of my favorite movies of all time and easily my favorite of the cornetto trilogy.

I hope this movie doesn't stink.&&I need this in my life.

>actually, this is false

k.&&I can pitch in $200. Let's get this thing made!&&Which brings up the question: if Ed bites you, do you become a zombie or a vampire?&&Only at the end of the movie though. The whole movie should be about trying to avoid vampires while having a zombie friend to protect. Then at the end, a la Shaun of the Dead, he gets bitten and it restores his conscienceness. Then close the trilogy up with the third movie about werewolves and he gets bitten at the end of that one, too. &&That might be the best reason for actually making this sequel. You should send your idea to him, maybe he listens and sends some props your way as well.&&It should involve a vampire physician named Dr. Acula.&&I really think you'd have to bring Ed back. Maybe even just have him back to normal at the beginning and make reference to them finding a zombie cure but only for people with high enough body fat or something. That way nobody had to feel bad about the parents dying in the last one, couldn't be saved.&&But why would a vampire bite an already deceased (zombie) Ed? &&ED your alive












10 minutes later












Hey, ummmmm Ed are you a Vampire?












Ed- Don't know mate. I was bit by one the other day&&“Ed! ... are you... alright?”

“Yeah, not bad”

“No... I mean you seem normal. And you were bit by a vampire...”

“Yeah, bloody hurt that did”

“Ed!”

“Yeah?”

“You’re not gonna...(?)”

“Suck your blood? Hahaha”

“Yeah” 

“...”

“Ed!”

“Well I don’t know do I? Never been a vampire before”


“Oh c’mon we’ve gotta save Imogen”&&I'd be ok with it&&You read it the other day when the headline was about Edgar Wright saying that a sequel was never going to happen. &&Well it's the same joke as the first title really. Movie name with dawn changed to Shaun. Entirely possible you ""came up with it"" independently.&&how about ""28 pints later""?&&It's literally the same pun as shaun of the dead.  &&I'm not trying to insult you (or Simon Pegg for that matter) but it's not really all *that* clever, it's a little obvious.&&I first heard him say it on an episode of the Nerdist podcast, at least 3 years ago now.&&Followed by Shaun of Frankestein, in which a mad scientist uses the pieces they cut Ed into in the last film to make a machine-man that people attack because they think it an abomination.&&Night of the living Ed&&No you probably just 'knew' it. Like I remember watching a trailer for a movie with Daniel Craig in a cowboy hat and then it felt like a broken men in black spinoff had been merged with a spaghetti western and I laughed to my wife-at-the-time and said, ""oh god what are they calling this one? 'Cowboys vs. Aliens?'"" And for a moment after the trailer ended we both laughed about it. Jaws were scooped up from the floor and that was it. We never saw that movie. But sometimes you just know. &&Shaun of the Planet of the Apes&&I have a t shirt with this title and Pegg and Frost on the front, I'd be so amped to see it become a real thing&&I think it's the former, Robert.&&I thought the name was treatment from the title. Why is the word treatment at the end of the title&&Shaun’s lot&&What We Do in the Winchester&&We're really just waiting for the werewolf inspired Shaun Again&&I feel like the title is clever, but is also simple enough that more than a few people would end up there.&&I always wanted a sequel called Night of the Living Ed where Ed escapes and starts another zombie apocalypse&&Hag&&*Fascism*&&I came here to ask the same thing.&&No. There was an article about him denying that there were any plans to make a sequel. Him writing a treatment for it doesn't mean it's getting made. &&I just heard a podcasts in which he says a Shaun sequel should never happen and would be a slap in the face&&This is old news, they wrote it after sean of the dead, but decided that instead of direct sequels, thry wanted to tackle other genres, and made the cornetto trilogy a thematic one instead of a literal one. 

Sure a sean of the dead sequel might have been nice, but it would have meant we wouldn't have gotten the masterpiece that is hot fuzz&&[deleted]&&Shadows is one of those movies that seems like it would only be funny to a select group of people, but everyone I have shown it to loves it, even if they aren't familiar with that group of actors.


It's also legitimately funnier every time you watch it.&&Dear Lord! It's beautiful!&&They're already making a ""Shadows"" sequel about the werewolves called ""We're Wolves.""&&And get Stu back. He's great. &&[deleted]&&I really want a cross over between Only Lovers Left Alive and What We Do in the Shadows. They have similar themes handled very differently and i'd love to see the culture clash of those 2 groups meeting.&&Jemaine*

Not sure if it was an auto-correct or you just never noticed. I know it took me years to realize it wasn't Jermaine.&&I would at least pay the price of admission. &&""What we do in the Shaun""&&Who was going around accusing?&&I wanted to believe this to be happening. Seeing that the link was ladbible brought me back to reality. What a trash site. &&Except Shaun is covered from head to toe in blood.&&Why cant he blue himself this time? &&*Warm* pint!

What kind of writer worth his salt doesn't know anything about alcohol?&&True but now he can get a Hollywood budget and a tom cruise cameo.&&Wow.. I wasn't ready for these kind of questions today.. &&Neither. The two cancel eachother out equating Ed to a weird, bitey stranger.&&Zompire. You spend all day mindless and biting people then all night with brain working hunting blood. &&Zompire, obviously.&&A zompire. &&I would imagine for a vampire, biting a zombie would be like eating an out of date steak.&&I considered a zombie because a dead rising is basically a walking corpse and a vampire/zombie mix would probably turn them into zombies first which I don't think a zombie could convert into a vampire as they lack blood? But then again, do vampires have blood? Dracula has blood, the vampires in Twilight don't. Could a zombie convert into a vampire? 

**Which one overrules the other?**

I don't even care about this stuff but this question boggles the mind.&&Neither. You turn into Nick Frost.&&https://youtu.be/90TW-p3rkQk&&yes&&Simple, you become a TED

You know like TED209


edit - DOH mean ED , ED, not Ted, but it looks funny, so i am leaving it, enjoy the humor at my ignorance.&&a walking cornetto&&Yes&&Oooouuu a Zompire!&&For some reason I think ED will turn back into a human lol&&Yes&&werewolf&&You become a zompire/vambie/zampire/vombie&&A zompire?
&&Or a zompire.... &&That's how III is born. Werewolves.&&Also, does he need blood or flesh to survive?  What about shooting him in the head, would that kill him?  Or a stake through the heart?  Is he affected by sunlight? Garlic? Does he have vampire powers?  I NEED TO KNOW!!!

Also, I'm totally on board with this as long as Edgar Wright is also involved.&&Probably a zombie vampire&&Imo the vampire bite wouldn't do anything to Ed in the first place besides give him some gaping neck wounds. However (depending on what type of zombie it is, Shaun of the Dead never specifies) the vampire that drank Ed's blood would either become a zombie vampire or contract a horrible disease because cold blood is probably swarming with pathogens (hell hot blood is).&&You become Suarez&&Zompire

or a 

Vambie&&You become a hybrid. Neither vampire nor zombie, but stronger than both.&&A Vampbie&&Also, can dogs look up?&&strigoi&&Nerd.&&Both? Zompyre? Zombpire? Vambie? &&Relevant [Tomska video](https://youtu.be/wufXYCvN_uY) oddly enough&&Obviously you just switch:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wufXYCvN_uY &&A Hybrid!?&&I imagine you would become a vampire. I mean, doesn't the vampire virus revive everything in your body to perfection?&&If he scratches you, you zombie. If he bites, you're a vampire.&&Obviously a zombie vampire hybrid which the likes of this world has never seen before. And as long as he is the descendant of Alexander Corvinus. Otherwise, he'll die a horrible death.&&I like to imagine they cancel eachother out.  So if a zombie bites a vampire he becomes a zombie, but if a vampire bites a zombie he becomes a vampire. 

In the movie a vampire asking his friends to bite him because a zombie bit him sounds hilarious.&&Yes&&Vampire, obviously. The stack resolves as Last In, First Out.&&A lich?&&A Zompire. It's still undead but it turns into a bat, burns in the sun, and eats brains (or literally anything warm according to TWD). &&Zompire and/or Vambie&&If Deadliest Warrriors' monster episode is any indication, both.&&Or a zompire&&[Relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90TW-p3rkQk)&&a zombpire, obviously.&&Zompire&&what if yoo become a hybrid like him?&&I think you just die.&&Yes&&Both. The world needs more zombie vampires, don't you think?&&But if the vampire is also a Nazi, does that make Ed a nazi zombie vampire?&&Don't care, as long as they make it like they did Shaun of the Dead, I will watch, love and might even wee myself with laughter...

Shaun Juan Demarco with Nick Frost playing Brando's role!&&Batman v Superman; Shaun of Justice&&It was okay. It was trying to follow up to something very unique which is hard to do. It's a solid movie on its own rights, but isn't a particularly good sequel.

Compare to blade runner, which is a fantastic sequel, but it's long, slow and hasn't been particularly successful. &&I haven't seen it, but several friends have and said it was awesome. Everyone in this sub is a violently critical of everything. Don't listen to this sub, just go watch it and let your own taste and the movies own merits decide whether it's good for you or not. 

I almost fell for the fucking ridiculous narrative that The Force Awakens was a feminist agenda driven piece of shit that painted men as pathetic and weak compared to women. My inner Star Wars nerd is thankfully still an immature child roughly 11 years old or so, so I went and watched it. I still judged it against the originals (that's a difficult thing to not do to a series with a near 20 year gap) but I thoroughly enjoyed it, being largely unchained from the Sith/Jedi Order rulesets, and can't imagine where the dumbfuck feminist crap came from (because it wasn't there. The protagonist just happened to be female, who gives a shit). 

Don't listen to critics. Go watch the movie, stream it, buy it, whatever. Based on multiple people's opinions that loved the first, you're not going to hate it unless you bring the words of critics with you. Out of all the movies I've gone to the theater to watch, I've outright disliked 2 and *hated* one of those. I don't enjoy most of the movies that I read criticism of though.

With a trilogy you have to imagine the three movies as one big story.

The middle of any story is almost always the character(s) at their lowest point. It's where the real twists and challenges reveal themselves. Because of this, you usually see the characters getting tested the most which makes for very interesting stories.

So if you put Hux (the character that no one remembers) or Snoke there, you would have to find another place for Poe and ruin the symmetry. 

Or Poe will be the new Lando.&&Or.... You're very wrong.&&Why? You should take a look at previous posters and see that you're just wrong.

Blaming this on a designer or illustrator not knowing what they're doing is pretty dumb. They don't really get to take liberties when contracts explicitly drive these things. These aren't fucking schmucks putting this stuff together either. Maybe it is a sign, maybe it isn't. There are literally no hard and fast rules here historically speaking. It'd be pretty on the nose to have everyone on that side be evil. 

Hux (Domhall Gleeson) and Snoke (Andy Serkis but it isn't really his face) are nobody actors compared to Oscar Isaac.

There are 3 different cases:

Singular, male: ""Der letzte Jedi""  
Singular, female: ""Die letzte Jedi""  
Plural: ""Die letzten Jedi""

Since the German title is ""Die letzten Jedi"" its confirmed that there are at least 2 Jedi. Its just the small ""n"" that makes singular ""letzte"" to plural ""letzten"" :D

This is also true for other languages like Spanish.

You can see it elsewhere in the film when Count Dooku, Mace Windu and Anakin lose body parts - no blood spurting all over the place.&&Truthfully looking at Leia, Luke's character looks weaker and weaker all the time. They're the same age - she's a prominent figure in the rebellion who was next in line for the throne, a senator (apparently had a PhD at 19), watched her home world get blasted, got captured and almost executed while she listens to Luke whine about losing obi wan - a man who he got close to for 10 minutes. 

Now she's a general and he's what? Hiding in a cave bc kylo Ren is a cunt?&&I was just thinking of that too and I like it except for only the fact that the numbered episodes largely follow the Skywalker family and though Darth Vader is in Rogue One, I think it is a little breaking of the narrative to just insert the movie as a proper part of the early trilogy a la Episode 1.
&&Clones is the worst in my opinion, but I guess you need it for the love story.&&if AotC and RotS actually sold the Padme/Anakin love story that trilogy would have been amazing&&It's more than just that, really. In terms of plot, not much really happens in Empire - one half of the story is Luke's training montage and the other half is about the rest of the cast patching up the Falcon's hyperdrive while running from the Empire. That's a pretty small story, compared to the world-ending stakes of the first movie. But despite the small story, the movie is still intercut with huge, epic moments - like the Walker battle, the asteroid belt, Yoda lifting the X-Wing, but it does so seamlessly - it never feels like they sacrificed a character moment to give us an explosion. &&It's also the only thing you can do from a story telling perspective. It has to end on a down so It can rise up in the third arc.

I should stay inside and watch LOTR all day 😍&&I love spending half a day marathoning the extended cut of LotR&&Star Wars pretty much invented the modern blockbuster movie trilogy (of course, influenced somewhat by the old radio & TV serial shows that George Lucas was such a big fan of), but the point of the post above is that storytelling in general (plays, novels, movies) generally splits things into 3 acts:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure

Trilogies (including the original Star Wars movies) tend to have nested three act structures where each movie has its own 3 acts, but the trilogy itself also follows a bigger 3 act structure.   The poster's point was, I assume, that though applying the 3 act structure across a trilogy of movies might have been new, the 3 act structure itself is a fundamental, dawn-of-time storytelling technique.


&&I would say The Godfather part 2 is a good example.&&Lord of the Rings. And probably Dante or some shit&&Of course! Trilogies have existed for hundreds of years.

In movies I could quickly think of The Godfather and The Man With No Name Trilogy as mainstream movie examples.

In literature, many epics were written in trilogies. More recently I can think of Asimov’s Foundation Trilogy.

But above all, it’s more about the fact that a middle film almost always will be the darkest/most challenging just because of standard storytelling convention.&&You're right I remember reading that too.  But is it really a dishonor though?  Say there was a pivotal scene that she is in and say it wasn't completed.   And let's say the cg didn't still look weird, that they had finally perfected it.  Would it wrong to use a cg version of her?

They didn't use a cg model, but they did a lot of editing tricks with the sopranos when the mom died.  They had to address it.  It sounds like they had finished her shoots so there was no impact, but they might have handled it differently if they still needed her.&&That's funny because they already *have* CGI'd her in Rouge One – albeit from her younger days. &&if you'd like a pizza roll please leave a comment on my webzone&&I did some quick research on that and it appears that you're right. Thank you for correcting me. &&Who is george Lucas and what does he have to do with Star Wars anymore? Unless my boy Walt said it I'm pretty sure it doesn't count. &&You have never heard the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.&&I know it's kinda been disproven or at least denied, but man I'd love for Snoke to be Plagueis...

From what I understand, we're still not going to know all that much about him even after this new movie since the director pretty much said he'd be like the Emperor of Empire Strikes Back (mysterious top dog baddie... which was what he was in TFA). But part of me desperately wants him to have some sort of connection to the prequels. 

I've always loved the bad guys from Star Wars, from Vader to Palpatine to the Fetts... I'll be a little let down if Snoke's backstory is that he's just a bad guy that was around for a long time that nobody knew about.&&What will Snoke be up to in TLJ, you ask?

Real estate schemes.

At least he never ended up as a sex slave to a giant worm monster. &&> Now she's a general and he's what? Hiding in a cave bc kylo Ren is a cunt?

Yep. I cannot believe Disney retconned ""Legends"" Luke out of existence for this.&&With the Anthology films coming out the line between ""main movies"" and ""side movies"" might start to blur a bit. I think you're right in that the focus on the Skywalker family, which has remained constant in Episodes I-VII, will continue to be the major identifier of a full Episode versus a ""Star Wars Story"". &&I just loved rogue one so much...lol waiting for the haters&&Clones is definitely the most tedious watch, but it does contribute more to the overall plot (disjointed though it is) whereas everything that happened in TPM could be covered in the opening crawl.&&Homer is *so* derivative&&Like most 3rd acts, maybe everyone back in the day just wanted to pretend it didn't exist. Everyone knows the 2nd act is the best act. Why watch Godfather 3 when you can watch Godfather 2? Why watch Return of the Jedi when you can watch The Empire Strikes Back? &&Godspeed, friend. &&Yeah specifically for movies but if you want to break it down more this is still not really a 'new' idea.

Plenty of novels and literature even before the 1900's had trilogies that consisted of three books that had an over-arcing structure outside their contained inner structures that worked within each book.

Sure Star Wars applied it to film for the first time, but that seems only natural as film is just another form of story telling. That style of trilogy narrative existed in literature long before that and literature is just the earlier form of telling stories. Star Wars and film didn't change that. They were just the first to really capitalize on it in the film industry.

And very few series break that mold anymore. Either it's a single or a trilogy these days. 

Even for like Harry Potter which basically broke that entire trilogy mold with seven fucking novels and eight films. But even then the story is similar in that it gets more climactic and eventful in the later books where the previous ones do a lot of place setting. The seven part series still follows a very natural story structure. It just chops it up into more pieces.&&Clerks came later&&[deleted]&&Clutch &&Still a god&&What's a queen to the ewoks?&&Why be a queen, when you can be a god?&&somehow C3PO and Trump got invoked at the same time, and a little more childhood innocence died

It was not an equal opportunity upbringing! Plus Uncle Owen was kind of a dick lol&&Yeah, Leia needs to check her privilege. &&Oh my God that was one time lol&&Fuck the haters. R1 was fucking amazing.

Yeah, maybe the characters weren't as memorable as the characters in the core episodes, but that's almost how it should be - the entire movie is a supporting cast and story to the core saga.

But aside from that, the plot was cohesive and original. The cinematography was absolutely *gorgeous* and really conveyed the scale of everything better than any other film in the franchise. The action scenes were fucking *superb.* They took advantage of modern film tech like the PT tried to, but actually told a story with the action rather than just spamming as much flashy shit on screen as possible.

The Battle of Scarif, in my opinion, is one of the finest action sequences/battle climaxes in the history of cinema. It's *long,* but the entire time it is very clearly and effectively portraying a meaningful series of events that is building tension along a specific narrative - and not only that, but tying the importance of action in two locales to one another.

Then everyone fucking *DIES!* In a ""Disney movie!"" I'm sorry, but that was a bold move, even if it made sense.

Yeah, there was a lot of fan-service, but it was fan-service done *right.* It tied in characters and locales, not just for ""hey I recognize that!"" factor, but because it made sense. And it gave me the Rebellion movie I always wanted since growing up on the OT, and the X-wing/TIE Fighter/Dark Forces video games.&&I feel like a lot of people say this, but for me TPM felt the most tedious. The race alone felt like 2 hrs.

Although, the child could have just continued to.play that part instead of Hayden bc Hayden acted like a damn 6 yr old in the other 2 movies. ""Obi Wan would be very grumpy"" like, really George?

Edit: also.TPM was the most Jar Jar movie. Kill me.&&It's all that beer.&&> Like most 3rd acts, maybe everyone back in the day just wanted to pretend it didn't exist.

Or like almost every ancient text it was just lost to time. It also wasn't written by Homer, so it'd be like some shmuck trying to release RotJ before Lucas did.&&I'm pretty positive that they're hinting at a true balance seeing as how the Jedi themselves are a lawful evil inherently lol.

> On his first read-through of the script, Hamill recalled, he got excited when the legendary lightsaber wiggled portentously in the snow. “The moment in the forest, when the saber rattles?” he said. “I go, ‘Oh, baby, here I come!’ And then it flies into her hands? I said, What the hell, she hasn’t even trained!”

Out of all the characters, he is the one people wanted to see the most.&&The more I think about it the more I agree they missed so many opportunities with the three of them back together. Such a precious & iconic trio, all miraculously willing and able to come back after 30 years, and what do they do?: Split Han and Leia up, give them 1x scene together and isolate Luke as some moody hermit who - after disobeying Yoda to go rescue his friends in RoTJ - is content to sulk around on an island dodging porg shit whilst those same friends are in mortal danger and a new Empire is forming. We will never, ever get to see him interact with Han ever again. We might not get to see him interact with Leia ever again (I'm hopefully wrong here).

I enjoyed TFA immensely and I'm super hyped for TLJ, but they really missed some incredibley unique and powerful narrative opportunities with the story they chose. &&After the last jedi is out and the cast doesn't have to keep quiet about the story, I'd love to hear Mark's vision for his character arc and why he disagreed with Johnson's vision. &&They glossed over Hamil’s disagreements with Rian..

Well that makes me nervous.&&> It’s no news that once Hamill signed on for the new trilogy, he had some strong opinions and hearty disagreements over Luke’s minimal involvement in *The Force Awakens* and the direction of his storyline thereafter. Earlier this year Hamill told Vanity Fair he “fundamentally disagree[ed] with every choice” *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson made about Luke, and shared his own pitch for how he envisioned his Jedi would return for the new trio of movies.

Huh. This is a little disconcerting. To be honest, if Hamill wasn't thrilled with the way Episode 7 turned out, then my vision of Star Wars might be more in line with his than with Abrams' or Johnson's.

I'm now honestly more curious about *his* Episode 8 than the one we're actually going to see... I hope he gets a chance to at least talk about his vision at some point. Frankly I'm kinda surprised he went public with his disagreement, though I guess that's old news to many. It just seems like he's almost putting an asterisk on the production: ""This wasn't how I wanted it done, so whatever happens... Don't blame me!"" &&> Earlier this year Hamill told Vanity Fair he “fundamentally disagree[ed] with every choice” The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson made about Luke

Calling it now -- Hamill is right. &&Cool thanks for the thing we already knew two years ago.&&Harrison didn’t care about the legacy, he was happy to do it for the right price, Carrie is a legend who would have done It for the fans regardless and would have been keen for the work (sad but likely true)

Mark cares about Star Wars, he’s not in it for the money, he was obviously conflicted and undershoot that the chance of success was low, or as the global response to the prequels showed, the odds that people would hate it regardless we’re high. 

But once both Harrison and Carrie were signed up he knew he couldn’t be the lone holdout. &&And JJ Abrahams is the reason why we didnt get a Luke Leia Han on screen reunion, thanks JJ!!&&It was actually the paycheck&&Half this article is made up.

>They just forget about Luke for about 45 minutes, until the last ten of the movie.
I would've forgiven it all if Luke had somehow shown up on Starkiller base to rescue Rey. I genuinely thought that's what was going to happen, when Kylo was struggling with the lightsaber. When it flew past him, I thought it was going land in Luke's hands, he'd light up, and say, ""Get away from her you bitch.""

>Wait, wrong sci-fi series...

>Anyway, it would've tied all the plotlines together neatly, there wouldn't have been all the weird stuff at the end, like Leia not hugging Chewie, or Rey piloting the Falcon instead of Chewie, or wondering what Chewie is doing while Rey is climbing up the hill to find Luke. Basically, Chewie is wasted at the end of the movie.

It's practically like me and u/RealMarkHamill are besties!&&Luke intervening there would have been really fucking awesome, just absolutely kicking Kylo's ass but being forced to disengage to save Rey&&Have never read that interview, thanks!

Although this quote: 

> Likewise, after reading Rian Johnson’s script for The Last Jedi, Hamill said, “I at one point had to say to Rian, ‘I pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice you’ve made for this character. Now, having said that, I have gotten it off my chest, and my job now is to take what you’ve created and do my best to realize your vision.’ ”

Makes me extremely nervous... This sounds like they've fucked up Luke's character. There were a few bits in the trailer where I thought ""Nah that's just misdirection, they wouldn't do *that* to Luke. No I'm not so sure :/&&That’s EXACTLY what I don’t like about rey, anakin skywalker, the guy that was yoda level of ~~thelomeres~~midiclorians as a child? Had to train for like 10 years to get master level. Luke had to train for like 3 years and he was not even close to vader. Then rey comes in and she mindfucks a trooper first shot? Nah that’s a mary sue if I’ve ever seen one, that’s what made these movies regular for me. Love the saga, love finn but rey man she’s just badly written. 

Also mark’s suggestion of him being the one stopping kylo sounds a billion times cooler.

Edit: fucked up a term.&&ha! even *he* doesn't buy the Rey can't do no wrong story. &&I'm still hoping they did, and we will see that in a flashback.&&I would go as far as to say Luke's best friend is Artoo, not Han.&&If you really think about it though, Luke and Han don't spend all that much time together.&&Well it ain't gonna happen in 9 if it don't happen in 8&&Harrison is on a farewell tour and it makes me sad.

The idea of the headline is to make someone interested in the article and give him reason to read it, if I see ""Luke Skywalker speaks"" it doesn't grab me as much as ""Harrison Ford was the reason Mark Hamill returned"". &&Hammill himself has said he likes what Rian ended up doing it just wasn't what he pictured&&That's not what Hamill meant when he said he disagreed with where Rian took Luke. 

Mark had a specific view where Luke would be post-RotJ, which was exactly the same character with no changes over the 30 years. He's said as much and how it was difficult for him to separate his ideas from where they were actually going with the character but in the end he agrees with Rian and is satisfied with the movie. &&Compromise is a part of the creative process when working in a collaborative art form like cinema and arguably vital to good filmmaking. When you surround a creative source with only yes men, you can quickly wind up with output that contains good ideas that poorly executed and/or lacking needed refinement. The prequels are an unfortunate example of this. Lots of interesting concepts / imagery buried in a bloated and clunky mess without any collaboration or compromise.&&Right?!

I mean, he’s just the man who embodied Luke Skywalker, has lived and breathed Luke Skywalker along with the rest of us, fallen in love with him and his space compatriots with the rest of us, raised his own children in the legacy of Star Wars, and this new guy dares to assert that he knows better the trajectory of his character? The one he’s known for 40 years? ...but I’m sure this new guy has super-great ideas.

Mark, your turn as the toy-collector in Spielberg’s amazing stories was enough to prove forever that Star Wars was more that just a movie to you, too. Thank you for being a steward of my childhood, and all our childhoods. &&boy i just feel the sunshine from here.&&Not everything has to be a fan service.

I enjoyed the movie a lot but stayed away from elaborate discussions so I didn't realize that others noted this glaring oversight.  The way he says it, it seems like it's become conventional wisdom since but in the first couple of weeks of the movie's release, I couldn't find any reference to it. 

This is the most significant issue I had with the film, a betrayal of established characters in favor of new one who didn't earn the moment. It's one of those writing decisions that make you wonder how dozens of people have read this thing and watched early cuts and no one objected enough to change it. How?&&Yes, and it would have made Kylo a badass if only Luke could stand up to him. So much wasted potential.&&I can't see how they would have explained him onto Starkiller Base, though.&&But that's not a deus ex machina!&&>Had to train for like 10 years to get **master level**

Maybe not hollywood in general, but within the context of a Star Wars sequel?  Much harder to pull that off without Luke than without Han.&&No, you are right that Hamill does not have the Hollywood prestige like Ford does, but Hamill literally have the most iconic role in the entire Star Wars universe. The original trilogy was Luke's story, as he is the main protagonist of that trilogy. It would be bloody hard to build a sequel upon that, with him being the last Jedi, without being able to use Mark Hamill.

In fact, I think having a sequel trilogy without Luke at all would have caused an uproar. Fans were already disappointed that Luke appeared only at the end in VII, imagine if he never showed up in any of the three movies? At least now we knows that he will feature heavily in VIII, and hopefully also in IX.&&Big Red One is great! One of my favorite movie exchanges:



Johnson: Would you look at how fast they put up the names of all our guys who got killed?



The Sergeant: That's a World War One memorial.



Johnson: But the names are the same.



The Sergeant: They always are.&&>but he's far far from Ford's catalogue in terms of negotiating power.

Not in Star Wars, he isn't.&&Don't forget C**k Knocker.&&But I god damn loved professa Arnold. &&Hamill has said he disagrees completely with the direction they are taking the character in. &&Why would they be? Dudes an actor, he's not supposed to write anything. &&Some movie watchers reported having blinked during Episode 7 and missing Luke.&&He's been requesting that Han gets killed off since Episode V IIRC. The only reason it finally happened is because Lucas is no longer there to say no.&&Hamill also said his tweet, which revealed that the trailer would air during Monday Night Football, was a ""poor joke."" Then a few weeks later... there was a trailer.

The great thing about Mark is he's a fan and he is unusually genuine in his words (for a big-time actor), so he speaks his mind. This smells like more Disney Damage Control™ to me, but only time will tell.&&Yea, I imagine Hammill's version would have been a lot more fan-servicey

which isn't a bad thing, but the impact of his one scene at the very end was one of my favorite parts of the movie.&&Yeah, he's sort of had 30 years to daydream about the character from a point of view than no one else has. &&> which was exactly the same character with no changes over the 30 years. 

Is that what he really said? 

He was most likely disappointed by how Luke went from relentless hero to rage-quitting hermit. It was certainly not the expected evolution of his character.&&Compromise means half happy&&To me it doesnt make any sense. Why bring them back at all if you didnt at least plan to sort of do a catch up scene where you see what your characters have been up to all this time.  
  
Besides Luke, you dont need Han or Leia to make 7 work. Leia literally does nothing and Han can literally be played by some random dude with his wookie companion I guess or some other companion of whatever race you choose. Now sure you can say 'but theyre kylo's parents!' Yeah but so what? Luke can tell you that in a nice short exposition scene which im sure we'll get in the next movie where he explains how he fucked up or how Kylo got pulled into the dark side etc.  
  
You can just say Han and Leia are living out in space doing what they want or they died due to whatever reason.&&When the film was over, I actually said to my friend, ""Did it seem like we watched 'Star Wars' again, just with different characters and scenery?  A lot of the same lines and same plot points, in the same order?""  I actually never want to see it recreated again.  And I *don't* want to see a movie in which the Kylo Ren / Rey confrontation and Luke / Snoke confrontation look and feel like the confrontations between Obi Wan and Vader, and Luke and Vader.&&I wouldn't consider it fan service, it would helped a stronger set up for the whole trilogy, a last Luke Han goodbye would have been epic given Han's death, in the movie his death is almost meaningless IMO

I really liked the Thrawn trilogy books - something like that would have been cool. An admiral taking the lead of remaining imperial forces and coming up with some clever crazy/desperate strategy for defeating the republic. Something that's not already been done in the other films.

I'm not Hamill so I can't say for sure what he thinks, that's just the impression he's given me.&&In particular he seemed annoyed by the fact that Luke was a no-show when Han died. When Luke literally threw away everything to save his friends in the past, he simply can't justify Luke sitting around doing nothing at all when his best friend is killed.&&I just happened to watch the extended version last night, and JJ directly addresses this.  Basically, he didn't want E7 to be a story about Luke, Leia, and Han (even though the entire overarcing story is finding Luke).  Instead, he wanted it to be a generational handoff and be a story about Rey, Finn, and Kylo.

Similar plot structure and conflicts. The hope is that was nothing more than to recapture a new audience and then pull a solid, more original Empire Strikes Back.&&>Plus an interaction between the three would have shown us how their characters grew after all those years, in the movie it seems like they were frozen in time

He's not just a director, he's one of Hollywood's most consistent producers for both film and television.&&He's good at making shallow blockbusters. That's all your typical moviegoer needs: a shallow blockbuster. Thus, his movies always bring a lot of money in so he gets to be known as a success.

Most of the earlier interviews with him showed how much he actually cared for that character (although he felt the dialogue was clunky at best - but it worked). It's just that he felt the story arc was completed. 

Its like a singer that has a hit, and for the next couple of years, every time the singer comes on stage they have to sing that same damned song. After a while the singer ""hates"" that song. But they really don't. They just hate being a trained monkey that has to dance for you every time the subject is brought up. Ford felt the same way about Han.

When he wasn't flying around, being a hotshot pilot, he ventured out in search of Jedi artifacts like holocrons, which gave him insight into the nature of The Force. His proficiency with force powers stems more from the fact that he is a conduit for The Force than actual training.

Skywalkers are natural conduits for the Force, that's one of the major themes throughout the entire series. Luke became powerful with little training because of Anakin's unique connection with the Force. If Rey's parentage rumors are true, there's a reason why she's so powerful in the Force: Her grandfather was literally Force-Jesus.&&Maybe they can add that in when they re-release with a musical number by an ugly alien.&&Ah, good to know.

&&lol, I love Mark Hamill so much for doing this scene. ""You're not gonna upstage me, Van Der Beek!""&&From what I understand from all the times he's spoken about it, he wanted Luke to take several of the roles that they gave to Rey so that they could add some proper closure to the relationships of the original team as well as preventing Rey from being such a massive mary-sue.

For example, instead of Rey catching the Lightsaber during the final duel with Kylo, he wanted Luke to be the one to take the saber and whup Kylo's ass. He also felt that Luke should have been there when Han died, since he doesn't believe Luke is the kind of person to run off and be angsty while his friends are in danger.

If the next movies follow this pattern, then it's likely that he's upset because the old cast aren't getting enough respect.&&That would be awesome! Then you could have called it 

STAR WARS EPISODE VII: COOL HAN LUKE&&I think hamill probably wanted a little more ""just like the old days"" stuff for the sequel trilogy. Probably a big scene where Han leia Chewie and him all fight stormtroopers again, but I won't really judge the story until I see it&&I remember a YouTube vid of a Q&A at a con and Hamil said as he read the script he was waiting for his big entrance. He got to the part where his blue saber was shaking in the snow as Kylo went for it and when it flung out he expected it was he, Skywalker, who summoned it and arrived on the planet. Luke sensed Han and Chewie were in danger like in ESB and came out of hiding to aid them. He expected he was going to have a duel with Kylo and then escape afterward with Rey, Finn, and Chewie.

I really like that idea. But I'm happy they gave Rey her moment. She's the new heroine, yo have Luke come in and save her would have been detriment to her character and the story in general.&&That's fair I guess. &&Honestly, this is one of the (many) things which pissed me off about TFA - they had so many great stories they could at least draw inspiration from in the form of the EU, and they just decided to rehash episode 4 with added Mary Sue and worse inter-character relationships.&&Well it's not like he could be a worse writer than JJ Abrams.&&Honestly, I dont think the Farce Awakens will age well.

Tom Cruise doesn't make 30 mill because he's the best actor around, but because of brand recognition. You could easily find a better actor who'd do it for 50 grand, but then you'd have to spend 50 mill more on marketing to get even close to the mindshare that a new Tom Cruise movie gets.&&Yes. As a general life rule the higher you get on 'the totem pole' the less the clock actually matters; Pay checks start coming with certain expectations. Well known actors aren't just paid millions for their acting ability but also their brand.

Huh, why in the world would he think that? It's not like he deliberately went against Yoda's wishes and fought Vader to save his friends in Empire.

Oh, wait...&&>  example, instead of Rey catching the Lightsaber during the final duel with Kylo, he wanted Luke to be the one to take the saber and whup Kylo's ass

The quote you're referring to, IMO, didn't mean he wanted to fight kylo .. only that when the saber wiggles in the snow he assumed it was going to be him who took it, because Rey hadn't even trained and he didn't think she could be that powerful. &&> he wanted Luke to be the one to take the saber and whup Kylo's ass. 

Oh my God, I just realized how epic that would have been...
&&That would have been seven layers of badassery and a lot better. &&I feel like he's missing the fact that it's been 30 years and Luke could have changed. I disntinctly got the impression that Luke had been through some shit and felt like trying only made it worse. It's the only reason he'd bail. It's like if Batman suddenly realized he was the reason Gotham is so fucked up.&&I've heard Mark say he *thought* he was going to be the one to catch the ightsaber during the duel but I never heard him say he *wanted* that to happen.

Another thing I do recall is for some of those ""making of Star Wars' that came out in the 90s for the rerelease, Mark said he wasted RotJ Luke to have a cool haircut and badass scar - so maybe his vision for the character was always more ""I wanna be cool"" or something :/&&...I'll allow it.&&WHAT WE HAVE HERE... IS A FAILURE TO DISINTEGRATE&&I definitely wanted a better goodbye to the characters with them interacting with each other, and now we'll never get it :(&&She had no saber training though.

They should have caused Kylo to lose his saber, and then he uses a regular weapon, while Rey had basically something similar to her staff. and then we see them fight and Rey wins.
&&FUCK, this would have made so much more sense and pulled the plot together better.

I love Rey, but she would have gotten straight wrecked by Kylo with no saber training at all.

The fact that she could fly the Millenium Falcon so flawlessly despite never having seen it before and having (I believe) no prior knowledge on how to fly a ship.

The fact that she knew about the quirks and mechanical failures of the Millenium Falcon better than Han, despite having only used the ship for about a day.

The fact that she overpowered a trained and powerful dark force user MULTIPLE TIMES despite not even knowing what the force was.

I really like the idea of the new trilogy having a female protagonist, but Rey is a shit one.&&Now that's a theory.  &&If the saber was something that acted like anything else in the world, I would agree.

The weapon literally cuts through anything but another saber, and you definitely need training for that shit.

Which is why i suggest kylo loses it.  Then we have a wounded, trained jedi, fighting a person who has the force, but lacks the training, but is trained with a staff.

RemindMe! 2 Months&&Regardless of how you feel about her appearance in R1, Disney still has *lots* of time to go back and ""remaster"" some ""special editions.""&&Thank you. I had the exact same feeling while rewatching TFA a few days ago. And it's not just Rey. All of the core 3 characters (Finn, Poe, Rey) are massively overpowered and seem to get their way with no threat or danger. Finn somehow knows how to wield a lightsaber in his first battle and is even able to duel Kylo despite being a ""non-force user"". Poe is able to take out 20 tie fighters and storm troopers within the span of seconds, and then hits all 8 cylinders in starkiller base with lightning fast speed and precision. Rey meanwhile can fly the falcon, use the force and wield a lightsaber well enough to defeat kylo ren on her first try. 

The whole movie is just ridiculous. Leia ignoring Chewie is the least of the crap that's in there. You have captain Phasma getting taken down in the span of 2 seconds by Finn and then gives up the shield to the entire base without any retaliation. You have Rey climbing around the walls of the starkiller base in a wide open area and the only people who see her are Finn and Han. You have the first order which is able to blow up 6 planets at once, and then struggles to fight off a tiny group of x wings. Finally you have kylo ren who can stop a laser in mid air, but apparently can't beat Rey in either force manipulation or lightsaber skills. &&You would also think Luke could have spared 15 minutes teaching Leia to become a full-fledged Jedi at some point during the last 40 years if the process was so fast.&&It sure is one theory all right.&&I can get with that idea, yeah.&&I hope you meant engrossed.

I still love the one I got the day I went.

Not trying to be snarky here, but this looks like a cheap/rushed bit of fan art. The proportioning alone should've been something that stopped this from going out the door. 

**I'm not hating on the artist, the style itself is super cool**, and there's a ton of potential here. But we're talking about the top-grossing series of films of all time.

The others had a better sense of contrast and concept. This would be better without the poor silhouette in the distance. He uses that technique in the other posters to achieve depth, but here I feel Rey is too important to have relegated to a poorly formed shadow. Plus it competes with the foreground too much, since it's dead center. Of course, this is still a professional poster, it's just my opinion that it is just a hair lower in quality than some of the others.&&This is really great, I love the textures on everything and the colors&&Take a look at those colours!

&&I'm guessing it will be a long training scene, excactly as in Empire Strikes Back...&&The trailer looks good but I'm a bit scared. 


Force was such a ANH carbon copy that, with this one essentially starting with Luke (Yoda) training Rey (Luke) and being scared of her power, I'm really afraid of an Empire rip-off where she gets frustrated with training, leaves before she's done to help her friends (bespin) and the Kylo (Vader) tries to recruit her. 

After Force what scares me most about this franchise is their ability to write original stories instead of always the same fucking story lines with the same families. 

It's a Galaxy far far away with trillions of inhabitants and we're supposed to believe it all only revolves around this one guy (anakin) and his legacy? &&LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSI-NESS!!!&&Well, she has to defeat the Huns somehow. &&if Rey doesn't get whacked by Luke's cane some time during the training montage, i'll be very sad&&Don’t like how they are portraying Luke as a hermit who doesn’t want to be involved in anything. He should have been a qui gon type character.&&Not me.&&Have you seen Rocky IV? It gets old.&&I think it's likely that Rey goes to Kylo as an attempt to learn as well as be a double agent of sorts which will happen toward the beginning.

Shitty is a harsh word.&&Wow his work is awesome &&Shitty? Pfft. His new reimagining for The Black Dahlia Murder's *Nocturnal* is fucking amazing. &&I'm gonna be ""that guy"" and say I don't really think his work fits as official Star Wars material. It has too much of a fan-art feel to it, even his other movie work - I could see it being sold at like a fan-convention type of event, but I just can't get into any of his movie pieces. His stuff works in like a metalcore context, and as fan-art graphic stuff, and hell, I think it could work for the right movie (more like some campy gore-fest like Wolf Cop) but it just feels really weird to me as a Star Wars poster.

If it's just like a limited edition IMAX poster, then I'm less bothered by it, and at least they're going out of their way to commission artists outside of the regular film studio graphic designers. I do enjoy seeing alternative posters and covers from some other artists. &&Since when is Sikth a shitty metalcore band?&&He did a lot more than shitty bands though. &&I've been of his since those days.

That illustration is seriously horrendous. &&I'm not going crazy, there's totally a rock solid peen in there&&Looks like a Bad Dragon dick and balls. &&Can't believe I had to scroll this far down to see the penis comment. &&Let's hope Rey can construct a rudimentary lathe.&&It's the same guy [Dan Mumford](http://www.dan-mumford.com/) which is pretty cool

[Also someone recolored the blue Kylo/Finn one it looks cool in grey](http://i.imgur.com/kfMvjJN.jpg)

edit: to be honest though I really prefer the originals to this new one.   I love Dan Mumford's work but I feel like there's not much color harmony in this new poster, it might look better with a different set of colors and a lighter black for the outlines.  In the TFA posters, for example, they each have a simple color gradient and there isn't any use of really dark black for outlines.

edit2:  Here's what I mean.  I just did a little recoloring in PS and while I know Blue-Orange has been done to death, it still works better than the Pale Green-Yellow/Orange here imo.

So here's a [Blue to Orange version with the Black lightened up and tinted a little bit](https://i.imgur.com/Y03HSt2.jpg), feels less harsh on the eyes to me.

edit3: [red-green version works too](https://i.imgur.com/FsqszsV.jpg) suggested by my dude u/DoctorSteve&&Yeah, it's the same guy&&Very Dune. Or Pern. &&[deleted]&&""of the character in the background"" uh... you mean Rey?&&Looks like bad comic book art.&&A lot of people complaining here and I don't get it. It's beautiful! 

The funny thing is, if this actually *were* a fan poster, Reddit would be all over this shit saying the artist deserves more attention and should be the official artist. 

&&I mean, at what point does official and fan made differ, if they are both made by professionals? Have you not heard of stylized art?&&Oh jeez, I.. I.. I.. knew it&&I don't like it either. I think it's getting praise for being both Star Wars and being different, but I think it looks a bit clumsy and the colour scheme is a bit off. And I don't know what is supposed to be going on in the background, is she fencing against nothing?&&The lightsaber imo. It’s just way off. Her silhouette is...ok? It’s like the first one you’d come to and move on to a different one. The look of the saber and her scale and her silhouette are really taking away from the stunning foreground. Am illustrator. &&I have to agree. Beyond the fact that it doesn't really look all that great, there's really nothing about it that says ""Star Wars"" to me besides the obvious title and the light saber.&&yeah that looks really...amateur&&Looks like amateur fan art, tbh.&&Its a somewhat minimalist fan art style, which is pretty common these days for the imax poster variant.  They might have a whole series of them like they did with Force Awakens.&&I think it looks like shit and loses all Star Wars vibes.&&It's because it is. Intuition is the judge and jury for tackiness.&&Yup, it is not even remotely impressive to me.

&&It looks like they got a silhouette of Rey and just stamped it on. &&The badly drawn figure in the background?&&Don't insult mtg card art.&&I have to agree here, this is very weak&&Yeah, I was surprised the top voted comments are so positive on this. It looks pretty lame. Rey in the background is almost laughable looking.&&I saw the same thing. &&Same thing you did in the last movie. Magically win because of bullshit.

He's a trained sith who could choke you from across the room and having zero training you would not even be able to stop it.

Not the whole galaxy, no. But the Star Wars stories were always intended to be the saga about the Skywalkers.

The anthology stories are meant to be about stuff that isn't the main story of the series.&&They did a good job with the Force Awakens trailers to not give away too much story.  My guess is the trailer makes it seem that Kylo is reaching out to Rey, but it is really cuts from 2 different scenes and he is actually reaching out to someone else.&&I understand the fear and I do think Last Jedi will adopt the darker mid-trilogy feel but the actors have said this movie has taken an unexpected direction. I would expect something more shocking like Rey giving into the dark side, or Luke going Grey.  
  
Understand, Star Wars 7 was one of the most anticipated and criticized ""reboot"" ever. They had to appease the disenfranchised original trilogy lovers so they went with a nostalgic recipe they knew would work. If 7 did well, inspiring nostalgia whole introducing new characters, that gives the artistic freedom to take these new characters wherever they want after, even so far as disowning the chosen one prophecy and the balanced force philosophy.&&I felt the same way about The Force Awakens; in my opinion it was a pretty average movie.

But I absolutely loved Rogue One, and thought it was a great concept with fantastic execution (okay, characterisation could have been better), so I'm not nearly as worried as I was after Force.&&People always bring this up but ok Abrams said over and over why he made it so similar. People were so butthurt about the prequel trilogy, so he made this movie so similar. He has also stated that the last Jedi will not be a copy of esb&&It's okay, I'm waiting for the inevitable Star Wars reboot in 2050.&&I think their main saga movies will tread too carefully for their own detriment. I don't see them trying to try anything new, or breaking out of any established formulas. The movies will be good, but I don't expect them to be great and I don't expect any major ""I am your father"" level moments sadly. With Rogue one they showed the ability to come up with a great story that Disney was okay with, that ended in tragedy and still left you satisfied that you had watched a good movie. The problem is though, that was a expanded story, not the main line and the main line of movies and Disney's ability to okay something that all kids might not understand is where I think the story is will fall flat.&&It's almost like he is a prophetic person, destined to affect the galaxy &&I thought it was pretty well established that they played TFA close to home so fans would feel at ease.

I don't believe for a second that they're going to rehash Empire with The Last Jedi.&&lol that's what the whole thing is about though. Yea there's other inhabitants but Star Wars focuses on Luke, Anikan and co. That's the point. &&If anyone is a central character in these films is R2-D2; maybe C-3PO.

The universe does not revolve around the Skywalkers.&&I knew I recognized the style from somewhere!!! Homesick is a masterpiece I never grew out of&&He also did one variation of the Plagues cover for TDWP&&Started following him on Insta after falling in love with the Deep Blue album artwork.

My wife has a full sleeve of all the artwork from the Homesick album and it's always fun to stare at.&&Knew instantly what you were referring to when you dropped the name Homesick. &&“Shitty UK metalcore band”....you name the two biggest metalcore acts around who are from Aussie and USA. &&ADTR has been my favorite band since about 8th grade right before FTWHH came out and I got a Homesick vibe from this but had no idea that is so awesome! &&Shut up he did not do ADTR’s album cover did he?!! That’s my favorite album of all time&&A day to remember ?&&Homesick was theeeee summer album of 2009. (came out in February I know, but that's when people in my area really became ingrained in it.)&&Did quite a bit for Protest the Hero as well back in 2010-2011. This is one of my all-time favorite shirts https://i.pinimg.com/736x/2c/4e/35/2c4e35f47bfb01cdd47d0fb7aae97bda--dan-mumford-sea-monsters.jpg&&I knew it immediately. Thats incredible i saw this and went i know this is metalcore album art, and of Course this artist did two of the best album covers in the metalcore game. &&You should come over to r/metalcore. We have a good time there =) &&Deep Blue!&&He also did some artwork for Gallows, I think when they released 'In the Belly of a Shark'. I have one that I still need to frame.&&When I saw this poster I thought it was very Homesick-esque. This explains why!&&I remember seeing parkway open up for adtr in austin. That show can never be topped in my opinion!&&I've outgrown all my shirts (literally and figuratively) but I still have one of his prints from a TBDM tour up on my wall. It's a woman being eviscerated with the tour dates written in her guts so is pretty out of place with my other pieces but I still love it. &&I felt like his art just became the go-to for 2010s ""core"" bands, to the point where if you walked into any given alternative club, half the dudes there were wearing Dan Mumford tees, and most of the girls too. Shame cos I loved his early stuff for bands like Gallows and BDM, but it just out of hand.&&I love this art style, so of course it's going on my background&&I have a big a2 print in my room but just tore it the other day, it kept falling on the floor etc and now its fucked, should of framed it&&Cry for Silence! This thread has taken me down memory lane. &&[deleted]&&I think they were calling the bands shitty, not the artwork.&&The Black Dahlia Murder aren't a UK metalcore band...

&&I agree. I don't think it works within the star wars 'brand', but that doesn't mean I don't like it, or detract from the fact that Star Wars is going out on a limb and giving an independent artist a shot at creating something new for the franchise. &&Its a bit flat and lacks the feel of interaction between the two characters. And I mean visual interaction. Luke seems like he's just like ""yup"" and Rey is too simply drawn, as if traced.  
You can tell dude loves to texture rocks and water and clouds but isn't quite as engaged with characters and composition. &&Yea...quite a few metal bands he did artwork for who were indeed not shitty. &&Agreed, what the fuck. Sikth has more talent than 95% of any other musical groups performing right now.  &&***Do not***&&Someone had to go there, I guess.&&owo&&She's roughly half the size of the rock, which is consistent with the trailers. &&May the force be with us all.&&Sweet, new mobile wallpaper. Thanks!&&Can I get one with the Star Wars logo text but without the fine print in the corners? :)&&Link?&&A Lathe?!  

Get off the line Guy!&&Every one of these posters say AMC on the bottom left. I wonder if these were specially made for AMC only or did other theater chains get them as well?&&It's been there for over 4 hours. Should probably get to a hospital &&Semantics.&&Are we even sure? Scale-wise that background figure would be a giant.&&[deleted]&&Just looks really organic and sloppy. Nothing epic about it. It's crazy the shit people will buy.&&Did you watch the trailer? She's training and he is frightened by her power.&&Yo I had the seem feelings about the color scheme, [here's a version](https://i.imgur.com/Y03HSt2.jpg) with the lighter blacks and a Blue-to-Orange instead of a Green-to-Orange

I can see the flaws in my version, especially how hard it is to see Rey's lightsaber, but I feel like it's easier on the eyes.&&I think because all the terrain around her has detail but she doesn’t so it looks like she doesn’t fit there&&Something about it makes me think that you are right. It fits hit style much better without the Rey figure - I wonder if marketing insisted it was added after the art was already done?&&Dont misunderstand me, it would be a beautiful mtg card. But it makes for a whack movie poster. &&Could be worse you could be promoted to a captain with no experience and on your first mission and the others who have served for years would be ok. &&His style barely evolved over the last decade though. I love his art but I wish he'd get out of his comfort zone a bit more.&&WHAT! That's so cool!&&Kinda! Last time they revealed all four then said specific dates when they will be available for people who see it in IMAX (I think it was Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun).&&So is Mace Windu the poor redditor who gets hit by the downvote bandwagon?&&KARMA NED! ON AN OPEN FIELD!&&From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.&&*YOUR* PERSPECTIVE, ANAKIN?&&I wouldn't mind seeing it as a pin up in the back of a comic but not the poster for the IMAX version.
&&You can't expect everyone to enjoy everything. You like stuff some people don't like, and dislike stuff other people like. It's natural.&&I think it's so you can actually see someone.&&YOU SORRY BUNCH OF HIPPIES&&I bought them off eBay in the months after TFA. Some sellers would bundle all four for like $25 which isn't too bad. &&I ended up getting the [Poe](https://6a25bbd04bd33b8a843e-9626a8b6c7858057941524bfdad5f5b0.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/bf840e43499e568ea75c3712e293f778.jpg) one off a seller on eBay. Not a fan of 3D movies so I didn't bothers seeing TFA in IMAX but I really wanted that poster. I think it cost me like $8 at the time. &&I have them. You want em? They're just collecting dust. &&This log had a child&&Mm ha, mm mm ha!&&Down to the beach I'm strollin'.&&That username.....and that sentence, just no.&&Mask on, mask off&&Clap on, clap off&&[deleted]&&I can't wait for the scene where Finn gets frozen in carbonite. &&Yup. That's why they're doing the spin-offs too. To see other stories besides the Skywalkers'.

edit: grammar &&yeah, like a Han Solo movie and Ben Kenobo movie.  Really expanding the universe.&&Fair enough, but even then, do the stories of all Skywalkers have to be exact structural copies each time? &&Reaching out to Finn?!&&I understand WHY they did 7 this way. What I'm saying is, they could have achieved this without it being a carbon copy. Orphan living on desert planet finds a robot that leads it to the rebels, meets an unlikely mentor, and goes on to destroy a death star. Come on. &&I agree. Rogue One was great. The characters were meant to be a bit shaken. A rag tag collection. I hate big actors filling roles like that, because you keep seeing the actor, not the role. Part 8 has me worried though. They will throw some curveballs, but the AT-AT's and the speeders, c'mon. They only give me bad feeling vibes. &&Agreed. Rogue one is full of flaws, including gaping plot holes, but so did all the other star wars films. At least they went an original direction: a darker, more mature tale about war and sacrifice and that's why it'd my favorite star wars to date. &&> He has also stated that the last Jedi will not be a copy of esb

The ~~Rebel~~ Resistance ~~snow~~ ski speeders attacking ~~Empire~~ First Order AT-ATs aren't doing much to alleviate these suspicions. &&Just saw ADTR this weekend, can confirm: *Homesick* kicks ass&&I feel like the art for that album is as memorable as the music, Its really great. &&Did anyone else notice [this bearded old man's face](https://screenshots.firefoxusercontent.com/images/09af2a20-b982-41cb-a914-ae3a2905a778.png) in the rock?&&The good one&&so GOOD&&Best metalcore album imo. Fuck me. I miss old parkway&&I'm 100% on board with getting a Dan Mumford style tattoo-any chance you could share a pic of that?&&Yeah, I couldn’t place the style then all of a sudden DUNNA DUNNA DUNNA DUNNA DUNNA DUNNA. LETS GO&&I don't think he meant that those bands are the ""shitty UK band"", but just that dan mumford also did the covers for those bands&&I’m always there &&The [Gallows](https://eviltender.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/GALLOWS1.jpg) stuff was awesome. In fact, all of it is, but I agree it was everywhere as if he were the only artist in hardcore.&&Probably $15,000ish+ at the least. For a well designed magazine cover for a big brand you're talking $1,000-3,000 or so. Add to the fact that this is Disney (so they want the ""best"") and that he's a pretty established artists that's pretty recognizable.&&$300000000.72&&I know. I took the comment as a mark against his frequent work with metal bands in general. ""Shitty UK metalcore bands"" is pretty specific considering he's been doing work for metalcore bands in general, UK, US, and Aus, for a very long time at this point. &&Or, you know, **DO**. Just as long as you don't just like, *try* to do it. Or try to don't do it. Whatever, I'm not your supervisor.&&There is no try.&&It's thanks to people like you that I am reminded to the fact that I can update my wallpapers when I come across nice art.

I never seem to consider it before someone else claims to do it, but once I see the comment, I realize it'll make a perfect wallpaper.&&It’s perfect for iOS. Nothing clashes with the time.&&[Here you go.

Ray looks too big and also kinda photoshopped in - something about her feet and how they touch the ground she's on. 

But I still really like the artwork!&&Yeah you should be able to appreciate that without seeing the trailer though&&But she doesn't really look like she's training. There should be more happening. And it doesn't look like Luke is scared of her power he looks like he's just watching from afar.

The other three were from a separate seller and said they got delivered but never did. Bummer. &&I hate Brenda!&&Someday, when you're older

You could be hit by a boulder!&&Force on... force more on ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&The thing is the only people who hated that about The Force Awakens are Star Wars fans. The sad truth is that the vast majority of movie goers probably haven't watched Star Wars since they were a kid or for the older generation since it was in theaters for the first time. The decision to just rehash the story beats of the originals is one that caters to the larger paying group of people who aren't super invested in the Star Wars series but it tends to burn the mega-fans. &&> Skywalkers'

&&Give it time I'm sure they're just testing the waters. Rogue One did a great job at telling a new story with a comfortable timeframe for a setting. I'm sure that the Han Solo movie will be decent and the Kenobi movie has potential to be amazing. In time we'll probably start seeing some movies from before the prequels, etc.&&They need to do a Knights of the Old Republic movie.&&Ken Bonobo&&Solo I'm not too stoked on but if they pull off a Kenobi movie right it could rival the original trilogy in terms of awesomeness.&&I'm hopeful for TLJ to not be too similar to ESB. We'll see but I have a lot of faith in Rian Johnson.

&&I was okay with everything until Star Killer base blowing up planets and them blowing it up with like that trench run... Everything else I was fine with and thought they did well with it. I still wish it was more original of course but I wasn't bothered until the execution of Starkiller. If it was a base with defenses like a raped planet and all I would be happy cause that's awesome. But it was way too Death-Star-y and *then* they blow it up so it was just way too much of a re-hash. But then again RotJ did it too. &&And even if this one's good we have J. J. ""Literally A New Hope"" Abrams on the next one; Star Wars: Return of the Lens Flare"".&&Seeing them Sunday and I CANNOT WAIT.

I recently got a full print of the Homesick artwork &&dadadada dada dadada da-da...&&Was there also, they were AWESOME!&&I remember seeing them play at small church in 2005. It's awesome to see bands progress.&&Columbus on Friday WOO WOOO&&SELF HELP&&whoa where’d you see them? they were in my town on friday!&&literally seeing them tomorrow! Ive never actually listened to ADTR before this week though, going for mooseblood, but it's cool to see this little connection here  
&&I loved how raw and stripped back it was compared to Killing With A Smile and Horizons. It really fit the narrative of the album. Absolutely by far their best album (although, Horizons is my fave based on purely sentimental reasons). &&I'll try to remember to take one this evening for you and I'll post it here.

I'm an artist in the poster world. I did an official tour poster for Metallica this summer and got $500 and copies to sell.

I'd be shocked if Dan got more than a few grand for this piece. There's a reason it's hard to make a living doing art.&&+/- 000&&He was calling the bands shitty&&Yes it was specific, because that's how he started before working up to big US bands and now Star Wars.&&This freedom gets ruined with wife and kids.... i forget what its like to have anything other than pics of them for backgrounds and lockscreens&&What?

I noticed the yellow accents on the rocks do stick out a bit so I lumped them in with the redness.

The green could use a little more tweaking on my part but I like the red-green scheme a lot&&... then&&GET ME THE KARMA STRETCHER!&&Or save this image, use a canvas like site and pay $10 to have this baby on canvas. &&Wow took a quick look at ebay and someone is selling a set of the 4 TFA ones for $75 now&&Now breathe...&&I don't think that die-hard fans of SW necessarily hate TFA, the thing about fan bases is that they often have each their own view of how their product should be run and end up disappointed when it doesn't end up how they wanted.

I don't know how hard in the fanbase spectrum I'm at, but I kinda agreed with most of the decisions made in The Force Awakens. I get it why people get upset arguing that it's a reskin of A New Hope. However, even in the OT, destiny and recurrence through the force were big themes in the Star Wars universe, and while for some people it may be a bit cheap to hit so much of the same beats in TFA, I think that it was solid movie to show to people what the new Star Wars triology is, and how it won't make the same mistakes as the prequels.

Just to continue my rant, I also loved the idea of main movies and spin-offs model, because for me it mean that they could play somewhat safe in the main movies and go wild exploring new themes in spin-offs. Which is why I was kinda let down with Rogue One, I don't know if they should've chosen another story of if they should've tackled it in a different way, but it was to me the least compelling SW movie.&&I don't think it's Star Wars fans who hated that about TFA. I've adored Star Wars since I was a small child and I LOVE TFA. I think some people viewed it as a legitimate issue and others just like to hate popular stuff.  
Personally, I think the third act falters a bit, but I'm also excited to see where the story goes. I think TFA was a solid foundation to build on. No matter what there will be comparisons to Empire. I just hope it's not because it follows the same structure. &&My own annoyance came from the feeling that TFA didn't feel like a canon Star Wars universe to me, and doesn't feel worthy to be Episode 7 of one of the greatest sci-fis of all time. 

It just feels like Disney hit the greatest jackpot ever, and is taking advantage of the Star Wars brand to sell Kylo Ren sabers and BB-8's. I mean come on, BB-8 is so obviously there to sell BB-8 toys to people. Rey is there to cater to female viewers, Fynn for black audiences, which is respectable but so obvious. Everything is there to go ""THIS IS STAR WARS!"" but not give die-hard Star Wars fans, familiar with the lore a good continuing after Return of the Jedi. It's so forced (pun intended)

Somehow Luke is a myth now, despite saving the universe and being all over the news for his heroics... Han Solo was a war hero, but for some reason he's delivering monsters on a giant cargo space ship coincidently near Jakku as his way of grieving for raising a dumb kid, the force is almost a myth again, the stories so far seem too close to the original films, I could go on. But do you see what I mean when I say the film doesn't feel official to me? an official Star Wars movie would continue without repeating the same shit. I mean, just look at the prequels... say what you will about them, but they did a good job at showing us the backstory of Darth Vader as Anakin, the Jedi at the time, and how awesome Obi Wan is. 

I'm going to get flogged for this, but I would love to hear Lucas's original plan for these films. I read the recent films are actually Lucas's original plans for the films, but completely rewritten and altered by Disney.

Of course, all of literature is subjective and that is the beauty of story telling.

All opinions and interpretations are equally valid when discussing literature and storytelling so there is no right or wrong interpretation. &&Yeah we missed the first few Wage War songs because the line was 2 hours long getting in!

"‘Blade Runner 2049’ Was Never Going to Be a Blockbuster, But It Can Become Something Better: a Cult Classic",37400,75hxlq,http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-box-office-cult-classic-1201885405/,3483,1507650640.0,,"It's a miracle that Blade Runner 2049 exists at all, especially considering the talent behind it.  I never much wanted a sequel but when I read that Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins, and Hampton Fancher were involved (plus the fact that it is a direct sequel and not a reboot...hallelujah), that was all it took to get me on board.  I had mega high expectations.  It delivered.

It really sucks that it didn't make money, but neither did the original.  I don't think we need another sequel.  We DO need more sci-fi films with substance, but if nobody's showing up then odds are we'll be lucky to get something like again this anytime soon.  Box office bomb or not, I'm so happy it exists that I saw it twice over the weekend.  I haven't watched a film twice during the theatrical run in over a decade.  The film is fantastic and is as good or better than the original.  Time will tell.  But there's no denying that 2049 has a passionate audience behind it.  &&Basically the producers paid $150,000,000 for a passion project, which movies happen to be... aside from all the money grabbing schlock.

If Ridley wanted to do a sequel to one of my favorite science fiction films with Denis, Deakins, Gosling, Ford and I had that kind of money... I'd 100% fund that project, even if it meant breaking even with some bonus money. 

In the end, they got a fantastic continuation of Blade Runner.&&I think fans will love it. I felt an apprehension recommending it to people. I thought it was amazing. But when I told people it was good and they should go see it, I said it's a slow burn and a dark crime drama. Movies that make it big are gotg and somehow IT. Movies that anyone can pick up and get into. And that's the way it's always been. If they made bladerunner more pedestrian, fans would have clamored that it didn't stick to the source material. And it would have def not made the cult status. &&Already sick of the articles trying to validate this movie’s quality based on box-office performance. That Scorsese piece posted earlier was spot on.&&Saw it Monday. It was a visual masterpiece. &&[deleted]&&This is dumb. The movie was #1 at the box office, and will likely make $100M domestic and probably $175M+ foreign. No, it will not be gangbusters profitable. But it won't be a bomb. It won't be some forgotten little flick nobody heard about that got mixed reviews and only found its audience later in the home video market. It will have none of the hallmarks of a **Cult** classic and will never be regarded as such.&&What I worry about is Villeneuve suddenly becoming a ""bad bet"" to studios.&&ITT: Nobody knows what a cult classic is.&&I just got back from seeing this. Blade Runner is such an important movie for me that I originally wanted NOTHING to do with 2049. It was only after friends were yelling at me to see it that I did.

I've never been more wrong about a movie. I wish I could better describe how much I loved this one. It's a miracle we got a sequel this good. I wish more people would see it, but it's not a movie for everyone. I think any cinephile should see this as it's an incredible movie going experience.

God that ending was perfect. Every minute I was marveling at something. Fuck I need to see it a dozen more times on the largest, loudest screen I can before it leaves theaters.&&>cult classic

didn't this just top the weekend's box office? this article doesn't merit a click.&&The sad thing is that there isn’t even anything that interesting out right now. I can see why people wouldn’t want to see it if they haven’t seen the original, but it isn’t actually required. I wonder what the experience would be if you saw them in reverse order. But yeah, they did a decent job of glossing over the plot of the old one. Also you can’t really say the marketing was to blame. I saw it everywhere on the internet. I was not disappointed by any means, there have been a lot of critiques about the run time but when it was over I was surprised it was the end. 

I never thought or cared if it was going to be a blockbuster but it is a bit of a shame that it didn’t do so well opening weekend. I’ve seen a lot of people mention in other threads that they were surprised how many people haven’t seen the original or even heard of it which is weird because I was born in 1989 and didn’t see it until probably 2009 or 10. So it’s a little fascinating that it’s not as widely regarded as we may have thought.  

I’m starting to digress so I’ll leave it at that.  The movie was phenomenal from literally start to finish. Going to go see again at least once. Ultimately I’m just happy there was a sequel to be honest. It also has made me love Denis that much more. I had only ever seen prisoners and that made me love him forever, now I’m excited to see everything else that much more. &&I'm tempted to take a long lunch and go see this by myself because it's not something I could go with the family and see.&&It's gonna win a bunch of awards and be considered one of the greats. As a huge fan of the original my expectations were completely shattered. They knocked it out of the park. &&It's at 80+MM worldwide before even being released in big markets like SK and China.

That's honestly pretty decent for a sequel to something only cinephiles and sci-fi fans really get excited about. 

I think when everything is done shaking out BR2049 will come out just ahead of its breakeven. The panic over Dune no longer getting made is overblown.&&Can confirm. I was absolutely blown away by this film and pretty much everyone I know who saw it said the same thing. Completely lived up to the original for me. I'm sure it'll be considered a classic in ten years.&&I left that theater FURIOUS.

Furious that Hollywood could have been giving us incredible sequels like this instead of god damned Transformers 2 and the like, all this time. 
&&I am old. So maybe listen to me maybe. Blade runner didn't premiere as a classic. The first time i watched it i was underwhelmed not understanding the depth and overwhelmed by a dystopian universe i had never seen. My son insisted that i rewatch many years ago. I weeped. Give this one time to sink in. And fantastic that this can get made.  Knowing it might take a while to be a classic. Van gogh never sold a painting until after his demise. &&[deleted]&&This film moved me. I don't care about any opinion. As a film it was profound. It is great art. Period. Nothing to defend.&&Calling it a cult classic while it's still in theaters?

Calm the fuck down.
&&It's a masterpiece.&&[deleted]&&Studios don't green light 50 million dollar movies in hopes they will become ""cult classics.""&&I thought this movie was fantastic. &&God damn I wish it was a blockbuster, though. I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. I think Gosling knocked this role out of the park, especially evident during the times where he scrutinizes his past and tries to figure out his life, where you can practically see the connections clicking and the gears turning as he tries to make sense of the information he's given.&&I fucking loved this movie and will be buying the 4K package when it releases.  

I’m considering returning to see it again in theaters to try the 3D version out.  

This is the kind of movie I’ll watch over and over again which only few movies have that effect on me.  Seriously, I only own ~30 movies.&&Its not going to be a big box office success OR a cult classic. Its a well known movie that will still make a lot of money. And when its out of cinemas, a lot of other people will watch it. I think its reputation will be a highly acclaimed sci fi movie. Not a massive blockbuster or a cult classic. &&[deleted]&&They mis-marketed it as an action film. Of course if they didn't, it would still be hard to expect it to make blockbuster numbers.

Slow burn noir type flicks don't do Star Wars bank.&&It just pains me that almost no one wants to see one of the most beautiful, interesting, and original films in years. Hollywood is never going to make anything unique again.&&I hate to say it, but I'm not surprised. I attended the double feature with the Blade Runner Final Cut, then 2049. They showed it in the ""grand auditorium"" and there was maybe 20-30 people in there. We were all clustered in the middle, so we had a great time. Just sad to see so few people turn out for this film.&&I was soooo happy with 2049. All i can say is WOW. &&I loved the movie. Saw it twice. K and Joe’s relationship was so unique it gave me goosebumps and tears at the same time. Harrison Ford was the best he has been in recent years. The visuals were crazy. The music heart rending. 

Buuuuut

So Hollywood made a good movie. 
Hollywood didn’t interfere with the director’s vision. 
Hollywood marketed the movie well. 
Hollywood didn’t spoil much at all in trailers. 
Hollywood gave it a big budget. 
Hollywood made a good sequel which retains the soul of the original. 

So Hollywood did everything right this time. So why is the movie bombing /r/movies, on your watch?

Why are you guys not going to see the movie in the theatres?&&Wasn’t the 1982 film considered a cult classic...&&Don't care how well financially it's doing, it's the best film I've seen all year &&Did I miss something, It was amazing!?&&I was able to see a double feature of both films. I didn't see Blade Runner until that day. While I enjoyed the art of the film the plot was a little hard to follow but had my husband fill in the blanks since he read the book. I really loved 2049 and felt that it tied so well with BR. I loved every character, especially the relationship between K and Joi. &&I fucking loved 2049 &&It was a very pretty film. It felt like a lot of scenes were written around ideas for visuals and didn't add to the story (Casino fight seen in particular). The motives for the characters were not that well fleshed out. The soundtrack was lacking as well, with out Vangelis. Kind of a centerpiece of the original. It was decent... all my opinion of course. I'm happy people enjoyed it! &&The movie is a masterpiece. I loved every second of it. The sets were amazing. The shots were genius. So good! &&I think it already became a classic. This movie is totally insane. It is even in its own league of uniqueness. I´ve seen it two days ago and I´m still blown away by it. This.. this movie is something special.&&This movie is amazing. I don't care what anyone says.&&Instant classic for me.&&if you haven't seen this yes, do so. it is worth your money on its own merits but we need to vote with our dollars here as much as i generally hate that expression&&A cult classic? Cool, so another 30 years for a sequel to come out?&&""We'd prefer blockbuster tbh.""

-The studios that financed this movie&&At a minimum, it's beautiful. &&Absolutely. That film is just such a wonderful experience that I can't imagine it not gaining in popularity as the years go by. While I personally felt that the narrative was pretty weak in some areas, 2049 is just such a visual triumph and thematic masterwork that I can't help but love it anyways.&&I got to see it yesterday and I already want to see it again.  It will be an instant buy for me the moment it comes out.&&I don't care what they call it. I thought it was absolutely fantastic. &&Having just watched the original directors cut version for the first time in my life (and I’m not young) a month ago and then seeing 2049 this week I hands down enjoyed this new offering substantially more. &&Just wanted to say, I haven't bought a blue ray since Avengers 1 and this will be the first (4K too) that I buy. 

Also, haven't listened to a commentary track since like 2004 and this one will be getting a listen. &&a cult classic of a cult claasic&&I loved it and it's a shame that it's not a box office hit but I think I'm good with how the story ends and don't really need a sequel. I would love another movie  that takes place in the same world but with a different tone like say Cyberpunk Super Troopers. Only half kidding. &&I saw the new movie about an hour ago. I am old enough to have seen the original movie when it first came out in theaters. I was not disappointed in any way with the remake. Great job to all involved.&&This movie is already my number one favorite movie of all time. And I love cult classics, so that's not really a surprise, but this movie is truly a masterpiece.&&It’s the absolute best movie I’ve ever seen and I don’t give a single fuck what anyone else thinks. &&i loved it. i can understand the complaint about the length but for me i loved the long and beautiful establishing shots that i get to drink in with my eye holes. &&Hope it becomes a classic. It deserves Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Cinematography, Visual Effects, Production Design, Score and Director&&Unfortunately cult status doesn't necessarily result in financial success, especially these days when people don't buy DVDs as much as they used to.

My concern is that studios will never make a film like this again. If Blade Runner 2049 was a smash hit it could have completely changed how people make blockbusters  
&&I just need to know where to get that bad ass jacket Ryan Gosling wears&&Easily the best film I've seen so far this year. A lot of people won't get it though, it's definitely destined to be a cult classic just like the original. If you haven't seen it or the original yet I very, very highly recommend seeing the original first as without it 2049 can be a little confusing.&&This just in, sequel to box office disappointment also a disappointment.&&A $150 million cult classic. How is that better than making it's money back? It might cause a studio to go under from this. A fairly bizarre way to frame a box office failure.&&The movie felt very similar to the movie ""Drive""   and I'm not just saying that because the lead for both was Ryan Gosling.  The speed, the tone, and the overall plot of the second half of blade runner, as well as the acting style and emphasis on music and atmosphere to set the mood, was very very similar.  Even watching Jared Leto ""test out"" the new replicant reminded me of when the antagonist in ""drive"" caught bryan cranston towards the end of the film.  VERY similar scenes with an eerie lingering of the camera on the bleed outs and leaving the viewer with a sense of inescapable fatalism. 

I loved drive.  But i loved this movie even more, because it added moral issues into it that Drive didn't have.

Drive is already a cult classic.  So is blade runner.  No reason why Drive and Blade Runner's baby can't be a cult classic too. &&Let's hope not. As a fan of both films, I would prefer that it receives both critical and financial success. After Arrival, it was great to see the trust the studio gave Denis on this film — there was almost no indication of studio meddling as far as I could tell. If 2049 continues to do well, we'll likely see more big-budget, well-crafted films from Denis, much like the trust Nolan has gotten the last decade. Hopefully the ""okay"" box office doesn't deter studios from funding more films like this one.

&&Cult classics have to happen naturally they can't be forced by proclaiming something can be.&&[deleted]&&The box office failure of Blade Runner 2049 is going to discourage a lot of producers from green lighting spin-offs, sequels, adaptations or remakes of any cult classic, which is definitely not a good sign, considering how good Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049 were.&&I'm 33, the people who I know who are 24 and under have liked the movie but have told me it was ""too long""... Whereas I didn't even notice. I would of been happy with a clean 3 hours.&&Don't care what anyone says: this movie was a 9/10.

There were a few tropes which felt shoe-horned in (THE RESISTANCE!  ROBOT REVOLUTION! AAaaand then we're never seen again....) but holy fuck, the cinematography.....ugh.  How does Dennis do that?  how does he say so much with SILENCE AND SHOTS?!?!?!?!

UGH I was wet the entire movie.  Soooooo good.&&[deleted]&&If it had a third of the budget, then yeah Cult Classic is great. &&Was amazing, looked good, sounded good, good plot and good acting. It's solid, but the theatre was only 3/4 full when I went on opening night.&&Unpopular opinion but I didn't enjoy it. I liked some parts and the cinematography was good but I must admit, I was pretty bored throughout. &&I like cyberpunk stuff, so I'm good.&&Im pissed it isn’t doing well. I would love a sequel, maybe offworld. Or a prequel about the blackout&&>It really sucks that it didn't make money

It's too bad it won't make money, but then again what Blade Runner film does?&&Too soon to say. If a movie ""has legs"" like Mad Max Fury Road, they can continue to have solid weekends. This will too, I suspect, as its critical reception and likelihood of it getting recommendation from friends seems great.&&I always expected the movie to do great financially on the first weekend, but get terrible audience reviews. I assumed people would remember blade runner being this ""amazing classic"" and go see it on the first weekend, then see a 3 hour slow-burning movie where nothing happens, and then hate it. I guess those people didn't show up at all. It's not a film for everyone, but it's easily my favorite movie of the year, and in my top 5 of the decade. &&Growing up, the fandom around the first movie made me think it was some sprawling epic when it's probably one of the smallest films out there. 

The first took place in a single city, with less than a dozen named characters. 

And what I really liked in both films is that superhuman feats are subtle and don't require much special effects. 

&&I'm honestly not sure why it's not doing better. I thought it was awesome!

It's a second master-class on show-don't-tell that is going up on my shelf alongside the Mad Max Fury Road.&&I'd almost prefer that it isn't a major blockbuster. I want it to be a big enough success that Villeneuve gets some recognition and freedom. I don't want another sequel. This one was good, it was risky and it worked out, i don't trust them to make another. &&There's no way they funded this film purely out of a desire to witness the final product. They wanted profit, like any company.

The film may well become a cult classic, but frankly I'd rather it becomes just a straight-up classic, with all the financial success as well. The relative failure of this film at the box office is likely to torpedo any future big-budget sci-fi that isn't Star Wars (or directed by Christoper Nolan). The first casualty may be Villeneuve's proposed Dune adaptation.&&I'd suggest rather than ""paid"" they took a calculated risk of a small fraction of $150m. I'd guess total boxoffice and then all the pre-production and post-theater revenues will earn them a profit by the time the honest accounting is done.&&Alcon wanted both, it only got art. Sad Alcon.&&Its a long term investment. If they can sell the rights to television, streaming services, sell 4k blurrays, and re-releases every 5-10 years for the next few decades as a 'classic' film they'll more than make their money back.

&&It may become a cult classic but that was not the intention in funding it. It was meant to make a lot of money. &&I do the same thing. I recommend it because I liked it, but I give the warnings that; 1) it's very long, 2) it's very slow. &&> somehow IT

It is so deeply engrained into pop culture I wasn’t surprised in the slightest. The face that it was a good book to film adaption, a better remake than the original, and stood well on its own just helped it gain more steam. The R rating was really the only game against success, but as Deadpool (just off the top of my head) has shown there is clearly an audience for more mature movies to do well&&""Didn't stick with the source material.""  

That's a laugh, the source being ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"". Of which the Original Movie had only a name or two, and half a scene in common with. The entire story and motivations were different.&&People like pew pew not think think.&&To be fair, they did make Blade Runner a fair bit more pedestrian (though I don't exactly like that term). The first movie had a lot of moral ambiguity. This one was vastly less ambiguous and I think suffered a bit because of it. It was a very good movie, it was fantastically made, and while all the high level aspects of the story were fantastically done I think the basic underlying story was kind of weak in order to avoid moral complexity.&&Yeah I watched it with no knowledge of the first one and was completely confused and frankly bored. I was assuming it was an action flick with a name like blade runner lmao. I was wrong. &&Fan here: it was everything I wanted and more. This sequel literally was not needed at all, but it manages to be just as good as its predecessor. &&Which Scorcese piece are you referring too?&&the sound was epic too. &&This shit was basically vaporwave the movie. So good.&&Honestly, that's the same situation as the first Blade Runner.  It was a well-advertised, big budget movie with a huge star.  And despite what all the commenters in this thread seem to think, it did *not* lose money, it just didn't make as much as the studios expected.  In fact, it was in the black prior to leaving the theaters *(edit: maybe not quite, see comments below about movie budgets not including all costs)*.  Now, add in three decades of VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, and Blu-ray sales, and you're seeing some decent but not earth-shattering profits.

The original wasn't an obscure ""cult classic"", either.  To compare it to movies in the same year, it made more money *(edit: the point being it was watched by more people)* than Airplane II, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, the Road Warrior, Quest for Fire, The Thing, and The Secret of NIMH.  It also had a bigger opening weekend than both Tron and The Dark Crystal.

Yet decades later you've got this narrative that Blade Runner was a huge box office flop that only sci-fi nerds knew about.  None of that is true.

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view=releasedate&view2=domestic&yr=1982&sort=gross&order=DESC&p=.htm &&275m BO on a 185m budget is almost definitely not profitable. It's going to need to do a lot better than that.&&From a business point of view, 200-300 million on a film that cost 150 million is a bomb. &&Not going to happen. He delivered exactly what they wanted and then some. My only concern is that he moves into other ""franchise"" type movies. It'd be great to see him do something like this once every decade or so but I want to see more original/standalone stories from him.&&Highly doubt that. His films have been critically acclaimed and have made decent money overall. I'm assuming Blade Runner was supposed to be the movie that made ""summer blockbuster"" money but he'll still have plenty of chances. (if he wants)&&Going to bet that Oscar nominations help avoid that.&&The film may well win some awards. As long as the film makes a small profit, then having critically acclaimed films (with the awards to back it up) is important for studios. 

And it was only really 'disappointing' in the US. It's done really well in Europe, and is top of the UK box office, where its opening weekend takings were only about 10% behind La La Land. It's going to make a profit!

I mean, Fences only made $40mil at the box office, but I doubt Denzel Washington is going to find himself out of work! &&He has a more impressive track record than M Night Shamalan, who  still somehow manages to get work in Hollywood after a string of horrible movies.&&It's actually surprising how many terms we have kindof a notion about, can mostly parse in context, and think we know the meaning up but if asked to define, we can't quite do it or are mistaken. &&On top of that, it's stupid and short sighted to say that good movies are better off being cult classics than financially successful. 

I read another article today that said it's good the movie isn't doing well because if it did they'd make more Blade Runner movies. This is stupid for multiple reasons. 

1. They just proved they can make a new Blade Runner movie that's good. 
2. This movie failing will cause other non-Blade Runner movies to not get made because they're seemed to be too similar in one way or another and thus too risky.
3. Even if a new Blade Runner movie is made and it's bad that won't affect the quality of the two that have already been made. &&Saw it in IMAX. I like my movies loud, and boy, this movie almost made me rethink my mindset. Almost. The brass synth is like a wave that immerses you then threatens to drown you at the highest peak of discomfort, then recedes. Then the process repeats.&&This gives me a little more hope.  I plan to see it for the first time tomorrow.  The original is easily a top five film for me, so I have had similar feelings of trepidation.  &&It was #1 at the box office, but it only made ~$33m. 

For reference, this summer, Spiderman was roughly the same budget as Bladerunner 2049 and was also ""number one"" at the US box office the weekend it came out, but it made nearly four times as much ($117m).  

Something can make what sounds like a lot of money to a normal person and still be a gigantic failure financially, so ""cult classic"" isn't too absurd a label to give it.&&Topping the box office is just clickbait. Though it is relatively rare for a movie that doesn't open at #1 to be successful it does happen... and more to the point actual success is pretty much your opening against your budget because you *will* lose half your audience each week. 

And Blade Runner did 31 million domestic against a 150 million budget. It will not likely gross its budget in the states which is a semi-decent rule of thumb for even possibly being actually profitable. &&A movie can reach even third place in the box office and be considered a success. Box Office placement shouldn't be compared to the overall performance of the film's gross. In this case, despite reaching #1, Blade Runner 2049 failed to reach expectations. It might barely reach the goal, but the studio will overall take in a loss from this film. The overall gross of the sales of the box office has to match or outperform the film's budget and other expenses. &&See Sicario. You will not regret it. 

I still wish Denis had Johan Johansson do the music. The music in 2049 was fine but the rest of the atmospheric soundwork blew Zimmers work out of the water. &&The only people I know who have heard of the original Blade Runner are people who were alive when it released, or like the 2 or 3 friends I have who are also really into movies. I think this being a sequel might actually be hurting it because anyone who sees the trailer and is interested may look and see the first came out decades ago and decide ""nah, I'm not watching a movie that old"" and then not want to watch the movie. This is a real thing. My ex though anything before 2010 was an ""old"" movie and she didn't like old movies. &&Most real sci-fi fans seem to absolutely love it. I think it was the best sci-fi movie I've seen in recent memory. Every second I thought was fantastic and perfectly put together, and even though I'm typically skeptical of overly-long movies, I felt the length here was just fine. 

I saw some hubbub from the SJW crowd about it being racist and sexist, and that's just fucking ridiculous to me. The relevant cast is like ten total people---obviously, unless everyone was purely evil or good, there is going to be some disparity. But the amount that some people dig for social issues these days is just absurd. And this is coming from a very socially-leftist person.&&That's a LONG fucking lunch my friend...&&Do it!!&&Yes.  Absolutely.  This is a must see by yourself in my opinion.  I would have been pissed if I had gone with my moron friends or something...

No distractions, phone off, escapism.  Good stuff&&I hope you’re right. It deserves plenty of awards.

I haven’t stopped thinking about it since I saw it on Friday and that’s a mark of a great film. Although I don’t think it’s a film for everyone I do think it’s a masterpiece of modern cinema. They did justice to the original in a way I didn’t think was possible.&&That's a serial number, not a name. &&I think it will go decently too but you shouldn't expect much from China's market. They enjoy much faster pacing in China so I doubt it will do good there. &&But who's to blame? Hollywood or people who pay to see movies? This an industry with thousands of employees; of course they'll make the movies that make a profit. In our reality that means Transformers sequels and not movies like this one, if the latter don't turn out a profit.&&Reading your comment felt like reading a click-bait article.&&Jesus, everyone just has to make a Transformers comment. People have been going for that low hanging fruit for a decade. Yes there's too much schlock out there but that's always the case. Let's just enjoy that this even happened at all.&&To prepare ourselves, I and my son both watched the first movie the day before and it beat me up pretty bad.  2049 took me apart.  It learned everything that you could from the first movie and added to it.

You and I both know that's not true.&&Just from my personal experience at work a lot of people are avoiding it because they want to watch the first one. I keep hearing people asking what version of the first they should watch before watching this one.

The sweeping epics can be fantastic (star wars), but I truly love the kind of sci-fi that takes human nature/ethics and examines it in a new context. &&Blade Runners world also felt so fucking real. Between the actual diversity of the residents, the weird (but not too weird) fashion, the decrepit style of buildings. The weird inventions that didn't exactly pop out at you, but felt REAL on the screen. It all felt strikingly unique, yet totally plausible and not too extreme. 

Just with a few shots, the movie felt like the most lived in sci-fi world I have ever seen.

Fucking brilliant. &&The most amazing thing for me about Bladerunner was revisiting the film in my early 30’s after separation from the Army. 

I watched as Harrison Ford defeated all his enemies as they tried their damndest to kill him. 

And then, there was the soldier. Watch their fight, from beginning to end. He could have killed Ford many times over, but instead lets the game continue. The soldier is instead taunting Ford to kill him, to finish his mission, but he won’t make it easy. The soldier needs to fulfill his purpose, but he is done killing and even says so during his final monologue. 

The soldier has seen too much death and realizes his life is a fraud, and to die would give him some real humanity. &&What's odd is that opinions are still very split on the first one it seems.

It's just a 8.2 on imdb. I find that bizarre since for me it's always been a ""perfect 10"" sci-fi film that deserves to be on practically any Top 10 list, either of sci-fi or general films of the 80s. It was pitch-perfect, but I guess it had limited action and felt too small.

It was really just a story of a cop hunting down a few outlaws, and then a small peak into the lives and thoughts of those outlaws. If they hadn't (spoiler for the original) killed their creator it'd have been a totally unimportant event even within its own history. All the characters were shades of gray, and the wider world was barely explored other than through visual space and imagery.

It was the story of every day people in a bizarre time and place. So few of those really get made, certainly nowadays.

And the media is inflating the story again. It's not a flop. These days it seems anything that doesn't make half of the production value back in the first week is a flop but that is just plain stupid. There is nothing really similar for a few weeks in cinema so the movie is going to get it's money back. 

It's been only 4 days with the movie releasing on a thursday. And it's already made half back.

[We still don't know whether Deckard is a replicant. Wallace asks some provoking questions but Deckard appears to have never found out himself only replying ""I know what's real"". To Deckard, the answer to that question seems to have stopped mattering, he's sure of his humanity. How much did the death of Racheal II bother Deckard? As much as losing her the first time? It was built from her replicant DNA, only missing memories from what I could understand. How do we as the audience reconcile not caring about this replicant as much as Racheal I, when for all intents and purposes it is just a human as the original?](#spoiler)

[And I'm still thinking about the extreme dichotomy between how replicants feel about the birth and how Wallace understands it. Replicants see it as a miracle, giving validation and purpose to their 'race' and providing some degree of proof regarding their humanity. Wallace sees it as a tool, a way to more easily perpetuate their suffering-filled existences and expand it across the universe.](#spoiler)

I dunno, I thought it was just as great as the original from that perspective.





&&Strange... I found 2049 much more complex and extremely deep. 
The original only scratched at some of these things. 
There is much more to talk about and much more to ponder over in the new film.
BOTH are amazing films though.
&&So basically the movie is fantastic &&I thought it was plenty morally complex IMO. There were various factions/'sides' but in the end none of them were depicted as being in ""the right"".&&https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/75gvs2/martin_scorsese_on_rotten_tomatoes_box_office/&&This. I'm not seeing nearly enough praise of the sound - in the original, the score was a key component. Same with this version. I liked both the scoring and the soundwork, and made a point to see it in a theatre that had great surround.&&More like retrowave&&You have no idea what vaporwave is if you felt the movie was vaporwave.&&Wait....isn't vaporwave a post-modernist deconstruction of 80s nostalgia? If so, how can a sequel to an iconic 80s movie BE vaporwave?  Vaporwave is commenting on the 80s, not the other way around.  So now we have serious movies imitating ironic art, imitating serious movies.&&All the neon! The pinks and blues and oranges! &&Wow! TIL... Thanks for that.&&> it did not lose money

It did in its original release. It cost $28 million and made back $27.5 million in theaters in 1982, and that's not counting the marketing and distribution costs on top of its production budget. So it was a failure before home video, even if not an enormous one.

Keep in mind that the movie got re-released a couple times -- the Director's Cut brought in another $3.7 million in 1992, The Final Cut made another $1.5 million in 2007 (and there must have been another, as there's still about $1 million unaccounted for). Sites like Box Office Mojo and Wikipedia include re-releases when providing a film's box office revenue, which is why you'll see it listed as making $33.8 million in theaters.

And those comparisons are disingenuous. Fast Times and The Road Warrior both cost less than $5 million to make, Nihm cost $7 million, and Airplane II and The Thing both cost $15 million. Blade Runner, on the other hand, was a big budget film for 1982 (E.T. and Star Trek II both cost about $11 million that same year). Box office success isn't just about totals, it's about money in vs. money out, and the story of Blade Runner's failure is partly predicated on how much the film cost for that time (the story of Waterworld is similar -- it's not that the film was awful or a huge wipe at the box office, but rather that it cost so much, which significantly raised expectations). 

I get the point you're trying to make -- it wasn't a collosal failure. But I think you're pushing so hard to discredit that narrative that you're erring in the opposite direction. It was still a failure, even if not a terribly big one.&&What?! There was an Airplane II?!?!&&Am i the only one that is surprised by how many amazing movies were released in 1982?

[Denis Villeneuve is making the upcoming Dune reboot](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14468876/dune-reboot-denis-villeneuve-director-official)
&&They wouldn't have released it in October of they were banking on a summer blockbuster. This time of year is always reserved for more artistic awards chasing movies&&BWWWWWAAAAARRRRRRMMMMMMM

It was like listening to a supercar shifting gears slowed down and cranked to 11. I loved it.  &&It's almost like summer movies and movies released in October perform differently.&&This is my favorite soundtrack out of any movie. It shook the chairs in the theater at times and gave the perfect atmosphere. I loved it.&&> My ex though anything before 2010 was an ""old"" movie and she didn't like old movies.

I mean...is your ex 7? I can see people not wanting to watch even something like 70s movies. But that was a different era of filmmaking. Nothing has really changed in the technique or format of movies in 25+ years. Going by this logic, The Dark Knight is an old and outdated movie.&&>who were alive when it released

Or...those of us who were desperate kids bored out of our minds with the 5 shitty sci-fi offerings at the video rental store and rented Blade Runner because it had a cool jacket and Harrison Ford. &&> The only people I know who have heard of the original Blade Runner are people who were alive when it released,

Or anyone who loves movies. If you're a movie buff, you've seen Blade Runner.&&I mean I can empathise with not wanting to see an old movie. I generally don't like anything made in the 50s or before. It was a different era of cinema that isn't to my tastes. 

But anything before 2010?! Jesus...&&tbf if that's the position they take on films, they're probably better off not watching the original. They'd likely just find it boring.&&I'm keen on movies and I had to watch the first one before seeing 2049. I've heard of other people doing the same. I imagine a lot of people would want to see the first one before the sequel but they just aren't *that* keen on putting the effort in to do it, thus, not going to see 2049.&&I'm glad I went with the friend I did. We both are fans of the original and had a great time silently being amazed by 2049 and had great stuff to talk about afterwards.&&Watched it opening night and also haven't stopped thinking about it so gonna go watch it again later today, such an amazing movie!&&> But who's to blame? Hollywood or people who pay to see movies? 

Both. There are many people who like a lot of things that dont' get made. The Lord of the Rings is easily considered a master class in big movie making but when it was being shopped around nobody wanted to make it.

The problem with Hollywood is not that people won't like good movies, its that people will pay more money for shittier ones. Its a bell curve and shit tends to rate higher than less shitty shit. Also though lets remember how insidious marketing is. We make movies to sell toys these days. They dont set out to make art so epople are raised to buy shit and we make movies to make them buy shit and stick shitty product placement in them, etc.

Its not like this is the only way you could make movies and make money. Its just a very reliable way to make bank. If shareholders were more like patrons in Venice then just money people you'd see way more art pieces.&&I don't know. Everybody? And all of us?  I was totally blown away by this, though. It's like ""oh yeah, silence, subtlety are actually things that can exist in high budget films.""&&It's been out for like five days why are people so eager to declare things classics? That's not how classics work &&I think it honestly has very little to do with the runtime. Not many people regularly even look into something like runtime before going to the theaters. I just think that it was a combination of the film being hard to market and not actually a widely recognized brand as much as the production company might have thought. Many friends of mine, even ones that are generally into modern sci-fi, either haven't seen the original or only vaguely remember it, and weren't interested in a sequel to begin with. Denis made an incredible film but I think it was never a $170mil premise and he made a fantastic film but not one that was ever meant to be a hit with multiple quadrants. I hope that it gets proper recognition despite the box office and eventually makes its money back, I know I will be seeing it again and owning it down the road as well.&&another reason avatar was so popular, apart from the 3D and completely computer generated world, was the absolute grade school level plot and character development.&&Yeah but how are they supposed to get upvotes on /r/movies without ridiculous hyperbole?&&And if you're being honest, the first one isn't for everyone.  It's extremely slow paced and it's a head scratcher.

That doesn't go well with today's movie goers.&&Reminds of when people were calling Valerian original and that Hollywood hated it cause it wasn't their usual derivative shlock.

Yeah, Hollywood is soooo intimidated by a scifi comic book adaptation!&&Welcome to /r/movies. &&The person might not be a native english speaker since in some other languages the word also means something along ""creative"" and ""unique"".&&I did watch the first and have read a lot of Philip k dick. I hated the trailers but loved the movie, honestly the whole trailers reek of grandiosity and overreaching, but they fucking nailed it. I'm not sure how they could have marketed it any differently, the movie just does not translate well to a 2 minute trailer.

Edit: I may not have even watched it if it were not for the overwhelmingly positive critical reviews. But I am so happy I did, probably my favorite film in at least the past 5 years.&&The trailers, in my humble opinion, were disasters. From originally being enticed by the idea, they made the movie seem like a tired Hollywood sequel, complete with in-fashion Ford cameo-for-the-nerds. And Ryan Goslings wooden performance just felt like horrible acting. The trailers made me actively avoid seeing this movie.

And then I took a chance based off a friend liking it, and I fell in love with it. And I think Gosling is great in it. Such a shame, I have personally talked to friends who had similar feelings :(&&Well the studio is shut down, but in 25 years nerds will watch it again&&You are 100% correct and shouldn't be downvoted.

The defining characteristic of a cult classic is a movie that goes under the radar in popular culture, but still manages to form an extremely dedicated following of fanatics. What it costs, who directed, which studio doesn't matter at all. It's the dichotomy of lacking mass appeal vs a big sub-culture appreciation that's key.&&So say we all&&It reminds me a bit of films like Stalker and Solaris. I'd recommend those to people I know are really into film and sci-fi, but not really anyone else.&&Do you have examples of others like this?&&Primer!&&Star Wars is often considered space opera, and not science fiction. I believe sci-fi tends to ask questions about human nature/ethics or projecting social problems in some new context. &&Chappie, Elysium,  and District 9&&A very interesting part to me about the world are the small inaccuracies in predicted technological developments. It's easy to think of flying cars when you think of the future, but the creators in 1982 were unable to foresee (or unable to depict) some of the actual developments that we take for granted today (e.g. smartphones and flat screen TVs). Like nobody uses a CRT today.&&This!! Honestly when I was going to see the new bladerunner, all I hoped was that it would be like this too. The atmosphere, the mood, the opening scene, the scenery, it was just so incredible and dense in the first movie, and so real and gritty without ugly CGI. It was like the first time I really was enraptured by the atmosphere of a movie. True art!&&Rutger Hauer is amazing - I could watch him all day. &&The best comments are always way down. Batty is in a rage; he's seen his people tracked down and remorselessly killed one at a time. How to show he's human? -show compassion. 

*As it turns out, Batty's more compassionate than Deckard.&&More than that, his final act is to *save* a life... and not just any life, but the life of a man who killed his friends, the closest thing Roy would ever have to a family. 

In that moment Roy needed to refute what they made of him, and even the life of a killer has value.

All his moments will be lost, but his actions live on. &&> It's just a 8.2 on imdb. I find that bizarre since for me it's always been a ""perfect 10"" sci-fi film that deserves to be on practically any Top 10 list, either of sci-fi or general films of the 80s.

It's very, *very* slow. Its pacing throws a lot of people off, and the setting can be overwhelming. As you say, the main story itself isn't what's complex, it's the setting and all the ramifications and implications it has on the story. Being that it's delivered in such a paced manner, a lot of people don't feel so great about it.

With the new one on the other hand, they kept the exact same slow pacing(which I fucking loved that they did), but more of the people going to watch now know beforehand how slow the first was and go in expecting that, so it's not as jarring.&&I love Bladerunner, but it's not a perfect movie. The Deckard / Rachael relationship is pretty forced and there are some scenes that don't work.


EDIT: I meant from a storytelling perspective, but yeah, Freudian slip.&&Blade Runner is a masterpiece of what it does. The thing that's always held it back though is the lack of emotion in the story. Blade Runner is very much a spectacle rather a story you connect with on an emotional level. I've watched it multiple times, as many have, and it has a certain emptiness about it, no real emotional payoff. &&8.2 on imdb *is* a 10 from Sci-fi fans. You have to remember that a lot of people will watch the movie as a cultural touchstone and not get it. So instead they'll think of the movie as an object and find it's flaws (of which there are many). I don't know a single sci-fi fan who rates it less than 11/10 as far as actual-movies-that-exist.&&I think it was going for claustrophobic.&&I had to let it marinate for a while, in the end I became of the opinion that they did more with less by focusing on the characters with the world being more secondary. I actually watched it again shortly after and it was like a whole new movie viewing it from that perspective.

I like how u/MomentarySpark described it as a story of every day people in a bizarre time and place, it made the whole world more convincing to me even tho they barely focus on it - it's just there in the background. Also as a synthesizer enthusiast that score by Vangelis takes me to another world. &&That, for me, was the biggest change in 2049. From the opening scene it's an open world.&&>the runtime is prohibitive for most people

Hmm? I didn't think it was that long. \*looks it up*

>163 minutes

What the what? It didn't feel nearly this long! You know a movie is immersive when it literally makes you lose track of time.&&neo-noir in 2017? thats weird. Thats why.&&It's infinitely better than Fury Road in my opinion, but I can get why people would equate them.&&A two hour long car chase with a grunting protagonist?&&I think it does matter. I think that the new Star Wars movies were pretty average/boring and that's because disney knows they can make bank off of them if they keep them safe and plain. Same as marvel with basically everything at this point. But now they're part of the Star Wars universe you cant watch the whole series without them. I think Blade Runner and even 2049 are great, and i wouldn't want to see a newer one that is canon and sucks. &&The movie studios know this. Which is why we get watered down family films with predictable plot, they set box office records &&It's... It's been out for a week. 

But fine. I'll go watch it again to do my part. &&The majority of movie audiences don't want good, cerebral art films that make you think; they want good escapism. And most of the escapist films now are shit. I highly doubt they ever intended this film to do well with the box office initially, as 200m for an R-rated movie is shooting for the moon these days. 

Blade Runner has never been a commercially big name, it's just been stylistically borrowed from for so long that people assume it's some action-y thriller, but it's always been a long, bizarre, postmodern film about human identity. No one wants to watch movies like that except for people who are super into 'high' art- and most filmgoers aren't. &&I saw it twice already and am going Friday again. Don't blame me.&&Agreed. It's currently number one in the box office, this ""flop"" word is thrown around too much. It should be given at least 3 or 4 weeks.&&> And it's already made half back.

No it hasn't. The $150 million is just production. Marketing and distribution cost about the same amount. So what you have is 1/4th of the cost of the film in the opening weekend, when you expect a lot more. With a typical dropoff, the film doesn't break even.

Studios do not fund big scifi movies these days as their indie arthouse films. They use big scifi and action movies to fund their smaller indie arthouse films. So not only are these films meant to make a profit, they're meant to make a really big profit so that they can justify losses on the more artistic films.
&&It’s big here in Germany,  theater was packed even at a weird time ( anecdotal I know) There have been some double features around here in Berlin.

Buy their tickets if you have to. 

We can not let this movie do any less than the best it can do. &&Home video and streaming account for more money than theatrical box office, and continue paying off for decades. 

Edit: On average, large budget ($100+ mil) movies make about 40% of their money from theatrical, and 60% from ancillary markets. [Source](https://stephenfollows.com/how-movies-make-money-hollywood-blockbusters/)&&Yes, let us enjoy the scenes.     
I hate when every scene seems timed and only a mean to move the plot forward&&I actually have been reading this on Reddit a lot lately. So I rewatched the original Saturday night after seeing 2049, and I still feel the complete opposite from you and most of Reddit. Every scene in the original felt like it contributed to the plot and told something new. In 2049 you get 40 second close-ups of a wooden horse like 5 different times (and one of those he even has to unwrap it). I don't know, just not a fan. I love the original too. &&I left the theater wanting more, and that to me was the sign that the movie was good.&&Agree, the one that I think could have been trimmed a little for sure was when Joe was exploring the building in Las Vegas.&&The Dark Tower certainly comes to mind 😒

I wish they had gone all in like the studio that made IT. If they would have put the same time and care into it I could legit see them making every book and turning it into sci-fi epic that would give Star Wars and the like a run for its money.

But they got scared and kept it shallow and condensed things for no fucking reason other than to insult the intelligence of the viewer. &&He supported taking it in a different direction, because he knew the book was mostly people in rooms talking, and that wouldn't translate well to the screen. But he didn't help make the movie. He said ""No one involved in the Blade Runner project has ever spoken to me. But that's okay; I haven't spoken to them.""&&What I got out of the movie, (SPOILERS), was that it asked what makes someone a special individual. On a character by character level, everyone seems special. You pull out further and see that Joi was mass marketed like that. However, K and Joi loved each other, so it didn't matter to them if they were designed that way. 
K had a similar arc, where he felt like he didn't matter. He was just a tool. But then when he discovers he may be the replicant child, he's convinced that he is unique. He later gets the rug pulled out from him again to find out he's just a normal replicant after all. But through his struggle of finding this special child that could change everything, he reunites the natural born replicant with its parent. He sits down on the steps, dying. But it doesn't matter, he found peace. He knows that he is built the same as hundreds of others, given the same memories as many other replicants. Even though he is one single bee in the hive of thousands, he tipped the first domino in the line. He is special.
&&Regard point #1, [I'm of the opinion that she was programmed to love K, or at least programmed to figure out what he wanted and then do it. I think this is hinted at by the fact that the advertisement seems to call all the men ""Joe,"" which is what Joi called K.](#spoiler)&&To your second point

[If Deckard was a replicant programmed to love Rachel, then he would by the very nature of his programming HAVE to love the DNA clone of Rachel, him accepting her death IMHO is proof he is NOT indeed a replicant.](#spoiler)&&I agree with you 100%. I left the cinema with a big knot in my stomach dealing with all the heavy social commentary.

A lot of questions come up in this one. 

A movie hasn't made me go ""woah..."" like this did in a very long time.&&If you like the first one, I'd be shocked if you don't like the new one. 

&&Great read, thanks for sharing.&&I was slightly disappointed that Johann Johannsson's score got replaced, but Hans Zimmer was an ideal candidate.

Also amazing Sound Design, does anybody know who the Sound Designers were?&&Even better IMO&&That's a very vaporwave attitude&&I have zero idea of what vaporwave is but I'm going to go ahead and say that this movie was VERY vaporwave.&&How many layers of irony are you on right now my dude&&[deleted]&&It's semantics.

""Outrun"" is being used to describe the more general aesthetic I think

/r/outrun for reference&&It's not really vaporwave. &&With William Shatner and Sonny Bono?  In space?

No, nothing like that.  Don't even bother Googling it because you won't find anything.&&I know, right?  That struck me as well when I went to go look up Blade Runner's figures.

It also makes you wonder how much better Blade Runner would have done that year if it hadn't been up against so many heavy hitters.&&Which is good, there a very few directors I would trust with pulling that off. He is one. &&I trust this man with any material now. 
&&I'm not sure as to whether that'll be a franchise, it might be a two part movie or a trilogy, just like how Nolan have made one trilogy and the rest is standalone movies. But we'll have to wait and see. I know he is attached to an adaptation of a Jo Nesbø novel, which is exciting, it's Villeneuve working with crime drama again which he hasn't done since Prisoners.&&They were hoping this was going to be the breakaway autumn sci fi hit, like interstellar, gravity, and the martian. The latter 2 were released around the same time. They forgot to take into account that this isn't a mainstream movie, and the director isn't a household name (yet). &&There's a certain motif where it sounds exactly like you described. Listening to the soundtrack rn, and it's in ""Flight to LAPD,"" but I do remember hearing it at different points throughout the movie as well.&&The first time I heard that ""rev"" I was like, why am I hearing a ""street car"" so clearly when we're way up in the sky... It wasn't until later I realized it was part of the soundtrack. Just like the sort of static-popping-cracking that at first seemed like one of the surround sound speakers was blown in the theater.&&You would be surprised. I used to watch lots of movies with friends, and one of them regards anything before 2005 as old. He is 31. Of course, he always gets the best TV set possible.&&And many people have...heard of very famous movies that were made before they were born. That’s...a thing. &&I'm honestly just ecstatic that this movie actually exists. It's like... a gift. I'm so happy this got made. &&> That's not how classics work

Read this in Harrison Ford's voice&&[deleted]&&>That doesn't go well with today's movie goers.

To be fair when has a slow moving art film ever gone well with American audiences? I think people today will be as receptive to something like 2049 (or the original BR) as they've ever been, particularly since I think a certain fatigue is setting in from our over-stimulated, over-informed lives. Certainly better off being released today than 10-20 years ago. Remember the late 90's was like idiot blockbuster central - think of all those Emmerich and Bruckheimer productions with lots of flash and zero artistic value. Do you think a Villeneuve film would get a 150 million dollar budget back then, even correcting for inflation? I sure don't.  &&Someone said that Valerian would have been better as a silent film and I agree with that statement wholeheartedly. &&[deleted]&&That's not what's being discussed, we know what a cult classic is. I think he was saying ""it is by no means better than a blockbuster if the studio that makes it loses all it's money"".&&Arrival, Moon, Ex Machina, District 9, Children of Men, Eternal Sunshine. There are so many good Sci-Fi movies that didn't do particularly well at the box office. &&GATTACA: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/&&

IF you're into animation, the original Ghost in the Shell movie is Rad &&Not sure if it's been mentioned yet but Dark City is a great one.&&Children of Men, full stop.

Science fiction dystopian future, but it's all literally the backdrop for the characters and story.  It never flaunts or focuses on the fact the future aspect or any of its tech at all. &&*Moon* explores some of the same themes in a small setting.&&Ex Machina &&Sunshine by Danny Boyle&&*Her* is great and probably one of the most subtle genuinely good sci-fi movies.  I mean the future/fantasy aspect. It's all about the one character and his relation(ship) with an AI program. &&A Man From Earth. Not typical sci-fi. But 100% low key wonderful. &&If you want books I suggest Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? which I believe is the original inspiration for Blade Runner. I read DADoES last year and only just found out about Blade Runner (don't shoot me D=) and now I'm super excited to watch them both.

I'd also suggest any of Heinlein's books. Most especially Time Enough for Love, A Stranger in A Strange Land, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, and The Cat Who Walks Through Walls (start with this one or Time Enough, imo).

As for movies, I know nothing. 

EDIT: Word&&Never Let Me Go &&Can't believe nobody mentioned Ex Machina yet, must watch! &&The latest “Dredd” is a good example.&&Equilibrium - imo a great sci-fi which looks into the power that our emotions have over the decisions we make. Also it has Sean Bean, Christian Bale, Taye Diggs and Sean Pertwee! &&Maybe I'm reading this wrong but Cloud Atlas was absolutely enthralling and delt deeply with the human experience on the macro level. I just wanted to mention it, really. &&John Carpenter's The Thing.&&Definitely watch Ex Machina&&best time travel movie EVER??&&Another thing is urban blight. In the 80s and 90s, the view of the future was basically blighted, gang ridden, dirty disgusting urban dystopian nightmares. If you have ever seen Predator 2, their view of 1997 Los Angeles was one massive gangland where various gangs are in a state of total war. Blade runner has similar themes of urban crime and dystopia and grit. 

That's because at the time, that is what our cities actually were starting to look like. Crime rose throughout the 80s into the 90s and our urban areas were destroyed by it. People had this view that the future was just chaotic anarchy, ruled by gangs and crime. 

As you can tell, they didn't have gentrification back then. NOBODY at all could have predicted our cities would actually become expensive gentrified tourist centers for hipsters and yuppies like they are today. &&I know it's hilarious when he goes to make a video call (how cool is that for futuristic) but he still has to do it from a payphone in the bar.&&Not all day.  A few hauers at most.&&He also wrote his character's final speech in Blade Runner. A great talent.&&Blind Fury is the shit though.&&The way I always saw it was that he kept Deckard alive, not to show his humanity, but to be a witness. 

He knows his memories will be lost when he dies ""like tears, in rain"" but having someone around to remember him, keeps him alive in some respects, if only in memory or someone else. 

If you don't believe in a god, (and Roy killed his creator) they say you have two deaths, the 1st is the day your body dies, and the 2nd is when the last time your name is spoken or you are remembered.

So in a way Roy's entire crew is dead, if he kills Deckard it will be like no one ever knew he existed. So he keeps him alive, the only witness to his existence.&&More compassionate than a one-man slaughterhouse.&&and that's why I'll never buy Scott's much later retcon that Deckard was a replicant, it utterly defeats the purpose of the movie&&I just saw the movie for the first time about a month ago and was completely floored. The attention to detail in near enough every scene was mind jarring. The script was also fantastic. Going to catch a matinee on Thursday with a buddy when I get home from work. This thread is makimg me excited.&&I think the second movie is a MUCH better movie overall (not taking in account release date and budget, obviously).

The problem that the first one has, is that it's meant to be a detective story/mistery, but there's no real discovery, there's no ""A HA!"" moment going on.

The closest you can get to is the ""investigation on the snake's scales/the tattoo"", after that it all sort of falls into place, the mystery is secondary, almost an afterthought.

Second movie has an actual plot going on which makes the progression much more enjoyable in my opinion.&&> The Deckard / Rachael relationship is pretty ~~forced~~

I think the word you're looking for is here ""rapey"" -- which *2049* seems to understand the implications of.&&That relationship was literally forced. As in he pretty much raped that girl. I didn't fell that seen was consensual at all. &&My favorite thing about it is that the same content could have been delivered in half the time, but they weren't afraid to linger on scenes, take their time, and let the viewer digest what was happening. The frenetic jump-cut style of Hollywood film gets tiring after awhile. Plus, such a gorgeous film so I didn't mind staring for bit.&&I am very comfortable with long movies, but I agree that Blade Runner is a particular instance that doesn’t feel anywhere near as long as its actual runtime. Which is great. &&Honestly loved the film but felt the opposite. It felt about 30 or minutes too long with entire characters that didn't need to exist. I don't think any runtime is too long really but that should never be an excuse for not having a concise script.&&Like the clusterfuck that the Alien franchise has become. Seriously, the first and second one were all you needed and they were perfect. All the other stuff is just pulling down the whole franchise; I don't want that for Blade Runner.&&Yeah and it sucks but it is what it is, people who feel like they want more should definitely ""vote with their dollar"", but I still think Hollywood has a role in fostering what is seen as ""good escapism"". 
 &&I personally consider myself a pretty casual movie-goer...I love escapism and generally don't want to rack my brain plodding through some overly dense arthouse movie that's annoyingly abstract and obtuse just because ""art"". When I first saw Blade Runner, I was not a fan - too slow and boring. I watched it again recently with expectations adjusted and knowing from the start that the replicants aren't just generic bad guys and liked it more...still didn't *love* it, but I enjoyed it enough especially due to the atmosphere and can see why it'd be more impressive back in the day.

I LOVED Blade Runner 2049. I feel it provided great escapism while also being a cerebral movie with amazing atmosphere and style. It's too soon to make the official call, but I believe when the dust settles it will be in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. Just to reinforce how casual and non-artsy of a moviegoer I am, TRON: Legacy is my current #1 personal favorite movie of all time, which I know is not what many would call a ""great"" movie by any stretch of the imagination.&&Also, like it or not big budge movies HAVE to consider international sales, including very restrictive but large markets like China. Deep humor, thoughtful conversations, etc *do not translate well or easily*. Action, visuals, simple humor, simplistic straightforward plots and drama do.&&I honestly don't think marketing spent all that much to be completely fair. I haven't seen a single ad on TV, the internet, or in theatres. Either their using targeted advertising and Google's algorithms are good enough to know that I am going to go see the movie anyways.

Edit: marketing did spend a fair amount, however, they didn't utilize the full power of targeted advertising very well and relied slightly too heavily on traditional forms of distribution which simply didn't line up with some of the possible viewers of the film.&&No I'm pretty sure the 150 mil is with the marketing. &&Unfortunately, my 2 year old dictator limits my movie theater visits, but the wife and I are still hoping to see it in theater. We already rewatched the original last week.&&Completely agree. Taking in each scene was like enjoying a glass of good whiskey. You had to savour it. It gave to time to contemplate and philosophise over it.&&I'm saying this as someone who considers Bladerunner one of their favorite films of all time, but it sounds like you might have blacked out the scene where Deckard enhances, pulls in and tracks right, which comprises roughly 92.5% of the total running time of the movie.&&It's not so much about the development in scenes, it's that scenes were calmer with few camera angles and less movement. They linger. They were less efficient and left a lot of space for atmosphere. &&I love the scene where he unwraps the horse because the film sort of deals with these ideas of uncertainty. Like, as an audience member we all knew the horse was going to be what he unwrapped but the prolonged pause on the shot of him unwrapping it and the tense music, it put me on the edge of the seat to the point where I sort of forgot about it obviously being the horse and just put myself in K's headspace in that moment. That is one of the most memorable experiences I have watching that movie. &&You are not alone.  Strongly feel that 2049 (which I loved) was slower than the original.  The original moves along at a decent clip, with [Deckard tracking down the various replicants and facing them one by one, all of the interactions between Batty and third parties (Tyrell and others), the entire plotline with the replicants getting into J F Sebastian's apartment, etc](#spoiler).

In comparison, in 2049 basically [K investigates two replicants and pretty much everything in the film is just him pursuing Deckard as part of tracking down the second one, albeit not for the original reason he was ordered to do that](#spoiler).

I feel like people who think the original is slow are mixing up a lack of explicit exposition with pacing.&&I really wanted a sequel... So yes, I wanted more.&&Wanting more and the film being overly long aren't exclusive. The movie itself could have used some trimming, but it did an excellent job with the story and setting that draws you in.

However, I really hope they don't do any more, at least not for a long time. It's a small miracle that this sequel to a 35 year old classic came out so well.&&That and the fact that most of the subplots were left unresolved. The rebellion for example.&&I refuse to call him anything but K. 

Joe is what every Joi calls their lover. Their customers are average, everyday Joes that they'll spend their lives with, versus the one-shot Johns the prostitutes have. &&[I agree that K was at least satisfied that he died for purpose, perhaps as a domino in something bigger. But I think that his serene death may be more of an *acceptance* of his short and strange existence, reflecting on how inconsequential he is. It doesn't matter if his experiences with Joi were *real*, those experiences did happen and will now be gone ""like tears in rain"".](#spoiler)

The fact that we are still discussing this though is my point. It's a layered movie that asked a lot of the audience and didn't answer questions for us so clearly. It can be interpreted many ways.&&I thought it was an interesting point where K is a replicant but throughout the movie the audience almost sympathizes with him and I felt like he redeemed himself earning his ""humanity"" at the end. If we are going to go as far to accept that, why wouldn't we be willing to consider Joi's humanity as well? Where is the threshold of biological integrity that defines humanity?  &&[To be honest, I'm not sure how much he actually cares about being the first domino or starting a rebellion. The rebel leader actually asked him to kill Deckard to avoid endangering the miracle child by leading Wallace or the police to her. K doesn't do this. He makes a decision to instead bring Deckard to meet his daughter, opening her up to potential discovery. I interpreted this as K becoming more human by exercising agency instead of following orders like a dog as he had for much of the movie.](#spoiler)

[The real power of the movie is that like the original, it raises big questions like ""what does it mean to be human?"" and ""what can be considered real?"". These are questions without definitive answers, and they inspire different interpretations that lead to discussions like this. So in summation, I like Blade Runner.](#spoiler)&&I had the exact same reflections while exiting the theater. I thought K dying on the steps, looking at the snow falling is a direct reference to the tears in the rain of the first movie.

The scene in the first movie is making a point that experiences you have define your existence. Even if they're engineered they're alive since they experienced the world and die.

In 2049, it's about what it means to be someone, an individual. K goes trough the arc of thinking he's a drone, then a miracle and then just another piece in the machine, just no the one he first thought.

Looking at the snow falling, I can't help thinking of the phrase ""special snowflake"". I think that by rejecting all the plans anyone else has for him and choosing his own end, K made himself special/unique.&&[The advertisement says outright ""What you want to see, what you want to hear"" which to me was an indicator that she was programmed to tell him what he wanted to hear and never had free will beyond her programming. It also may say something about the unfulfillment of consumerism. Anyways, this crushing realization is one of the things that pushes him to make a decision to disobey both Wallace and the rebellion and help Deckard get to his daughter instead as an act of his own free will](#spoiler)&&[deleted]&&Would the different eye color be enough to not meet the ""programming requirements""?  It would not be the exact same DNA.&&Or replicants have free will. &&Haven't saw 2049, but I own the director cut of the first one, it's one of my favorites &&Vaporwave indeed.&&I would trust him with the rumored Matrix reboot nobody wants.

I think that's saying a lot lol&&Right there with ya!&&I'm not sure what's happened to the definition of the word ""franchise"". 

Dune is a book. To franchise Dune is to use it's defined properties to create new product. It's already a franchise. It was a franchise the moment anything but the original book was put to market.&&This might not belong in a museum! &&Aside from being a sequel, Blade Runner 2049 was Black Mirror the Movie + Her 2.0 with baddies + the Island.  Definitely not original. &&Arrival didn't do too bad.  Made $100 million (domestic) on a $47 mil budget.

District 9 actually did pretty well with $115 million (domestic) on a $30 mil budget.

Both made double that if you're looking at the worldwide box office numbers.

&&Ex Machina is incredible. &&Ex Machina is my favourite movie ever. Definitely a great movie for anyone to go in to completely blind.&&Equilibrium was cool too&&PREDESTINATION: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_21&&Thank you for jumping in with Gattaca. Such a wonderful movie.&&Omg I never see people talk about GATTACA! I only heard of it because my Norwegian genetics professor mentioned it when explaining something about genetics. It's quite a special movie with some great acting and provocative themes. &&If we are talking animation then Akira also

Edit: and the books are even better at really pulling apart the characters relationships and showing you how mad it really was&&[deleted]&&Original GITS and Innonence are both must sees for fans of Blade Runner. I like how both aren't just similar in style, but in their existential questions of what it means to be considered conscious, what it means to be alive, etc. &&I only recently watched the commentaries on my disc.  
Roger Ebert loved the shit outta that movie, and I gotta admit that I totally saw what he liked.  

Oh, btw, which way *is* it to Shell Beach?&&now that's a cult classic!&&Not to mention the cinematography. Man, that movie is a really spectacular example of continuous cuts, and creating an excellent sense of cohesion and immersion with a camera, actors, and on-location sets.


edit: *a* word&&isnt District 9 that style as well. the movies arent about the looks its just a backdrop on a ""what if"" scenario&&Alfonso Cuaron fucking knocked that out of the park &&I've had Children of Men sitting in my Plex library for a couple months now, and I think it's finally time to watch it - especially since I've been sick in bed all week and don't think I'll be getting out to see 2049 just yet. This description has me pretty excited to see it.&&And his follow-up Mute looks to be really taking some aesthetic from Blade Runner. &&I second Moon. So far it has been my favorite sci-fi until it moved to make place for BR2049. Moon is so small as a movie, yet great as sci-fi. Very emotional.&&I can’t wait for Annihilation!!!&&Best dance scene ever &&Fantastic movie for the first three quarters. An absurd one for the last.&&Sorely underappreciated film. &&Seconded.  That movie is a gem that almost no one watched.&&The sequel is just starting to make the rounds. Can't wait for it to be available in a more widespread manner. [Man From Earth: Holocene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I41GPIMZu0E)&&> If you want books I suggest Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

Theres also the recent [Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick's_Electric_Dreams) TV show by Channel 4, 4 Episodes in and its been pretty good so far.&&My schedule for today lists a six-hour self accusatory depression.  
&&That's a really good point too. I think they basically took the concept of ""downtown vs suburbia"" and extended it to ""world vs off world"". &&Not exactly.  He re-wrote the final speech.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_in_rain_monologue&&I think Anthony hopkins spoke it better in the sky advert though &&The idea I think also is that he taught Deckard about humanity, not just as a witness but as someone who would understand. That's what that whole chase was about. He could have killed him much sooner but he was teaching him a lesson: _""Quite a thing to live in fear. That's what its like to be a slave.""_

Whether you take Deckard as a human or a Replicant the lesson is powerful either way. The one being killed for not being human is more human than his killers.&&What I really appreciated about the movie is how almost none of the plot is spoiled in the trailers.  Compared with something like Spiderman that ruins everything.

If I were you I would avoid all related threads until after you see the movie. &&Do yourself a favor and see it in Imax. It's so worth it for the large scale sweeping shots, and a normal theater won't do the score and sound effects justice.&&In the book, the purpose of Rachael is explicitly to attract Deckard / other Blade Runners and mess up their ability to retire replicants. I may have missed something, but it seemed like that was pretty much laid out in _2049_, while it was a lot more ambiguous in the first movie, quite intentionally.&&Idk about if 2049 seems to understand it, they seem to try to cover it up a little, like commenting that ""she clearly is into him"" when listening to the test. &&>I didn't fell that seen was consensual at all.

I always thought that was the point.  Rachael was a replicant, a sub-human, and Deckard knew that.  In-universe Deckard's actions would not have been rape, just the action of a lonely man fucking a toaster.  However, Deckard's arc involves him becoming more accepting that replicants and humans are the same, thus in a retroactive way the act is rape from his new perspective.  Because of Deckard's new perspective on replicants you could also call him a murderer for just doing his job.  It was a great way to show the shifting shades of gray within the story.&&The fact that they linger on shots really makes the setting seem a lot more monolithic. &&Half of this movie is K looking at things.&&Terminator as well&&It's a miracle we can have the original Blade Runner thats a classic and a sequel thats just as good or better. I'd rather it stay that way. But part of me thinks Villeneuve can make a third and not fuck up. He's been on a winning streak. &&No. I'm positive that's not accurate. They never include marketing and distribution in those numbers, largely because it's ongoing.&&We sent the kids to grandma's house for a sleepover so we could watch the Final Cut of Bladerunner and then go see 2049. Totally worth it. We couldn't remember the last time we'd watched an R rated movie. It was fantastic. 

Edit: we saw it in IMAX, and the theater was only about half full. That made us sad, because it's such a great film. &&Seems like a lot of the original bladerunner fans have young kids. Three colleagues of mine have been endlessly plotting a way to go watch it.&&CSI got nothing on blade runner&&Or the flight to police station where they just admire the view?!&&To be fair, I fell asleep during that sequence, woke up, and it was still going. 

My favorite subtle joke in Super Troopers is, ""Enhance....Enhance...""

2049, by contrast, felt downright elegant. It knew where it was going, so the journey was very much deliberate. 

The original, with greater ambiguity at its heart, meandered accordingly, or at least that's how it felt. &&I couldn't really enjoy the original. I love Harrison Ford, I love old movies, love sci-fi, I loved the whole idea of the plot, the universe, props, like so much... But I just wasn't enjoying it that much. Maybe expected too much? I really like the idea of a simpler sci-fi film, as someone said earlier, not this huge explosive thing like Star Wars (which are my favorite films), so I enjoyed that feel to it as well.&&we are allowed to soak in the movie and what it's presenting to us. it was in absolutely zero rush and was made all the better for it, IMO. It's quite like a wizard: it was neither too fast nor too slow. it went at precisely the pace it was meant to.&&Not even a sequel per se, just more stuff set in the same universe with the same creators at the helm&&Yeah I'd say it needed maybe 10 mins of trimming. Where Deckard shows up there seemed to be some superfluous edits and the pacing derailed...slightly.

Still, as you say it's a miracle it turned out so good. When I first saw was this was being made, I rolled my eyes given the guff that Hollywood as produced in recent years in the name of revivals and sequals.&&I'd rather that, in my humble opinion, than an ending narration perfectly tying up all the loose ends with a pretty bow.  Yes, both leaving everything unexplained and explaining absolutely everything are shitty writing techniques, but the former at least has some consideration for the intelligence of the audience while the latter is generally done ham-fisted.&&It didn't need to be resolved. We got one complete character arc for K/""Joe,"" which is the point. &&I hated that they opened that can of worms so close to the end, and just kind of popped it up out of nowhere with no further explanation.  Now I want a movie showing the aftermath of an android revolution and what happens when they take over.&&> It doesn't matter if his experiences with Joi were real, those experiences did happen and will now be gone ""like tears in rain"".

did anyone else notice that during most of K/Joi's more intimate scenes it's always raining?&&Joi's character was done so well I thought. It made you question what makes you you. In the movie, it's not your memories, as many people can be given the same ones. Is it the programming of a holographic girlfriend? There's no individuality there as they are pumped out a factory. Deckard is asked if he knows if he's been programmed to act how he does or not, and in classic Harrison Ford stubbornness, he barks, ""I know what's real!"" And that's true. It doesn't matter if someone tells you what isn't real. If a replicant mocks you for not liking ""real"" women, it doesn't matter. What's real for you is what does. That's why K looks mad at the ad for another Joi. Sure, it will be technically the same, but it wouldn't be real for him anymore.&&[I found it interesting that aside from the love aspect of their relationship, Joi was the one who continuously told K that he was 'special' and 'different' and that she always knew there was more to him. At that point in the movie the audience believes K *is* the child and so simply nod along with what she's saying, when the reality is that she's telling him what he wants to hear. And I think that's important, the fact she was telling him this stuff shows that even though he tried to deny or reject it at first, deep down he *wanted* to be special, he wanted to be different. And by believing he was for a short time, he failed his basic test, showing it was his belief that he was different that made him more human.](#spoiler)&&[Rachel had brown eyes, not green. I think Deckard was just fucking with Wallace in a way to say I don't care what you put in front of me. It's not the real her because it doesn't have her memories. Even if he's programmed to love Rachel, it should be clear to him that it's not the same one.](#spoiler)&&Deckard was actually straight up [lying](https://fogsmoviereviews.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/20110821-074909.jpg) there. ;)&&The first is (or maybe was...) my all-time favourite. I've seen the new one twice already, and I might go watch it again.&&Arrival certainly was a hit if not a smash hit ($225MM+ worldwide with video in on $47MM production). Profitable by any metric. District 9 was a sensational hit based on its budget ($210MM+ and video sales on ~$30MM production) but I don't think anyone was really doubting that or at least they shouldn't be.

Moon, Sunshine, Children of Men... less so. I think the first two likely were around profitable but not hugely so (Moon shows ~$16MM ttd on a $5MM budget, Sunshine about $40MM on $40MM so likely a loser) and CoM didn't meet expectations (about $70MM on $70MM production budget) but what the hell, it was a movie worth making regardless. Erm, Eternal Sunshine (as in Of The Spotless Mind) did rather well though!&&I've seen a lot of people talking about Ex Machina recently and I'm so glad it's managed to stick with everyone like it did for me. In 50 years I want it to be considered a classic.&&lookin' forward to Annihilation? Same dude behind Ex Machina. &&SUNSHINE: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448134/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&&Not really, only half-fucked. Its not that far away from SAC series in its mood. &&I liked it.&&Eh its good in other ways. Plot and themes are pretty trash but visually it is gorgeous&&Second star to the right and straight on til morning.&&You're looking for the express.&&the crow, dark city and the matrix. that's the only 'matrix' trilogy you need. &&The final fight scene in that film is probably the closest to being in a war that film can portray.

I think Children of Men is more accessible and even almost *important* to watch, I always recommend it to people.

It's only an hour and a half too which is amazing for how fantastic that movie is&&Watch it and thank us later. Hands down my favorite movie ever. Let me know what you think&&Blade Runners

Reminded me of 12 Angry Men.&&Having seen and loved the first one, that looks... really bad&&How much do we actually know about the Off Worlds? I think the only details we know are:

Humans live on nine worlds. People spend a lot of money to leave Earth, implying off-world is higher class/safer/less polluted/etc.

There are only eight planets in our solar system, so by ""nine worlds"" (he didn't say planets) they probably colonized a number of Saturn's and Jupiter's moons, plus Mars and whatever planets are habitable. Maybe our own moon but maybe not. Possibly large asteroids or even space stations. It's also likely they haven't moved beyond the solar system.&&Nah, 2049 went in the opposite direction from the book.

Book spoilers: [The sex scene in the book is because Deckard has to retire an android with Rachel's exact model and he was trying to make sure he doesn't have any feelings for her which he concludes explicitly that he does not.](#spoiler)&&I think Wallace said it during the scene where new Rachel is brought out for Decker. Something about whether it was a true attraction or whether they were designed to be attracted to each other. &&I've never really looked at it that way - I always felt he treated her as a human even when he knew the truth. In a way that's what makes Deckard such an interesting character - he believes that killing replicants is wrong and dislikes the work, even though he feels that he has to do what's required of him. Reluctant gunslinger and all that...

That scene is certainly problematic, but I saw it as his attempt to break through Rachael's inhibitions, because he knew there was something there. It wouldn't work in today's cinema, but I'm fairly sure it was a common enough trope at the time. Hell, half of the Bond movies have similar scenes.&&I don't think you guys are fully understanding what's going on in this scene. Deckard is full of self-loathing because he knows what he does for a living is wrong. That's why they basically have to force him back into the job. His emotional attachment to Rachel, a replicant, shatters the thin facade that replicants are less than human and disposable. 

Rachel makes Deckard's worldview impossible and their scene together in his apartment reflects his anger and frustration at his place in the world. &&Yes, this exactly.  Then add in that incredible soundtrack, holy shit.  Talk about capturing the feel of the the first movie and taking it to the next level.  That literally was the fastest I have ever felt a 2.5+ hour movie go.&&I mean, that’s the longest and best look we get at the cityscape so I’m not complaining &&I just want to explore more of the Blade Runner world, the artists did a great job.&&I thought that too, but when reporters asked Ridley Scott how he got Ford (who had rejected previous attempts at a sequel) to sign on he said Ford thought the script was the best he had ever read.

This movie had a hell of a bar to keep between continuing a beloved cult classic and the expectations Scott and Ford set for it, and it delivered. &&Could you see [Deckard's daughter](#spoiler) wanting any part of a violent rebellion though? Or even K, if he had discovered that it really was him? I thought that was dramatic irony. Freya thinks that the solution to achieving equality with humanity is through violence, but a theme of both movies is that valuing life is a key part of being human.&&Yeah that last thing it needed was some cliched rebellion with the good guys winning and happy ever after.&&It's always raining in Blade Runner&&[I more noticed that there was a lot of crying, and as far as I can remember, all the tears were from characters that aren't 'real'.](#spoiler)

Seemed intentional.&&Replicants can't lie.

*immediately says that she's going to lie*&&Watched the original the night after seeing the sequel. I thought the same thing during the first image of Rachel walking in from the hallway. But in the subsequent interview with close-ups of her eye reactions, her eye color is clearly greenish.&&Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaacs both deserved Oscars for that movie.&&I'd say that its definitely on its way to becoming one&&Its so damn mesmerizing&&This is excellent news, thanks! &&MOON: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&&One of my favorite movies. The final act kind of loses it, but damn if the first 2/3 of the movie aren’t amazing. &&I agree, it wasnt as bad as some people make it out to be.

Honestly, i almost feel like the majority of the people that said the GitS live action movie sucked were people that didnt watch any of the animated stuff until a few months before the movie. My friends and I thought the movie was *okay*. Not good or great, which we wanted, but not ridiculously horrible like the Avatar or Dragonball movies&&They got the mood but not the feel, which is the normal point that live action adaptations fail at.&&It's really, really, really far away from SAC.  Motoko being upset at *not* being the only full prosthetic is bananas; everyone she knew in Section 9 was only there because it costs so much to maintain your body that you basically have to be a government slave, might as well work at a fun unit with some autonomy like S9.  And the fact that the animation dives into her being born a full prosthetic with no memory of biology is again worlds different in all tone.  Motoko isn't the angsty Scarlet character at all.  

Movie was fun, but not at all like GITS animation or manga in any format.  Basically it's a Stand Alone Film.  

I compare it to Starship Troopers or WWZ.  If you can get over how it has almost nothing to do with the source material other than the basic universal theme, you'll like it for what it is rather than what it isn't.  Get hung up on everything being wrong and you'll hate it.&&The car ambush scene in the woods was amazing too.&&It feels that way because it's one long take and your point of view. From the  moment they start out for the apartment building until they reach the second floor is one long shot. There is a shot like that in Full Metal Jacket. When the platoon advances towards a group of buildings. &&Yeah, clearly the plots go in two very different directions, but I think the implication was she was still deployed for that purpose.

[Also, I think you are wrong on your summary of the book. There is another bounty hunter who is totally unfeeling, but Deckard falls for her.](#spoiler) The book and movies are pretty divergent plot wise without question, but if you start to forget that the ultra-strong, mostly amoral replicants aren't just like humans, that's the point of both works.&&It could have been interpreted as ""rachel was possibly designed to be attractive to you""&&The soundtrack really was amazing. I only have 2 scores in my music library, but this will be the third.&&Exactly. The world felt so deep. It felt like you could get an almost endless amount of stories from it. Just like the first one the story just picks up at a random point in the worlds timeline and ends at another random point. The start and ends are important for the main characters but are relatively unimportant on the world scale.

Harvey Weinstein Officially Forced Out of His Own Company,37348,7554zy,http://variety.com/2017/biz/news/harvey-weinstein-out-weinstein-company-1202583568/,5398,1507504415.0,,"So the biggest question is..why did he lose his protection that has shrouded him for so long? I'm pretty sure it's not just because the NYT got ahold of some info. All the media orgs have been privy to his behavior over the last 2 decades, so SOMETHING happened for someone important to finally say ""fuck Harvey"".&&They all knew about it, theyre only firing him now because WE finally know about it after 30 years&&All these old-rich-pervert stories end the same: with justice coming at the last 10% of their lives or so. 

They're getting a little old for the shenannigans anyway, so it's too little too late. They've had their fun at the expense of so many people, and he's probably ready to retire, so it's hard to be happy about this.&&It's official, Harvey has been forced out.

**From the article:**

Harvey Weinstein has been forced out of the independent film company he co-founded and catapulted to Oscar glory, felled by a mushrooming sexual harassment scandal that has hobbled his status as a media mogul and left his future in Hollywood in jeopardy. The Weinstein Company’s board of directors has voted to remove Weinstein from the studio, leaving control of the company in the hands of Weinstein’s brother, Bob Weinstein, and chief operating officer David Glasser, it was announced in a statement from the company Sunday.

**Edit**: It appears to have been a unanimous decision by the board, per THR.

**Edit**: Statement from The Weinstein Company:

> In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company — Robert Weinstein, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Tarak Ben Ammar — have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately.

**Edit**: Per THR

> Weinstein's rep, Sallie Hofmeister told THR: ""I can’t reach him at the moment. He’s unavailable. Apologies""&&I was a personal assistant for a minute in LA, any time a young actress asked my boss for advice he would say ""Dont end up on your knees on Harvey Weinsteins jet""
&&Does anyone remember a show called ""Action"" that was on Fox for about 20 minutes, about 20 years ago?  Jay Mohr played a Hollywood agent trying to maintain his sense of morality while playing the Hollywood game.  It was a pretty brutal send-up of Hollywood culture.  

I remember a scene where Jay's character had to go to the house of a famous producer, a pudgy, balding man who took a shower while Jay was watching.  When he stepped out of the shower he just sort of glanced downward and smirked as if to say ""impressive, huh""?  

I'd heard at the time that they cancelled the show because it hit a little too close to home for some Hollywood personalities.  It was pretty savage.&&[deleted]&&[Article from 7 years ago](http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/harveys-girls-the-wouldbe-ingenues-where-are-they-now-and-what-happened-then.php) 
""Every few years, Harvey picks a new girl as his pet. He puts her in a picture or two, takes her to an event, and not unlike Cher Horowitz, makes her a project, an attempted creation.
The Harvey Girls are easily spotted. They are all very pretty, often in a rather generic sense. Their instant fame and the push behind them comes seemingly out of nowhere and without any justification in terms of resume or skill set. Most obviously, at least as of 2007, they are clothed exclusively in Marchesa on the red carpet (the fashion line of Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman). So if you were wondering why Harvey Weinstein seems only interested in actresses who dress like fairy princesses from Planet Sugarplum, it’s his wife’s fault. But the most telling sign, if you’re looking, is the Want. These girls, each of them, has the look of desperation, of need. They WILL be famous. They WILL be stars."" 

edit: thanks to u/JC-ice for the list in a comment below

Mira Sorvino, Uma Thurman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gretchen Mol, Sienna Miller, Jessica Alba, Olivia Wilde, Jennifer Lawrence, Blake Lively, Zendaya Coleman. All allegedly. (Edit: and someone just suggested Marion Cotillard and/or Michelle Williams. Also forgot Scarlett Johansen).
Ashley Judd refused his advances/offer.
We don't know exactly what happened with Rose McGowan other than she got a settlement of 100k and probably signed an NDA. But she clearly hates the guy and has implied he was a rapist.&&Sadly, I don’t think it’s the immorality of his behavior that took him down. That’s been pretty common knowledge for years. His company was struggling back in 2015 and in debt up to its eyeballs, which likely hasn’t changed. I’m betting one (or more) of their investors/insurers/financiers decided Harvey was too much of a liability and required his dismissal. Pretty much all of the company’s film library is in hock due to massive debt restructuring.

I promise his firing did not result from the NYT story - the NYT story resulted from the decision that Harvey had to go. The story was strategic and gave him little recourse. Rumor is that Bob engineered this powerplay and went on record for the first time. Bob and Glasser are profiting from this somehow, not just saving face.&&i once listened to the olivia munn audiobook, and she told  a strange story of a hollywood exec exposing himself, or i guess it could have been a prosthetic.  she didn't identify the person of course, but i have to wonder if it was weinstein.&&All of these revelations are now making me wonder ""what other older men in Hollywood are actually serial predators?""

I'm glad the culture is causing more and more people to stand up to these arseholes&&Good riddance. &&The silence about this from rank and file Hollywood is both sickening and cowardly.&&Wow. I expected this as a final outcome, but not so suddenly after the allegations had been made. Hoping karmageddon finally hits this asshole like brick wall, although the cynic in me suspects he will stay afloat in the industry similar to Faraci's surreptitious role at Alamo Drafthouse.

I'll be curious to hear the reactions from actresses like Paltrow and Lawrence, who Weinstein certainly established.&&What has Quentin Tarantino or Kevin Smith or Spike Lee said about this whole thing? &&I wonder if the outings that have been happening in the last few months mark a true change moving forward in the film community, or if this is just a fluke of formerly powerful men that lose power only to then be vulnerable to the consequences of their horrible actions.&&There have been recent scandals and cover ups in the British media too. [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), who was a TV and radio host, molested and bullied vulnerable people for years and the BBC covered it up for their own benefit. After his death hundreds of people came forward to say they had been a victim.&&That's gotta be rough but he could've expected no less.

It's also entirely possible that he can get decisions (or at least influence them) through his brother who I suppose he'll still talk to.&&[deleted]&&Now that this is out, I wonder if Cory Feldman will come out and name all the execs that raped him and Cory Haim.&&It really is pathetic how many Hollywood elites have a zipper attached to their lips though. 

I think the only action I have seen thus far is  $30,000 returned from the democratic party (out of $300k+), and a couple actresses coming forward.  Everyone else is like ""yea, it was an open secret""&&The past few days I've been confusing Harvey Weinstein with Harvey Fierstein. Things make a lot more sense now.&&One down, a thousand or so to go. Time to clean house, Hollywood.

&&A known sleazebag for decades, but only now receives his comeuppance because the Weinstein company was *publicly* embarrassed. That is the key takeaway from each of these scenarios. &&""they busted you for good this time Harvey.  ya gotta go.  see you at the pool party next week.""&&While he deserves this vitriol and defeat, I'm curious as to why specifically now, after all this time, does everything crash down against him. 

He pissed someone powerful off, I guarantee it. &&If roman Polanski is loved and accepted by Hollywood this guy will be fine in a bit &&If you think this case is pretty bad just wait until the truth about Dan Schneider is known. Oh man what a shitstorm that will be. &&Good. I really hope his life goes further down the shitter after this. Piece of fucking shit. Wish nothing but the worst. &&Well this is not surprising and is this runs pretty deep in Hollywood, it's absolutely disgusting.

People seem to forget that the ""casting couch"" has been around for a long, long time. (casting couch = producer telling young actor ""you want a part, you gotta have sex with me."")

I used to be a development intern for a company I won't name in Sunset Blvd. and everyday you could all these hot unknown girls (mostly models) coming in to see the producer for a ""part"".

Also I don't know if you guys have heard about Soho House in West Hollywood which is only for exclusive members of the industry. I went there once Friday night and I saw a bunch of young hot girls with old dudes (mostly producers) all over the place.
&&member when Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood told everyone hollywood is full of pedos? tip of the iceberg here.&&Very telling about the lack of vocal outrage from the hollywood elite about this cocksucking perv. This guy is the tip of the iceberg of sick deviant behavior that goes on with hollywood....and they are all trying to get in front of this.&&Surely he's the only one on the board with a history of abusing women.&&Pretty interesting to think about our global communications landscape as it currently exists. From public, on-the-record allegations (granted, regarding behaviour that’s been whispered about for decades) that started last Thursday, it only took three days for a powerful Hollywood mogul to be fired from his own company. 

I can’t even begin to imagine how many more public figures, whether justifiably or not, are soon to be eviscerated by the court of public opinion. &&I wish this signalled a shoft in thinking in Hollywood and film, but I sincerely doubt it. Nor do I believe that hisbrepuatation will be tarnished in any lasting way from this. 

Gene Roddenberry sexually harassed a number of star trek stars and others, yet fans are all too willing to sweep it under the rug for the contribution he made to science fiction, etc. He was still a pile of sh**. And the industry, and star trek fan in particular, need to acknowledge this and move beyond this as acceptable behavior. 

I love you, star trek, but damn do you make it hard.

And f*** you Gene Roddenberry.&&Are they going to rename his company?&&Just remember he want sacked because the board found out, he was sacked because you found out&&the REAL problem is the folks at his firm that forced him out KNEW this was going on for years and never did a fucking thing about it until it was exposed. They should ALL resign!  WTF!&&God, I remember watching the Oscars a few years back, and it was so cringey. Everyone was bending over backwards to suck the man's cock. The most uttered phrase was ""Thank's, Harvey"", as if he was the fount of all things good in Hollywood. &&Breaking News: Hollywood is FILLED with these guys. He is only one of MANY. &&>""...decades of legal settlements stemming from sexual harassment allegations leveled by former employees and associates...""

They knew because they've been quietly hiding this and paying off the accusers up to this point. Apparently, it has just now gotten to a level of publicity and financial loss that actually need to separate him from the company.&&Lorne Michaels says SNL didn't joke about Weinstein because he's from New York.

Well, so is Trump.&&Hollywood is a dark and perverse place. Wouldn't surprise me to find out this is just the surface of corruption.&&It's no shock.  We've known for years from articles rumoring about how horrible he is.  Produced a lot of great movies, though, so it was an open sore that everyone allowed.

We know from at least since Gretchen Moll that she was a Harvey girl, and probably years before that.  Look at any hot blonde he produced that won a questionable Oscar, get a Vanity Fair cover, or wears his wife's dresses.  Harvey girls.

A damning thing is not the women brave enough to come forward, but all of those who kept silent because Harvey helped their careers.&&Still no warrant out for Brian Singer.&&What's with Hollywood and all the horror stories about sexual abuse?&&Did anyone see how SNL blasted him?

Hmmm, no? nobody did.  &&ITT: Reddit knows all about the inner workings of Hollywood&&The other owners are probably all deviants too, their secrets just haven’t gotten out. They don’t care about the sexual assault, they’re saving their own asses. &&So how many people part of the Weinstein company knew thos guy was regularly assaulting women? How many of them did it themselves? 

Sounds like they offered up a sacrifice. Now th media will be focused on this guy and the nest of predators will keep on doing as they please. 

&&“Mr Weinstein, on behalf of the Weinstein company, you are removed from the Weinstein company, yours sincerely, the Weinstein CEOs&&Can we just give a moment of thanks for badass Tina Fey, calling out these sexual predators through her work before it was cool or safe to do so? Harvey Weinstein has thrown people against walls for making jokes about him so it's not like it was nothing.&&Everyone on the board is acting like they are shocked by this behavior and they had no idea what was going on. It reminds me of the behavior of officials in MLB during the steroid scandal. Makes me sick. You know everyone in Hollywood knew. &&Sexual misconduct by a high profile person always makes me scratch my head. Think about how much of a creep he has to be that his own brother voted him out. Obviously sexual based actions that aren't warranted by anyone are bottom of the barrel type of shit. Sure there are affairs and infidelity all over Hollywood but when you take shit to the level of harassment, creeper chills set in. This ogre for instance. You have plenty of fuck you money, you wanna get freaky and weird I'm not judging. Hire an Ashley Judd lookalike, fill your basement with hookers dressed as business professionals, put on your latex suit and let that freak flag fly. Walk around smacking asses , eating Buffalo wings and give a helicopter performance with your junk all you want. In the privacy of your secluded basement. Wake up the next morning, take the gag ball out, pay those whores, tie your tie, and go run your empire. 

Or lose total control of yourself and do what you do thinking it'll never be found out. That's what Pee-wee thought.&&Good. Fuck him

Now lets get the pedos out of hollywood.

 Elijah Wood  and Corey Feldman have already basically  already told us its true but no one wants to do anything  because  we might not get our  great  summer blockbusters like Ghostbusters  2016 and Batman  v Superman. 

Enough is enough. Please let this be the  snowflake that becomes an avalanche &&After Hollywood's worst kept secret finally comes to light I'm glad there are finally going to be consequences. There was a great segment on it with Kim Masters from THR on Press Play on KCRW on Thursday. &&I sometimes wonder if the reason these scandals stay hidden for so long is that the only way to get ahead in Hollywood, Wall Street, and DC is to have skeletons in your closet. That someone with a clear conscience is seen as untrustworthy, but someone with baggage is easier to control. So I wonder if everyone with power is in their position precisely because they have a secret(s), and they're actually terrified of being exposed, so everyone stays quiet in concert.

But that sounds crazy so I don't say it out loud.&&Has kevin smith commented on this yet?&&Good fucking riddance!!! I will understand why that d-bag gave the Academy a ton of money for Best Picture victory like ""Shakespeare in Love"" over 'Saving Private Ryan"" and everybody else. Like, seriously?&&He stopped hitting home runs.&&Idk man, things like this can he random. Why did Cosby go down when he did? Or the Catholic Church in Boston?  &&Probably served his purpose and is no longer useful. Scary to think that maybe others are able to step up to fill the gap.

This stuff has gone on in Hollywood for years. NONE of the outspoken actresses/actors are saying a word. Completely changes my idea of them. Sick people who are so thirsty for a chance in the spotlight that they will compromise their morals. Shame. &&The board: ""I am shocked—shocked—to find that gambling is going on in here!""&&Anyone who was paying attention to it knew about it. This is the first time it's turned into wide public knowledge (accusations).

In other words, this was the first time it was bad for business.&&I wonder just how much WE still don't know about this scumbag.  &&Meryl Streep just warmly called Harvey Weinstein ""God"" at the Golden Globes last year.  And a few years ago she gave Roman Polanski a standing ovation at the Oscars.  Maybe she's in character for the role of a rich, hypocritical Hollywood celebrity who feigns moral righteousness unless it has the potential to impact her pocketbook.  She doing a great job playing that role so far.  &&Key comment here&&My buddy is a cinematographer and he says this stuff is everywhere. Everyone knows about it. They just turn a blind eye because they all want to keep working.  

Watch for Quinten Tarantino to go down next if this spreads. &&We all knew about it too. Harvey has been a well known scumbag to anyone paying attention to the industry for years. Christ, Entorouge even had a whole episode about it years ago. Ashley Judd came out about it years ago.... I say good riddance but clearly some factor other than  ""us"" knowing about it played a part here.&&Nah, even that doesn't matter. How long did people know about Jimmy Saville? You either wait until they're dead or the person who did all of this bad shit has pissed off the wrong person. That's it.&&Only opened the comments to say this. 

Basically: ""Sorry bud, we were cool with it, but now people know and we'll lose money, so you gotta go. Nothing personal.""&&I mean, Tom Cruise, when a young actress asked for tips about the profession, famously told her ""not to wind up on her knees in Weinstein's jet""&&I dunno man. I have a hard time imagining someone on their death bed thinking about how the bulk of people you have interacted with despise you for the gross actions you took. I can't imagine what kind of mental barriers are collapsing now that he won't have work, or sex, or whatever to occupy his mind. He only has himself and his thoughts. I don't know how everyone's mind works, but I doubt he'll be on his death bed thinking ""I had my fun"". &&I agree with you except for the ""he's probably ready to retire"" part:

> Weinstein maintained that he could weather the crisis and re-emerge as a player in Hollywood. He spent the weekend in Los Angeles pleading his case.

He was fighting hard to *not* retire, to the point where he had to be fired.&&Wow I'm surprised that he really went down. I thought he was so powerful he might be able to brazen it out. Maybe the world is getting better at handling sleazebags&&>mushrooming

Heh
&&If Weinstein is getting forced out for this, just about every producer and every film company should be out of business within the next year. Anyone who thinks Harvey was unique in this is incredibly naive.&&Imagine being an actress who blew Harvey for their big break like last week. How pissed would you be. &&I mean... that's good advice. Stay on high ground. Hollywood is tough to break into. I'm sure many aspiring actresses have considered things in desperate times but keeping your head up high is important. There are better ways.  &&And that was just one minute.&&As a 30 year old straight dude i'd probably suck his dick if it meant a staring role in a film and millions of dollars. I can't really blame anyone for that. &&[deleted]&&Makes me think of that “because of the implication” scene from it’s always sunny. &&I'm a person who has no involvement in the film making industry living on the other side of the planet and I've heard of Weinstein's misdeeds. The only surprising thing about this is he's getting his comeuppance.&&Yes! Loved that show, was a hardcore version of Entourage. &&[deleted]&&He already cashed out big time when he sold Miramax years ago. The Weinstein company is just a second career.&&And his beautiful model wife who likely sticks with him. &&The Gretchen Moll *Vanity Fair* cover rumors were the first time I heard about his reputation.&&Jesus...this was written 7 years ago. &&“Harvey’s casting couch”. 

So telling. &&Is there a list of these actresses? I could guess some, just wanted to see if I was right. &&Jennifer Lawrence Marchesa Red Carpet 2012 - [photo](https://imgur.com/a/LwJwG)

One of the plotlines of the Peter Sellers Film ""The Party"" involved a producer asking sexual favours from a young ingénue. When she refuses he states that she will never work in Hollywood again.

By supporting Hollywood you support this type of behavior. Weinstein is far from the only one, this is behavior that is endemic to the culture of Hollywood itself and these predators usually protect each other when they can. People dont usually speak out because theyll be blacklisted or have their lives ruined. Vote with your wallet. Foreign or independent


[Here is the leaked version of the doc An Open Secret](https://hackin.org/intel/Hollywood%20Pedophiles/). Rich Hollywood pedos sued to have parts censored where some of the guys admitted it on camera, so activists leaked the uncensored version. Heck they got the guy in charge of child actors committee for the screen actors guild to admit it by having one of his victims confront him over the phone on it. That same guy was the one that vetoed adding a warning for parents on the SAG website to look out  for predatory behavior. They have a former FBI agent admit they want to bring these people down but every time they try witnesses either pull out or they get people ""up top"" preventing it.&&I work with someone who used to work at Nick, and I asked her about him. She brushed off the question, probably because she didn't know anything, but told me her older boss, not Schneider, made advances on her when she was younger and harassed her when she turned him down.

Seriously there was a doc made about it called An Open Secret

Youd have to be willfully naive to not know this is going on to a high degree in Hollywood. There have been a lot of people who have come forward saying things about it but not wanting their lives destroyed over it because guys like Weinstein are very powerful and all these predators protect each other when they can&&Everyone cryptically works in Hollywood suddenly haha&&I think it's only fair to now disqualify **Shakespeare In Love** and award it to **Saving Private Ryan**.&&Same shit across all forms of entertainment. Ray Rice beats his fiancée, 1 game suspension. Video tape of beating leaked? Suspended for the season and then cut from the team. 

But... what if he was coming off an MVP year? Would he have been cut? Would a team have given him a second chance? Probably. But they didn’t because he was replaceable. He was not good enough for a team to justify the bad press. If it was prime Adrian Peterson, you can bet your ass that he wouldn’t have been cut. 

We’ve seen it with many other athletes and celebrities who do shitty things but still have the talent so people will take a chance on them. Chris Brown, Michael Vick, Johnny Depp, Mel Gibson, Sean Penn, the list goes on. Some have survived their fuck ups and some haven’t. But the ones who have survived all have one thing in common: they still have talent to the point that people will ignore the shitty behavior and still embrace them. &&As I understand the Cosby situation, it was the same deal. Just a known secret in show business. Then Hannibal Buress started talking about it a lot, and the victims started to feel like it was safe to come forward.

On Weinstein, it's interesting that the NYT story came out just before Ronan Farrow was planning to release his huge story in the New Yorker. I don't know who was behind the NYT story, but Farrow, as the son of Woody Allen, clearly has a vested interested in combatting sexual abusers and their apologists in Hollywood.

It could just be that these stories have been around, but our culture just wasn't ready to believe the victims. So some reporters realized that the time was right and made the case.&&Rose McGowan definitely is. And Ashley Judd.&&Hollywood is a cult of vanity that protects their own and feeds off the talents, innocence and youth of its young. It's the cultural epitome of the oldest profession in the book. The same for wallstreet (greed) and government (power), you don't enter without paying your dues and they demand a piece of you. Morals be damned.&&*”Your winnings, sir.”*&&It helps that Harvey is past his prime. He's not hitting home runs like he used to.&&In the past people in the industry where worried about how Harvey would fuck with their film (recut the ending, or never release it, etc). Now people are worried about how Harvey's reputation is going to fuck with their film. &&Not just that but other powerful people in the movie industry&&He's not the only one. How many are having their predatory behaviour covered?&&Hollywood is so hypocritical it's hilarious.  Harvey Weinstein sexually harassing Ashley Judd and jerking off in front of a reporter in a restaurant?  Big fucking deal.

[Victor Salva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Salva) videotaped himself fucking a 12 year old boy, and then made the film [Powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_(film)), a film where a child has  mythical power over an adult. Even better, Disney found out about it and didn't even fire the guy (let's pretend they didn't know about all this beforehand, they just got caught knowing about it so they lied). Listen to Rogan's podcast (#[679](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izr3Jsjee0s)) with Barry Crimmins and Bob Goldthwait for more information.  Sickening.

> Disney officials reported that they learned of Salva's crime only after production of Powder had begun, and stressed that there were no minors on the set for the film

Oh ok, perfectly fine then!

He fucked a kid in 1988, filmed it, got caught, and then Disney hired him to make a movie about a kid who has powers over adults. Who would ever work with such a monster?   Surely his career was over after that, right? 

Oh my, no.  He's made 10 movies since getting caught fucking the boy on video, including the Jeepers Creepers trilogy.  He's worked with Sam Rockwell (edit: maybe Rockwell didn't know as he worked on an early film, as pointed out by /u/vardulon in a reply), Rose McGowan, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen, Justin Long, Nick Nolte, and Dean Stockwell.  All of these actors knew their director fucked a 12 year old boy and filmed it, yet they all agreed to work with him.  But at least he didn't flirt too hard with a beautiful actress or pull out his dick in a restaurant!  

Fuck Hollywood.  &&She called MMA fighters animals I believe it was, yet she applauds real animals.&&Or she was never a victim and these same people made her a ton of money. Its really hard to tell whats actual truth with all of this internet anonymity and ""fake news"". 

However, this Weinstein thing... just wow. &&Still waiting on the Peele comment. &&> Watch for Quinten Tarantino to go down next if this spreads. 

Details?&&Have a read of Hollywood Babylon. That whole industry has a sickness.&&Good example. Enough people knew about it and many were tacitly taking measures against it (trying not to leave him alone with kids). Unfortunately, he was a charitable ""rain maker"" raising cash for all manner of things and loved by senior management. To speak against him would have been career suicide.

Seems very similar to Weinstein.&&But you’ve also never been ridiculously wealthy, famous, and powerful like him (I’m guessing :P). You have to think about how much of a narcissistic piece of shit that could make someone &&I'm sure most people like Weinstein don't give a flying fuck about what they've done, and won't think twice about it on their death bed. He's been in the movie industry for how long now? I don't think anyone with an actual conscious would be such a shitty human for all that time without some breakdown or admission of guilt.&&he'll still have sex.   The man is a multimillionaire and as the saying goes there's no such thing as a ugly multimillionaire.

He still has friends in the biz who he could influx through past favours given .

And America loves a good comeback.&&All the people who really matter in their lives already knew anyway. Maybe there will be a few who didn't know or didn't have a hint of what was going on, or who will actually be surprised to know the truth, but those close to this kind of person--the kind of person who has a public persona separate from their private and actual self--will not be surprised at all. 

They're the ones helping to enable it, after all. Someone has to excuse their behavior. People, no matter how horrible they may be, still desire friends and others to talk to without being judged. 

Society at large might think he's a horrible dirtbag, but when you're a public figure, you eventually learn to tune that shit out. Ever worked retail? When you get to that point with customers, when you eventually learn that no, you don't need to take their complaints personally, that sometimes people are just idiots/jerks and that if you let it ruin your day, you're going to be miserable? Jack that up ten thousand times and you're in a celebrity's shoes.

This guy won't lose any sleep over this. But I guarantee his victims have--and will probably continue to--lost a lot of sleep over what he's done to them.&&You know that some people take pleasure in the fact that they got away with doing bad things right?&&Have you seen his death bed? It's huuuuge.&&I want so much to believe that &&Sadly it's more economics than true moral repulsion. His presence would be a toxic effect to profits so he must go; not that anyone on the board gives a shit that he's a sleezball.&&Does anyone really think there was a single board member who was not aware of Weinstein's actions, instead of knowing for yeard and only acting outraged when it becomes public? Corporations will hide employees committing child murder if it means negative views about the company don't form, and then unanimously fire someone over a tweet if it happens to become a news story for 2 hours. Nothing to do with right or wrong and everything with company first policy. This is a group of enablers scrambling to avoid any consequence.

Ashley Judd refused his advances/offer. 

We don't know exactly what happened with Rose McGowan other than she got a settlement of 100k and probably signed an NDA.  But she clearly hates the guy and has implied he was a rapist. &&I've been in the higher tier film industry for only a couple of years and am still pretty low down; working mostly as a producer's assistant and trainee development rookie.

Like, it's the very worst kept secret. I've heard the darkest fucking stories about Weinstein's conduct from a two-degree-removed point of view, including him being obsessed with Michelle Williams and Marion Cotilliard (and almost certainly fucking one or both of them), and having his assistants bring countless prospective actresses to his hotel rooms (in the middle of the day) to find him standing in his fucking briefs like a fucking ogre in a den.  

None of the stories coming out are surprising but it's so fucking depressing.&&I think you and all the others expecting that will be disappointed. The allegations revealed have already destroyed him professionally. Any actress still working that may have been subjected to his alleged aberrant behavior has much less incentive to throw herself into this mess.&&the movie based on this guy will be. I hope thats where they take that Tropic Thunder spin off about Tom Cruise's charcater that has been in development hell. &&I don't. I expect Hollywood will want to steamroll over this as soon as possible. Maybe a rival production company leaks more stuff about the weinstein company while the rest close ranks to hide their own transgressions.

Trevor noah, stephen colbert, Jon oliver and Samantha bee largely ignore it because they're worried it could affect their careers (also known as intellectual cowardice).

What you will see is these hosts  start to say things when they are absolutely sure weinstein can't get back at them, instead of taking a stand.

I think the amount of Hollywood breakdowns is testament to how fucked up the industry is.

But they get a free pass by doing the time tested rich millionaire thing of hiding their evils by playing up to bleeding heart causes and paying lots of money to charity.

Here in the uk, Jimmy Saville donated so much money to build children's wings in hospital and whatnot everyone turned a blind eye to him wandering the wards and molesting  kids.

Not that I'm defending Donald Trump's disgusting behavior at all, however it's a tad rich that a lot of Hollywood folks raked him over the coals for his ""grab her by the pussy"" comment only to applaud and cover up sexual predators.&&[deleted]&&The blog Crazy Days and Nights has been on this for years.  

They called Weinstein trading sexual favors for roles with Amy Adams, Lana del Rey and Jessica Alba, Jennifer Lawrence, and Gwyneth Paltrow.   Also broke how Kirk Douglas raped Natalie Wood, Dan Schneider from Nickelodeon is a pedophile, as is Martin Weiss.  Has dropped blind items about Rob Reiner, David Geffen, Jeffrey Boam, Michael Bass, Harvey Bernard, David Nicksay & David Seltzer possibly being abusers.  

Everything that blog hints at eventually gets broken as real news, years later.  I remember them talking about Harvey Weinstein sleeping with Lana del rey on a contract to make her famous back in like 2012. &&I think part of it is just the nature of the allegations. It's all rumors and innuendo spread out over time so people think they're being fair minded by not taking a side when they don't have first hand knowledge.  It takes a public opening like the story this past week and then the flood gates open with victims coming forward.  

As far as coverage, even after the Hannibal Buress joke it took a little while for the Cosby story to build momentum. Weinstein isn't even a household name like Cosby was.  

I think it shows how accustomed we are to instant feedback that this broke Thursday and by Sunday everyone is talking about who has and hasn't addressed it yet. &&Before the NYT article came out, their were stories about how he had already began hiring crisis management teams to deal with the fallout. 

With that in mind I can't help but feel that the response, everything from his attorneys quitting to his ousting, has been choreographed. 

One week from now we'll forget this story, and even though his legal troubles will continue, it'll no longer be of public interest. &&I, too, enjoyed reading that admission. As soon as I read it I knew he was fucked in terms of civil lawsuits. &&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ7mJFNkLAU&&I'm willing to bet that 'Spielberg, eg. al.' don't want their own dirty laundry being aired. &&Hey, that seems like a disservice to Indiana farm girls.&&I thought they had something of a falling out due to Miramax's creative accounting causing people to not get paid fully.&&He is being protected by a whole country.

You can rise pretty high when the right people have leverage over you&&Passed that though, it will be interesting to have an Oscars season without him since he famously tips the scales so often. &&Meryl Streep loves her some sexual predators. She also defended Polanski and sang his praises. She is trash.&&But the whole Polanski thing happened in an age before social media, before 24 hours news.

Also didn't Bernardo Bertolucci and Brando virtually sexually assault Maria Schneider during Last Tango?

Starting off, no we should not embrace pedophiles.  But is a guy who dreams of starting a fire but never does it an arsonist?  If someone is sexually attracted to children but never does anything about it, is that a huge problem?  I don't care what you jerk off to, I'm concerned with your actions.  Yes, downloading any kind of child porn counts towards you harming children, as you are perpetuating the demand for the material.  However, I'm very cautiously listening.

She was bipolar, and bipolar people have a clear pattern of getting manic and sexual restraint goes out the window. 

If pressed, I bet she'd have been able to tell stories about having sex with a damned prop lightsaber at some point.  We also abuse chemicals to medicate the BP, so we can't tell if we're high or cycling when we do shit.

That's not condemning CF, just being honest about the effects of BP.  She slept with Harrison Ford and then blabbed about it without thinking of the consequences to him, for fucks sake.  That's *so* BP.

My point is if she did sleep with Spielberg, or whoever, I'm not going to blame them: I'm gonna blame her disease. She owned it. She wasn't proud of it, but she owned it. And that's important to us.

I did a lot of crazy shit when I was cycling, That's all mine and nobody else. 

Sorry if I sound preachy but she was sort of a hero of mine for how hard she fought this disease.&&Carrie Fisher has a very dry sense of humour and that was most definitely a joke.&&God I hate her psuedoscience bullshit and scaremongering so much.

She [defends and gives a standing ovation to a child rapist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNrsV_o0KYo), but then goes to the Golden Globes and acts like she has the moral high ground to criticize Donald Trump and tell everyone how great Hollywood is. 

What *really* pissed me off was seeing everyone kiss her ass after that as if she did some great, brave thing, criticizing Donald Trump, saying that she's some amazing woman who deserves to be looked up to. Fuck her, she's a sexual predator defending piece of garbage, and she's a goddamn hypocrite. &&Speaking of Hollywood's hypocrisy, I really, really liked Ricky Gervais' opening monologue at the 2016 Golden Globes. Unlike seemingly most celebrities, Gervais actually seems self-aware, and I really appreciated him using that monologue to call Hollywood out on their bullshit. I liked the joke he made at Roman Polanski's expense, especially when you step back and realize how many people in that room are friends and supporters of Polanski (Harvey Weinstein being one of them). 

I never did understand why people worship Hollywood celebrities so much (""Oh no I'm sooo sad Chris Pratt and Anna Faris broke up! They were my favorite celebrity couple!"") It's no secret that Hollywood is a fucking cesspool of decadence and moral bankruptcy. Stop looking up to celebrities, they don't give a shit about you, so you shouldn't give a shit about them beyond the movies they're in. 

Don't get me wrong though, I'm sure there are lots of good people in Hollywood. But even they don't deserve to be looked up to and worshipped like they are. &&Everyone who made Tropic Thunder is cool in my book, because at least they tried really hard to out Harvey as a piece of shit.  Les Grossman is 100% based on Weinstein.

People like Meryl Streep can go fuck themselves though.  I have zero respect for her now.&&And that’s it.  He’s gonna be able to stay around because of what he knows.

Every studio should of let the director have another go&&This is why I love Netflix the level of ""fuck it go for it"" is perfect and has made for some great content&&Kind of related, this is more or less the business model that Jason Blum created at Blumhouse Productions (Get Out, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, Whiplash). Obviously, without the direct sales revenue aspect, though.

Basically, buy Indie scripts that major studios would never consider to be blockbusters for stupid cheap amounts of money. Then, give them an insanely strict budget with no wiggle room to go over. When you buy 60 scripts for the price of one blockbuster, statistically most of them will be flops, but there will be a handful that will bring in BIG returns on initial investment (see list of movies before). Essentially, it’s the same principal as cold calling (for any telemarketers out there), or if you invest in a portfolio of very risky penny stocks.

I’m glad to see the “base idea” is being recreated, since it’s been highly profitable, and it gives us movie goers a shot to see a lot of movies that otherwise never would have existed.

For a really interesting look into Blumhouse’s production model, I highly recommend this podcast from NPR’s Planet Money: [Episode 650: The Business Genius Behind Get Out](www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/29/521950337/episode-650-the-genius-behind-get-out) &&They should throw huge amounts of money at Neill Blomkamp immediately. &&*Elfquest* please!&&Oh man, please let ""The Prototype"" make it to the list..

It seems Netflix are attracting decent directors who recently been burned by the Hollywood machine.  &&This makes sense... Netflix knows how to find an audience for these more niche films. Hollywood does not have their level of analytics so even though in theory a smaller budget film targeted at a smaller audience is a more sustainable way to invest, Hollywood just doesn't have the infrastructure in place to find those small audiences. They carpet bomb advertising on city buses and hope that pulls people into the theater, whereas Netflix already knew I would watch Little Evil based on my viewing history before they even struck a deal with Eli Craig.

Part of me thinks what really killed the music industry was their inability to use analytics when the internet boomed and now Hollywood is following the same path. The options were just too overwhelming and people felt intimidated in trying to find new music. If you just have this huge unfiltered list of choices you're just going to stick with the best sellers, or not bother at all. If the tech that Netflix uses had been around back then to help people find stuff they would like without any effort, I bet the music industry would look very different today.&&Think they could make S4 and S5 of Dark Matter? Please... &&Netflix had changed the requirements for creating new content.

The studios competing to run films in the theatre are all about putting butts in seats. So, when they want to make a movie they look for a safe script from the current ""it"" writer, they look for a star from the current pool of ""it"" actors, and so on and so on.

So, when they make new movies they aren't making the best movies they can. They are making the movie with the most currently popular people and trying to cater to the current trends. The end result isn't usually great film making, it is mediocre crap that caters to many and usually puts butts in seats because of intense marketing campaigns.

Netflix on the other hand grants creators more freedom to create the films they want with the actors they want, unknown or not. The driving force isn't putting butts in seats, well not in the same sense. Their drive is to create interesting content that people will watch, regardless if it is good or not. But that doesn't mean they don't create crap, in fact lots of time they lean into creating crap but they don't have a worry about it failing or they don't worry about it getting bad reviews because they know their is a market for good bad movies (ie. Sanders free run to make endless Sandler stuff).

The drive for Netflix is different then the standard studios. They aren't trying to hook or trick people to come to theatres. They already have the money for the projects, so they just keep generating tons of content. Sure, they are still trying to attract new business but their model and artistic freedom for creators has proven that it works and in the end they keep new members coming.

Tl;Dr Netflix do good with artistic freedom, standard studios do bad with artistic restriction. &&Netflix always gets a lot of flack, but there is no other company that gives newer writers and directors a platform to start their career with. As a film writer/producer it is extremely hard to find a tv network that will greenlight your show without knowing someone in the business.&&I'm totally digging *Big Mouth*. I could never watch something like that on regular television. The concept alone is amazing: children and hormone 'monsters'.  For me, it's literally a laugh a minute. &&Now if Netflix could just stop with the over the top, unnecessary sex scenes in all of their shows, that'd be cool.  I don't mind some nudity here and there, and even a short scene isn't that bad... but Netflix really seems to be trying too hard to be edgy with the sex scenes they add to everything.  It almost never fits the story, and it's always so out of place that it doesn't make sense to have it in there in the first place.&&    Between the time when the oceans drank Atlantis, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an age undreamed of.

Seriously, that movie was probably the worst movie of 2016. And I’m saying this as a unironic fan of *Tusk* and the *Puppet Master* movies. *Yoga Hosers* is probably not just the worst movie of 2016, but it probably also qualifies as the worst (and most expensive) home video of 2016 too. &&Kevin Smith has kinda lost it in my opinion.

Either way, more Carruth.&&the cast that got announced for that movie was great (and probably way too busy to still be attached to it in any way). &&ermergerd Upstream Color was so good&&This whole shit is why I hate the film industry. Shane Carruth completely produces, writes, films, directs, composes, stars in, etc. 2 critically acclaimed movies with a massive cult following. His very first movie, which he made on a budget of $5000, is considered one of the greatest sci fi films of all time. Guy writes *two* different scripts, which several prominent people call some of the best movie scripts they've ever seen, and *still* no one will help him make his films.

Until now its just been purchases from festivals or other films they find and decide to release.&&I watched *You Get Me* last night on a friend's recommendation and it was maybe the worst movie I've seen all year. It's a film aimed at teenagers who have never seen a good movie before. My friend is in is late 20s and doesn't get to recommend movies anymore. &&And we should be glad about that. For like, a decade, the film industry has been churning out nothing but low-risk, built-in-audience, always gonna see it even though expectations are low, popcorn movies of little value. 

Netflix is taking risks and producing films that don't appeal to everyone, and I think it's a good thing. &&I wouldn't say they suck (besides a few). But they have the same problem as Marvel and other blockbusters but in the indie form... the plague of the 'passable' movie.

I have higher hopes for The Meyerowitz Stories (directed by Noah Baumbach) releasing in the next two weeks and Mudbound (which is their main Oscar contender) but we'll see. Their best film is still Beasts of No Nation.&&That's why you only watch the good ones!&&Couldn't that be said about most studios? Im real curious what their batting average is compared to ""Legitimate"" studios. &&But most people, not including myself, didn't like Little Evil from what I've seen. Maybe there was a good reason it was being held up&&I feel bad for that guy. He spent something like 6-18 months doing pre-production for the Halo movie only to have it fall into development hell when the Microsoft and movie execs couldn't get along. Then he tried to do Alien some justice and old man Ridley Scott decided he wanted to play with Xenomorphs in his second prequel. It's no wonder he's trying for the crowdfunding option at the moment.

He's got a great knack for gritty sci-fi but his repeated use of (near) fictional lawless South Africa (which in fairness he is really good at depicting) for his Earth backdrops make most of his projects feel similar despite their other differences. It's also getting kind of boring to see the same type of location again and again. Even Rocket Jump and Corridor Digital on Youtube get that they can't do all of their shorts in the same local alleyways.&&Content providers are all trying to pull their stuff back and put it on their own streaming services so that you need to subscribe to a bunch of different services to see the stuff you want.

See, here’s the thing with streaming services: you don’t own the content. That’s why it’s cheap. Want to have a copy of MASH you can watch anytime? Buy a box set. YES, OF DVDs. Or Blu-Rays, since they shot that shit on film back in the day, and YOU’RE WELCOME for making old TV shows that still look awesome today.

Edit: While I’m at it, go for the European box set; the lack of a laugh track takes out most of the saccharine quality that MASH got a reputation for. You realize that folks like Hawkeye are desperately cracking jokes in an environment of people in no mood to laugh. It’s a darker series, even before the chicken.&&personally I'd rather have a continuation of Universe&&It'll be as good as all the other video game movies.&&Keep in mind they don't play this same risk reward game that other studios do. If a bigger budget film is heavily criticised, they still get the same income as if they never made it. They just miss potential dvd sales and maybe gain fewer new subscribers than they hoped that movie might attract. It would have to be especially terrible for one movie to make people give up their account.&&They make enough money to pay it off in a few years. They're borrowing big time to build up a library of original content as fast as the licensed stuff is leaving, as well as outpacing their competitors own development of originals. There's also that old quote about becoming HBO faster than HBO can become Netflix; they've got competitors on multiple fronts aiming for their spot at the top.

As for quality disparities streaming services in general are able to take a scattergun approach to original content so they're all greenlighting lots of random stuff in the hopes that something will be the next big hit like Mr. Robot or Stranger Things. That said Netflix's earliest originals were very solid shows but that was at a time when they needed to legitimize online only content. Nowadays we all see a TV show and an online show as one and the same but they had to come out fists swinging to put them on the same playing field.

edit: nevermind they just announced a subscription price rise today. I guess that's one way to do it lmfao.&&There’s no way anybody can pull that off and sell it to an audience.  You’d end up with *Pacific Rim* and totally omit the whole point of the thing.  *NGE* is not a giant robot fighting series.  It’s a giant-robot-fighting *backdrop* for exploring what a shitty fucking human being Shinji is.  Not even Netflix is going to take a chance on that without watering it down into some basic Hero’s Journey sort of thing. &&Never heard of Dale and Tucker Vs Evil? You are lucky my friend.

The issue with theatrical distribution is distribution, and sharing profits with theaters, and promotional costs. Netflix has their own distribution so doesn't need to worry about the first two points (other than increased bandwidth/CDN costs; now I'm curious how much their costs go up when there's a marquee release on the service versus new subscription revenue it brings in). They promote their content, but far from the extent that a crappy $100M release needs to to get butts in seats.&&It also only cost $5 million and despite being absolute trash was probably watched a lot.  Kevin Smith has a large social media following.

I'm the type of person who unironically loves Saturday Syfy movies. So the scale that critics judge a movie on has no impact on my opinion. He's said that the last few movies he's made have just been weird ass movies that *he* wants to see. He comes up with an idea and goes ""I wonder what that would look like as a movie"" then he makes it. Most of this came after making studio movies like Cop Out left a bad taste in his mouth. He wanted to go back to his obscure indie roots and make movies that he and his friends would get a kick out of for a while. Personally I love all of them except Tusk, and even then I like the idea. I've just got some anxiety issues when it comes to the type of thing that happens to Justin Long in that movie. I can't sit through the human centipede for the same reason. But with Jay and Silent Bob Reboot just over the horizon, I think everyone will be getting the dose of that classic Kevin Smith that everyone feels is missing from his most recent works.&&[""Do you ever plan on making an original movie without rehashing any of your old characters that doesn't suck?""

That movie could not have used more dumb cliches about millennials if it tried.&&> My friend is in is late 20s and doesn't get to recommend movies anymore.

My father in law said the same thing about me when I told him to watch It Follows.&&It’s funny. I’m a little older, but this is all I heard growing up 20-25 years ago. “Movies suck now.” And yet some amazing movies continue to get made. 

I think it’s simply a good example of Sturgeon’s Law: 90% of everything is crap. Most people making movies are mediocre filmmakers. Only a select few actually master the art and make something worthwhile. &&Beasts of No Nation was absolutely gut wrenching and a great, moving film. Did you enjoy Arc? I liked it, but didn't love it. The premise was cool, just lacked some polish. I wish Primer was still on there. That movie set the time travel bar for me. &&I loved war machine. Felt like it came out really well.&&Okja is better than beasts of no nation &&Too bad they removed ratings and just have the garbage ""80% like"" metric which has absolutely no baring on how good the movie is (Adam Sandler, I really don't love you that much)&&Way worse than Blumhouse and A24.  Wish they'd fund movies using a similar model.&&It wasn't quite...maybe I'll say *fully baked*? It was good at playing with all the tropes in the spirit of Scary Movie but it never felt fully committed. I laughed my ass off more than once so it gets my full blessing, but it's no Tucker and Dale. &&It was fine. Entertained me for an hour and a half. &&I'm yet to see Little Evil&&Worse, probably.&&Yea, their balance sheet and longterm goals are very different for any given show/movie, than a studio. Their busts don't hurt them as much and their hits don't strictly enhance their bottom line but have more impact on bringing in/retaining subscribers. Ultimately - volume for them is good, so even bad movies have at least some value. &&I've watched it for the first time last weekend with the gf, it was amazing.. I've heard of it for years but never actually thought of watching it. One of my favorites now. 

As a big horror fan it was nice to get a different perspective on the cliche scenes.&&1st watch was amazing. I knew nothing about it. I bought it at FYE a few years ago on sale. Always loved Alan Tudyk, from Firefly to Death at a Funeral. Had never heard of Tyler Labine until I watched it. I laughed harder than I thought I could. Those two guys are fantastic. That movie was a pleasant surprise.
&&The sequel is not good. Just watch the first movie again and tell yourself it's Conan II: The Rebarbarianing.&&The thing is, Arnold *would* be a draw for another Conan movie. He *is* Conan in the eyes of many. That last abomination we got fucking sucked.&&After Deadpool and IT you'd think they'd revisit it.&&> Schwarzenegger is no longer a draw.  

Pfffp, that is laughable.  All you would have to do is show him in a dark throne room, the back of his head wearing a crown, and his hands resting on the top of the hilt of his sword and people would line up around the block.

&&Arnold as Conan would be a draw.&&There was a Del Toro art exhibit going around in the Spring- here’s a Reddit post from a guy who went and took a picture of the Mountains of Madness Penguin:

But then what I REALLY want to see is during interviews, when a Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks or Robert Downey Jr level actor has to justify it as something other than a meta joke about video games. ""Well you see the character of Freeman has very little personality beyond what the players ascribed to him. So what I wanted to do was try and capture that experience and reframe it as an interaction between actor and audience. Is Freeman a quiet scientist just doing his best, or a barely contained madman pushed beyond breaking? Both are valid character interpretations and the challenge I faced, as an actor, was delivering a performance that lent Credence to  every interpretation and yet at the same time none of them"" &&Gordon Freeman has got to be [Hugh Laurie](https://imgur.com/a/yGd1R).&&See if you can find Orson Welles while you're at it&&Well, i think somebody already did.&&I saw it, it's great. He's 88yo though, that's scary.&&I just don't get it, man. Why totally butcher the main character like that?

I get that it was a risk running with an evil protagonist but that was the *entire* point of the show! **None** of the characters were all that accurate but what they did to Light actually hurt me...

EDIT: People's main argument is that it's pretty much a totally different story, just set in the same universe. Honestly, I would have *totally* supported that. I still don't think it would have done all that well as it was yet another ""beat down kid gets powers"" story, but I wouldn't have issue with it.

But that's not what it was. They used the same characters, and with that comes an expectation that it would remain *somewhat* true to the original. There's nothing wrong with putting their own spin on it. I had no issue with changing nationalities or certain scenarios, but the *entire premise was totally different!*

It wasn't a redemption story. It was a trickster giving god powers to a psychopath.

And don't get me wrong, I do get why they used the same characters (it got *way* more people to watch it), but as soon as they did so they justified any negative response from those who went in wanting the old story.

Take the 2006 live action version. They *totally* changed the ending, but did so in a way that actually fit in to the whole ""Cat and ~Mouse~~ Cat"" dynamic that made the show so great (honestly, I preferred that ending to the anime's).&&Dragon ball Evolution comes to mind. That might have been the most cringe inducing piece of shit film I've ever watched. Seems like there's a trend when it comes to Anime being picked up by American producers/directors.&&World War Z is this for me.

The film itself is alright, it's a decent zombie film.

But... why did Brad Pitt buy the name from the book?

The entire film is the literal antithesis of the book by the same name. The film is, deliberately, a completely shallow PG-13 (without blood) action film with a blockbuster Hollywood star.

The book is a gritty realistic self-reflection of humanity and how it might cope with a realistic zombie disaster.

Why did he bother buying the name? That is all they share in common.

The only thing I can think of is to prevent an actually faithful book-to-film version...&&Ghost in the Shell was the same as Death Note, people who weren't attached to the anime liked it while fans of the source didn't&&I didn't watch the anime and still thought it sucked ass...&&I hadn't read the manga or watched the anime and I thought it was a really bad movie; it was pretty embarrassing.&&>This was the first time I ever watched a remake of something I loved and now I understand why people hate remakes so much.

&&Or go the complete opposite way like they did with Battle Royale//Hunger Games (I'm not saying it was intentional, I don't know). Keep the same core concept but change everything else.&&If the movie was entirely original and didn't have a source material it probably would've made for a fine film and I believe I've heard some people who weren't as familiar with the source did enjoy it. Maybe not a great one (arguably still mediocre) but enjoyable. Coming off of the source material it was like a twisted abomination of what made it and the characters so amazing, and that's why people hate it so vehemently.&&Death Note was a fine movie, and represented the concept well. It just changed all the characters too much while still trying to make them the same. It's a great choice for ""grab a pint with the gang and watch a movie""-night. &&Except they want the movie to be made too. At least they did. I went to a panel with the 2000ad guys a few years back and they were saying at that point it was largely down to fan support. It needed to be proved it would be a success since Dredd didn't actually do that well commercially and all. &&So speaks the Klfixam.

The problem is that his movies end up being niche and only have cult followings not exactly high reward movies from how out there they are.&&Most of the time I've seen him in interviews, yes.  Dude produces really good movies though...&&If you enjoyed the 11th Doctor, or Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you're gonna love it.

Someone correct me if I'm way off but I think the only way something's gonna happen is if they think there's money in making that movie. Until then the story will sit on a pysical or virtual shelf collecting dust or bit rot.

The stark contrast of what looks to be the bustling business areas of the maps descending into chaos and ruin is what really sets the tone for the game. All that idyllic glitz and glamour turning into a horrible blood soaked and drug induced ruin. That's a lot more than just water and lights.&&Hell yes, Bioshock 1 you could make in a shitty warehouse. Its badley lit, most of the enemies you barely glimpse, the enmemies when you see them are either prople or low tech. You could add the external water efects (ie seen through the windows) in post with very cheap CGI. Thats a $10-15m movie at most. Bioshock Ultimate sure, thats $100m.  &&Just saw the trailer, he managed to film a movie with Johnny Depp 
and a bunch of not bottom of the barrel actors for 5 mil? Is Depp doing that bad or is Kevin Smith a genius. Or I just realized the girl is Depp's daughter, so maybe that's what it is.&&The internet talks more than it walks. While Kevin Smith does have a huge social media following, those followers failed to show up for  his last theatrical release (*Tusk*). Having a large social media following does not mean much unless you can generate a lot of money from it. 

I love Kevin Smith, and I hope he gets his movies made, but I don’t see a future where Netflix picks up a movie that he makes. &&>  Kevin Smith has a large social media following.

So does Paris Hilton. Let's fund The Hottie And The Nottie 2. &&The first half of that movie was cool. The setup of the kidnapping and everything.

Edit: Well, thanks for the responses, TIL...never would have thought that was the case.&&I did as well then I saw all the terrible reviews and was very confused.&&Yeah, that's what I heard as well. But I really like the script a lot. I think it's a fun kids romp even apart from the really weird experimental stuff.

So much amazing stuff in the source material they could have drawn on. &&People wouldn't have forgotten about The Dark Tower if they decided to actually follow the damn books.&&Gerald's Game was good, and Mr. Mercedes is a pretty solid TV series. King has a lot of material to work with, and much of it could be done with a relatively small budget. 

I for one would love to see Behind the Dragon's Eyes get made into a Netflix movie. Duma Key would make a good one too.&&[deleted]&&*Spectral.*

Spectre is a Bond movie.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I find that people either really liked or hated that movie.  I'm the former, quite liked it.&&You gotta know your audience when suggesting movies.

Sure *you* may like it. But would this really go over well with a skeptical person from an older generation who may or may not like horror in the first place?

Another thing about horror is that it tends to be a lot like musical taste or one's opinion of Saturday Night Live. The ""best"" era always seems to coincide with when that person was in their late teens/early 20's. Sometimes it's hard to break someone out of their preference.&&And survivor bias.

I'm biased though, since the kid in the movie lives down the street from me.&&Not really all *that* similar beyond being a horror-satire sort of thing, but Cabin in the Woods is probably worth watching if you haven't seen it. Much more on the nose in parodying the genre, but a pretty decent movie in general.

What's not to love?&&Old Man Conan!&&Jason Momoa was actually really good in the role, and a lot closer to the Conan of the books.  Everything else about it sucked though&&The R-rating isn't the defining factor here whatsoever..look at Arnold's track record the last decade and you'll see Deadpool and IT aren't valid reasons to revive a 100m+ Arnold film&&So basically revive Frazetta and have him do all the key art. Yup. &&Arnold as Conan, done seriously like the original would be awesome. The comic relief from Destroyer doesn't hold up well once you aren't a kid anymore &&Good god. That is horrific.

I mean Bryan Cranston could honestly pull that off. One of the best BB episodes was the fly episode, and he said a whole dozen words the entire episode.&&Yeah. La danza de la realidad was very good too.&&Akidearest mentions in her review that the movie would've worked much better if they presented it as a sequel of the original story. Light Turner finds the notebook and decides to follow on the steps of the original Kira, and Black L is actually Near's protegé or something. Ryukk interferes with the story because he's frustrated that the new guys aren't as good as Light Yagami. Also, focusing the story on Mia instead of Light since the writers obviously think of her as the mastermind of the story. It wouldn't make it a perfect movie, but it would've made way more sense and been less subject to the constraints of having to rewrite ""Death Note"" to fit in a two-hour flick.&&The worst thing for me was adding the girl. Her entire story just felt awkward and forced.&&Don't forget L, His character was completely fucked as well. Instead of an intellectual battle of wits and cunning we got L chasing Light down the street with a gun.&&TBH the Japanese destroy their anime or video games just as much when they make live action adaptations, it's just that most of those don't make it to the Western market.

Most of the times it's due to taste (Japanese movie taste is pretty weird), or the fact that those are done kinda cheaply as a cash-in. Or just that, I dunno, those aren't really good to adapt to movies in the first place.&&Hold on now, Speed Racer was actually pretty great. Then again the Wachowskis are probably legit weebs so they understood what they were working with.&&The real problem comes from shitty directors wanting to cram a stereotypical American action movie starting a kid (a loser/loner who just wanted to fit in, but becomes a hero and gets the girl) into any anime/comic/video game where that isn’t the plot. 

Like Dragonball. They changed Goku into a kid who wanted to go to high school and parties? Who secretly studied martial arts, but couldn’t fight back against bullies for unspecified reasons? And who wins in the end because he finds the power was within him all along?

All that bullshit about Goku actually being sent by Piccolo or whoever to destroy the earth is irritating, but not important. As is Yamcha being a thief. But turning Goku from a fun loving guy who lives to fight, one who trains to his utmost to become stronger into that... why even make the movie. &&The only way to do that would be like a 10-12 episode mini series. If Netflix could pull that off I'd watch the absolute fuck out of it &&Well, at least author of the book got payed&&As a fan of the Anime going way back; the Scar-jo film was pretty decent cyber punk, but it wasn't Ghost in the Shell. Changing the name and a few details and it would have been a totally separate thing &&You should try the anime if you at least thought the concept was interesting.&&Just like Dredd was not based on The Raid, Hunger Games was not based on Battle Royale. All four were independent of each other that fans for some reason like to say one inspired the other. &&But damn, William Defoe was good&&I didn't hate it myself either and I'm a big fan of *Death Note*. Was it a great and amazing adaption? No, but I never went into it expecting it to be anything great.

But comparing it to the DBZ movie or the Ghost in the Shell movie, I'd much rather watch Death Note quality live-action movies over them. It at least looked good, was casted well (I actually really liked American Light, even though I wasn't jazzed with their portrayal of him), with my biggest complaint being Mia's character.&&Maybe my 30+ viewings from when it was on Netflix will help&&I was lost at first and then watched it again - made much more sense the second time around.&&Ask ole Georgie hisself&&Im the same with those two and Fassbender at the moment. &&Tom hanks for me.&&Well half the movies with Tom Hardy in it also come with Nolan directing. Not that Tom Hardy doesn't deserve his own credit, but the two know how to work together exceptionally well. If you didn't see Dunkirk you should catch it sometime. &&I don't think that one died because of the director tbh. I mean, yes, he only makes bro movie, but it definitely was some studio bullshit. &&FWIW, the Red Letter Media guys made a decent case for Suicide Squad probably having been ruined by studio meddling, so the director might not be that bad.&&It also says ""Fury"" and ""End of Watch"" right under that. You can cut him some slack. &&If you liked that check out cabin in the woods.  Same basic premise on turning the horrer field upside down with ruining anything.&&I came into that movie expecting the typical spoofing horror comedies do, but damn they managed to make a hilarious film that totally plays it straight&&Glad you said it cause it's true. They successfully recreated that look and feel of the art deco aesthetic that encapsulated the futuristic optimism people felt during the 20s and 30s. 

And then fucked it up and ruined it turning it into horror. It was so visually pleasing.&&Think you meant Bioshock Infinite &&Yeah, the two stars, Depp's daughter and Kevin Smith's daughter, are childhood best friends in real life. &&Yepp, their daughters are best friends in real life and the two are school-dad friends. Kev pitched him the part and Depp was all over it, he loves weird shit like that. I believe his exact quote was ""Kevin, I was in a movie where I had scissors for hands. I love shit like this.""&&That's what it is, their daughters are friends apparently.&&Luckily, Netflix is on the internet so those lazy ducks don't have to walk to the theater. &&But I swear if you make X, I'll buy it!

He didn't enjoy it when he tried it in high-school, so he didn't smoke for a long time.&&I think people are too much expecting every movie to be the new best thing ever. Sometimes it's alright to just watch a light comedy with funny characters and a predictable story IMO.&&That was the weird action movie with the blue killer ghosts?

It's not for everyone but I don't think it's ""marginal at best""&&F is for Family is outstanding.&&Honestly I feel it's the other way around.

Never cared for BJH but I love Bill burrs story telling and humor and big mouth was actually pretty funny, didn't really like the art style though &&I guess I'm one of the rare people who had mixed feelings, lol. Horror is a pretty hit or miss genre, so I appreciated that it was a competently made horror movie with a cool premise, and the score was great. I really didn't give a shit about any of the characters though, and some of their decision making was cliche horror movie ""characters making inexplicably dumb choices."" I also found there were a few too many moments where the monster - which had previously been shown leaping at people and horrifically killing them - would hang back a bit with the protagonist and not go in for the kill, which is always frustrating in horror movies. So yeah it was like a decent 7/10 for me.&&what? yes they do. they started funding shit with Moonlight. They needed to diversify and what a hell of a homerun with the first movie&&They've stepped agressivly into production in the last 18 months. About 8 in production right now, following on from a degree of prodco involvement in It Comes At Night, Sacred Deer & as thefilmer notes, Moonlight&&That I can't dispute, I do like him. But the rest was completely wtf.&&I'd watch it though. That's like, 1 ticket at whatever bulk price moviepass gets.  &&The problem is every action movie besides deadpool costs $100+ million.   Conan shouldn't need more like 60 million to make a spectacular movie.  &&Come on, do it&&Really? I imagine they'd be even more clumsy. A light jog and you're away. Probably pretty easy to push over. Could probably get a bag over its head and end it all right there.&&I dont know.. shouldnt Dune actually be a miniseries rather than a/several movies?&&I’m just over halfway through the book and it seems to have a basically three act structure, no? I could see the first part of the book easily getting adapted. &&""IT"" might be reviving 2 part movies.

Dune would fit perfect in that model.&&>That man can do no wrong, has fantastic cinematography (what dune needs) and a good track record with sci fi.

The cinematography is amazing because he works with the master –Roger Deakins. That man can do no wrong. But yes, Villenueve is on an absolute tear of great movies and I hope he doesn't let off the gas.&&Yeah but I don't want an actor to just pull it off, I want to see a movie pay the fees that actors of Tom Cruise's level charge, slap his face on every poster, slap his name on every article, and then send him on the normal press tour and watch someone like Tom Cruise whos acting career is now just as much built on his personality and charm, explain why he doesn't actually say anything.

I have no doubt Bryan could rock it, and I have no doubt Tom could rock it. I just want to see an actor whos salary is in the tens of millions,who's movies attract people from every background and whos audiences have come to expect a certain picture from a movie headlined by them, try and manage expectations by justifying why they don't talk in this film. &&Maybe, I just think the whole point of the show was the dynamic.

It wasn't even about the Death Note or the Shinigami, it was about the amazing cat and mouse between the two leads.

As you said they essentially created a totally different story, just in the same universe. And power to them for doing so, but it wasn't a good story. It was just the same tired heroic emotional rubbish. And it *certainly* wasn't the Death Note people were expecting.&&""You have a magical book that kills people?""

""Lets Fuck!""

&&Mine was when L was so confident that Light would kill him when he showed his face but it was never once established that Light kills innocents at that point. The same applies to L finding out that Light is Light because he didn't kill his dad. When, again, he never showed that he killed innocents. It isn't until the cops are killed by Light's girlfriend that someone ""innocent"" actually dies.

In the anime, L finds out that Light is greedy by making someone say they're L and saying their name. Then Light kills them. This event never actually happens in the movie, and it is vital, otherwise, any conclusion L comes up with is arbitrary up until those cops die.&&To be fair, Misa in the anime was also annoying, awkward and forced.   &&which was a shame, because otherwise i thought the characterization of him was not bad.  the maneurism and the way he acted and spoke were pretty on point.&&Yeah, as a rule of thumb, every time I see ""Live Adaptation of X Anime"" I think to myself ""Okay, this will be absolutely nothing like the anime, maybe use some character names and shit but literally nothing will be the same except the premise."" If I go into it like that, I'm okay.

The reason these things are terrifying is not because of the flight response of “oh god they might kill me! I might die! Spoopy!”

The reason they’re terrifying is because of what they represent. These strangely huge creatures shouldn’t exist and clearly have encountered some otherworldly horror that has transfixed their brains on these massive, ancient mountains. They represent the fact that there’s something infinitely more horrifying lurking in the deep caverns in the midst of a frozen wasteland.

Um. Has there been a trend of 2 part movies? How many 2 part movies have there been in recent history?

EDIT: Breaking Dawn and Deathly Hallows, are the only ""recent"" ones I can think of, and those were both part of a larger series. Before that, what, Kill Bill well over a decade ago?&&Very true. Light trying to find L's real name to kill him was one of the most important parts of the show.&&She had her own magic book that kills people&&In the anime it had to do with Light killing the person that murdered her parents, i haven't seen the netflix movie though.&&Not exactly. She worshipped Kira for killing the man who killed her parents. She loved Light because on top of being Kira he was also handsome and kind to her. He played this role so that she would work for him in killing people.&&Misa in the anime was pretty clearly a sociopath before ever meeting Light. That context isn't there in the remake.&&In the series she had her own Death Note and had already developed a fixation on Kira. So when she finds out Light *was* Kira, it was just a chance to jump the person she was smitten with. &&“Sequel”...?

I loved the original, but we gotta admit Misa was the kind of character (completely subservient without any real aspirations of her own outside of making Light happy) that probably wouldn't fly amongst non-Death Note fans in the west who would never read a manga/watch an anime.

The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,36069,79ca6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/79ca6m/the_curse_of_the_black_pearl_still_holds_up_14/,3076,1509221361.0,"Has my vote as one of most satisfying and entertaining pieces of popcorn entertainment from the last few decades. Everything, and I mean everything, is impeccably executed.


The cast is marvelous. The beautiful Keira Knightley (only 17 when this was shot) is a perfect leading lady, Depp's iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the movie, Bloom's principled pretty boy Will Turner is a hilarious counter to Depp, and an astonishingly good host of side characters fulfill their roles perfectly.


I could praise everything else; the set design, costuming, direction, special effects, script and score endlessly, but it'll have to suffice to merely say that the cooperative world-building is impeccable.


In the best way, The Curse of the Black Pearl feels like the ride that inspired it. Richly detailed, blissfully escapist and consistently compelling, I'll never understand how Verbinski and crew were able to maintain that for this entire two and a half hour movie.
But despite the aggressive plotting, this thing never runs out of gas. 

Through all the shifting character allegiances, evolving identities and various twists and turns along the way, you never lose sight of what's happening. It's a blockbuster equipped with a rare clarity and confidence, a total masterpiece that feels driven by a singularly creative and adventurous spirit.","TIL Keira Knightley was only 17in that movie&&And the interceptor is a beautiful ship which honestly didn't get enough screen time &&One of my favorite action adventure movies. Sword fights, ghosts, and the Black Pearl chasing the Interceptor is one of my favorite action sequences ever.&&Also one of the best main musical themes of the last 20 years.&&Jack Sparrow has one of the best entrances in all of cinema. It tells us so much about his character in such a small amount of time. Instantly we know he is not very good at being a captain, yet is tremendously lucky with swagger to boot. &&Geoffery Rush's ""Ya best start believin' in ghost stories..."" line is one of the best deliveries of a line that I have ever heard.&&What I love about this movie is that is balances the serious with the silly extremely well. Later iterations get bogged down with Deppisms and Plot Armor, but the first movie manages to keep events and moods serious enough to keep the audience enthralled. Sparrow actually treats some things seriously. The Black Pearl holds a terrifying, nightmarish presence when its chasing down the Interceptor. And more...&&I think the film's greatest strength is not having Depp as the lead man. &&There's a reason we have this bloated quintilogy today, because the first one was brilliant.&&The first film was a fun movie and kept me engaged the whole time. It's unfortunate that the lackluster sequels have made it a little bit forgettable.

Yep. Make a quality film and it will. Effects or not, if its a good movie...its a good movie. &&I wish the Pirates movies had stuck with the small scale. Part of what fucked the franchise was the fact every film after the first became a massive, world-at-stake globe trotting thing. There was no need for that. BP works so well because its just a tight little ghost story at its core. These movies should have just been small scale anthology stories/adventures connected by Jack Sparrow as a supporting character. &&For a film of equally “perfect” composition of its adventure parts, see How To Train Your Dragon. 

Not a single wasted scene, idea, location, character, mood or gag.&&Movies like this are great. Men in Black comes to mind as another one. Also A Kights Tale.&&[deleted]&&I remember when I first heard they were making the movie, and I scoffed at how terrible I thought it was going to be; making a movie based on a theme park ride seemed like a totally uninspired money grab by disney, in my mind.


I was completely wrong, though. It was a great film, thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.&&Am I the only one who likes the second one as much as the first?
I just love the darker tone, the flying Dutchman has a really cool concept and I think that Davy Jones is an incredible villain, both interesting and scary.
Also I remember being terrified by the kraken the first time I watched it.&&[](/flufflepirate)One thing is that first pirate film was historically athentic *except* for the skeleton pirates. It isn't accurate (Port Royal was actually the hub of piracy, Tortuga was a half-way decent place) but it FELT like a real point in history with real characters in a real place. Every film after that felt more like a fairy tale, with ever more absurd situations.

A pirate king? Magic running everywhere? Curses just being handed out like candy? 

Also, Jack just is the wrong person to lead, and the dead last person to build the entire mythos around.&&Fuck yeah it does. CotBP is amazing. Such a good movie with a great character performance by Johnny Depp. Barbossa is actually a scary villain in this one. &&It’s a shame they never made a decades worth of sequels. I wonder how that would have gone. 

&&I will never forget sitting in the movie theater with my Cousin, the movie starts.

""Pirates of the Caribbean"" rolls over the screen. Then ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and I hear her say: Oh god, it has a subtitle, they're going to make 8 of these.&&Keira was only 17 when this was shot?  I don't know why but that's shocking to me. &&didnt this movie have like a 10 million dollar catering budget?&&I solidly recommend the book  On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers to everyone ITT. It predates the entire series by a decade and a half, and it's clear Verbinski (as well as Gilbert & Schafer over at LucasArts) were inspired by it.  

A shame they decided to cannibalise the plot for the fourth film, but I can assure you the book is far more interesting than the film.&&S T I L L H O L D S U P&&Anybody who goes ""ooohh what? Pirates of the Caribbean?? Hashtag Eww""

No. Screw those people. You know what? Black pearl is one of the best movies ever made. 2 and 3 are pretty damn good. 4 is awful and 5 is decent but you know what? They're all watchable. 

But BLACK PEARL?? it's a legend. A perfect intro to the series. A masterclass on character building. A beautiful combination of action and comedy. What could you possibly mean by 'holds up'? Of course it holds up. Did the Social Network hold up so far too? Of course it did. MASTERCLASS. anybody that thinks Black Pearl isn't an enjoyable use of their time needs to be slapped.

Hard.

With a fucking fish.

Beautiful post, thank you for sharing.&&Shame every sequel got progressively worse.&&""Star Wars still holds up 40 years later""&&The scene with the skeleton pirates walking underwater is still one of the best scenes I've seen in movies to date.&&""Good movie holds up 14 tears later.""

Wait until I tell you about Casablanca.&&I think one of the things that made the first one so great, and where all the others stumbled, was that all the different conflicts between the different camps were filled with likable and sympathetic characters, with mostly reasonable aims and motivations. It kept you really invested in how it was going to turn out, and guessing who you should really be rooting for. The follow ups were just a boring ""pirates good, everybody else bad!"" conflict that lent no weight to anything. I couldn't even muster up any sympathy for Davy Jones because the conflict was so bland.&&Wtf, yea I had to look that up to double check, I always thought she was well into her twenties when the movie came out &&Sometimes when I see actresses at 17 looking like Knightley did, I wonder what cosmic karma they have going on because I was a sewer monster at 17.

Thanks, kind stranger. &&Wait wait wait...that means she was 14 when she was 18 year old Natalie Portman's distracto-twin in Episode 1!?!&&Yea, that's crazy! She didn't look 17 at all. &&Wait a second...that means that she was 17 in **Love Actually**? So Z for Zachariah and Rick Grimes were in love with a 17 year old?&&It's like Scarlet Johansson in Lost In Translation. Also 17 but performed like she was well into her twenties. &&Craziest thing to come out of this thread. &&Wish I looked like her at 17, it really blew my mind. &&TIL 17 year old Keira Knightly kissed a 26 year old Orlando Bloom&&Yeah this got me questioning her other roles...this movie came out the same year as Love Actually. 

She most definitely does not seem 17 in Love actually. &&When she does the fake-out dropping of the gold piece, that face she makes. Hot.&&If I remember right, they had to use makeup to make her breasts look bigger... I don't know why I know that&&It hurts to watch it go down. Every time.&&Well, there's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.&&When I rewatched it this year I was astonished at how much of it is real sets. 

There are very few outlandish fantasy locations like in all the sequels, and most of it takea place in Port Royal, which is a huge set, or on the many ships, that they all built and sent to sea to film on.

The action itself is also incredibly hand-made. The Ghost Pirates are (very good) CGI, but almost all other set pieces, fights and action sequences are practical / stunt work.

Curse is much smaller, but much more tangible than the other films.&&Music was on point too&&In part of [this feature length review (at 12:55)](https://youtu.be/zhdBNVY55oM?t=776) the reviewer explains why the action sequences in Curse of the Black Pearl are so satisfying.

Though I highly recommend watching the whole thing.&&Oh for sure. Nobody beats Hans Zimmer. Fun fact: he totally stole the pirates theme from his younger self. I was listening to the Gladiator soundtrack recently, and there it was! Obviously tweaked a little bit here and there, but that theme absolutely originated when he composed the score for Gladiator. God, I love Zimmer. 

Edit: apparently I have been terribly misinformed for over a decade. Apologies to Klaus Bedelt. So...he borrowed from Zimmer then. Not to condemn him for that, the music is still spectacular and composers borrow from each other and themselves all the time. Zimmer is still king in my book though. &&what cracks me up laughing in that scene is the epic heroic music, then that garbage of a boat sinks in  unceremoniously &&He maxed luck and charisma.&&At the time, I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie. Then I saw Jack Sparrow's entrance. The moment he steps onto the pier as the last of his boat goes under remains one of my favorite cinema moments ever.&&*But you* have *heard of me.*&&Every character's intro is like this, though Jack's is the most spectacular. 

Within the first 30 seconds meeting (the adult version of) the character you know their motivation, who they are, and what their relationship to the other characters is. &&*Captain* Jack Sparrow, Savvy&&But not just lucky. His entrance shows he's innovative and unphased by unusual circumstances. You can tell he's highly experienced. Especially after he bribes the dock worker and then pickpockets it back off him.&&[Link to said intro.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7m5Int1hAA)

There are also quite a few Youtube videos analyzing CotBP that are fairly good if my memory serves me well.&&[deleted]&&""...you're in one!""&&I am disinclined to acquiese to your request&&Dude, what about ""I feel... cold""?&&All of my favorite lines from this movie are from [Geoffrey Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GMkuPiIZ2k). &&I really enjoy his first scene,  when Elizabeth is taken onboard the Black Pearl and he gives his little speech about The Code.  Obviously Depp deserves s ton of praise for Sparrow but I think Rush should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  He nailed that part. 

Edit:  meant Depp,  not Drop&&People always bring up Depp, Knightly, and Bloom, but Geoffery Rush is my personal favourite through the whole series.  
&&Topped imho by his return at the end of the second movie. ""So tell me, what's become of my ship?"" 

[Scene](https://youtu.be/JYR0AUBrGyQ?t=1m12s). As good as it gets. 
&&Opinions are like assholes jakie.

YA ARE ONE&&I actually got chills thinking about it. Even if it's not my favorite movie, I must admit pretty much everything about the film is spectacular.&&Honestly, I would put Geoffrey Rush's performance as Barbossa right up there with Johnny Depp's Jack. He was a perfect mix of intimidating, charming, witty, and even reasonable, you couldn't help but love him. I was actually sad when he was killed at the end. &&[The clip](https://youtu.be/1fzXmJyolfY), quote at 00:33.&&The Sparrow basically became a meme of itself. &&Jack Sparrow works because he is one of those side characters that, in his own mind, thinks he is the main character. &&Another thing it does great compared to the sequels imo, is they keep it simple. The Pearl and its crew is cursed, and wants to get uncursed

The first feels like a real-ish world with a hint of Magic, where the sequels were magical worlds with a hint of realism&&Definitely. Jack Sparrow works best like a Disney sidekick... funny to have around, but not the main character. &&Ironically this film was Depp's first nomination as Best Actor by the Oscars; a lot of people forget about that. &&Well the character of Deep has evolved to become terrible but he was a GREAT character in the first movie. He *seemed* dumb, spontaneous, and drunk all the time but he was actually an incredibly clever, physically gifted, and nice guy. All the pirates in the know knew that he was much more than the image he portrayed to the outside world.
Basically Sparrow devolved from like a Forrest Gump type character into Jar Jar Binks, with pure plot luck driving him forward.&&He's the lead, but he's not oversaturated.

The sequels pretty much just relied on him (well, the third movie didn't even have him for like the first 30 minutes right?). Jack Sparrow was great, but once you overdo it it becomes annoying.

It's like Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is barely in it (though TBF I do think he could've had a few more scenes), but in Hannibal he's the star and some of the mystique is gone. Another example is the Hulk. In The Avengers he doesn't even appear til the halfway mark and then doesn't appear again til the climax. But in the sequel he's everywhere and it's not as fun (it's why a Hulk stand alone movie NEVER works out).&&My BF and I got into a serious argument about this a few months ago. He insists Sparrow is the main character of this movie, which I think is absurd as it is clearly Will Turner (or maybe, maybe Elizabeth, but no way it's Sparrow.).

My whole point is that the Pirates movies were fun when Jack Sparrow was this random force of nature that blows in and wreaks havoc, but when they made him the focus of the films they lost their magic. &&You don’t give scenes to he scene stealer. You let him steal them.&&Yup, classic way it goes. First is a labor of love with a lot of time and inspiration put into it, it does well because of that, the producers see the money and go ""okay now do it again ASAP!"" and it's basically impossible to be as good as that first self-contained story. Also nothing beats meeting all those characters and being introduced to that world for the first time.&&Overseas box office / percentage of total gross:

&&Maybe I’m in the minority, but I still enjoyed 1-4. I feel like they got a bad rap. Haven’t seen 5 tho &&The fifth made me angry. They gutted everything that made Jack Sparrow Jack Sparrow. Jack has this veneer of idiotic drunkenness that hides his dynamic, sharp mind. His extensive planning and spur-of-the-moment tactics underneath his half act (He's still a super drunk, for sure) make him the enjoyable and dynamic character he is. 

The only part of the fifth movie that had the Jack that the past 4 movies had was the snapshot of him as a young man tricking Salazar. &&The fifth was fun to watch with my family but I'd consider it a waste of time if I watched it by myself or with a friend &&Just watched it on a plane to Europe. It was either that or Sweet Home Alabama. Luckily I had time to watch them both. &&I would say ""shell"" is even a generous choice of words&&I find a good way to measure small adventure stories is by asking ""What would happen if the protagonist failed?""  

If they'd failed in CotBP, the three heroes die and the ghosts keep sailing.  

If nothing can ever happen if the protagonists fail because the world is exploded or whatever, you've made your scale too big and lost emotional depth.&&HTTYD was a really pleasant surprise. I watched it on a whim and got way more of a heartwarming adventure and solid character drama than I was expecting.&&This was on earlier today. It's hilarious&&I *love* the music from HTTYD.

It's got that bit of Celtic in there that's just enough&&On that note, Big Hero 6 is completely underrated.&&My only issue with HTTYD was that it was *nothing* like the books. Toothless should be a shitty green dragon, dammit! It's still an amazing movie though, I just think of it as a prequel to the books which explains how they learnt how to tame the dragons (Using names from the books of course).&&Men in Black is a rare example where the sequel wasn't extremely good, but the third was made and came though extremely well. I honestly love the series.&&A knights tale still holds up I re-watch it typically twice a year easily one of my top 5 films to watch. &&""I feel... *old*""&&Imagine how Johnny Depp feels.&&I remember my dad telling me we were going to a movie about skeleton pirates and I was freakin terrified. Then it became my favorite movie ever.&&That was my experience. I had zero interest, missed it's entire run in theaters, then one day a friend starts up the DVD at a get-together, I'm like, ""Oh, that dumb Disneyland ride movie,"" and 10 minutes in I'm like.... ""Whaaa? This is not what I expected.""&&I agree. Dead Man's Chest is underrated, a ton of fun, and not at all confusing or bloated as people claim. At World's End is where the franchise goes off the rails.&&Kraken and some of the action scenes made two a great follow up to one. But the third was meh and four and five felt like TV episodes or something &&Will and his Father plot line in 2 drags the movie down IMO. Jones is cool, the East India two villains are cool, the Black Pearl and everything that happens on the cannibal island is cool. But half the movie spent on Dutchman politics and Will plotting is boring and Orlando Bloom is not likeable enough to carry a full half of a film on his own. &&I don't get why the 2nd and 3rd get so much flack, they aren't close to as polished as the first but I found them all pretty funny and enjoyable the first watch (with 1 being the most rewatchable).

The 4th and 5th were absolute travesties in comparison.&&I concur wholeheartedly. When I first saw it, I was a bit disappointed it went as supernatural as it did, but it pulled it off. And precisely because of that - it was a 'real' world with supernatural elements, and the sequels were supernatural worlds with real elements. The first one felt like if there were to be more adventures, they'd be regular pirate adventures, and you can suspend disbelief because the rest of the world is normal and this is protrayed as the one big out-of-this-world occurrence. The effect is completely watered down by the sequels making it a world bursting at the seams with supernatural events and fantastic powers and skills and locales. &&I'm going to give an upvote, because I agree with the first couple sentences, but I will hold my tongue in regards to the greatest pirate king of all time &&The first movie felt like things were happening nonetheless, and our characters were reacting to a well-realised world.  

The sequels felt like nothing ever happens without the protagonists direct involvement.&&Barbossa is my favourite character in these films. He just *feels* like a pirate. He's a murderous, mutinous thieving scum who epitomizes everything a pirate is and was, and Geoffrey Rush plays him so well.&&That's where Disney fucked it up with the german title (again).

Due to the ride not being known widely, ""Piraten der Karibik"" must have seemed lackluster to someone in charge.
So they named it ""Curse of the Caribbean"" (""Fluch der Karibik"") and had to keep this main title for the whole series. &&Probably because she still looks almost EXACTLY alike. &&Same. Love Actually came out the same year, so it's a bit weird to think she was 17/18 in that movie as well. &&She’s turned 18 on set. &&I believe so, it was a post here a couple months ago&&Movie from the last decade still holds up! &&1 month later, bladerunner 2049 still holds up&&This ancient movie hasn't aged a day if you're open minded like me. &&I did too, she looks so much younger in Bend it like Beckham, and it turns out it was released just a year before The Pirates!&&When I was 17 a sewer monster told me I was ugly&&lol right? teenagers are grotesque, full of acne and look like children, how on earth did she look like that?&&Something something step 1&&Knightley is way taller than Portman and outgrew her shortly after that film came out. &&Huh. TIL that was her in Star Wars&&See how that holds up in court!&&Lemme ask you somethin Rick&&That's actually a little uncomfortable. She was making out with like a 40 year old dude in that movie&&No fucking way.  

Holy shit looked it up and you're right&&This one blew my mind more when i first found out.&&Or like Traci Lords being 16 in her early movies, when she looks like she's in her 20s. 

... uh, that's what I've heard. &&SHe has been pretty high profile advocating against the unrealistic body image hollywood and the fashion industry promote and pointing out that she has for the industry tiny breasts and all the things they did to distort that.

My wife is definitely what most would call ""flat chested"" , and when both are not ""augmented"" she looks just like knightly.&&Seriously right in the heart strings. Good news is that the real boat still sails around, she is called the lady Washington. &&That Black Pearl is a real ship.&&CGI is always best as an *enhancement* rather than the main selling point. Filming an entire film in front of a green screen always feels rather forced.&&[deleted]&&The pirate cove is also a great set, and real.&&The Interceptor is actually a real ship that's still sailing today, the *Lady Washington*.  I had the pleasure of sailing on it for a season, definitely a wonderful little ship (though certainly not the fastest in any fleet, haha.)&&My dad was getting really into sailing when those movies were coming out and took a class down there. All the marinas and other sailors were swapping stories of sightings of the black pearl, almost like it really was a mystical ship.&&Well, Hans Zimmer is *always* on point.&&I recently found that video on YouTube, clicked it out of curiosity, saw the run time and was like ""ya nah definitely not watching the whole thing."" 
Then I did and I loved it. One of the best reviewer videos I've seen because he's Goddamn right about it all. It reminded me why I love the movie so much. &&I really didn't intend to watch the whole thing, but that's a pretty great and interesting review! I've always loved that film but never thought too much about what made it work.&&John Williams would like a word.

I love Hans Zimmer, but to say that ""nobody"" beats him is a stretch.

It's just a really, really short list. &&[deleted]&&Wasn’t it Klaus Badelt who composed the first movie? At least that’s what the soundtrack says. &&Hans Zimmer was the producer of that soundtrack but Klaus Badelt is credited for music. &&Hans Zimmer didn't do black pearl, that is Klaus Badelt. Personally I do think Zimmer took his best parts and made masterpieces of them despite how poor the other films are, up is down and the theme where Keira and Orlando get married are some of the best modern compositions, period. And all based on the riff by Klaus Badelt. &&He also did the same composition in 'The Rock'. It's actually a little tacky how he keeps borrowing from himself to use again in another film.&&Hey it may have been garbage but it got him from point a to point b ^^^^and ^^^^not ^^^^a ^^^^step ^^^^further&&Even though the physics make absolutely no sense, it's a great gag&&Its the lucky rogue archetype. Jack Sparrow, Indiana Jones, Nathan Drake, James Bond (in the new films), probably a host of others I'm forgetting. All fall in that category to some extent. 

Not the best at what they do but make up for it with charisma and a ton of luck.&&""It's a *shilling* to tie your boat up at the dock""&&I had a similar experience with A Knights Tale when I was in high school. 

My sister took me to see it and I thought it was going to be some terrible romantic movie with Heath Ledger. 

[Then the crowd at the joust started singing Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hi8IWqic0U)&&My buddy from college does captain sparrow in Disney World. It's hilarious even in college before he started he had the voice for it. I used to call him captain. He was so fucking excited to get the job at Disney World. &&There's some pretty tight editing in the first movie. If you watch all the deleted scenes you can see its just not as effective.&&You are without a doubt the worst pirate i have ever heard of&&The movie is just plain loaded with great lines. &&In a fair fight, I'd kill you! 

Well that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? &&i still say this all the time switching out ghost stories for whatever's appropriate.&&Perfect delivery. &&That means No.&&Let's go?&&What an amazing scene&&Also an excellent delivery. &&That was my favorite part, perfectly executed but deep, you really felt for the villain and his struggle at that moment. Even the expression on Jack's face, a normally goofy character, completely serious. I even felt cold during that scene. Such a damn good movie, really makes me wonder what the hell happened to the rest of them? &&Three words that convey two entirely different sentiments: first, that he's achieved his goal of feeling, second, that he's dying in the process. I don't know of three other words in film that communicate more.&&Yup, that's the one I remember. A humorous thrill ride beautifully capped with sadness.&&Woah all this time I thought he said ""old."" 

And I was legitimately furious he didn't get to taste his apple. &&The number of times I tried to use that line with my parents growing up... Bedtime is more like a guideline than an actual rule.&&Which pixel is he?&&And he's in it for ten seconds in the sequel, but damn if he doesn't have the best entrance...and line:

""Now tell me, what's become of my ship?"" &&Love Johnny Drop&&I still link people the “the code is more like guidelines anyway” when they start saying something is against the rules. &&The 4th movie had its problems, but it was fun seeing Rush and Depp banter again.&&I met him working on one of the later Pirates films when I crewed one of the tallships they used. He's a true professional, and an incredibly nice, amiable man. He was happy to chat with us for almost an hour while they were getting ready to shoot. &&oh barbossa is easily my favorite character in the whole franchise thanks to rush's performance.&&He's literally the only reason I went to the 5th one.&&I remember that ending blowing my mind &&Chomping the apple is the best part. Totally sold the entire thing.&&YOURE IN ONE&&Jack Burton in the Pork Chop Express.&&That is an incredibly good way of describing it!&&And you barely even got any magic until the end with the coins.  I mean, invincibility and a quick scene with the moonlight, but for the rest of the time they’re people on a mission.&&This is the major difference imo. The first is a simple bedtime story. The rest become complicated and absurd. 

You could have the entire movie focused on Jack and it would still be great if the plot were simple. &&To add to this another great thing that COTBP does is not having the bad guys plan be evil. They just want to be human again.  It makes them much more likeable and relatable. 

Contrast this to Davy Jones, a great character but not particularly likeable, Blackbeard who I didn't care for at all and Salazar who frankly I found an annoyance the whole film. &&I'll submit this is also the reason why Hulk movies are a tough sell. &&Exactly! Imagine if, after the success of the first Star Wars movie, that George Lucas completely misjudged its popularity and decided to make Han Solo the main character of the subsequent movies. That's where Disney fucked up, taking the fun out of Jack Sparrow by focusing too much on him.&&If Jack Sparrow was ever to be the ideal lead in the movies, then they should start taking his alcoholism seriously. And that wouldn't be a fun movie at all. So keep him where he works best, god dammit...&&Lone Ranger....ehhhhh.&&Utterly insane. How his body of work in the 90s didn't at least granted him a nomination ?&&Did this come out before Donnie Brasco? I thought he did a great job there&&Yeah the character of Jack Sparrow is one of the worst cases of Flanderization I've ever seen.  It's a real shame because his character is fantastic in the first one.&&He's definitely a lead but I wouldn't at the lead. The reason jack sparrows fails to draw an audience in his standalone is because he's just the comic relief, not the plain shell of a character that Will was.  Will's the one we're meant to feel for and put ourselves in his shoes. At least that's how the first one was set up.&&Well it is a Pirate movie...should do better over seas.&&China sure loves our shitty movies.&&I loved the 3rd: in the timeless sand land, the trip back, the music, the sacrifice, the relationships.&&As someone who actually liked 1-3, don't watch the 5th. It's trash.&&5th is garbage. Jack isn't Jack anymore. Except for like, ~~twice~~ thrice. &&That flashback was probably my favorite scene of the movie.

It's so disappointing - they had a good idea smothered in that film. Show Jack as older and less confident. He no longer knows if he's pretending or if he really has turned into a drunken idiot. Show that he's not as quick to keep up with all of the batshit stuff that keeps happening to him. Show that he would rather be drunk than take another day of ghosts trying to kill him.

But then bring it back. Have him mentor Henry like he mentored Will. Have Barbossa remind Jack of who they were, who they are, and who they can be. Give Jack a chance to face off with Salazar and reclaim his cleverness. Give people a reason again to remember the name Captain Jack Sparrow.&&""do you think he actually plans all this? Or is he making it up as he goes?"" *mast falls over*&&Yeah even his delivery of lines in the 5th was absolute shit. He didn't even sound like jack. It was a terrible movie.&&At least it was better than the fourth&&I went in a 21 year old expecting a heart-warming adventure, and came out feeling like an excited 12 year old who wanted a dragon. It made me feel like a kid again. The music, the imagery, and downright adorableness of Toothless, it was the perfect kids movie &&14 years you carry that comment, /u/aconnellan, and now you waste your shot. &&clap clap clap&&Drunk and rich?

/e: just to make it clear: he's one of my favorite actors.&&Dead Man's Chest was made worse by At World's End because it isn't a self contained movie.&&3 is my favorite actually.&&Gol. D. Roger?&&Rush is so good in those movies. I know Johnny got the Oscar nod for Jack but Geoffrey Rush could have too!&&She and I are roughly the same age, but I guess I always assumed she was a few years older than I.&&You've got to be shitting me. I could have sworn there was at least a 5 year gap between the 2 movies.&&Bend It Like Beckham might have been filmed much earlier though. &&She revealed in an interview they had to use makeup to give her the appearance of cleavage. That may be one reason for the apparent age difference.&&I actually am a sewer monster.&&[deleted]&&Good genetics for some, makeup for the rest.

I mean have you seen what some older actors look like in real life? Age is hitting them pretty hard but on screen they still look mid to late 30's, maybe early 40's.. and *good* for those ages. Then you see a picture of them taken with a fan or something and there's quite the difference. 

It's amazing what 30 minutes with a professional makeup artist can do for your looks.&&Today: 

KK: 5'7""  
NP: 5'3""&&They’re less rules and more guidelines&&Funnily enough that's a perfectly valid defence in most places.. I had a friend end up in hot water when he took a girl home and it turned out she was 16 (he was 19). Her parents found out and called the police.

Thankfully he was fine because;

1. She looked at least 18.
2. She *told him* she was 18.
3. They met in a bar (legal drinking age here is 18), she used a fake ID to get in.
4. She fully admitted to lying about her age and the fake ID, as well as everything being consensual.

So yeah even though when it comes to statutory rape the minor can't consent, the way to law is worded here if a ""reasonable person"" would assume that person was of age then they can't be charged.&&*rubs head*&&https://giphy.com/gifs/jack-nicholson-nodding-anger-management-S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o&&Chiwetel Ejiofor was 26 and Mark Andrews was 30 at the time it was filmed.&&You've seen a ship with black sails, crewed by the damned, and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?&&I think it also hurts that the actors are having to imagine what theyre looking at instead of interacting with their environment. &&CGI follows the same rule as everything else - if you take the time/money to do it right, you will get rewarded with a quality product. Look at Fury Road - that featured both very good practical effects along with CGI that worked together to fulfill the directors vision. Even the original Jurassic Park has good looking CGI, because they put in a lot of effort to reach the technology's potential.&&This movie will always be a favorite of mine. It's on Netflix, and I watch it at least once a month. Everything about it was so well done. &&Don't leave out Klaus Badelt, either, who also scored *Equilibrium*, my favorite movie...

...and uh, *Catwoman* with Halle Berry.&&He recycled his Gladiator score. &&Also Howard Shore. The Lords of the Rings soundtrack is a true masterpiece. 

But yeah, that list of three people is responsible for most of the great film music of the last 50 years. &&Hans did a live tour this year, and it was amazing. Since he did do the score for the second POTC, he ended up playing it, and it's pretty amazing to hear live, and may have been one of the best scores of the whole show.

When you're there, you kinda see how much of his early work all sort of blended together, but he's taken so many risks in his later work, it totally makes up for it.&&This sounds like how Captain Jack himself would have defended it. Well done.&&[deleted]&&Human variant rogue (Swashbuckler) with the Lucky feat.

He's fantastic in everything. I hope they resseruct him again for the 6th pirates since Davy Jones is back &&Not only that he's dying, but that he isn't entirely sure he isn't happy about it. The feelings on his face are deeply confused.&&He was my favorite beastie boy &&Second only to Johnny Drip&&How the hell did you land that position? That sounds superb!&&He lives in the same area as my work and I see him regularly at the train station. I always have an awestruck look on my face but I'm too chicken to start a convo. I'm pretty sure he's clued in on me going ga-ga over his presence though lol&&I'm sure almost everyone knows this at this point, but it tickles me to know that the actors were all just as surprised as the audience by his reappearance. I enjoy stories of actors being fucked with for the sake of a genuine reaction in general.&&I'm surround by them!!&&I'm gonna tell you about a missing pirate ship, and I don't want to hear 'Act of God'.&&Big Trouble in Little China is in my all time top 5 favorite movies. There's not a bad moment in it.&&They also kept the CG to a dull roar. Davey Jone's sailors were so visually *busy* that they were just a mess to look at. Too much detail just blurs out, especially when A.) it's all CG and B.) it's an action movie. &&I really hope they go back to the original style for the new movie.

Edit: I have been informed that the new movie came out months ago. Apparently I have some catching up to do, movie-wise.&&The Hulk’s entire problem cinematically is that it’s essentially a werewolf film that doesn’t know it is one&&Indeed. Hulk Hogan just isn't leading-man material.&&Hulk movies are hard to sell because Universal Studios owns the distribution rights in perpetuity.&&Jack Sparrow as Hulk's sidekick would bump it up, yes. &&I think there's probably a way to make a good Hulk movie, but using the classic superhero format isn't really the right way to go about it. The Hulk is an interesting character but I don't think he works when he has to put on purple shorts and beat up bad guys and that's what all the Hulk movies seem to devolve into by the end of it.

They need to do what they did with Logan... Give us a dark serious adult rated-R movie. Make it about the battle between Banner and Hulk, not ""Hulk VS the US Government"" or ""Hulk VS Different-colored Hulk""

There's that one line in The Avengers where he says ""I put a gun in my mouth and he spat out the bullet"", take that emotion and run with it. That's when the Hulk is at his best. He's best when he's a tragic character, not an incredible one. That's my opinion anyway, I'm sure plenty of people love the purple shorts.

There's a comic called [""Hulk: The End""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk:_The_End) and though I haven't read it, I think something like that would work best.

&&They're about to fuck up again by making a Han Solo movie.&&Imagine if, after the success of a James Bond movie, the director decided to make a bunch of prequels about the childhood life of Erst Savro Blofeld.

Oh wait, that ""main villain backstory"" is exactly what the Star Wars prequels are.
&&Pirates 5 basically did the opposite: make him the lead and make the alcoholism wacky and funny. It sucked ass, imo. &&Lone Ranger is not a great movie but it does contain one of the best action train sequences ever. &&I liked it. I mean, it's not a super amazing piece of cinema, but it was entertaining, which to me is the most important thing for a movie to be.&&His facial expressions alone in Sleepy Hollow should have done it. Considering they're literally the only thing I remember about the movie...&&You'd think, I dunno, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas would have done the trick.&&""Donnie Brasco"" did come out several years before that, but Depp was not nominated for that performance. (Was nominated for best adapted screenplay.) 

&&If anything Depp should’ve had an Oscar for Ed Wood. Still think it’s his best role to this day.&&I thought he was alright up until about the fourth, with a STEEP decline in the fifth. It's actually baffling how badly he was flanderized in the fifth.&&Cunning, weirdly honest, very smart, and always comes out on top no matter how bizarre the situation gets.&&Jack is the Gatsby to Will's Nick Carraway.&&A main character needs to have weaknesses and flaws and their own hint of tragedy. It's why you cheer for them; you want them to overcome themselves just as much as you want them to overcome the psychical dangers that are against them. Will is a good lead even if he isn't as liked; and jack co-leads pretty well as he tries to best his old rival. But Jacks character by the end is just jack but with completed revenge. While Will is now a swashbuckling hero who got the girl.

You like Luke when he's forced to leave home and go on adventure, learning the ways of the force. You like watching Dr. Grant learn to take care of and care for children in a trying time. You want Ripley to face her fears of the xenomorphs to save her new surrogate daughter.

But a ton of Jacks love and comedy comes from just how little of a fuck he gives about his 'flaws'. He's a drunk and a womanizer and a buffoon and a pirate, and it's why we love him. We don't want to watch him overcome his alchoholism, or straighten up his act. The films glorify how incredibly fun those things are for him.&&Drink up me hearties, yo-ho&&China likes our shitty movies that boast *spectacle* - explosions, effects, fighting, action, stuff like that.

They have their own film studios to make movies with actual plots and drama.&&Personally I feel like there's a good movie in the third yet it just...unravels and loses itself a bit.

The constant backstabs and politics are an example. By the end it just gets too much and stops feeling like it makes sense. 

&&Yeah, I saw what they were doing with him. His moments of instantaneous recognition and knowledge (Barbossa's lady friend from decades ago, the Trident...), but it felt so clunky. They made him too silly, it was painful to watch. &&I enjoyed the movie as a spectacle, but it really bothered me that Jack never really talked to Henry about Will. Missed many opportunities to rib him about being ""just like his father"" or having the very real conversation about how Jack is the one that cut Will's heart out and made him captain of the Dutchman. There was a ton of history between Jack, Will, and Elizabeth and they didn't capitalize on any of it.&&Damn it, that would have been much much better, u should be a writer&&WTF was that scene though? They completely retconned his origin with that.&&I know right. His mind, knowledge, and the fact that he went toe to toe with Davy Jones in a swordfight and won the round. It's no wonder he's a Pirate Lord. &&I felt like Depp really phoned in his performance in the fifth, instead of enjoying playing the role as he did in all the others.&&Fifth was way worse IMO. Bardem was utterly wasted. Mcshane at least had a few decent scenes.

Depp was also very below par as well, compared to the first 4 too.&&The music in this movie was so incredible! And about feeling like an excited kid, Hiccups [first real flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xwOb5LkyQU), especially the part where he lets go of the cheat sheet and dodges the pillars still makes me feel like that!&&I liked all three.

CGI when combined with practical effects fool the audience into believing everything is real because they see so many real things.&&One of the reasons Jurassic Park's CGI still holds up is because much of it augmented the real, practical effects. Like the scene with the T-Tex and the jeeps, there's actual jeeps getting spun around and windshields being crushed in. Great blend of practical and CGI. Best way to do it. You see some of the same in this first Pirate's movie. Real sets and characters, enhanced with CGI. &&T2 is another example of CGI that even though it's very basic compared to effects now it holds up so well because of it's strategic use.&&Did Zimmer have a role in the curse of the Black Pearl?

There's a moment when Sam and Frodo are at the border of the shire and they're having an emotional conversation about how Sam's never been outside the shire before, and as soon as he takes his first step across the border, there's this perfect little musical cue. It's such an amazingly crafted score.&&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BkmF8CJpQ

So impressive how he's become a go-to name in composing in such a short time.&&I see your point and I say that kinda stuff all the time when people complain about physics and realism in fantastical movies, but in this case you can literally see the support columns at the front of the dock and the boat just moving right through it.

If you've ever met Hunter S Thompson or Seen him speak, you would also gain a new appreciation for his work in Fear and Loathing.  &&5 was a shit-show all around. The moment they opened with a Fast and Furious rip-off gag I knew it was going to be terrible throughout. I watched the movie when it came out, and I still have no clue what it's supposed to be about or the general story arch.&&wow that’s a great analogy&&This gives me an idea: what if you made a Pirates movie with Jack Sparrow as the ""lead,"" but structured the story like a Mad Max movie?

In Mad Max movies, most of the time, Max is essentially a side character. He's there, he's significant, but the story doesn't revolve around Max's journey, it revolves around someone else. Fury Road is a perfect example - the movie is actually about Furiosa and her journey, and Max is along for the ride.

What if you made a Pirates movie with Jack Sparrow playing that same kind of role? It's not his journey, he's just along for the ride, but he's still playing an important role. Meanwhile, someone else that can be allowed to develop as a character can be the actual lead, while Jack is just having fun and getting drunk along the way.&&Absolutely. For everything the movie does wrong, it does something right.

Kill off the Kraken off-screen between the second and third movie? That's ok! We have the scene where they come back from the dead!

Corny marriage aboard the ship when everyone is fighting? That's ok, the overall sequence of the boats fighting around the whirlpool is awe-inspiring!

Breaking the meta with Keith Richards in an extended cameo role? That's ok! The sacrifice Sparrow makes to save Will's ""life"" makes up for it!

I think, for the most part, it's a fitting end to the trilogy, but there are a number of changes that would have really solidified it as a solid set of movies.&&True.  I think that all the backstabbings and side-switching *do* ultimately make sense, if you piece it out carefully, step by step.  But it's very complicated and confusing in the moment, and I think it took me like 4 viewings to sort out entirely.&&Yeah it risked making it’s on characters unlikable by having everybody turn on each other. I think it wrapped well enough though, and like above said the sand land was weird and cool even if it didn’t make much sense &&My Will and Elizabeth got back together in the end so for me it was worth the crapton of spectacle w/o substance that came before it XD

My original OTP at 8 years old lol &&I was hoping Barbossa would make a comment to Salazar like ""cursed pirate crew? Been there, done that.""&&Yeah, I felt like the writers in 5 didn't pay proper attention to established lore.&&I thought that too. My least favorite part was Depp. Why did he seem so different?&&I've only seen a few movies in 3D, and I'm convinced that HTTYD will always be the best 3D movie I will ever see. The flying scenes were incredible, and they completely avoided some of the nauseating effects that Avatar included (forest chase scenes are never a good idea in 3D).

That's not to mention the incredible score by John Powell (his best, IMO) and the delightful writing and acting. Still can't believe it's a DreamWorks film.

EDIT: Wrong composer.&&If the series had ended with that shot of Jack sailing off with his compass in the little dinghy I would have been so happy&&Beckett’s Death is still fucking phenomenal, if a little bit corny. Davy Jones and Jack Sparrow duelling on a mast while swirling around a whirlpool is also so bloody stupid and wonderful. God I need to rewatch those movies &&I also really enjoyed the third. Everyone was lying to everyone else all the time. It had this great political drama aspect to it.&&Dude no. You don't line up every ship of the line afloat and then *not* have them duke it out in a pitched battle. I was so upset that they amassed those huge war fleets and then had a dumb video game final battle instead of a vast fleet engagement. &&""It's *Lord* now, actually.""

World's End and Dead Man's Chest had so much fun stuff in them, with Beckett, and the Kraken, and the Pirate Court, and the Maelstrom. The only downside is that they spent two movies building up towards a climax that for the most part didn't happen.&&I would like to take an ad out in your yearbook. Full page, two words&&From what I have seen of you, without even stalking your post history, I think you're beautiful. &&And no ship that's *not* crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could POSSIBLY have black sails and so couldn't POSSIBLY be any other ship but the Black Pearl?&&Ugh, that broke my heart. &&The Jurassic Park dinos looked much more real than the Jurassic World dinos even 25 years after&&Yeah, I totally would've believed that Bryce Dallas Howard can actually run in heels if not for all of the dinosaurs making it obvious that the whole thing was CGI. &&I love NC, but he defo gets a bit irate over CGI. 

I really do believe he would be critical on many of this movies CGI, just because it looks dated compared to todays. 

In his recent review of the 1999 Mummy, he was super critical on its effects for simply aging, when it was released almost 20 years ago they looked absolutely phenomenal. And that movie, once again, is a movie which had many, many practical effects. &&I think Zimmer wrote the skeleton of the main themes and Badelt wrote the rest, then Zimmer took over for the third movie. To me Up is Down and He’s a Pirate sound a lot more like pure Zimmer than The Medallion Calls and The Black Pearl.&&I think nerdwritter made a video about motifs in lotr. Everyone who loves soundtrack should watch his video. https://youtu.be/e7BkmF8CJpQ&&Ahhh, I love how the Fellowship theme comes together so majestically!

And every time it segues from the Shire theme to the Fellowship theme for that matter!&&James Horner......&&In this case the boat could just be disintegrating under the water as it hits the dock.  It wasn't a very big boat. &&it's almost unfair to bring Burt Reynolds into this discussion&&Huh, been meaning to start watching CR...

Excuse you&&No it's Ello poppet.&&Poppet? You're the poppet. &&Ya best start believin' in counting pee, urine one!&&As far as I know it's on Netflix&&But you have heard of me &&""A compass that doesn't point north, a pistol with only one shot', Norrington takes out Jack's sword, ""I half expected it to be made of wood""&&[Yup, because Sparrow took over a ship, learned the cargo was slaves, then freed them instead of profiting off of them.](#spoiler)&&I love that line so much. To this day I like to be silly and say ""commandeer"" instead of take/steal/borrow, and follow it up with ""nautical term"" in my best Jack Sparrow accent.&&Parlay? Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought up 'parley'!&&That's the first time I've felt like one Zimmer score couldn't just be swapped for another.

Edit: yeah, I know. Pirates isn't credited to Zimmer, but it's one of his guys.&&Oh man, in that case literally the only good part of that movie.&&Thank you for helping make my all time favorite film series next to Star Wars and LotR. <3&&Yeah, supposedly they were told it would be Anamaria (Zoe Saldana) coming down the stairs.

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383574/trivia?item=tr0669423&&I think it would have worked better if they just gave everyone a few barnacles instead of making them entirely out of sea bits. They could have played up the ""Drowned men"" thing without overdoing it. &&I was so disappointed in how they handled the PotC franchise.

The first movie is just wonderful. It's really masterfully done by a lot of perspectives. Then the sequels just get more and more outlandish and ridiculous, and I feel like the writers were being told, ""NO, go *bigger,* go *better*, make these people in fucking AWE constantly!""

Except I wasn't in awe. There are some silly physics in the blacksmith fight scene, but dear Lord the wheel in the jungle in 2 was insane and not in a good way. I didn't even see the point of cannibal island.

I liked it best when you really weren't sure what angle Jack was taking or what kind of man he was, that Elizabeth was a pirate fangirl who had grand ideas with no way to back them up (I'll fight *with the coat of arms over the fireplace*), and that Will was this good naive guy.

But Jack became the focus too much and the mysteriousness of his character vanished, Elizabeth became somehow competent in being a pirate herself, and Will went dark side. And suddenly sea magic is all the fuck everywhere.&&I thoroughly enjoyed it. For free, at home, on a rainy day.&&#HULK SMASH&&Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?&&There's a great one with Jack Nickelson and Pfeifer. Wolf, iirc.&&Jekyll and Hyde is essentially a werewolf story and werewolves predate it by 50 years&&No Holds Barred was far superior.&&[ANTIFREEZE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lt81WBrUBLc)&&Which is exactly how they're going to ruin it.

Han and Chewie are SMUGGLERS at the beginning of episode 4. They make a living cutting shady deals with crime lords. Han has no problem dusting a bounty Hunter and walking away like it's no big deal. Han isn't a good person.

A stand alone movie should take more cues from gangster and Yakuza films than buddy cop pieces. It should be about desperate survival, not searching for a mcguffin.&&Really, just pick any classic heist movie then fill in the characters with a variety of no name actors, stage hands, and muppets. 

Imagine Italian Job but in the end they're all shoved in to the back of a YT-1300 balanced right on the event horizon of a black hole and then Han says ""I've got an idea"". &&Dude's only line was ""HAARRRGRGGHH!!!"" but damn he was scary&&[deleted]&&Hard to give a fuck if your only passion in a project is the paycheck and your lines are terrible. &&I rewatched Curse of the Black Pearl right after seeing Dead Men in theaters. The difference is night and day. There is none of the swagger. Sure Jack was drunk a lot in the first one, but he still maintained himself as a force to be reckoned with, always had a plan, and executed it perfectly. This latest installment is just your typical alcoholic who has no ability to carry himself, and relies on others for his success.

At least the 4th was fun, this was....I'm not even sure. It was so bad I wouldn't even pirate it. They should have stopped after 3.&&Dreamworks also made The Prince of Egypt which I still hold up as the most beautiful animated movie ever. Very very different in tone, but the animation and music and voice acting is stunning &&I can't be happy with any ending but Jack with the Black Pearl.  Like, that's the love of his life right there.  I feel like Barbossa can have any ship and be happy with it, but Jack needs the Pearl.

I endured all the rest of the bullshit in the first couple sequels, but ending without Jack captaining the Pearl made me swear off seeing the others.&&I find the other two entertaining but I definitely prefer to view them as ""What If..."" stories rather than connected to the first three.&&/r/wholesomesewermonster&&That was nice of you.&&Those two got their chemistry back in the 5th one. I could watch a movie about them.&&Story?&&I think that's mostly due to SO MANY practical effects, live puppets and animatronics being the common screen-time dinos...and most of the CGI dinosaurs were during dark/weather-filled scenes.  It's harder to see the cgi vs real separations when the right lighting and effects are used, and you aren't seeing it for long periods of time.

Even shitty Saturday specials on SciFi channel (when I used to watch it) can get a pass for decent cgi if it's not on screen for a long period of time, or has extended interactions with the actors.

But when cgi goes for a long time visibly...you start to notice&&The realism was solidified by the fact that she said it never occurred to *her* to take them off. &&It's unfair when Burt Reynolds tells you it's unfair.&&This is the perfect time to get into it!  The previous campaign's story has reached a conclusion, and ended that story with those characters.  The rest of 2017 will be one-shots and holiday breaks, and then an entirely new campaign with new characters at low level starts some time in January 2018!

So you can spend the next 2 months catching up on some of the previous stuff, and then join us at the beginning of the next adventure! :D&&Yeah, often an aspect of the character is that it's surprising how good they actually are at whatever it is they do, given some other aspect of their personality (Sparrow is a drunk, Jones is a professor, Bond is severely damaged, Archer is an idiot).

I rest my case.    :-)&&I think I read that filming for that one was during his nasty divorce so I'm sure that didn't help either. &&Also, that it seemed like he was drunk, in real life, when delivering all of his lines.&&And when it comes to story writing, Kung Fu Panda (the first one) was also good. If you had summarized the plot and listed the voice actors, I would immediately assume it was a terrible movie. But the writing and character development was pretty good. The villan escape scene was badass, and the score by Hans Zimmer was fantastic.

Fun Fact: It's one of the few major Chinese-themed films by a Western studio that has sold well in China. The the culture, religion, and message of the film was authentic enough to resonate with Chinese audiences, despite breaking some of the cultural norms (i.e. the hero in Chinese films tend to be ""flawless"") I'll have to look up the article for the source...&&I think you smell like a butt&&He had to act some scenes in front of a green screen with nobody else around, since they'd be CGId in later. He eventually broke down because he just couldn't make any emotional connection without anyone else around, and said that this wasn't why he got into acting. &&He broke down, essentially saying that he was a trained stage actor and he was never prepared to stand in a room yelling at tennis balls for hours and hours.&&So much of the Hobbit trilogy was filmed in green screen that, during filming one day, Sir McKellen sat down and cried on set, saying ""this isn't why I became an actor."" &&I think Archer is just as damaged and probably a bigger drunk.&&Archer isn't an idiot, necessarily. Mild autism, combined with a lot of the time he is intentionally acting oblivious to piss people off.

One of my favorite running gags is when someone tries to correct Archer and Lana will sigh and say ""he knows.""&&As an ignorant kid I always wondered why that little boy hung out with an old dude like that. &&Which is exactly what the filmmakers want you to think.

The whole series got completely fucked when Guillermo Del Toro left and Peter Jackson got no time to prep storyboards, rewrite the script, remake the props and sets, etc. Jackson himself described his whole shoot of the hobbit as him winging it because he had no time.

"Denis Villeneuve reacts to ‘Blade Runner 2049’ bad box office, stands by spoiler-phobic marketing",33197,781k1i,http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-denis-villeneuve-box-office-1201886155/,4822,1508692947.0,,"I think this brings up the movie-fans vs general audience debate again. The general audience wants to know what to spend their money and time on where as the majority of movie fans (including Denis) will go in with a clear-mind, seeing what the film has to offer. Can’t really please both sides here. &&I’ll watch anything this man directs. &&I completely agree with everything he said. And I also stand by avoiding spoilers in trailers.

This is so sad that such a good movie is doing so bad :(&&He made a great film.  He should take pride in that.&&He did it right.  This was the best movie I've seen all year.  Every moment was captivating and the whole experience was surreal.  An wonderful change from the formulaic blockbusters.  It had artistic integrity and wasn't trying to go for mass appeal.  &&Loved Blade Runner 2049, I hope it keeps making money long after the ""box-office hits"" have been forgotten.&&This ""bad box office"" narrative is overblown. 

It has made $194M worldwide, with the overseas weekend numbers not back yet. It has not opened in Japan, China, South Korea and other Asian markets where this kind of film does well. 

And that's not even considering what it will do on home video, where it will especially do well years after most of this year's box office hits fade away. &&I'm really happy that a movie like this was still able to be made nowadays. It will hopefully get more money and recognition as the time goes on.&&It's destined to be a cult classic, just like it's predecessor. Of course, I would've loved to see it do better at the box office.&&Weird how that movie failed. Sure, it was long and ""artsy"" but had also plenty of action and a lot of tension that kept you glued to the screen. &&Judging by the trailers, I thought this was going to be a Hollywood-fied version of Blade Runner.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much it was like the original.  Denis deserves more credit for making an excellent sequel, more than he is getting right now.

Besides, if we judged movies by their box office, Transformers 3 would be one of the greatest movies of all time, and that film sucked.&&I refused to watch any trailers or promos for this movie.

I went to watch it with only my memories of the first movie for company.

Turns out this movie is one of the best movies I have seen in ages!

It had an actual storyline that kept you guessing till the very end. Some excellent side stories that makes you question life.

Yes it is a long movie but I was never bored. Not once. 

Riveting, old school, gritty sci fi and I loved every second of it. 

I don't agree with the ending.&&Blade Runner 2049 is fantastic, and a visual wonder.


 It's also almost 3 hours long, and an R rated noire detective story that came 35 years after the original. It was likely never going to be a huge thing at the box office. &&I think it's sad that they measure success on box office numbers. Villeneuve created a masterpiece and should be proud. The movie fucking rocked&&I loved this movie, the most beautiful film I’ve seen in years. &&The movie has maybe three action scenes. 


And that is a GOOD thing. I loved every minute of it. Box office success is not always indicative of a movie's quality.&&Box office nimbers have been become something of a sport and it's sad that it's taking soooo muuuuch discussion, seemingly moreso than the actual film itself. 

Yeah, box office numbers are important for more films of the genre later on, but jesus christ mang&&I do think the marketing was off. Sure they didn’t have to spoil the movie but the trailers and marketing made it seem like you had to watch the original blade runner when that wasn’t the case. I mean it helps for Easter eggs and makes you more familiar with the characters but everything you need to know is explained in the movie. If they had done a trailer explaining who the blade runners are for people who haven’t seen it. Like spoil the basic premise of blade runners are robot hunters and gosling has a case about broken robots that may be more. It didn’t need to advertise to blade runner fans, the look director and everyone involved was enough to get fans to go, they needed to market to people on the fence and newcomers. &&When the Cast away trailer spoiled the ending, Zemeckis pointed out that people may say they don't want spoilers, but in reality they actually do. They aren't going to see something unless they know *exactly* what it is.

Some times I think he may have been correct. Sadly.&&My problem is that it's hard to get the younger viewers to even watch the original. No original, no love, no sequel. Shit, I try to push Logan's Run and Bladerunner on my teenage boys and it's like I'm peddling Pearl Harbor or something. &&I loved the movie, but I'm not really surprised that it failed at the box office. I don't think it was because of the marketing, but rather that most viewers would have found it boring. I remember walking out of the theater after seeing the film, and the first thing my friend does is to start complaining about how slow and pointless the movie was. &&I think the 4K and Bluray sales of this will make up for it. I still can't find the first Blader Runner in 4K and I cannot wait for 2049 to hopefully come out before holidays.

This was one of the best sequels I've seen to a movie that didn't really need one. It felt like the Ridley Scott/James Cameron one-two punch but now it is Denis Villeneuve. &&I've never been much of a movie person.  Too cheap to see most things in theater, and I guess too ignorant to miss a lot of the nuances and fine points of great film making.    

BR 2049 really hit me hard.  I cried in the theater, but was smiling on the drive home.  Scenes from the movie, quotes from important scenes, stuck with me.  I came home, immediately hit reddit to find somewhere to talk to other people about this movie.  I've seen it 3 times in theater, ponying up each time to see it in an AMC Dolby theater.  (That's about 60 bucks right there, more than I spend on movies in 2 years, possibly 3).     

This really is a situation where my heart is broken about a film not doing well.  I feel bad not only for the movie makers/actors/studio, but I also feel bad *for people who will miss out on such a really great movie*, something I've never felt before.  I can only hope it grabs some Oscars and catches a second wave of showings in theaters where hopefully more people will get to see it.   

 Fingers crossed.  &&I loved this movie. Thank you Villenueve for helping to bring it to us. &&This movie bombing is one of the biggest injustices of all time.&&M, 19, never heard of the movie before I saw it in my local showtimes. Knew nothing about the previous movie, knew nothing about the story, just saw that Harrison Ford and Ryan Gossling were in it and that was enough. Saw it, loved it. But yeah if I hadn't randomly checked my local showtimes I would have never heard about it.&&Blade Runner was one of the best movies I've seen in recent memory. The fact that it wasn't a financial success is more an indictment on moviegoers than it is on the director.&&It was still good as fuck though&&When Reddit shits on a movie, I check the [tomatometer](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner_2049/) for a reality check:  88% reviewer approved, 81% audience approved.

That's a good, if not great, film. The original film performed modestly at the box office with plenty of negative reviews. VCRs created a cult following, and today the film is widely respected. It's on most lists as one of the top 5 scifi films to date. I wouldn't be surprised if BR: 2049 follows the same trajectory.

Edit: We need to reframe how we think of movie profits. With the advent of VHS rentals, then DVDs, and now streaming, films make money into the far future. I'd be interested to know, for example, how much money the film Clue made after it left theaters. The film was widely panned and failed to recoup its $15 million production cost, very likely due to its insanely dumb marketing gimmick (pay to see the film 3 times to see the three different endings... yeah, nobody did that). Today, Clue is a cult classic, and a Reddit favorite. &&>Villeneuve even requested for K’s identity as a replicant or a human to be left out of all reviews.

Oh you mean that plot point that they spell out for you right at the beginning? That's not the plot twist of the movie. The plot twist is [whether or not he's Dekkard's son](#spoiler)&&I respect him for sticking to his guns. The film was excellent and I'm so glad the trailers were vague.&&I don't understand the argument that marketing is behind a poor box office showing. Compare Blade Runner to Arrival, another dramatic and thought-provoking Sci Fi Film, and it's doing pretty well.

It's also not like the trailers give off the wrong impression of the film, and I doubt there are people out there saying, ""Well why didn't you say that Ryan Gosling is a robot?!? I would definitely have bought tickets to the movie if that was in the trailer!"" like the article seems to insinuate.&&I don’t understand. I thought it was a fantastic sequel.&&It's sad that a really good movie isn't getting its due, but I'm glad that WB won't be trying to churn out a bunch of shit sequels about the replicant revolution now. The two Blade Runner films are both very intertwined in their story, but they both manage to stand tall, completely on their own. That's a rare and beautiful thing with sequels. &&I can see it being a cult classic.  This obsession with opening weekend is so weird for films like this.  

I wonder if it picks up any oscar buzz and, if so, that'll help it.

Incidentally, I saw it on opening night at a regional multiplex (Hertfordshire, UK) and it was empty.  But today at a central London IMAX, it was packed.  This is definitely a demographic thing.&&Several of my facebook friends saw the movie multiple times and can't stop talking about it.  This movie is going to have a long tail. Money'll get made. &&I saw this film at the IMAX. Paid for the premium seats as well. Its the first film I've bothered to go to the cinema for in almost ten years, that’s how much of a success it was. 
It's the first piece of Sci-fi to come out in ages that didn't amount to Tom Cruise being flung around in some fucking CGI disney flick funded by scientologists &&If only Harrison Ford didn't charge 100 million per film, the filmmakers would atleast have 33% less of an investment catastrophe &&It's such a shame that a quality product like this was a financial victim of its own studios' pretentiousness. There was absolutely no reason whatsoever that the infant couldn't have been even mentioned in the trailers at all because it spoils nothing. They expected the masses to spend money based on seeing Deakins' & Dennis Gassner's work (phenomenal), Gosling & Ford, and the original film that 90% of the population has never seen. You need to market a story that is worth experiencing on the big screen if you expect people to leave their homes (homes where they can watch incredible stuff on TV and be satisfied). 

There's nothing worse than a filmmaker having to defend his work over the financial result. Unless they're David Fincher or Chris Nolan and are granted access to the decision-making of the campaign, the director is helpless. Denis did his job beautifully: he handed WB a film that is easily worth $450mil with a great marketing campaign. He shouldn't have to explain the decision. &&Such a great film.&&Blade Runner 2049 was an awesome sequel to classic film. Go see it. &&I'm really upset it's not doing well. It's the most beautiful and one of the best films I've seen all year. Doesn't hurt that the original is one of my favorite films of all time.&&This really sucks. Planning on seeing the movie this week because I heard its terrific. Sci-fi needs to pickup &&I went into this movie opening night blind other than the first trailer. 

Was shocked when the first twist happened and floored by the movies course and resolution. 

I am going to forever cherish that cinematic experience. &&So we're reading an article that's 3 week's old about the ""failing"" of a movie that has grossed 195mm.

Really?&&from the director...

""“I liked the idea that you were supposed to learn it as the movie goes on,” he said. “As a cinephile, one of my best experiences was when I was on a film festival jury. I had to watch 20 movies without knowing anything about them. You don’t know the genre, you don’t know the country, you don’t know the story. You don’t know if you’re about to look at a comedy or a horror movie!”&&Such a shame.  Great director, amazing film, the right approach to marketing.

So sorry to see it disappoint at the box office.

I have no doubt it'll blossom as a cult hit the way the first one did but Hollywood is more fickle than they were in 1982, so we may not get such a big, ambitious auteur movie for a long time.&&The three short films leading to 2049 could have played a better role in marketing the release.  Like each one could have aired once a week on a Sunday evening TV slot, between shows or something

2048: nowhere to run 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ9Os8cP_gg&&This film is so fucking good. I just got back from seeing it, and it's a damn shame audiences have apparently ignored it, because it's everything a good sequel should be: faithful to the original, while still being its own thing and having its own message (that builds upon the original's quite nicely).

Definitely my favorite film of this year.&&It was such an amazing movie. I'm going to go see it a third time this coming week.&&The low box office numbers aren't surprising.  Science fiction isn't very popular.  Most people prefer stuff like Star Wars.&&I put on Blade Runner every night when I go to bed.  And I mean EVERY night and have been doing so for several years.  Blade Runner is the perfect movie in my opinion.  I initially didn't like the idea that they were even making a sequel.  After hearing Villeneuve talk at Comic Con and watching the shorts I began to be hopeful that the sequel might actually be something that'd be worthy of following the original.  And the sequel is absolutely that.  It is a triumph.  Nothing can touch the original.  But the best thing I can say about the sequel is its the sequel that the original deserved.  I don't care about the box office or anything else.  &&Breaking News: It's a fucking travesty that this movie is doing as bad as its doing.&&I’m just going to have to do my part and see it a third time in the theater now.  &&I wish everyone would stop worrying about the box office and just be happy it got made, and was pretty damn cool. For people who love the original, it's kind of a miracle sequel that could have been a mess.

It will be thought of in high regard in the future, and while it may take a long time, it will probably make its money back. I know I plan on buying it in some crazy 4k package. I don't even own a 4k TV yet, but that shit was beautiful on the big screen.

Sorry if it wasn't for everyone, but not everything has to be for everyone. I'm glad it took chances, and I'll see every movie Denis makes. &&I love spoiler free trailers and wish more producers would go that route. That being said I really thought this movie balanced between being visually interesting and cliched , atrocious, and really bad. I can understand how one could enjoy it but still&&People will still care about this movie in 25-30 years...unlike whatever “outperformed” it at the box office. &&I loved this film.&&Wait is BR: 2049 not doing well? How? It's movie of the year in my opinion...&&Saw it last night, loved it! Hope it ends up breaking even by the time it's on VOD/Blu-Ray.&&Sad. Best movie I've seen in theatre in a very long time. My wife and I loved it. &&It kills me that this movie isn't getting box office proportionate to the experience it offers.  People are fucking idiots. &&I know it didn't make a billion dollars but it broke even and is making gravy now. It's also a film the studio will be proud of and will gain more attention during award season. There's also a good chance of it becoming a cult favorite. 2046 did just fine. &&I felt it was a little slow the first time I saw it. The second time the pacing felt perfect. I enjoyed it more the second time. It was a little hard to follow the first time. I highly recommend watching it again. &&I think the reason this film wasn’t a “box office super duper mega smash hit” is simple. It didn’t appeal to kids. Kids don’t pester their parents to go. That cuts out a large market.

The film itself was brilliant. Not everything has to be a marvel style, good for the whole family, a bit of everything, fun romp. I really believe this Bladerunner will be seen as one of the best sci-fi’s of the decade. It will continue to make money on streaming services. 

I hope this director continues to make sci-fi. His films are gorgeous, thoughtful and better than the vast majority of scifi that’s been coming out lately. 
&&What worries me about this film's failure is what execs will take from this. I can guarantee they'll take the wrong lessons out of it, and think it was the theme, or the length, or something else which ultimately made it great. I'm happy we have BR2049, I'm just sad we won't get many films like it in the future&&literally just walked out of the theater. Really enjoyed this film.&&That movie was awesome.  A truly original cinematic experience with a very satisfying conclusion.  &&It's a great movie. Please go see it. It will be huge in a few years. &&I loved this movie so much. I feel bad it’s not getting the attention it deserves. &&Amazing film. Definitely deserves to be seen on the big screen.&&You bet your as I'm gonna buy it&&I tell people who shit on this movie’s money performance this: the movie wasn’t made to make a ton of money, it was made to be a great Blade Runner sequel. They did exactly that, and I have a great amount of respect for them sticking to their vision and absolutely nailing it. &&Denis should be proud because he made a remarkable movie they didn't fit the mold of a traditional action flick, all the while living up to the film's predecessor. I was skeptical when they announced this movie but all doubts were destroyed after watching it. They said I hope it has a better life on Netflix.&&It will prove its worth in time. OG Bladerunner also sucked at the box office and now is referenced as a legend. True quality is appreciated in its own time. 

Movie was phenomenal imo.&&Works of genius often are not understood in their time.  I predict that this film will also achieve cult status and have very long legs.&&Everyone should go see this movie, it's a fantastic experience. Go for IMAX. No, it's not an ""art house"" film, that's bullshit. &&Many films have benefited from an Oscar re-release. Not to mention an Oscar win. I hope that will help. &&As someone who works in the film trailer industry I would like to point out that at any given time 3-5 marketing agencies are cutting trailers for a big film.

The studio then puts them in to testing focus groups. I.e some shit at a Ohio mall. The trailer that gives away more of the movie usually tests higher than the rest. The studio puts out the trailer that tests the highest. 

It's the stupid people in focus groups fault, and dumb people in malls.

So we all hate giving away the whole move yet you always lean towards wanting to see a movie once you know the entire god damn story. Blame the general public. &&I've only seen 2049 once, and I'm dying to see it again to really unpack it all, but I think it's my favourite movie of all time. Everyone I've spoken to who has seen it agrees it's an amazing movie. Can't believe it's not doing better at the box office!&&Half way through the article, talking about how important it is to the director not to spoil the plot and then they drop a spoiler and name a major character as a replicant.... Goddamnit&&It’s really a shame that not a lot of people are seeing Blade Runner 2049. I thought the movie was an incredible experience visually and audibly as well as great acting jobs. I kept thinking to myself while seeing it I don’t want this to end. &&Had some edibles before seeing this movie. Easily the most intense movie experience of my life. Every scene could have been a wallpaper&&The thing is, they made a truly GREAT movie and they know it. Even if it only breaks even, the tremendous quality of the film they've made must count for a whole lot, maybe some awards at least.&&Good, because he and his crew made an amazing film and should be damn proud of it. I'm part of that 77% that is apparently the core audience (Male, >25, no surprise) but I was transfixed throughout and left the theatre, not so much with questions, but at least a little uncertain about some aspects of what I'd been through, and that's a *very* good thing.&&I'm really quite sad that they movie is not doing better. 

The original is one of my favorite films. Consequently, after being disappointed by so many recent cash grabs, I went into this one with very low expectations. 

His movie vastly exceeded all of my hopes. Everything from the story, the acting, the score, was damn near perfect. And if this movie doesn't get the best cinematography Oscar I'm going to call bullshit because it is the best shot movie in recent memory. &&I loved the original Blade Runner when I saw it as a teen and I love the new one now.

It's brilliant, beautiful and goddammit I love it.&&I thought bladerunner 2049 was great, and the marketing was just enough. I'm more baffled by my own friends who said it sucked, never taking movie recommendations from them.&&I've heard nothing but good things about this movie and still plan on seeing it ASAP.

Box office showings don't really have much to do with how a film is received in the long run anyways. I think I remember Spielberg predicting that several big budget movies would flop at the box office which would cause studios to rethink the way they make movies &&The worse people are the ones who say what happens when they know it’s the movie you’re on line for the next showing.&&Well I've seen it twice now and I'll pay for a third ticket probably, really help pad out those box office numbers. As someone who considered Blade Runner to be one of my favorite films of all time (even in all it's different cuts) and as a diehard Villanevue fan since I first saw Sicario (which I subsequently intoxicated myself with all his work) just the idea of 2049's existence made me chub up a bit. Seeing in theatres the first time I was fully erect the whole film. What a masterpiece imo. Saw it a second time and brought a different friend who I thought would like the movie. After it ended he said he didn't like it at all because he didn't get it and there wasn't enough action. This film was absolutely made for fans of the original and I truly don't know if I've ever seen a better sequel. I loved the original and have seen it many, many times and I watched the 3 short films twice a piece before going in so I had in depth context that I'm sure a lot of the""general audience"" didn't have and that likely made it confusing for many. Basically the point I'm trying to make is that this was a movie made for the diehard fans by a diehard fan with little regard for the summer blockbuster audience and I really fucking respect that. I understand that when you make a huge investment in a movie you are trying to turn as big a profit as possible. A lot of movies these days lack heart because they try to cater to as large an audience as possible. Blade Runner 2049 had more heart than any summer blockbuster I've ever seen because it rejected that idea and catered to the same audience that enjoyed the original and little else. Man I could talk about this movie for hours.&&As someone who was really excited for this movie, I just think marketing did a bad job of making it clear when the movie was coming out.  I didn’t realize it had premiered until friends told me that they had seen it a week ago.  That’s bad marketing.  Spoilers have nothing to do with it.&&$300 million? That seems like a lot of money for a slow artsy movie.&&Box office take is not an indicator of quality. Pass it on.&&It's a 3 hour long, artsy, directors cut that somehow made it to theatrical release. You could cut this movie down to 2 hours just by shortening still shots. 

Anyone that thinks this would play with audiences is crazy and cannot understand that quality is not the only driver in marketability. &&I went twice... damn. :(

I want more of these!&&This move is best watched on a large screen with good sound IMO. &&* Production Budget: $150 million
* Worldwide gross (so far): [$194,105,203](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/default.htm?id=bladerunnersequel.htm)	

I mean, the movie already managed to surpass its production costs. I think it's going to bring a small profit, which is not bad at all. With that being said, I watched it twice.&&You can't please everyone. I'm glad Villeneuve picked one path over the other rather than being indecisive and choosing some middle path and failing to appeal to either demographic.&&Saw it and really liked it. A big reason people don’t go and see movies is bc they can watch them on a fire stick at home for free. Before the arguing starts I believe this to be true. You’re going to pay at least 50 bucks for tickets and popcorn so the movie better be good. This one was. &&I was sure word of mouth would help this movie. This is bad news for all us movie fans. An excellent movie that doesn't make enough money is a bad movie as far as studios are concerned. These types of movies are so few and far between already. Dang. &&$195 million worldwide, and it was just recently released in S Korea and China:

http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bladerunnersequel.htm

I think in the long run, it will do just fine. &&Please dont cut funding for dune... Please dont cut funding for dune. ..&&I've been very disappointed with most the remake/sequel cash-grabs, including Star Wars, Prometheus, Total Recall...

In fact that's why I didn't bother with 2049 at first...  But I saw it today...Good film all around. Now that it's gone a few weeks with positive reviews, i expect sales to kick up. I mean, the theater was pretty full today.&&So is it good?
&&it's a great film, I loved it and came out thinking to myself, ""boy general audience isn't going to like this at all""&&It is a sequel worthy of the original. Yes it's long but the visuals, story, and score are amazing.&&Denis is exactly right and the marketing was terrific. Sad that the general movie going public needs to be spoofed what's going on in a movie to see it in so many cases &&[deleted]&&Such a bummer the movie isn't performing well. Have seen it twice already and absolutely love it. The score, imagery, themes and acting are all very well done and make for a great time. Love the fact they didn't spoil anything about the movie in the trailers (think waaaaay to many movies do that and it ruins movies). I worry this will prevent studios from taking chances on other movies like this/sequels that could really be fun. Hopefully it doesn't! &&Blade Runner 2049 was excellent and I really hope we get another. &&This movie was a damned masterpiece and will stick with me forever.

Profit or not, the film impacted the fans in a positive way, and for that, I’m so thankful to Villeneuve and team.&&I went to see the movie on opening night, and I was the only person in there. That’s the first time that ever happened, and I was quite disappointed.

I’m old enough to remember seeing the first Blade Runner at the movies, and being completely blown away. I wanted the second to have the same impact to others around me.

I wasn’t blown away by this sequel, but it was good. But, over the next few days I found I was replaying much of the movie in my head. I had some questions, and then I saw the other three shorts posted up on reddit. They explained a lot.

This is one of the few movies I’ve ordered on iTunes Store. It’s going to be one of those I watch over and over I think (like firefly lol). There were lots of details, small connections and references I missed first time round. This movie also makes me want to save up and buy a nice 4K screen.

Overall I’m happy. It wasn’t a shit sequel and I think it’ll grow on me.&&I think what's gonna have to happen is, trailers will stay spoiler-heavy and movie fans who want to avoid them will have to avoid trailers altogether. I think most movie fans can basically look at the people involved in making a movie and decide whether they want to watch it or not, trailers aren't crucial. 

They may also start a trend of ""no-spoiler"" trailers which, for instance, may do things like only show footage from the first half of the movie, try real hard to not give away plot points, etc. just so movie fans know something of the visual experience a movie offers. Teaser trailers are already pretty close to this.&&Definitely a never-ending debate there. My friend and I were talking about it and couldn't fathom how some people can skip through scenes of a movie, only watch a movie if they know what's gonna happen, stop watching a movie and pick it up days/weeks later, etc...
You cannot avoid those people and they will forever be part of the movie-watching audience. It's definitely something everyone involved with the production has to consider and ultimately decide how they want their film to be experienced. &&I just don't watch the trailers. Very simple.&&I think movie fans might need to relax for a bit, and as I saay this as a heavy one.

Yes, having a bit of the experience slip by you can blow, but shit I can't think of a good movie that was ruined by knowing a sliver of the film. Shit, I knew the ending of Memento before I saw it, and I'd say that banks on not being spoiled more than most.&&Shit, I haven't even seen the first Blade Runner and you could tell that at least with the cinematography from the trailers, it was going to be gorgeous. I'm really hesitant to go into a movie without knowing much about it, especially a nearly 3 hour long one, but I was hyped about this movie from the first trailer.&&The Avengers found a great way to do it, they spolied the first 10 minutes in away that made it clear the feel of the movie without giving away all the jokes or cameos.

After that, all Marvel movies just said 'fuck it, lets show them everything' .&&He's made six good films in a row.

That's pretty damn impressive!&&Imagine if he'd been given Ghost in the Shell to direct&&I can't wait for his take on Dune!&&I'll watch anything that will allow me to admire Ryan Gosling 's face for 3 hours. &&gimme bond 25 &&I typically only go to the movies for lowest common denominator superhero popcorn flicks, but after seeing Arrival last year and 2049 this year, any movie DV directs I'm there opening weekend.&&definitely my favorite director.&&Personally I thought it was one of the best sequels I’ve ever seen.  The general public wouldn’t know a good movie if it jumped up and bit them in the ass.  Generally, I think it’s safe to say that most people have the attention span of a gnat. To that point, most people I know who saw it and didn’t like it said it was simply because it was too long.  For me I couldn’t get enough of the cinematography. I loved it. &&And it has NOTHING to do with the marketing. Anyone who says so is an idiot.

It's a 3 hour art house film.

EDIT: It's a three hour sequel to a cult-classic film from the 80s. Just lookup the reception to the original. Marketing or not this film was NEVER going to turn a profit.&&Went to the cinema, seen it, and at the end credits I stood in silent awe at the work and inspiration it took to create. 

One of the best SciFi movies of the year for me (also a fan of the original) and I'm sad that such a level of dedication and talent is doing bad in the box office.&&It's a sequel to a film that most people under 30 haven't seen, and a lot of people who did see the original thought it was over-hyped, and didn't get what all the fuss was about. At least, everyone I know who has seen it has that opinion. I don't know anyone who thought the original was anything special, beyond the visuals being outstanding.&&Couldn’t agree more. It was stunning. &&[deleted]&&To me, Dunkirk edged it by a hair. &&To all the people thinking the movie bombed : This article is a week old, and the movie is estimated nowadays at 74 Millions Domestically, and nearly at 200 Millions worldwide (Because yes, USA isn't the only country in the world).
http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bladerunnersequel.htm&&I saw the movie this weekend in a small auditorium. About 15 people were there, and behind me were a row of early 20-something dudes that seemed interested in the movie, but chose not to pay for it. How do I know?

I overheard them saying that they bought the tickets on Fandango, and then after getting to the theatre and going in, they went on the app and requested a refund. Got their money back instantly.

I know their $100 or whatever isn't going to help Blade Runner succeed, but it just made me angry.&&Best damn cinematic experience I've had in a long while. I was visiting another world for nearly three hours.&&I loved it too.  I hardly ever actually go to the movies.  I think the last movie I saw in a theater was Rogue One.  I spent the money to see this one in imax, especially since there was the option for just 2D imax.  I was not disappointed.  It was a great movie, and it looked amazing on that giant screen.  &&You know how it has done specifically in Europe?

The two times I saw it there was a pretty decent audience, especially considering it wasn't the opening week, so this whole flop narrative has been a little baffling to me.&&The problem is that the movie studios get about 50-60% of domestic tickets sales and anywhere from 20-40% of foreign ticket sales. So you can cut that number in half. Add to that marketing costs which aren't included in the reported production budget ($150 million) and can easily be about half of what it cost to make the film. 

Figure $225 million overall to make and market it. Then subtract about half of ticket sales, and a movie has to make quite a bit to be considered a box-office success. In addition, certain international markets (cough, cough China) are known for taking eons to actually pay their share back to the studios.

All that being said, I think calling it a ""flop"" is a bit of a stretch. A full-on flop would be more in the vein of bloated films like John Carter. Also, it (BR) was executed well enough that everyone involved in the making of it will be looked at favorably and will go on to do more great work. This definitely falls on the shoulders of the marketing team.&&It probably had a huge marketing budget though. Plus it's not like the studios get 100% of the box office takings. &&Funny thing: I'm watching this movie for the first time now in a cinema in Brazil. The room is totally full.&&The original also flopped a bit when it was showed at the cinema, right?&&In a weird way I'm kinda glad it didn't do fantastically... I mean, if it was a huge box office success the studio may try and push out more lower quality sequels. Like with the last couple of die hards.&&I get the impression that people who didn't grow up with slower, more atmospheric sci-fi will find it very slow. I saw it twice and loved it but both times went with buddies who got bored.

There's plenty of nuance in the movie. It isn't just ""slow""; it's character- and world-driven and expects you to think about why a character might be reacting the way they are. In the age of screamed exposition and constant ""Yeah... that happened"" meta-jokes every time things get too serious, it's harder to get into something like that.&&I am surprised by the fact people are surprised it failed

~~WB~~ Sony and Alcon: here is a $150 million+ near-3 hour long rated R sequel, to a sci-fi cult classic that barely made back its budget back in the 80s, which we marketed in such a way to obfuscate the smallest of plot details, including the basic premise of the film, instead relying on imagery and language that would only remain recognizable to fans of the original.&&I mean it could've used some more action if you wanted the general audience to be interested. But I thought it was perfect the way it is.&&If anything I think it kind of shows that the original film's legacy is more of a dog-whistle than say something like Star Wars, which is an industry in and of itself now.

I loved the movie, but am actually kind of glad it didn't meet expectation right away (the money will eventually be made back anyway, via home video and doubling it up with the original movie like studios will do with DVD's). The way it ended, it didn't make me want more. I felt it ended on the absolute right note and anything else would be doomed to diminishing returns.&&I really liked the movie and was attending a theater almost full for it here in Brazil. One choice of the movie I'm still struggling to understand is its runtime. I don't mind long movies, but there were some minutes in Blade Runner that felt like just added in post-production because it didn't matter to the overall story of the movie imo. &&I loved it but saw it with my fiancee and her family and they all thought it was dead boring. I don't think it's performance is too weird at all, though I hope it will get a boost following its inevitable Oscar attention. &&What don't you agree about the ending?&&How do you not agree? You just didnt like it or?&&You've got me excited. Cant wait to finish the first one&&Shawshank redemption bombed but now it's considered a classic. Not saying this is on the same level but it will find an audience just sad it couldn't in the cinema.&&It's just because it's a marker for what decisions are gonna be made in  the future honestly. The reason it's being discussed is because it may mean fewer chances are taken in the future with artsy visuals in an action movie over etc. Etc.&&Having Harrison Ford in the film is already a big fat spoiler.&&[deleted]&&Exactly. Maybe if the marketing had made it look like a JJ Abrams Star Trek film, you could have put more asses in seats the first weekend. But you'd have had a lot of angry people complaining about being tricked.&&Yep. I would totally buy a 4K copy of this movie. I dream of being a cinematographer and there are certain movies I rewatch over and over because they’re just so beautifully shot. &&I saw it 3 times also. First in an AMC Dolby theater, then IMAX, then back to AMC Dolby. 

And now I think I understand why I was underwhelmed by Mad Max Fury Road. I did not see it in a theater. 

Blade Runner 2049 has made me lose interest in seeing other movies in the theater now because those movies are going to look and sound like garbage to me. &&*and* we have it...so who cares about the box office? It's so much better than having to hope the movie gets greenlit and done correctly. 

The movie was made, it is great, and soon it will be on Bluray.

 We win, regardless of what happens at the box office.&&Arrival had one third the budget.&&I don't know what anyone expected. A 150 million dollar sequel to a movie that flopped when it first came out isn't likely to make money. Especially one that's not very GA friendly. I mean, it's 3 hours long if you include previews. The marketing would have to somehow pretend this was Star Wars or a comic book movie to convince people to see something this long. 

The difference between BR2049 and Arrival is that Arrival cost 47 million and doubled that just domestically. Blade Runner will end up making more than Arrival but it will still be a financial failure, while Arrival was a huge success. &&Bad marketing is one of the things that this sub circlejerks about. &&Did you just ruin it for me &&BR2049 will have cinematography on lock but I don't think they pandered enough for the other awards.

It seems like you need a cultural issue or debilitating disease to even have a chance.&&This article was published eleven days ago, on October 11. Eleven days is roughly one and a half weeks. Villeneuve is offering a thoughtful response to a question about the profitability of his latest film and by default is giving an opinion on the current cultural obsession with box office numbers. That is really what we are talking about. Thanks for asking!&&Saw it two days in a row last week. ;)&&People still talk about Edge of Tomorrow and few people care about Malificent. &&It is a lot of money... but the film also cost a lot of money.&&> That seems like a lot of money for a slow artsy movie.

Better $300 million spent on a slow, artsy movie than $200 million for a miscast, misdirected dumpster fire like Valerian.

But $300 mil is most likely including marketing, which isn’t all that much when talking about massive Hollywood projects. The $200 mil figure for Valerian was just for the production. &&To all the people thinking the movie bombed : This article is a week old, and the movie is estimated nowadays at 74 Millions Domestically, and nearly at 200 Millions worldwide (Because yes, USA isn't the only country in the world).
http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bladerunnersequel.htm&&Yeah, I've watched no movie trailers in 2017 except maybe the ones before movies at the theatre(but those are mostly for blockbusters I dont give a shit about). Ambitious productions don't need to hide spoilers from their trailers because even though it's shitty for movie enthousiasts, it's great for marketing.&&Yep I've already started doing this sometime over the past few years. Trailers have become absolutely ridiculous. A good alternative is to watch only the first 15-30 seconds of a trailer to get the general feel of the movie and then shut it off.

It's funny when friends or family are showing me a trailer and after a few seconds I go ""Looks cool!"" then walk away without watching the rest. Makes it seem like I dont care when in reality it's the complete opposite.&&I will put down a movie and finish it later if it's pretty average, won't return to some. But after 3 hours of blade runner 2049 I wanted more. &&I have quite a few friends who've said to me before something like ""oh I watched half of that film last night, I'm gonna finish it later!"" and I'm so baffled each time...

I'd never stop a film half way through and then watch the other half another day, you just lose all of the pace and immersion and just everything else. Even if I got too tired to finish, I would just rewatch the whole thing. &&They are difficult to avoid if you go to a theatre to watch a movie &&I'd argue that part of my Ex Machina experience was ruined for me by the trailer.

It would be difficult to sell the film to the general audience for what it was, so they went with a sort of robot vs. man thriller vibe. The problem was they included the scene of [Ava tackling Nathan in the hallway, which spoils the main plot point of her trying to escape from her room. So the entire time I'm watching the film I'm not wondering if she will ever get out or not, I'm wondering if this is the moment she in fact escapes.](#spoiler)

I wish I had never seen the trailer for that exact moment it ruined.&&I know lots of people hate spoilers but for me I could know everything that happened in a movie but would still like to watch how it plays out&&Not being spoiled can make a mediocre to decent film really a great first watch.

But a truly great film is better on a 2nd viewing anyway. 

But there is something magical about unexpected twists and turns truly gripping you, it's the movie equivalent of a magic trick.

Once you know how it's done you can appreciate the skill, the dexterity and invention behind it.  
But the wonder is gone.&&One of my favorite movie experiences was - and I can't believe I'm saying this - watching *The Truman Show* on a plane. At the time I lived in France, and the movie hadn't been released there yet, and not even marketed (the lag between U.S. and international releases used to be significant back then). So I went into this movie completely unaware of any premise.

I loved it. I never saw anything coming, and was as puzzled as Truman when that Sirius-labeled lantern crashed into the ground.

Since then I've been careful to read or watch as little as I can for movies I anticipate. It's difficult to ignore the trailers in the theater, but thankfully I watch little live TV so I can forward through the ones I don't want to watch.&&It’s really cool!

Had the seen the first film and b. Were willing to sit through another 3 hours of it. Now a movie can't really expect all of this from its audience as the first movie was released nearly 30+ years ago

I went into the theatre wanting to love the film, just waiting for it to blow me away how most intelligent SciFi does, but it just never did. I made the mistake of not watching the prequel and I think so did a lot of the general public. Beautifully shot tho&&People can have their opinion. &&[deleted]&&I think ‘art house’ is pushing it.

It’s not exactly a mainstream summer blockbuster either, but come on, it’s a sci-fi movie with extremely high production value and famous actors, biggest name in cinema music and most renowned cinematographer, with involvement from Columbia and warner bros pictures.

But yeah probably a lot of people weren’t down for a 3 hour movie, which is a shame. I know in my country at least they charge extra for movies that long.

*Edit:* I’m seeing a lot of people saying they don’t think the length is the problem. Well if the length isn’t the issue, and if it’s not the marketing, then what is it? Curious to hear. Personally I loved the movie and did not think it was too long, but I could see how the mainstream audience might think that.&&Art house would be something more like Mother! or Neon Demon... and I was ready for another hour after the credits started rolling.

It seems like a lot of people are confusing Art House with NOIR.&&That's just not true.  It has everything to do with marketing.  They even avoided putting it in fall film fests which would have given it a lot more buzz.  The marketing was almost non-existant.  They counted on the fact that the original was such a cult classic that people would just show up, and they were wrong.

The movie itself was good and had good reviews.  I presume you watched it, which proves my point.  The fact that it was to ""artsy"" for you didn't mean you didn't actually see the movie.&&so length has everything to do with it? Cause that might be even sadder. &&It totally does. Marketing gets people to watch movies and Blade Runner had no hook in the trailers. The trailers of the movie were catered to movie buffs who are gonna see the movie anyways, not to average folk who need a little more to get into the movie.

To claim that marketing had nothing to do with BR's low gross is hilarious.&&I wouldn’t exactly call it arthouse but yeah, it’s sloooow at points. Mostly due to editing. 

Arrival had a bunch of very leisurely cut “hero” shots of the alien artifact where the pace felt really deserved, because the story actually revolved around this mysterious thing and the aliens inside. But I don’t think BR2049 is *about* how empty Vegas is or how nice Wallace’s offices look.

Everyone keeps saying this but I can’t believe that. The original Blade Runner did terribly at the box office(although the theatrical version is the worst version) and only became a cult classic many years later. How would anyone actively market something like BR 2049 when it’s a sequel to a slow, brooding, sci-fi, film noir? 

I think BR 2049 is one of the best movies of the year and have seen it 3 times already, but it’s not a movie with mass appeal and no amount of marketing would have helped IMO.&&[removed]&&Same thing in France, went to see it yesterday, and had to go to a session later because the one I wanted to go to was already sold out. Although, I can kind of understand it: the director is not French, but ""close enough"", and slow movies are still popular here.

I find it funny that you say that the movie as being popular in Brazil. Most of my friends from Brazil didn't see the original movie, and I think that I only saw it because my father was a ""cinéfilo"".

(I'm only joking about someone from Quebec being close enough to a French ^don't^kill^me^please )&&I went to the the theater last Friday to watch it here in Brazil, too. Had a hard time finding a mall with a subtitled version. Then we went to the 5:20pm session. It was empty. The movie is BEAUTIFUL. Excellent, and really up to my expectations - which were high, as I simoly love the original, the plot, sci-fi, Ryan Gosling and Denis Villeneuve. And I will probably watch it once more in the future just as I did with the original BR. 

However, here in my region it seems mostly no one has even heard about Blade Runner. Here in Minas Gerais it is a cult classic and most theater rooms had only few sessions. Pica-Pau was doing better, lol. 

Have a good one.&&Get off your phone and enjoy the film!&&Goddamn, here in Hong Kong people kept walking out of the movie. Then again, the majority of modern HK produced movies are lame slapstick....&&Yup. Both critically and financially. It was only starting to come back to light and be rediscovered a few years after it was initially released&&Thank god we won't be getting the ""Blade Runner cinematic universe""&&I don't know. I think I'd like another sequel or two that fleshes out the world a bit more. Especially since, at this point, it's an entirely different creature from the novel it was based on.

For instance, there's clearly a (second) revolution forming and we also still don't know what's going on anywhere else in the world. ALthough maybe it's for the best that they don't make any more.&&> I saw it twice and loved it but both times went with buddies who got bored.

Yep. The incessant watch checking of the friend next to me became quite annoying... but I can't really blame him.&&I did grow up with the slower brand and I still found it slow. 

My internal movie timer was expecting the movie to end when a certain important character FIRST shows up. 

That movie just has a looooooong, slow arch. &&We live in the world of superhero action movies now.  Deliberately paced movies just don't draw.&&Disagree.  I've grown up with atmospheric sci-fi, I love it, and yes....I'm an oldster.  

Blade Runner 2049 would have benefited greatly from a more draconian editing.  There were plenty of scenes that felt a bit more like artistic masturbation rather than adding to the film itself.  To avoid spoilers, even one of the key action scenes began feeling like,""sweet mother...get just it over with...END IT!"" rather than communicating the tension of what was happening.  

That said, I enjoyed it and have been recommending it.....but it could have been so much better.

&&[deleted]&&If anything the surprise it failed is basically buying into the Hollywood mindset while trying to reject it. 

Now the mindset of Hollywood is ""fuck middle class films"". Make something for $100 million +, try to make $300+ million and then complain and lament when the movie whose budget you inflated can't necessarily meet your expectations.

That's the reason they are so many derivative blockbusters and bombs; everyone is aiming for huge returns on existing IP. 

The fact that they applied this to Blade Runner, which was never a box office draw and for fans to then buy into the disappointment just shows how far the mentality has spread. &&Fact is that I am ecstatic to see this movie, but I never actually feel like going to the theater. If this movie was available today on streaming service for 20 bucks I would watch it tonight without a doubt. I think people are going to movies less and that is also a factor here. Wasn't this the worst summer ever for movie theatres? Also annoying I need to wait months until I can actually see the movie when it's out of theatres. I don't pity studios that complain about budgets not being recouped since they  refuse to develop new business models to generate revenue.&&Still 1000x more action than the original.&&It's always better to make more money than less in these situations. Look at Fury Road; it would get more attention for Vileneuve, for scifi and maybe get investment in other works.&&Such an about face abrupt cliffhanger end to the comment. &&Look on the bright side, the bombing may have saved us from ""Shawshank Redemption 2""&&I guess that means even more Superhero movies, it's never a bad year to restart a Spiderman franchise, is it.&&Yeah, I think if I hadn't known if he was in it it would have been really exciting to see him show up. &&I'm sure they would have liked to keep it a secret, but it would have been almost impossible to ensure no set photo's came out, or no one saw him around filming locations on weekends or whatever. With plot point spoilers even if they leak you can ignore them and no one can tell if it's fake or real. If you are keeping Harrison Ford a secret and a photo of him on set gets uploaded somewhere, then it's spoiled everyone is gonna know he's in the movie.

Plus I bet they really wanted him for the marketing.&&I can't wait for the film to come out on bluray/DVD so I can watch the extras to see how they filmed the prostitute//house overlap scene.&&> I don't know what anyone expected.

It's a paradox: on the one hand we want to praise them for being bold by giving Villeneuve free reign to make a great sequel, but they did it in the most Hollywood way possible.

* Take existing property and reboot/make sequel.
* Give it a massively expanded budget and box office expectations just on the strength of the name of the IP regardless of whether the IP's appeal can support it (Lone Ranger)
* Market it opaquely so that even if the IP theoretically could support it audiences who don't know it won't be enthused (John Carter)
* Movie doesn't do as well: panic and lament.&&it still hasn't released in China, why isn't anyone talking about this?&&That's my point. You can't make a slow-paced three hour movie and expect to make Avengers cash.&&I tend to not watch trailers of movies I know I want to see. I either get too hyped for it and I am disappointed or they spoil things. I also tend to stay away from blogs or reports on movies for the same issues. &&I watch the teasers only. Those are perfect.

I fully expected the movie to be slow and lull me to sleep in the first hour, but I had prepaid the tickets so I went anyway.

The movie was as slow as I expected. What I didn't expect was how full of plot information and artistic vision every single ""slow"" scene was. I left my seat more awake than I had been in almost a day (and then just crashed an hour later ofcourse).

I went in just expecting a watchable movie, and it ended up blowing me away.&&What killed me is that I can’t sit through 3 hours and not have to pee. Even though I pee’d before viewing.

Wanted more. &&Opposite feeling here—I found myself consciously wondering about the extensively long shots and why things kept lingering on needlessly...&&>I have quite a few friends

Well, la de da.&&Eh sometimes if I stop a movie right before I fall asleep and start first thing in the morning I can kinda jump right back into it. I mean I try to avoid doing that but it doesn't ruin it.&&[deleted]&&I've done it a couple of times, but usually it's because I'm really tired or because the movie just wasn't that great(in which case I might not even come back to it). &&You must lead a life where a three hour stretch of dedication to entertainment is possible.

It's what I've been doing for 5+ years. Socially awkward, sure, but I don't trust the people making trailers for not spoiling my experience.

Edit: Added ""close your eyes"". I mostly close my eyes.&&Honestly I really enjoyed this film knowing absolutely nothing about it. I didn't know that plot point and I'm so glad I didn't. Similarly with Bladerunner 2049, I really ensured I wouldn't know anything about it going in and loved it for that.&&Huh, TIL not watching any Ex Machina trailers was a good decision.&&Fair enough.

I saw it knowing that plot point. For me, it was more about how that was reached and the perspective of the characters at that moment. Given the subject matter, I assumed to an extent that something roundabouts that event would happen.&&I personally think the best trailer to movie interaction is when a trailer shows parts that get cut from the movie but give the impression they gave too much away.  Star Wars: Rogue One and Spiderman Homecoming did that.  

If you ask me, I think Villeneuve should've made more populist trailers for 2049.  He made an incredible movie but the reality is he has to recoup costs in order to keep making more.  It's just what you have to do when your budget's in the $200-300 million range (Supposedly marketting pushed 2049 close to the $300 mark).  Even if 2049 has the soul of an indie movie, it's foundation is no longer an indie artsy film and can't follow the same marketting approach.  &&I saw the trailer right before I decided to watch the movie and I didn't even notice that scene in the slightest. &&""What makes a movie great is not what it is about, but *how* it is about it."" - Roger Ebert&&Likewise, it's why I rewatch movies.&&I wish tarantino would a little bit of this, something cyberpunk or sci-fi&&Enemy has stayed with me in a way few films do.

But it doesn’t really matter because they’re all great, as you said. &&Enemy is one of his best movies IMHO&&Enemy is also a great movie IMO&&He more or less tackled the concept in both forms with BR2049, with its focus on solving a cyborg/replicant crime and dealing with the main character's place with what it means to be human.  &&the new Blade Runner is more like GitS than the new GitS.&&Wait really? That's so strange. Ridley Scott was working on Dune, and it was only because of production problems that he was able to break away and make the first Blade Runner instead. Full circle!&&Particularly a niche film where the desert-dwelling drug addicted jihadists are the good guys. &&You're not wrong, but I'm baffled as to how an adaptation of the best selling sci fi novel of all time can be considered niche. I'm surprised there haven't been more adaptations. Hollywood sucks. &&Hopefully it'll go the route of HBO or a similar mini series, but I doubt someone like Denis would commit an indefinite amount of years to that. &&Because it's Dune and it needs a proper, actually Great version, yes I think it's possible. I'd also imagine there would be private investors quite interested in making it happen so long as it is done right. I personally think Villeneuve's Dune could be better than the Lord of the Rings films.&&> He's one good-looking man

Yah, I used to think that too, until some Redditor commented about his eyes being uneven. Spent the whole 2.75 hrs noticing it ~_~&&I think it's fine for general audiences. My SO hated the original and barely paid attention when we watched it before seeing 2049 and I've been a big fan of it for years but we both were very happy with 2049. 

I think you may have sabotaged yourself by expecting too much. &&[deleted]&&I never saw Blade Runner and this was one of the best sci-fi films I’ve ever seen. Top 10 easily &&I didn't see the original before watching the sequel, and I was completely blown away by the movie. The cinematography was incredible, the fight scenes were tense and believable, and I was on the edge of my seat from the mystery of the plot.

I guess different viewers always have different reactions, just my two cents as a cinemaphile. &&It was a beautiful film with an OK script.  Even here, people are vastly over-selling it, which probably hurts by setting expectations too high.  It was good, but not great, and it demands a lot from a general audience.&&I think movies are really a difficult medium for intelligent sci-fi. First, The budget you need for a good science fiction film almost always requires a dumbing-down of the film's content to appease the masses. Second, most films don't have enough time to do what the original literary genre does: conceptual exploration. 

Television and books (obviously) can overcome both of these obstacles in different ways, hence why there are more examples of high-quality sci-fi works in those mediums vs. film. A good, intelligent science fiction in film is a much bigger ask, and only with exceptional talent can it be pulled off. &&Yeah, you really should have watched the original.  I watched the original a couple of days before watching the new one because it had been a good twenty years since I had seen it last.&&I don't know what I would have made of the film if I wasn't already a big fan of Bladerunner. It didn't feel that long to me, but I did think the sound was off a bit. Why does all the machinery sound like giant fog horns? Did they reuse pacific rim sound effects or something?
Also, you are in for a treat if you haven't watched Bladerunner yet. &&The movie tackles societal racism and inequality, capitalism and trickle down economics, virtual reality and its effects on mankind, genetic alteration...etc.

I was expecting it to be a mishmash of poorly written story and trying to be ""enlightening"" by cramming all these underlying themes into the movie, but they expressed these subtle dilemmas very well throughout the entire movie, with incredibly well written dialogue and beautiful scenes. I think this is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, and I'm a bit sad that others don't see it that way.

This is one of those rare moments where the sequel is immensely better than the original in my opinion.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is just the cherry on top.&&3hr movies also means less showtimes at the theater. &&Agreed but I think it's much closer to the film noir films of the old days and it's paced similarly. &&Add another three hours and make it a series and people would binge watch the whole thing in one night&&I hate the whole it’s a 3 hour movie 
Ok it’s an extra 45 minutes , chill out people &&I think they're using ""Artsy"" to contrast convention, a binary.&&The marketing was everywhere and the trailers were obviously cut to appeal to a broader demographic. Not only that but they created two short films and an anime to promote the film.

The marketing was there.

> The fact that it was to ""artsy"" for you didn't mean you didn't actually see the movie.

Did I ever say it was too artsy for me? I went with my GF however and she absolutely hated it. Some people also left the theater presumably due to boredom. I would definitely classify Blade Runner as artsy maybe it's not an Art House film that was a misnomer. 

&&I enjoyed the film and love the first movie, however, at one point in the film I wondered how much longer it had.  The scenes tended to go long.  But not a bad movie in the least bit.&&Baahahah the trailers were not marketed towards film buffs. They were made to appeal to the largest broadest audience possible.  They were all cut like it was a bombastic action film. &&I think that’s one of the things I loved about BR2049, though. It made you soak these beautiful and, often tragic, environments in. I’m probably not the average viewer, I suppose, but I think the film is remarkable. &&Can’t have a sci-fi without a full electronica soundtrack!&&Harrison Ford does an amazing job of falling right back into the roll, I watched the original  right before leaving to see 2049 and there’s so many subtle little quirks that Ford specifically has with his Deckard character that he brings back for 2049. &&Definitely feels that way. I watched it the week after it released and there were maybe 10 of us in the room. Today I just rewatched it (Sunday morning) and it was at least 80% full this time.&&Oh, that's very much low-balling it. With mainstream blockbusters, the norm is a 2x multiplier for market after the movie wraps. Blade Runner was a little smaller movie, but we all still saw lots of trailers for it, so I'm sure it cost more than the 194m it's gotten back.  
  
  With that said, it'll make a bit more before all is said and done, and usually movies take a few months to come out in Japan which is a decently size market. And it'll make some money back on on-demand and blu-ray sales, and break even or maybe do a little better. That being the case, I don't think this hurts Villeneuve's career at all. Best case is that it generates a lot of Oscar buzz and gets a small re-release in February and makes a decent amount of money.&&I mean, it's just fraud. You can do the same thing with nearly any credit card purchase by issuing a chargeback. Don't expect them to have a Fandango account for very long.&&I would like that! I saw it in an IMAX and the seats were vibrating from the bass of the shuttle-car takeoffs and landings, which was pretty darn neat.&&That's awesome.

Maybe in the end it will turn out to do really well world wide. One can hope...

&&Yeah it seems to have done well here. When I saw it the room was packed out at a 10.30pm showing (late night!).

All the people I know under 35 who've seen it haven't watched the original. They made it so you didn't necessarily need to, but I really loved some of the references they put in there.&&I live in the UK, both times I saw it (on opening night and then a week later) the theatre was full, so I was mighty confused about the box office failure. &&Good to hear it's not just me. 

I saw it on a Friday and a Wednesday and both times it was a not only a solidly sized audience, but people seemed to be real into it as well.

I also went with four people ranging from 12 to 40, so at least my experience was that a wide audience is interested.&&I agree. Not sure what the motivation is behind keeping that out of the public eye.&&It's almost impossible to do that actually, as tax laws for each individual market are so widely different.

As an example, China takes about 75% of the earnings of a foreign movie unless a chinese studio was part of the production.&&Some of that is that it's harder to report, the share varies from theater to theater and based on time.  It's not likely paid back immediately either so it'd take too long to get anything accurate.

I'm a few years past the need to defend what I like to people who don't get it.&&I'm sick of people saying that the public just can't appreciate a 3 hour long movie because this particular 3 hour long movie bored people.

Lengthy, slow-burn atmospheric cinema has never been a mass-market product.&&Dude superhero movies are definitely deliberately paced. Hell long boring movies are the ones you can argue aren't deliberately paced&&Its not fucking Superhero movie's fault. &&Yeah it felt like it needed a theatrical cut.  Which is a shame because it's such a beautifully made movie.  I definitely would not have seen it if I'd known the length.  But it wasn't exhausting like a Pirates of the Caribbean or a Transformers film.  Still, I'll bet a lot of people checked the run time and said ""nope!"".  

Just small cuts in lots of scenes to improve the pacing though.  I don't think a single scene needs to be removed.  &&I loved it *but* that's because I tend to enjoy films which have bits that function almost as atmospheric tone pieces to steep you in the universe. For me many of those slow bits had a function and often that was to create an almost Lovecraftian sort of ""insignificance of man"" feeling against the sheer scale of how awful Earth had become. It's almost like planetary body horror and I think you've got to be on board with the subtext of every one of those scenes (like thinking ""holy shit, actual animals being cultivated"" when you see bees or appreciating the work they put into making some obscure area feel lived-in or dilapidated) to feel the same way.

There are probably compromises that could be made along the way. I'd personally watch a director's cut that was longer, but Villeneuve might have made compromises for people whose favorite part of *Akira* was the cityscapes near the beginning, but who felt like similar shots in 2049 dragged about 33% longer than they needed to.&&hint: add ""funny"" one liners and explosions&&The original is also only 1hr 57m long.&&And the original isn't loved by the general audience.&&hopefully it will get some oscar buzz.

For one, they were all excellent and provided greater depth to the Blade Runner world and context for the movie. But what I loved about them was they set the tone for BR2049 without spoiling the plot.

Instead of multiple 5 minute trailers all giving away key plot points like most films do nowadays, they should have released these shorts like they were trailers so that the general audience could follow the contained plots of each one and hopefully become intrigued to see more, then end each one with a small teaser for BR2049 itself to get people to want to go to the theatre to see the full film of the short they just enjoyed.&&I hate modern film advertising.  I avoided everything about blade runner because I didnt want it ruined. And it wasnt.

Which is only fitting, since GitS had some heavy influence from the first movie.&&In all fairness, the mostly evil galaxy controlling catholic nuns are also drug addicts.&&This is Dune. There aren’t really good guys. There are simply the people the book focuses the most on, and the people who oppose their interests. &&A bunch of kids drop acid on a wormy planet...&&Well where do you think Lucas got his ideas from?&&Note it took almost *four* decades for Dune to sell 12 million copies. I'm sure some of those 12 million copies were purchased by people who had already read it, as well--to supplement a first edition or a signed copy, to gift to their children, and so on. Unfortunately, science fiction as a genre is inherently niche. Bookreading *in general* is niche, for that matter. There are exceptions--Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Agatha Christie for example. But they are exceptions to the rule. And I actually wonder if even Agatha Christie will translate at the box office for Murder on the Orient Express. I suspect it will, but mostly because of the way it's been marketed (as kitschy as the marketing has seemed to me).

Consider even popular fantasy. Game of Thrones' first season had a domestic legal audience of only two million per episode. Now it has roughly 12 million per. TV show adaptations are, of course, different. They can start slow and build their audiences over time if they are well-made. Word of mouth is a lot more effective for serialized material. But films are different. Either you attract people through hype, or you don't and then become a ""cult classic."" And that's truer for sci-fi than any other genre, unfortunately.

I think Blade Runner might have done better if they marketed it to people who weren't fans of the original. If they had provided a bit more information about replicants in the main trailer, I'd assume more people would be curious. The visual of K breaking through a wall just isn't enough when you have so many superhero films where that happens routinely. You need to present a bit more content, because Blade Runner can't be Star Wars, where lightsabers, John Williams and the Millenium Falcon is enough to drum up hype. Cult classics don't drum up hype as well as universally known/seen franchises. I'm not saying they should have spoiled the whole story for 2049, like a lot of trailers do these days. But do more than present some vague parts of the story. ""I did your job once"" doesn't mean shit if people don't know who Deckard is. Instead, provide a little more detail about replicants and suggest what K's job is. You learn that at virtually the beginning of the film anyway.&&It was 2hr44 including nearly 10 mins of credits.

People are being generous with their rounding. It was closer to 2½hrs, not including credits.

I thought it was the right length to tell the story.

If anything, I thought the last half an hour was a bit rushed, and it could have done with another 20 mins so as to balance the pacing a bit.


&&Did you feel like you were missing out on any plot elements from the first, or was the lack of info appropriate to a new viewer? My gf has only seen parts of the original and feels like she missed crucial info, but I disagree. Thoughts?&&This is another thing I love about movies - how polarizing they can be. I had never seen OG Blade Runner, and I didn't watch the trailer for 2049, but had heard great things about both. I watched OG Blade Runner the day before I went and saw 2049 and I thought it was the best sequel I had ever seen. I genuinely thought it was beautiful throughout, stayed true to the original film while having a complete plot all on its own, and was just fucking beautiful. It's also interesting to me to see what is important to people in films. For me, cinematography is one of the most important aspects, whereas other people will care mostly about the writing, or the plot, or the acting. While all of them are important to most of us, I think it's so interesting to see how people weigh each aspect. &&Personally, wasn't really a fan of the original. Saw this and it blew me away.&&I watched a few trailers, thought it looked shit. ""Oh great they're going to milk this one"". Then I saw it getting good reviews. Didn't read those reviews and gave it a shot. I didn't have any expectations, and I loved it! It's one of the few times I've watched a film and not thought about ways it could've been better. It is what it is. It did blow me away a little, but it didn't blow my mind. &&Hans Zimmer score instead of Vangelis. Zimmer did Inception and he loves his horns.&&That’s a great point and something I considered this weekend while I went to see it again. Although, if it was making a ton of money, theaters would have on more screens. &&Does that make a big difference if more than half of the seats are empty?&&[Fewer](https://tribzap2it.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/game-of-thrones-stannis-fewer.gif)&&Sure, but that's hardly arthouse. mother! was arthouse. 2049 is just an intelligent film that expects the audience to meet it halfway. &&It had to be... as a sequel of such a behemoth of a film as BR is,it had to tackle at least some of the same world,issues,performances(otherwise it'd've been lambasted as another shitty name-grabbing sequel), all the while not feeling like a copy of the first...for me it did, with great results from everyone involved...
One of the very few films I was seriously hyped for in recent years (looking at you ""Interstellar "" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"") that truly delivered... I'm more than happy to know that we have Dennis Villeneuve for a while...&&Which is why it'll be viewed (and purchased) regularly for years to come. He made a movie that has longevity, like the original. This one's a keeper, which will bear repeat viewing, and have a following. 

I'm happy it didn't do typical blockbuster box office. That means it's got *substance* that the general movie-going audience doesn't get. 

""Flames that burn twice as bright, burn half as long"", as the man said, just before Batty gouged his eyes out. &&From the comfort of their homes from a streaming subscription they already have.

There’s a big difference.&&Yeah but that’s what people see.&&Nah fuck that, if I'm devoting 3 hours of my day to watching a movie it better be a damn good one. In this case it was a good movie and I don't regret spending that amount of time watching it. If this movie didn't have as good reviews as it has, I would have absolutely not went to it this afternoon, 3 hours is too long of a time to devote to watching a shitty film.&&They really really weren't. They gave nothing away about the plot and didn't hint at any major or spectacular action sequences.

If I didn't know anything about Blade Runner those trailers wouldn't help.


And those  short films and animes only got out to people who were looking for it&&I spent the whole time worrying about whether it was going to end soon, because I didn't want it to. I loved all of it.&&Yeah they were. 

Pretty much zero plot stuff revealed. The most you can get out of the trailers is ""hero is looking for a guy"", when it's the reason behind the search which makes the whole thing interesting. The trailers were filled with material that highlighted aesthetics, which is what film buffs have been crying for when it comes to trailers ""all the visuals, no plot points!""

Those trailers weren't made to appeal to the largest broadest audience possible, because the largest broadest audience possible wants to know what they're walking into.

It makes even less sense to keep the plot under wrap since the essential of the story is pretty much alluded to in the first 10 minutes and it's not something that needs to be kept a secret.&&The trailers were as bland as possible.  don’t think that makes them appealing to broad audiences. 

If you know nothing about Blade Runner, all you really get from the trailer is it’s a movie set in the future, Jared Leto has weird eyes and apparently has people in plastic packages, Gosling is looking for Ford (who seems to be someone of importance, but we don’t know why). Unless you’re drawn in by the setting or aesthetic, the trailer doesn’t provide a hook. &&I hate how antsy modern audiences are. I love the pacing of 70s movies and earlier, where there's enough time to drink in the world, learn about the characters, develop the themes and plot without dashing to the next scene or thrilling camera angle.&&Like the alcoholism?&&I think its caters more to an older audience who'll go when they have time and feel like it rather than, say, YA fanboys who have to see it on opening weekend.&&When I watch American TV when I travel there, I get the impression of a far shorter attention span relative to the rest of the world. I'm sure that plays a role.&&Last time the public got word of how much the VFX staff were making out of a multi million dollar profit movie including an [Oscar for Best Visual Effects](https://gizmodo.com/life-of-pis-vfx-team-explains-whats-wrong-with-the-in-1531864103) it started huge debates and protests.&&In my hometown in Sweden last week it was 80% taken too in the biggest theatre, starting at 9. More than I thought.&&Same in UK. V surprised&&Same here. France, full house. I've actually never seen this cinema so busy before. First time in my life I didn't manage to grab seats in the middle row.&&I've seen it twice, both times mostly filled to capacity. I think part of the problem is the length of the film - it's nearly 3 hours, factor in trailers and advertisements, and cinemas have a limited number of times they can screen the movie each night (on a week night, a single screen won't get more than 2 showings outside of work hours).&&Saw 2 weeks ago at a weird 4pm time in Canada, full house too. &&Canada here: Went opening night and it was packed. Went last night and it was packed. &&Don't forget the crossover with the Blade franchise!

Blade^2 Runner&&They still hawngry, cuh&&You mean, you don't want a blade runner version of terminator salvation???/s&&Yeah, apparently people have have already forgotten that Wolf of Wall Street was a commercial hit despite being even longer than BR 2049. I don't think the public's attention span has dropped off that much in 4 years&&Very true. Schindler's list, Godfather Part two, Return of the King, Wolf of Wall Street, Titanic, all over 3 hours. The pacing was just off, and movie buffs don't give a shit because they value cinematography over plot. I love these deeper, ""indie-er"", movies, but BR just lingered too much for me to love it.&&Agreed. 

I think BladeRunner is 10/10 for characters, acting, vibe, and lots of things, but I think it was pretty poorly laid out storywise. 

That's not saying it's a shitty movie, or that sci-fi is bad, or that 3 hour movies are bad. 

It's just saying that this particular movie isn't perfect in a specific way. For me. 

 Braveheart, Titanic, LTOR were all long ass movies that got the pacing right. It's possible and this movie didn't do it for me in that department. &&I love both of those films, I also love 2049, but I feel that the guy you are responding to is right. For example, Arrival, a film by Villeneuve as well but I feel he did slightly better with exposition in it. In Sicario and Arrival they both have modern society as their  base, for your average movie-goer, that is an easy thing to grasp and build on. Once you start implementing a fully formed sci-fi world like in 2049 while also relying on *some* level of knowledge of the first film it gets a lot harder to stay interested.&&It's all relative. It's the budget you gotta look to. BR comes fat. I am guessing Arrival and BR2049 have the same target audience but their budgets makes one a success and the other a failure. &&Exactly. Everyone's lamenting the death of scifi in cinema cause the sequel to a cult classic (which all too often comes with the label ""also box office flop"") cannot carry a film past the $300 million mark (or whatever it takes to make such a budget profitable) but that's to be utterly expected.

IF anything their complaints are falling into the new Hollywood way of thinking, where a movie shouldn't just be good, a movie cannot just be moderately budgeted and successful, it has to blow the socks off and make hundreds of millions of dollars. 

That's basically the same blockbuster thinking that got us into this mess in the first place, you'd think they'd avoid it.&&Yeah, the original Blade Runner was also a flop.&&You’re not wrong to a degree. I can totally understand people not wanting to sit through a near 3 hour long potentially dark, depressing, serious, slow/boring blockbuster. These are all reasons I can see people not wanting to see the movie. I don’t think anyone is to blame for not wanting to see it. I just don’t think there was a good outcome when they decided the budget would be $150 million. All I can say is all you folks better buy the 4K Blu-ray if you really hope the movie can make its money back.&&At least it'll reduce the runtime&&Eh... I re-watched this movie at one of these heavy-censoring countries after seeing the original cut elsewhere, and you don't really miss much in terms of plot. The only thing that's somewhat unclear is Jared Leto's motivations, because the scene with the woman in the plastic bag is heavily edited, but you can piece those arguments together along the lines. I don't really think censorship could be this movie's downfall in Asia. &&You're right.  No human being would stack books like this.&&***spoilers***&&would you recommend watching the shorts before the movie?&&Fucks sakes.  WHAT SHORTS?  The marketing team really dropped the fucking ball here.  I didn't even know there was a new Blade Runner coming out till a friend of facebook started raving about how good it was.  Total ""Wait what, new blade runner?  in my car an off to the theatre i went.I know when the new THOR is coming out, and new when the new Kingsman came out, etc, etc, it's not I don't keep up.&&I'll be your friend. Can you help me move this weekend? &&Have you been going to the theater near me? 3 out of the last 4 times I've gone to the movies a dude sits down next to me, pushes the recliner all the way back, and is snoring loudly within 20 minutes. Why the fuck is he even at the movies?

Honestly it's starting to make me hate the recliner seats.
&&[deleted]&&True, but even then, some people just don't care about the surprise. It's about the artistry, not the plot points. 

This isn't exactly anything new. Shakespeare tells us in the first lines of the play that Romeo and Juliet are going to kill themselves, and only through this tragedy with their family's feud end. There is something to be said about the experience of being told what will happen, and watching it play out. &&Shouldn't skip Sicario&&[deleted]&&excuse you?! I see you need to meet Gom Jabbar to fix your manners&&You're not selling this to the executives right now&&This seems to summarize the problem imo. I got the impression the film was targeted at fans of the original Blade Runner, and tbh there aren’t enough of those to fund a blockbuster movie. &&OG Blade Runner was divisive as well. It was a flop on release and only turned into a classic after the fact.&&Cinematography ranks high to me because it can make a bad script 100% watchable. You just zone out and get lost in the epic rectangles and eyelines in everything and the colors. Bad acting or directing is harder to hide.&&I also saw the original for the first time the day before 2049. My feelings are very, very similar to yours.

I do think there's a bit of a nostalgia factor for those who saw the original film 30+ years ago and have seen and cherished it since then as well.&&Exact same here

They made us watch the original over and over again at school and being the angsty teen, I never liked it that much

But 2049 is easily in my top 5 movies I've seen, I just loved so much about it, and it all started with it's amazing trailers&&Im with you on that one.  Im a huge fan of the original novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, and the first Blade Runner was so much worse than that, that I could never see it as anything more than a cheap and badly done imitation.  Which isnt to say I didnt enjoy the performances in it.  But this new Blade Runner had some of the most beautiful Photography I've ever seen and I think the performances were incredible.  And I disagree with the comment above that the script was only okay.  It was good in my opinion, it only had some thematic issues.  It was one of those films that wash over you in such an overwhelming way that it requires some time for it to sink in.  At least it did for me&&It does because you have to have as many screens available during prime hours when people are more likely to go to the movies.  If you have a theater with only 7 rooms you can really only provide BR2049 with one and if you have a showing at 5pm or 6pm, all the people going to the movies after work at 7pm or 8pm are a lot more likely to choose one of the other movies that's actually available to watch at that time versus waiting an hour or two for the next BR2049 screening.  That's how most areas are in the U.S., limited theater option.  &&Yes it does.  When we go to the movies we have to arrange it around kid bedtimes and babysitter availability.  We had quite a bit of trouble finding a show time for 2049 that worked.  They were either at around 7:00 which is before kiddo bedtime or after 10:00 which would end late enough that it would be hard to find a babysitter.  &&[deleted]&&Yup, the closest Villeneuve got to arthouse was Enemy and he's moved in the other direction since.&&I mean one of the ways you can tell it wasn't arthouse is, it was for the most part not playing in Art houses.&&Agreed. It delivered on all fronts for me. 

I'm just happy it got made I just don't see how anyone thought this was going to be a huge blockbuster. 

&&I had such high expectations for
2049, as BR is my favorite film, and it exceeded them completely. I saw it a second time and still loved it. &&Doing bad in the box office isn't a badge of quality...

And it's sad because now studios will be reticent to give Dennis Villeneuve more chances with big budgets or big franchises.&& > I'm happy it didn't do typical blockbuster box office. That means it's got substance that the general movie-going audience doesn't get.
""Flames that burn twice as bright, burn half as long"", as the man said, just before Batty gouged his eyes out.

 Some real /r/iamverysmart shit&&Although, even at home I end up binge watching series rather than watching 3 hour movies. Which I'm not happy about&&I seriously look at a longer movie as a bargain.&&> 3 hours is too long of a time to devote to watching a shitty film.

And factor in previews, travel time, etc. &&This. I see a lot of people saying that the trailers were super broad, but maybe they saw trailers I didn't. Every trailer I can think of seeing highlighted the aesthetic and didn't really give the viewer much else.&&He practically has Johnnie Walker^TM on an IV drip!&&Exactly my thoughts. Those of us who saw the original Blade Runner 30 odd years ago now have family and busy lives and not every Friday premiere night free. I’m sure we want to see it, it’s just finding the time. I only made it this past weekend and enjoyed it. I’d like to see it once more in the theatres too, but again, it’s finding time. &&Damn. Just read that article. The VFX team had a huge role in making that movie what it was. Smh&&Saw it a couple days ago in Mexico city. Sold out.&&I just watched it with a swede here in London. This is totally my fault for not confirming her understanding beforehand but she a) didn't like it and b) also asked why it was so different from the original with Wesley Snipes. &&Seems to be doing pretty well everywhere except the US. &&Blade Runner: Covenant 2079&&To be fair Wolf of Wall street followed hijinks, a setting from our past, and a shitload of nudity, not to mention a whole lot of controversy to naturally parade as marketing. People still complained about length though. 

I'm glad BR2049 was as long as it was. It needed the time to draw out the atmosphere and characters, it's part of Denis' voice. It's what I wanted from it. &&Blade Runner 2049 is only 2 hours and 32 minutes without credits... significantly shorter than those movies you mentioned. &&Transformers 4^(I'm sorry) was a hit and 2hr45&&I think you have something there. My parents saw Sicario in theater because it’s Villeneuve (I think they saw Arrival too, not sure) but there is no chance they’re seeing something like BR. It doesn’t have the slightest mass market appeal.&&The final product turned out great but whoever okayed the budget is foolish. An $150 million dollar budget for a sequel to 35 year old noir film that didn't do well at the box office originally is insane. The marketing wasn't great (not because of the lack of spoilers) and frankly it just isn't a movie most people want to see. Arrival showed there is a desire for mid budget psychological sci-fi but tripling the budget for blade runner was a mistake. &&Yes totally, as the name suggests they're not long or time consuming to get through and if you watch them in order you get a great sense of world building before you even begin the actual film.

If you haven't seen the original I'd really recommend that too for the ultimate experience but I'd say if you don't want to watch the 2 hour film, at least watch the shorts.&&Thats what villeneuve recommends, they explain what happens between 2019-2049&&Totally, and I can crash on your couch for a couple weeks right?&&To get away from his wife.&&My girlfriend falls asleep in those chairs about 75% of the time. She always goes to the movies with a sweatshirt and sweat pants and i swear she just has the intention to go take a nap. &&That is terrible, but kind of hilarious. I do this at home, not the theater. &&Every time I see this happening it is an older guy at least 60+.  Just can't keep his eyes open once he pops that recliner.&&Drugs are super useful. They're like stat buffs in video games, if you're not using them you're behind. &&Someone really should remake Dune as a rural/urban meth/heroin/crack war flick.

Our market research tells us giant sandworms are trending!  We have to jump on this right now!

(No, Mr. Weinstein, not *that* kind of ""jump"".  Please get off of the intern.)  &&I did hear that as well! I also watched the final cut from 2007 without the voiceover so my experience was much different than seeing it in theaters when it came out. The main gripe I had with that movie was HOLY SHIT HARRISON FORD CAN YOU BE ANY MORE RAPEY&&That's a great point. To add: longer movies naturally limit how many movies you can play each day. It is a cost-benefit analysis from the business owners perspective, which is profit from concessions sales and ticket sales, i. e., does showing Blade Runner 2049 in another room increase the number of movie-goers. Let's say we allow 45 minutes between movies. Over 14 hours there can be 4 showings per room per day of Blade Runnner 2049. Instead Geostorm can been shown 5 times. Blade Runner 2049 must attract 20% more people per showing for this to make sense financially.&&That's a good thing in my book. Not for the movie but for my viewing of it. I could give a shit whether people came to see it in my bumfuck town, I just got to see a awesome movie with just my family and nobody else. I wish it would have done better, but a great movie with bad box office is better than a bad movie with bad box office or no movie at all&&Love that movie so much and I don’t know why. When I’m kind of feeling restless, it’s late at night and I just need to watch something to distract myself, I put on enemy and can always fall asleep and I mean that in a good way, the movie always pulls me in. I’ve seen it about 8 times now.&&I feel like Polytechnique was *very* arthouse. &&For real. I'm kinda just revelling in the fact that this film got away with itself in the Hollywood climate we have.&&Same. I can't remember the last time I went to see a film twice on my own. I've done that in order to go with other people, but not just because I wanted to see the movie twice two weeks apart. &&Saw it 2 days in a row! :)&&Honestly I think the binge-watching trend has conditioned me to not be afraid of movies with long run times. Once Upon a Time in America was a film I put off watching for a while cause it was so long but really it was just like watching a 4-6 episode miniseries. I think there is something about the psychology of knowing you can watch something in chunks that makes you more likely to start and once you do you keep going. Movies promote the idea you need to watch the whole thing in one sitting. That makes it harder to just get started. &&I look at it as a longer amount of time I have to pray I don't have to pee.&&First week it came out in Australia it was hard to get tickets to. I don’t get why this is a “failure”&&US confirmed lowest-brow&&Not surprising to be honest. The movie is “too long and boring” for US audiences.

Went to watch it twice in the UK. Relatively full house each time. I watched it both times in IMAX 3D and they had regular 3D and 2D showings alongside it.&&Financially it was a mistake, but I'm sure happy we got the movie that we did. It will go down as one of the all time greats in the genre. &&cool, sounds good!

How David Fincher Hijacks Your Eyes,32333,776qa9,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfqD5WqChUY,1260,1508335366.0,,"[deleted]&&I agree that Fincher's style is unique and instantly recognisable but I've never experienced the sensation of seeing things in real life like a Fincher movie.

I will say Mindhunter is worth a watch.
&&Fincher shoots his movies at super high resolutions so he has room to ""move"" the camera in the edit. For example - he shot Gone Girl at 6k, mastered in 5k for VFX and stabilisation then scaled down to 4k. 

The extra pixels means he can reposition or stabilize the camera during shots (like tilting up or down with characters, or adding even more precision to shots that pan left or right following characters).

It also means the camera has a robotic ""omniscience"" to it. You can read more about the technique here: http://postperspective.com/gone-girl-light-iron-david-finchers-path-6k/

A good example would be at 40 seconds into the video. I'm pretty sure that the camera doesn't tilt up but rather is digitally repositioned to follow Daniel Craig's eyes perfectly.&&It seems like such a simple technique to use, but I've never noticed it before.   &&IMO fincher makes the most rewatch able movies&&It's pretty funny that Nerdwriter uploads a video on David Fincher cause I was binging video essays about his work earlier today. For those who wanna check any of them out here's:

- [Every Frame a Painting's 'And the Other Way is Wrong'](https://youtu.be/QPAloq5MCUA)
- [Kaptain Kristian's 'Invisible Details'](https://youtu.be/QChWIFi8fOY)
- [Lessons from the Screenplay's 'Gone Girl - Don't Underestimate the Screenwriter' (more so on Gillian Flynn's writing, but still a good video nonetheless)](https://youtu.be/CF3lFPW4E1o)    &&Really cool but the video is missing an important detail. 

Fincher's camera doesn't just follow characters, he follows their *eyes*.

Imagine a horizontal line drawn across the frame about 1/3rd of the way from the top. The character's eyes are locked to that line in Every. Single. Shot. If their eyes go up, the camera goes up. Their eyes go down, camera goes down. Go back and watch and you'll see what I mean. Notice how in every shot the character's eyes are locked to that upper third line. Just a few wobbles and variations here and there are all that keep it from looking like stabilized video. The effect is eerie, and really draws you into the world.

Now imagine 3 vertical lines cutting the frame into 4 equal columns, left, right and middle. In each shot the camera tracks the character's eyes on one of those 3 vertical lines as well. He usually frames a character on one of those lines and then locks the camera to their movements, keeping them on that line in the frame. Either left, right or center. And the camera moves to keep their eyes on that vertical line. Edward Norton crawling across the couch, the camera keeps his eyes close to the dead center line. In a couple of shots, characters do move from one line to another across the frame. Like Brad Pitt coming down the stairs, his eyes start on the center line and eventually move to the right line and out of the frame. &&When he showed that clip with Keira Knightley where the camera didn't move with her it looked so jarring after that montage, really drove the point home.&&Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this an advantage of filming in higher-than-necessary definition? You can reframe and adjust tracking in a shot while editing without compromising your overall shot's quality (if you've planned for such errors in tracking).&&It's a good analysis, but I don't think I agree with him that this technique makes the moves feel more personal or intimate. I think it comes off as cold because it's so mechanical. It moves with the movements of the actors, not with their emotions. It doesn't pull in close because a character is feeling sad, or look around when they're feeling nervous, or any of the other techniques directors use to show characters' internal states. 

It feel impersonal, like Fincher is removing himself and his viewpoint on the characters from the process.&&I bet this guy started every school paper with “Webster's dictionary defines ___ as....”&&You better stay away from my eyes you bastard. &&As someone who actually does directing for, you know, work, I’m unable to stop myself from snickering at all the comments that call this “obvious” or “the first thing you learn in film school”. Grow up, jr Spielbergs. Yes, tracking is a simple technique. But this particular flavor of tracking, and consistency of it, does indeed seed a style. When most/all shots track hyper-tightly, that creates a possible break, when it changes. It creates a bit of an inverted language. It creates a space. It paints subjectively instead of objectively. Like/hate the technique artistically, this is a superbly observed and reasoned stylistic deconstruction. &&His World War Z sequel is going to be so damn good I just feel it&&This reads like a /r/moviescirclejerk title&&I always thought that it was isolating movement in what he wants you to focus on.  This is similar to watching [stabilized gifs](https://imgur.com/gallery/e8mr65v).  As the background blurs, your eyes focus on what is steady and clear.&&I see a lot of criticism of Nerwriter1's flashy editing and overtly dramatic speech rhythms. I agree a lot of those criticisms have validity, but I see his exaggerated style as consequence of his audience and platform.


He probably wants as much viewership as possible without really sacrificing his integrity, so he makes his videos a bit flashy as to keep the attention of the most distractable viewers. YouTube's platform also prioritizes audience retention (hence, flashy editing and dramatic speech) and video length. So he pads the run time a bit. There are worse sins.&&kaptainkristian did an amazing video on him.&&Damn didn't notice that.&&Fincher also shoots in very high resolution and then frequently reframes and stabilizes, which allows much of the blocking matching that would seem too much to expect from a camera operator.&&Needs more Trent Reznor&&There are a few scenes from Mindhunter where the focus is being pulled between two people talking in a car.  It's done so well. I noticed that the focus changed just as my eyes looked to the other person's reaction. Did this stand out to anyone else?  &&*He uses panning, tracking shots, and tilts.* 

Ok, nerdwriter. *Ok*. &&Amateur question-I have seen David Fincher's Gone girl and the social network as well as house of cards episodes directed by him. I absolutely fell in love with all three of those.

Can someone please recommend me other worthwhile movies to watch? &&Yeah, his style is the same as [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring_%28psychology%29) and he's crazy/clever for doing it- it's known for creating empathetic bonds.

I suspect the impersonal criticism comes from the fact it's entirely passive for the viewer- creating a form of social dissonance by having the nonverbal activity of mirroring combined with no reciprocity- makes people feel invisible, and that feels voyeuristic. &&When I read the title I hoped for a moment that the youtube channel ""everyframeapainting"" was back. &&If you all would prefer someone more substance over style, I suggest [Rob Ager](https://www.youtube.com/user/robag555) and [Collative Learning](https://www.youtube.com/user/robag88) (one guy, two channels). His content is much more substantive, and doesn't really concern itself with editing at all. The man makes great points, but he could bore the Grim Reaper to death.&&Watch any film made by Akira Kurosawa and you can learn great deal regarding panning and tilting.&&That was interesting, astute, and well done.&&This was a really interesting video. Does anyone have any suggestions of different channel or videos to watch about different director techniques like this?&&Whoever made this video - thank you! This has been an eye opener &&From the title I knew it was nerdwriter1&&Fincher's tracking shots always make me jizz my pants. Don't get me started on shots of people walking down long hallways...&&Easily the best Nerdwriter in a while. I feel like he's really taken his critics' thoughts into consideration.&&This comment is going to get lost but I just want to say I really appreciate NerdWriter. Along with many others, I’ve criticized his videos in the past as being simple critiques and of course his tendency to use big words for simple ideas, which gives the impression of trying to come off as smarter. 

But I just want to say those things are gone here. This is a genuinely good analysis and he keeps his dialogue simple. I just want to commend him for listening to his criticism and adapting.&&One of my favorite shots in movies is in Fight Club during Jack's montage about insomnia, when the line ""a copy, of a copy, of a copy"" is spoken, there's just this weird layering effect that perfectly captures how it looks when you haven't slept. I'd love to know how he did this. &&Another YouTuber, ""Every Frame a Painting"" has an analysis of Fincher's positioning and framing entitled ""The Other Way is Wrong"". It's sorry of tangential to this piece and very interesting if you're a visuals dork.&&I can't stand this guy's voice over style&&This was something I noticed back when Fincher was directing music videos in the 90s. His videos are probably the best ever made. &&This was pretty interesting.  I like how he started with such a subtle one, that I'd never pick out (Daniel Craig's tilt), and then expanded to show it all over the place.  By the end the Craig tilt became obvious and I felt I grew a bit as a watcher.   My favorite one was Pitt's Se7en where he almost stands up from his desk twice and the camera follows.  Almost seems silly.&&I love this filmmaking-for-dummies kind of analysis. Great! &&Nerdwriter is such an interesting YouTuber, his video essays are always great&&I tried to run up a tree after I saw matrix at the cinema &&I've now gone a bit down the Fincher rabbit hole and was very surprised to learn that he directed a boatload of music videos. In particular, Only by NiN. Very cool.&&Is it Fincher or his cinematographer? &&This is what really gets me about cinema that I don't think a lot of people who watch movies get. The deliberate movements and intricate cinematography that draws us in visually. &&Having worked on a film set - you'd be surprised how long it takes to set up for long, complicated camera moves. A simple looking shot may have taken hours of prep. Dollies/tracks/steadicams, tracking focus, etc. It's so many moving parts.&&He basically says this in the Panic Room commentary - saying he wants the camera to feel like a presence observing the characters, and not just a camera following them. Nothing too special about it in my opinion. Lots of movies from the golden age with Hitchcock had this same style. But Fincher has the added benefit of new editing techniques, and this precision comes from resolution cropping and tracking, not the movement itself.&&Fantastic director using simple tools brilliantly...and this video did an amazing job of explaining it.&&One of the cooler aspects of David Fincher's career is the music videos he's filmed; including JT's ""Suit and Tie"", Madonna's ""Vogue"", MJ's ""Who Is It?"", and a whole heap of other videos for stars like Paula Abdul, Sting etc. in the 80's.&&I think it's not so much that David Fincher's style of directing changes the way you see the world, but that his style of directing mirrors the way you already see the world.

Just as you would smoothly track someone or something of interest with your eyes across your vision, Fincher tracks the subject of interest with the the movement of the camera.  Since it's so natural for us to track what we focus on, Fincher can influence what you focus on in a scene by simulating what you normally do with your eyes with the camera instead.&&Appropriate seeing that I'm watching ""Mindhunter"" on Netflix right now and can't seem to unglue my eyes from the screen. &&When someone tells you what to watch for... that's super cool. &&Now just imagine a David Fincher long take in a movie or tv series, just let that slowly sink into your mind and eyes how amazing that would be too watch, and then imagine the sheer effort and work that it would also take.&&Wish nerdwriter would have put examples of this from Panic Room.&&This comment section tho... didnt know this sub was so toxic and full of hate. Why?&&Have not come across a bad David fincher movie on recent memory&&Love these video essay YouTube channels. Great content &&/r/moviescirclejerk &&This could have been a 30 second video and done without the click bait title but cool I guess. &&He's overrated in my opinion.&&The way I think about it is that the camera is moving along with brad while he is coming down the stairs. That is why my focus is with him. When it stops, THAT is when I think to look around the rest of the screen to see what the layout is. It is like it tells your subconscious to PAY ATTENTION TO THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE SCREEN. Then when it stops I need a second to catch up. For me that is typically why I like to rewatch movies a few times. I watched the spongebob movie like 10 times and always caught something new. Don't even get me started on the game of thrones series. I'll probably never catch all the subtleties in that show. &&I watched Se7en again the other night. Looks like this is a good excuse for me to watch it again ;)&&blah blah nerdwriter is pretentious and lame but this video legitimately pointed out something about fincher's movies that i always subconsciously liked but didn't realize it specifically until he showed it on screen  

Good video.  

this camera technique makes me feel like I'm in the scene. It reminds me of how i'd watch something in real time. My eyes follow the subject around the space, so the camera does the same. When I'm watching people do something in a room, i'm not 'looking at the room' (a still camera)&&Yea, and after when it switches to Freeman the camera stops once Freeman walks out the door, even though Pitt is still moving.&&Additionally, you don't focus on the person going up the stairs, especially as the camera starts to pan with Freeman. Having a static shot in which Pitt is coming down the stairs, while the other person goes up (or switching between characters during dialog in such a scene) creates a busy frame that cam lead your eyes astray.&&It's funny how I read Se7en and 'seven' but Fant4stic as 'fant four stick'&&It’s funny. That was the clip during which I thought this whole concept broke down. The camera didn’t follow Pitt very well. At the bottom of the stairs, he backed up a bit and the camera didn’t follow (like the clip with Keira Knightly). As he walked out, it followed but not lock-step like with the Gone Girl one early on or many of the others.

Interesting this clip was he best example of this style to your eye and the worst to mine.

Obviously I’m right but that goes without saying.&&[deleted]&&I can't say ""Fincher's style has messed with how I view real life"" because I've never paid any attention to who Fincher is, but I've totally had movies 'keep me in the moment'? after I've finshed watching them.  Sometimes it's little things like weirdly paying attention to how I walk to the kitchen, or bigger moments like holding on to feeling of a movie like Rogue One, or Drive, while I head home from the theater though awful traffic.  Or musicals adding a bit more rhyme to my thoughts :/&&I definitely have. I've noticed myself doing it before, and never really understood how. It's a little surreal.&&Re the Mindhunter thing, isn't Fincher the reason that Netflix started doing all of these data mined shows?&&It's not a movie, but if you want to experience your eyes being hijacked, The Witness (a puzzle game about perception and looking at things in just the right way) is pretty incredible for that imo. To the extent that it has an bonus ending scene that is essentially a short film about a guy who played the game still seems to be seeing the world with game-eyes.&&I watched it over the weekend and it just kind of flew by. It was over before I felt like it really went anywhere.

It was interesting enough, so I hope the next season is a bit more substantial.

&&> I've never experienced the sensation of seeing things in real life like a Fincher movie.

Just a silly hook to get people to watch the video. Clickbait, if you will&&> I will say Mindhunter is worth a watch.

Lot of bad dialogue in the first episode, like 70s made for TV movie bad. Does it get better? Am I missing something?&&Maybe now that it's been pointed out, after watching one of his movies you'll notice it afterwards.  Like when I play GH for x-hours (3) and finally look away the walls are scrolling. &&yeah. a lot of this is simple tracking of their movements. no need to get crazy with takes just to get the perfect synchronized shot. &&ok this is really insightful&&One of the first times I ever noticed this technique was in The Insider (Michael Mann). Near the beginning, the protagonist walks into his boss' office and stands while the boss sits. They briefly talk, and the boss invites him to sit down. As he sits, the frame tilts down with him, revealing another person already seated.

This simple trick immediately elevated the tension and added more expository depth to the situation. &&Some of the best cinematography produces an effect without you noticing. I watched It Comes At Night the other day and only noticed at the end of the movie that in the last 5 minutes, the aspect ratio slowly shrinks (the black bars at the top and bottom) to produce a claustrophobic feeling just as the movie is reaching its climax. It's subtle but interesting.&&Ya, how many times can you rewatch emotionally draining movies like *Zodiac*? A lot, I watch it every time it's on. &&I would agree. Part of the appeal to him as well is he doesn't make feel good type movies. His characters have depths and flaws that challenge your own perception of what you find acceptable in a person or a situation as well. 

I can rewatch his films and always pick up something new and be as invested as I was on viewing #1 as I am on viewing #9.&&I rewatch The Social Network at least once a month &&Yeah I was watching these scenes realizing I need to rewatch these movies lol&&That's definitely true. I've probably rewatched his movies more than any other director (probably why he's one of my fav). When I first saw Fight Club when I was in highschool (honestly, what better movie is there to see when you're a teenage guy) and I proceeded to watch it 6 more times that same week. &&Has it really been a year since the last Every Frame? 

Does anyone know what the dude's up to? Hope he's ok&&I just found Every Frame last week (wtf took me so long) and it's a fucking treasure trove. A bit hesitant on binge watching them since they're now a finite amount but I can't seem to get on w/ how new movie essays are put together how they often (like in the OPs video) cut to themselves to make some tangential point, or just how they're edited w/ quick cuts--it's all really annoying to me and doesn't add to their point at all IMHO and sometimes takes away from it. I stopped watching Crash Course because of their editing techniques. If there's anything out there that is just purely voice-over, similar to EFaP, please please please let me know. &&Interesting that Every Frame doesn't comment on the motion of precise character tracking at all - even though its very clearly in scenes used as examples of the camera not moving!&&If you've never watched it, I highly recommend ""**The Director Series -
 David Fincher**"", a complete retrospective of his career, including short films, music clips & commercials :
https://vimeo.com/139955174

It's 3-hours long *(split in 5 parts)*, but totally worth the watch.

&nbsp;

The same guy also made similar retrospectives for Kubrick, Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson & the Coen brothers.&&You should check out [Jack's Movie Review on The Social Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k8tnxa1vNs).  Another good channel.

He has [a small playlist of Fincher films](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU4hxiWeMBySzP16iTQ4369EgMM5mJcV_), too.&&Kkristian was my first thought too. That's a good essay.&&I love all these channels.. I follow them regularly... Sometimes binge watching their videos. &&Thanks for these links.  Fascinating.&&thank you. it's the first time I've thought while watching nerdwriter 'duuude, you're missing something very important!'.&&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds&&I guess that's why after a few minutes of this you are then wired to associate camera movement with ""something is going to happen"" or either way you get anxious if everything is still. In Fight Club there are plenty of scenes of Norton frozen in front of Pitt and like a ballet Pitt and the camera are moving and advancing the scene. &&I love video essays like this that find just the right clips to illustrate a concept perfectly.&&That works assuming motion blur isn't a huge factor in the shot. &&IIRC Fincher uses this to ensure perfectly symmetrical shots in at least House of Cards. &&It's an advantage for using a wider field of view than is needed as well as higher resolution. It also allows you to zoom in and not have to upscale the image. Movies shot on 4K cameras look better at 2K as well because of the anti-aliasing from super sampling.

https://i.imgur.com/WS3f4ZE.png&&I think you're pretty close. This camera style almost gives a feeling of voyeurism. It follows subjects like your eyes follow people around as you're observing them from afar. He doesn't punch into things like beads of sweat or foot tapping or whatever. Creating a separation from you and the subject.

It's a different feeling. I would say that this style creates more of an empathetic feeling in the audience. You see it from a distance, then put your own life experiences in the character's situation. As opposed to others who try to put you directly into the characters' shoes.&&Makes you realize how a particular style of film-making will work well with particular stories. This is basically all about dramatizing movement in physical space, people striding through rooms, running through woods, or at least someone gesturing in a chair. In contrast, a lot of famous novels have a lot of letter writing, or I think the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo had a lot about historic research about the family company, or about the error the journalist had made earlier in his life, and the ongoing legal case, and it's just difficult to make that work with this style. Especially because in dramatizing movement so much, you might actually play down other elements of the story.&&I see it as a completely unobstructed view. You get to see the characters without any distractions or tricks. I thinking allows an immersion of sorts. &&As EFAP mentioned (and actually backed up with, you know, research and a direct quote from Fincher), Fincher likes to pronounce the ""omniscient"" personality of the camera. I agree, it gives a impeccably calculating presence to the camera which can feel impersonal. In a way, I feel like in how books have narrator styles that give different feels to the story, Fincher perfectly visualizes the third-person, omniscient narrator.&&I don't know, I think I agree with him.

The movements of a character are more obvious to a viewer when the camera tracks them, I suspect because our peripheral vision is actually better at detecting movement than our foveal/central vision (provided by magnocellular cells).

Consider a person walking whilst a camera tracks their face. The only part of the frame lacking motion will be the face, where the viewer's eye is focused, whilst almost every other point of the frame will feature motion, and most of that motion will be in your peripheral vision, giving a stronger sense of that motion.

Now consider an alternative, where the camera is simply fixed on the background and a character moves within the frame. This gives the picture a stronger sense of stillness, preventing the character's behaviour being communicated to a viewer via subtle motion, because they're less detectable. Perhaps debatable but I think he's on to something here.&&Absolutely. It's touched a bit on the Every Frame of Painting analysis, with the clip of Fincher saying that he wants the camera to have an omniscience, that it's kind of just there.&&“Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as 'the fusing of two metals with a hot torch.'

Well you know something? 

I think you guys are two medals. Gold medals.”&&And ended it with a quote from Carl Sagan or somebody like that.&&It feels arrogant. Especially after getting Stuckmannized. &&He would probably respond to that by saying, ""Actually, I use the Oxford dictionary""&&It was like he had a word or page quota he was trying to meet. He took a mildly interesting observation and tortured the living shit out of it for 5 minutes. &&Oh my god, remember when he said “Logan interrogates the contours” of the superhero genre?  He feels the need to vomit a thesaurus with every sentence.&&He's gonna mindfuck you through your eyes&&For real. It's like if someone broke down Steph Curry's jumpshot and all the comments were like ""LOL every player shoots jump shots. It's one of the first things you learn!"" &&I am a professional director too. Thank you for this comment... A huge amount of ""this video is soooo simple and lame"". I got a lot from this video and felt it was presented really well. &&I like to pretend that it will be the first World War Z film, and that there were no others. &&wasn't it cancelled&&Anyone know what's going on with World War Zequel? &&If this doesn't happen I will be incredibly disappointed &&""How Christopher Nolan Holds Your Penis And Makes Sweet Cinematic Love To Your Ass While Tarantino Watches: A Lesson in Storytelling""&&this makes me feel like im in the hammock with her. Definitely more seductive knowing im in the sack with her ;)&&A lot of people are complaining at how basic this analysis is. Thing is, most people (myself included) know fuck all about filmmaking. Videos like these are how I've started learning. &&Yeah, if anything it shows that Nerdwriter really understands the medium. He know that having a good idea isn't enough, you need to go viral to make it in this cluttered space. With flashy presentation, good and clear ideas and an easy to consume runtime, he maximizes the chance that his video will get picked up by media aggregators and go viral.&&In other words, his videos are for laymen and as a layman I appreciate Nerdwriter1's style and effort while still mantaining an articulate language and Integrity as you said. His critics are obviously the high and pompous and I hope they see what Nerdwriter1is trying to do. As a matter of fact, I think he dumbed the language as time goes on. I've been watching his videos for nearly two years now and I still remember the first videos I watched from him and I had a harder time understanding them as opposed to his newer videos. &&Doesn’t everything?&&Yes! I thought it was amazing! I was about halfway through the show when I really started to take notice of it. Such a great effect to add.

That show is so amazing.&&You missed the point of the video where he explains that those shots mimic the *exact* movements of the characters.&&That's really dumbing down the subject of the video.
The video is explaining HOW he uses panning, tracking shots, and tilts, which is fairly unique to his style. &&That's the point, isn't it? That Fincher is meticulous with the fundamentals to create his style. I think that line was intentionally anticlimactic.&&Yeah it's a pretty simple and redundant video although I will note how powerful it is seeing the comparison at 2:43 when you compare Jake Gyllenhaal moving in line with the camera movement vs that other movie. &&I knew it was nerdwriter before I opened the video just from the hyperbolic title. 

Nerdwriter is so self important sometime. &&If you haven't seen Se7en or Fight Club, drop everything you're doing and watch those. 
I would then switch gears a bit and then watch The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Zodiac.

 Then get back to Panic Room, The Game and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, not necessarily in any order for the last three.

But really Fight Club and Se7en are a must see. I personally love all his movies so it may come off as fanboyish but almost no one will disagree about the first two.
&&Literally all of them. 

Alien3 isn’t a good movie due to studio interference but its still an interesting watch. Every other Fincher movie is at least good. Panic Room is Fincher’s idea of a “small” movie and it’s still better than most thrillers. 

Fight Club is IMO one of the most important movies of the 90s. Though I’m biased because it’s also my favorite movie. &&For Fincher movies?

Zodiac is a great one, and Girl with the dragon tattoo is terrific (he directed the English one which sadly only covers the first of a couple books).&&Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Fight Club, Se7en&&Just watch every single one of his films honestly.&&Every Frame a Painting and Now You See it.&&That would be the director, cinematographer would be more concerned with the look and mood of the film.  Lights, camera, lenses, filters etc.&&You mean Mindhunter?&&Fincher's Squarepants adaptation is gutwrenching. Rooney Mara captures Sandy perfectly -- for my money it's head-and-shoulders above the Swedish version.&&Heads up, not so much subtlety in the later seasons, but it's still one of my favorites &&and after re-watching it check out cinemasins video on Seven:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esXh5TxwKYA&&There's a clothing store near where I live called Se7en. It freaks me the fuck out whenever I see women walking around carrying huge brown paper shopping bags with the branding on the side.&&I'm only 4 episodes in, but every time Kemper's talking, I'm drawn into his narrative just like Ford and Tench. While I like almost all of the characters and I think they do a great job, it seems like every scene outside of that interview room I'm just thinking ""You guys are going to have to kick it up a notch if you want to carry this story without Kemper on the screen.""&&He chews up the screen when he is in the scene. SO GOOD!&&Britton is fantastic in the series! I don't know that the series itself is brilliant exactly but it's good and he (and his character of course) are exceptional.

&&Everyone I've showed this series to have all said that Britton's acting is fantastic and I'm inclined to agree. He nails his performance so hard, and to have a titan like Fincher directing really complements him, I think. &&Oh man he did such a GOOD JOB as Kemper. Really gave me the hebe jebes when he first started talking. He enunciated just like the real Kemper in his video interviews and he is probably the reason I maintained enough interest in the show to watch the whole season. &&I’m glad to see Britton getting noted for his exceptional performance.  I read some reviews of the show and was really surprised critics hadn’t mentioned it.  When he first started talking about his mom, I got chills and had to get up and walk away for a bit.  It was so disturbing.  Britton really should be getting more press for his role.  The show is great overall.  &&I think Holden's character and the acting is absolutely amazing. I don't know what it is about Holden that just engrossed me from the start. &&sequence* :P &&How I'm currently feeling about Blade Runner 2049


Edit other movies people have mentioned that also has this effect on them include:

The Road, Arrival, Brazil

And I will add:

The Dark Knight, Closer, Children of Men&&After watching Atomic Blonde I had a similar experience. Any time I would go to my fridge to get water, I would cup my hand on the automatic ice dispenser and sprinkle the ice into the glass like she did after getting out the bathtub. &&Watched the incredibles,  and afterward my movements were incredibly calculated and coordinated. I didn't have to think about what I was doing, but I did some pretty cool shit, like throwing trash into a very small trash can from across the room multiple times. It was weird. &&After my friends and I saw 300 in the theater we all just wanted to get in a fight. We were pumped for a few hours afterward.

Not a lot of movies keep me in a moment like that.
&&Have you seen Fight Club and how did you feel afterwards?&&haha, that holding on to the moment after watching a movie is very real.

i really had to pay way more attention than usual to my driving in order to keep things legal going home after watching mad max fury road. that movie just made me want to tear up the landscape with automotive mayhem.&&Oh, I still remember how fucked up my brain was after watching Punch Drunk Love. It felt like my brain was working at a two times accelerated pace. I remember not being able to do normal things without feeling like things around me were way too slow. :P&&Or speaking in a Scottish accent for a few days after watching trainspotting &&There's a reason Drive and BR2049 are my top two movies of all time.&&With *The Social Network* I definitely sensed this, but more so with the sound. 

*No Country For Old Men* is definitely one film that had this effect on me. Again, with the sound direction. Every little footstep on a wooden floor/ gravel was pronounced- and it added to the intensity. I remember everything seemed different for a day or two.&&Being hyper aware when viewing the shots, I really like the scene from Seven where they came down the stairs. In a lot of his shots you're on a journey with the featured character, so much so that I suspect you could put a dot on the center of their skull and the frame would follow it perfectly. In the shot with the stairs it focuses on Mills coming down putting his jacket on, showing that it's Somerset who is leading. The shot then overextends itself just a tiny bit when Somerset stops suddenly to start lecturing Mills and then centers back, giving us the the same feeling that Mills feels by being stopped short. Then they leave the scene and the door is now framed rather than following the character's path, preparing us for a transition.&&Basically yeah:

>When the program [House of Cards] , a remake of a BBC miniseries, was up for purchase in 2011 with David Fincher and Kevin Spacey attached, the folks at Netflix simply looked at their massive stash of data. Subscribers who watched the original series, they found, were also likely to watch movies directed by David Fincher and enjoy ones that starred Kevin Spacey. Considering the material and the players involved, the company was sure that an audience was out there.

Taken from this article: https://www.fastcodesign.com/1671893/the-secret-sauce-behind-netflixs-hit-house-of-cards-big-data&&The second time I played through the game, I accidentally came across one of the environment puzzles and thought it was a neat idea. Then I realized there were over 130 of them to find.

And the challenge cave.

God that game has so much. What art!&&I've seen a consensus on reddit that the first episode is not as good as the rest and that the show picks up in episode 2&&Yes. &&Definitely keep watching, the dialogue becomes much better as the characters become more fleshed out. &&It gets considerably better. By episode three, you'll be hooked.&&Absolutely. I literally said ""Holy shit, this show sucks"" to my wife, but kept going.  I'm on episode 8 or so now. It's awesome. &&That is so weird to see someone say that. I started watching after the second or third episode (my boyfriend had started binge watching it before I got home from work). Not my thing usually, but I totally got sucked in. From the episodes I saw, I can't imagine the dialogue being that bad, and I didn't get ""70s made for TV movie"" vibe at all. &&Agreed. Can't pin whether it's bad dialogue, or if Groff is just not strong enough of an actor to make it work.&&Gets better and then resorts back to being kinda lame at the end. Terrible final 2-3 episodes. Didn’t really go anywhere in the end as it already seems like they needed extend the story into season 2 rather than have an actual story arc in season 1.  &&1st episode stands way apart from every other episode when I look back on the series.&&I REALLY didn't care for the first episode at all. Awful, clunky dialogue, and the main character couldn't be more uninteresting. It seemed like Fincher was really phoning it in.

Everyone seems to agree it gets better in Ep. 2, but what a terrible way to start a series.&&First episode is bad and poorly paced but it picks up episode 2 and by episode 4 it gets going. Ending isn't that good though.&&This is one of my favorite scenes in the UK Office because it uses a similar technique.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAnIOCIBFR4&&The Russo brothers also do this! I love it. &&The Insider, one of my favorite movies to rewatch. Al Pacino's scenes are great. Al Pacino and Chris Plummer's scenes together are frickin outstanding. They just swagger around like the Butch and Sundance of the whole goddamn airwaves.&&I only really notice it when it's *not* used because the movie feels stiff, where as if it's being used properly I'm sucked into the movie.&&Holy shit that's amazing. Now I really want to see that movie.&&You should post that to /r/moviedetails &&That's actually not quite it.

The ratio changes during his dreams throughout the movie, but then also at the end of the movie.

The point, imo, is **SPOILERS AHEAD**

Is that as he's becoming more and more ill, he's having a harder time deciding what's real and what's a dream.

In the dream sequences it's a sudden change (but sometimes not super obvious, because it's a pretty dark movie). He falls asleep, and then when he wakes up we're in a different viewing ratio. Towards the end as he's sick, it just changes slowly as he gets worse.&&I haven't watched op's vid yet (mobile data...), but, what you say here reminds me of Stalker, from the 70s. It's in black and white, until they enter The Zone, and it changes to colour rather subtlety. Was really cool, made me question whether it wasn't always in colour. &&Sydney Lumets Twelve Angry Men is a perfect example of camera choice for the story. It starts all wide shots from above and transitions to low angle tight shots At then end as the tension increases creating a claustrophobic experience. &&That movie will always have a place in my heart for introducing me to my favorite drink, the aqua velva. &&Even though he is my favorite director, I never got around to watching Zodiac until a few days ago.  Not sure why.

It's now my favorite of his films.&&Alien 3, The Game, and Panic Room are the only Fincher movies I *don't* rewatch regularly. 

Fight Club I must have seen at least once a year since it came out. Zodiac grows on me with every rewatch, what a fantastic film.&&I'm not a big movie guy so I don't pay a lot of attention to directors so I didn't know how much I loved this guy. Holy shit these are some of my favorite movies because they all made me feel fucked up a week after I had watched it.&&Its in my top favourite movies because its so well shot, edited and written. I start watching it just to see some scenes and before I know it the movie is over.&&All logic says it should be the dumbest movie ever and somehow it's one of the best. It was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar that year.&&He’s been working with Criterion and doing video essays for their films. Pretty sure the EFaP project is over now&&He's been doing video essays for criterion&&The guy behind Every Frame is an editor by profession. It's not surprising that he would be better at it than most essayists, who are typically recent film school graduates with little professional experience. Also, if you haven't watched his video on F for Fake yet, he talks a lot about editing in that one.&&I'm similar where I'm sad to have reached the end of EFP videos and now don't know where to go. EFP spoils you; it's like being yelled at to watch other video series now.&&I find Lessons from the Screenplay really enjoyable.  It's not a replacement as he focuses on another aspect of the filmmaking, but he doesn't over edit or make any of the points about himself, and he has some really interesting insights.  Check it out!&&> If there's anything out there that is just purely voice-over, similar to EFaP, please please please let me know.
 
It's a different kind of thing, but I'm a fan of Scout Tafoya's [The Unloved](https://vimeo.com/album/3724818) series, where he makes cases for underrated films - it's just voiceover with shots from the movies. Some of those and other good ones made by Matt Zoller Seitz and others are at the [RogerEbert.com Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/rogerebert). Seitz has an excellent Wes Anderson series.
 
Edit: Seitz did a really good five-part series on Terrence Malick's films in 2011: [Part 1](http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/all-things-shining-pt-1-20110510), [Part 2](http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/all-things-shining-pt-2-20110511), [Part 3](http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/all-things-shining-pt-3-20110513), [Part 4](http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/all-things-shining-pt-4-20110531), [Part 5](http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/all-things-shining-pt-5-20111024). They're early, so not as polished as his more recent Wes Anderson ones.&&Yeah, this bothered me a little. He straight up said Fincher *doesn't* move the camera, even though his examples were shots where it was moving with the character! I'll admit that I would not have noticed the movement if it weren't for the OP, but now that I see it, it's so obviously crucial to his style, and it's pretty crazy that Every Frame missed it.&&I've seen loads of Fincher analysis videos and I've never seen the technique explained quite like this; it's probably the best analysis of his work I've seen. It'll be interesting viewing his work with this in mind.&&Fincher sticks you in the actors' eyes [like this](https://youtu.be/I6t2BV2MQVE?t=40s). &&I know it's been like 17 years since I watched the DVD commentary track of Fight Club, but I remember Brad Pitt talking about how he kept doing unexpected things that the camera man had to keep up with. One was the hallway where he dances unexpectedly.

The 'parking lot fight scene' had him jumping out of frame - the camera guy didn't keep up with him. And Brad talks about that, how he's doing things that weren't expected. It kinda makes sense that this was important to Brad, if it was important to Fincher and *he decided to let those scenes stay in anyway*. He also talked about how in that scene he wasn't expecting to get hit in the ear, so his surprise reaction to that (and ad lib) was genuine. 

So Fincher doesn't always have the reigns so tight that it's 100% choreographed with the actors (which is what *I* would say nerdwriter missed). But I think he allows Pitt a lot of leeway.

Also, I recall that commentary track being particularly fascinating. 10/10 worth a watch.

&&Or parallax, lest it look like pan and scan. &&> This camera style almost gives a feeling of voyeurism.

""People are perverts"" - David Fincher&&That is one of my favorite quotes.  Two great jokes smashed together so efficiently, perfect to Michael's character.&&Such an incredible joke - one of my favorites from the whole series. It's so ridiculous, and yet so in keeping with Michael's character. You can perfectly follow his thought process despite how insane it is.&&God I hope this is original. This is hilarious. &&Bullions and bullions of yurrs ago....&&Yeah I bet this Nerdwriter guy didn't even grow up with black people!&&I'm mindfuckin' you right now&&Peyton Manning throws all these touchdown passes? Well, duh, every peewee football team in America practices those. &&Eh, the movie was alright. Just a waste of the actual book because the movie has nothing to do with the book other than the name. &&No I think delayed. Haven't seen anything about it being cancelled. &&That would suck! Would be awesome to see his style in a post apocalyptic movie. I really liked the cinematography for Children of Men.&&Brad Pitts working out.&&[“How Guillermo Del Toro Goes Down on the Audience”](http://www.aintitcool.com/node/11793)  NSFW&&Excellent comment lmao. I might add “While PTA Cucks You From Another Room”&&> ""How Christopher Nolan Holds Your Penis And Makes Sweet Cinematic Love To Your Ass While Tarantino Licks Your Toes: A Lesson in Storytelling""

FTFY&&Do Kubrick!&&Exactly. 

Anything becomes obvious when you're apart of that thing. Be it film, mathematics, auto repair, things that start out as complicated become menial as you go further into that thing. &&Don't worry it's just a bunch of haters that wish they were making videos like this but find it easier to critique it, and then use the actual advice in their films&&In other words object motivated camera movement. A lot of directors use object motivated camera to show information and express emotion. I can think of a few other directors like Kurosawa or Spielberg or Cuaron who have used this technique constantly in their movies. Kurosawa is the guy who even pioneered it. Recent movies like Fury Road or Hard to be a God(one of the most inventive examples) use this technique to perfection too.

I did learn something kind of new here since I nver noticed any of this in Fincher's movies and only was able to see object motivated camera movement used predominantly in Mindhunter(probably because I haven't seen any of his movies in two years).&&Knowing how cinematography works can really increase the pleasure in watching movies, gives you appreciation for the craft.  Surprising to find the study of cinematography a putdown in a movie subreddit.&&You don't understand though. All these brilliant film-making geniuses/film critics on reddit can easily create award winning films equal (if not *greater than*) David Fincher so that 5 min appreciation video about his work was pointless to them. Just a waste of time that they could've used to create their masterpieces&&Yeah honestly when I first was watching it I thought ""eh, okay yeah sure that's interesting"" but after that comparison the difference is pretty huge. &&>it's a pretty simple and redundant video

Welcome to fucking Nerdwriter! &&I agree.  Fight Club is one of my favorite movies of all time.  

GWDT is something I watch every winter.  Love that movie as well.

Panic Room is definitely his weakest offering (excluding Alien 3), but it's still great IMO.  It gets flak because its compared to his other movies, not movies in general.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the greatest movie that I never want to see again.  I've seen it twice and it ripped my heart out.  Only movie I've ever actually cried during.&&Am I missing the joke here? I feel like I'm missing a joke. &&I'd pay to see this&&Important to note that Cinemasins has a more comedic approach and doesn't really leave you with any new interesting information. Pure entertainment&&Im loving this show at the minute. Kemper is utterly fascinating. He is the Hannibal Lecter of the show. I will say that i think my enjoyment of this show comes from some morbid curiosity. 

And on a side note. Anna Torv is gorgeous. &&I had the same thought and was pleasantly suprised that they kept it going. The character development is top notch. They definitely keep you hooked. &&Kemper's accent is just like my brothers. (who's also similar size and build)  It's pretty creepy for me to hear him talk.&&No spoilers, they will interview more people, and every single one of them is amazing, their interactions and dialogs are very well written, great show &&[deleted]&&Just started watching tonight. Got through 3 episodes and annoyed I have to go to bed.&&just fyi, the expression is chew up the *scenery* and it means overact (in a bad way)&&He seems to be channelling John Goodman. From his hand movement to the way he sits and his speech cadence.

Excellent performance.&&I enjoy it as a contrast to modern Crime shows that use everything this man is pioneering. Everything he does and says is just S.O.P today and its like some backwards world they are working in, I really enjoy that difference. &&I saw it a week ago and I still can't stop thinking about it&&[deleted]&&I walked out of Blade Runner 2049 and had to grab some things from the store on my way home. I found it very, very difficult to separate my mind from the visuals on screen during 2049 and adjust back to reality in the weird, sterile, fluorescent glow of a chain supermarket.&&About to leave to go see it and I'm pretty excited&&I had to go again last night, worth it&&I was on the fence about seeing it in theaters until I read this.

Damn, forgot to change the language on my phone tap keyboard.

I could be having the shittest day ever and that song can still give me a lift.&&I put a dishwashing glove on during sex and it didn't go off well.&&We don't talk about that.&&The book had a much bigger effect on me than the movie even though I saw the movie first.&&The first time I saw Fight Club, it was at a poker night at buddy's house where we all spent the night drinking whiskey and playing cards. Towards the end of the night, we fired up Fight Club and I mostly watched it alone as others passed out/went off to puke and ended the night as the only person awake for the second half of the movie or so.

At work the next day, I told my buddy that I ""feel like a rusty knife"".&&Bringing up The Social Network is a great example of Fincher bringing what could have easily been a boring fucking movie into a gravitating movie. The score also helped. &&That's the part that the video missed. The sound *tracks* with the camera and character. He's, in actors' terms, a blocker and choreographer.

Fincher has a sense for expressing spatial experience. His films should never be in 3D (like 20,000 Leagues) because he's already placed you in the action and dialogue. The reason the films are so visceral (Se7en) are because he also makes objects, sounds and music actors interact with into characters themselves.&&> No Country For Old Men is definitely one film that had this effect on me. Again, with the sound direction. Every little footstep on a wooden floor/ gravel was pronounced- and it added to the intensity.

I agree, the virtual lack of any soundtrack helped tremendously with this.&&Thats because Trent and Atticus' score was incredible&&""Fuck that. I'm not letting a bunch of robots tell me what to - Say... this is pretty damn good!""&&The first episode lays all the groundwork. Its like it wants to get everything out of the way so things feel forced or there is too much exposition. Characters feel like caricatures. But by the end the show off and running. The rest of the series is pretty good. &&That is weird. I can't remember exact dialogue but for example when he's flirting with the girl in the club, all of their lines seemed really obvious and corny to me. And not like in-character corny, but like the writers just don't know what good dialogue sounds like. 

A lot of other commenters here seem to agree if you look at the comments. I'm glad that apparently the show picks up but I couldn't even finish watching the pilot I thought it was so bad. Some of the critics [agree that the first episode is pretty weak](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mindhunter).

The interesting thing is, I couldn't tell if the show was made now or in 1986 or so. It reminded me of craptastic movies and shows from that era. I turned it on not knowing what it was, and then after I turned it off in disgust I had to go look it up and find out it was just made this year. So that made me think maybe it was deliberately bad for some reason.&&That first episode could have definitely used a rewrite before they shot it.&&Disagree I loved the ending. I'm getting ready for work but will update tonight. Basically I think kemper was Holdens 'rock'. &&God that was great. I should probably get around watching that show.&&I don't know why that very last line was so funny.&&""So what's a goblin?""
&&Yes. I really appreciate Pacino's eye movements towards Plummer when he starts questioning the corporate CBS situation. Like a non-verbal communication - Wait, hey Mike, are you with me on this, or what?&&It's a great movie, but it got bad ratings because it marketed itself a little differently from how the movie actually plays out. But I still felt it was amazing. Great acting, great script, great atmosphere.&&Note that it's not a real horror film, more of a suspense film that purposefully leaves a million questions unanswered in the sake of wanting you to put your own ideas into it. I personally hated that, but I still think it was a really decent watch and if you can get over/like that type of slow burn movies with great acting and unanswered questions stuff, then you'll love it. I simply only enjoyed the suspense, the suspense is well crafted. I have mixed feelings on it.  

Note it's nothing like a movie like Enemy, which has a lot of questions that if you paid attention you'd understand. Director purposefully left nearly everything unanswerable. &&Good idea.&&Wow. I didn't notice it during his dreams. I only noticed at the end. Having said that I don't think

he was sick the whole time. Just at the end after the dog came back. They said in the movie that the illness starts showing signs within 24 hours. I think the aspect change is just to subtly create a sense of paranoia.&&You wouldn't be making fun of it if you tried it.&&No lie, his spot by the beach was off the chain. &&Just saw Zodiac the other day and have mixed feelings about it. Can you explain why you liked it so much?  The palpable tension in most scenes? How all characters become slowly obsessed with the case and end up consumed by it? &&I've seen it brought up a few times here now, I guess I should really watch it.  I never took the time to.
&&Oh dude you gotta watch Zodiac&&Panic Room is quite impressive and probably one of my favorites. &&*Alien3* is actually really interesting.  A total mess, but certain scenes are really fantastic and loaded with subtext.  &&Had Fincher done an Alien movie unrestricted by studio meddling today, it probably would turn out to be the best one of all. Certainly the most *interesting*.&&It's such an exhilarating film about something so not exhilarating &&This movie feels like it’s only 30 minutes long  &&On premise yea, but then if you just said there was a movie directed by Fincher and written by Sorkin then no one would doubt it’d be good&&Thanks, that explains it then.

https://www.criterion.com/films/28695-the-breaking-point&&I'm surprised I'm only just now hearing of this! Are these included as special features on new criterion releases? Where could I go to view his new essays?&&Thanks!&&It's not really a case of better or worse. I also prefer Every Frame A Painting, but I wouldn't say that Nerdwriter is an inferior editor, he just tends to excessively stylize his videos and it seems to work with audiences.

Now You See It is a decent film analysis channel making only use of voice-over, btw.&&Whoops, so you reckon I'm asking for perhaps too much? :-x Thanks for the mention, I'm sure I'll get to it soon.&&And you haven't found an adequate replacement? I looked into the website he currently works at and couldn't really find any videos that could tease the monthly subscription out of me. &&Check out [the ones I linked to here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/776qa9/how_david_fincher_hijacks_your_eyes/dojufs7/). Tafoya's and Seitz's are both the opposite of yelling.&&He now works for Critreon but it’s not as good yet. &&Perhaps he meant the camera isn't fluid and therefore not moving, as in its mechanical and stoic even if it's not ""moving"" per se&&He said the camera is not handheld and doesn't shake. &&""Perverts are people"" - Harvey Weinstein&&the awkward silence adds a lot to the effect, i think. and the non-plussed faces of Phyllis, Bob et al.

as with many jokes in The Office, but particularly with this one in front of a large, normally festive crowd.&&Haha I wish it’s from The Office. &&Exactly. Imagine if Fincher directed some of the best stories from the book, like how the Battle of Yonkers would play out in film form. 

World War Z has a lot of potential as a movie if the studio strays away from the typical action blockbuster zombie genre. &&Now I'm sold.&&""Stanley Kubrick shoves his 35 MM lens down your throat while Paul Thomas Anderson, Edgar Wright, and Alfred Hitchcock all play soggy biscuit with a copy of Whiplash on Blu-Ray""&&I literally did not understand what an editor did until a couple years ago. Thanks to super basic videos other people would scoff at, it's added an entire dimension to how I appreciate movies. &&>implying they make films&&I do wish I could make videos like these but that doesn't mean I can't criticize them or that my criticisms are without validity.&&I think the point of the video was that Fincher is much more precise and well choreographed with his object motivated camera movement than most other directors, not necessarily that other directors don't do it. I mean, he even shows a clip from another film that's essentially trying to function the same but isn't as precise, and the effect is noticeably different. 

Look, I totally get that videos like nerdwriter's are often basically teaching 1+1 to people who are well versed in movie-making. The thing is, most people aren't. Until I tried to get more into the technical side of things just a couple years ago, I honestly couldn't tell you what an editor actually does. I only just found out a few months ago the difference between sound editing and sound mixing. If you already know about this stuff, his videos probably aren't for you. &&> object motivated camera movement

did you even watch the video? it's not just object motivated camera movement. the camera is 100% perfectly synced to everything the actor does, going as far as mimicking subtle head movements.&&Right? I've seen so many negative comments. I come to r/movies cause I'm obsessed about film. I've never noticed this about Fincher but it explains so much and is very interesting.

Coming from someone who actively makes music videos and short films, this is incredibly interesting/helpful. &&At the risk of sounding snooty, the comments in /r/movies is like listening to the people behind you at the local multiplex. Predictable and nearly zero depth, which is fine for sharing the trailer to the next Marvel movie. 

EDIT: I promise this isn't intended as a burn on folks that just aren't that into movies. There's obviously nothing wrong with that. But this sub just isn't the place for in depth conversation about film.&&Motherfucker this sub is for [talking about movies, not film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrx2bv_LoG0)!   

/s&&I love cinematography. I loved Stanley Kubrick before I took a semester film class and afterwards I learned to absolutely adore him. We didn't even watch any Kubrick films but armed with a little bit of knowledge about the subject it can honestly make or break a movie for me. It can make a blah or even shitty scene seems great if shot in an interesting and relevant way&&Agreed, he's a very talented editor but his videos suffer from a bad case of style over substance. There tend to be one or two interesting observations or ideas at the core and a lot of verbose fluff layered on top of it.&&I honestly don't get the hate for him. His overly flowery language is a bit annoying at times, and some of his videos definitely lack an overall thesis, but the majority of his work is genuinely insightful and well-researched.

His video on Ghost in the Shell is one of the best video essays I've ever watched. Most of these types of videos rely solely on shallow opinions/observations and basic film knowledge, but that one goes above and beyond by making the connections between the film's production design and Hong Kong's identity crisis after an exhausting history of sporadic power shifts. I don't think I've seen any other video essayers who have the knowledge and dedication to incorporate that amount of rich context to their lessons.

And it's not just the Ghost in the Shell video... I'd say it's the majority of his work. I don't doubt that this video is a bit redundant (I haven't watched it yet), because many of his videos are. But I think people are WAY too hard on him overall.&&Thanks Everyone for this list!! Ill start with Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac, then move on to The Girl with the Dragon tattoo and Panic Room. As for Curious Case of Benjamin Button I'll watch it in the end as I don't want to be crying before I watch all of his other movies! :) &&Only? Really?

Go watch Up. And if that doesn't get you... go watch Grave of the Fireflies.&&He’s talking about The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but saying Spongebob instead. &&He's a bit less cheesy than Hannibal. &&Anna Torv has a large part of my heart all to herself, if she wants it. &&Kemper is the monster who keeps you awake at night. The other people I have seen so far are fractionally as disturbing as Kemper. 

And, yes, the actor nails it. 

Kemper is so disturbing that I do not recommend this series to women without seriously warning them first of how disturbing it might be to them. 

When he described sucking and tightness... I will never forget that scene. Never. &&Your brother or Kemper?&&The bird scene. You know what’s coming but you still say oh oh oh when it happens.&&She’s terrible. I hope she isn’t around as much in season 2.&&TIL&&The Pizza delivery was GOLD. ""You Guys!"" with a big shit eating grin. Could make you forget you were talking to a predator. &&Actually he isnt the guy I would say channels John Goodman. Keep going though and you'll see what I mean :)&&I thought the same thing. Every time he spoke I wanted to say he reminded me of John Goodman. Pretty cool.&&He's channeling the real, actual Ed Kemper. It's an awesome performance, but it's so, sooo creepy...&&Agreed 100%, felt that way each time he was on.  Was talking with someone yesterday about if this came out in a different era, Goodman would be great for the part!&&Yeah, I kept thinking of Goodman's casual every-guy style in Barton Fink.&&I do like it and I'll definitely continue to follow it. It hasn't yet engrossed me completely though and we'll see if it does in the end.

Definitely in the top ten percent of what's on TV but that's pretty faint praise!&&I do wonder how accurate the show is about the FBI and larger law enforcement community resisting his techniques. The FBI prided itself from the very beginning under Hoover as the cutting-edge crime-solving organization. It's hardly a departure from that mentality that the FBI would want to start *predicting* criminal behavior. It's just about the most Hoover-esque thing you can imagine. So much of what drove the FBI was this sense of arrogance held by Jonathan Groff's (Holden) character. But they're portraying the FBI as actively resistant to his methods.&&It's great when movies do this, the closest thing to having forgotten a dream, but the mood still lingers. 

I really got conscious about this after watching The Road completely unprepared. It clicked a lot with various interests I have, like ""what to do in a post apocalyptic setting"" so maybe it was part timing too, but the movie's hopelessness stayed with me for 5 days where I felt kinda broken inside and my mind was still caught in unconsciously in that gloomy world.  

Very few movies do that with me, but I love it when it happens.&&I wish I had the time to go see it again and again. I can't wait until it comes out on disc.&&There is one section of the film that was a cut/swipe from one scene to the next... Fucking blew my mind when it happened. I was thinking *did he just do that.. Wtf!? That was amazing!**

Ya'll know what I'm talking about&&Same!&&to be fair that's like half of all Ryan Gosling movies&&Haha yeah, same here.&&When we left the theater it was dark and pouring rain outside. The reflection of the lights on the road as I drove home made for a really trippy experience. Would recommend. &&Seems like a small thing but I totally get it&&My black box was yelling at me driving home from Baby Driver&&I live near a movie theatre. Everytime a fast and furious movie comes out, there'll be kids peeling out up and down my street on opening day like a bunch of jackasses.&&Good answer.&&I often feel like smashing Jared Leto's face in. &&Reminds me of my freshman year of college. Every time I hear it, I'm back in my dorm room. I can still feel the shitty carpet under my feet and almost sense the light off of the harsh fluorescent bulb from the desk built into the wall.

I first saw Fight Club when I was in the early parts of high school. I didn't FEEL Fight Club till we watched it in college. Nothing special, other than a very slightly greater realization of what the rest of the world was about that you just don't get until you move out of your home. &&Your partner be like, wtf did you just say to me?  Sport fucking?&&Trent Reznor is an incredible composer and writer&&I really enjoyed Robert Ressler's book *Whoever Fights Monsters*, his memoirs of this period at the FBI, the development of the Criminal Behavior section (the second character is based on Ressler), so I have high hopes that the story is going somewhere. I think I'll give it another try. &&Huh, well this comment has convinced me that I don't need to go back and watch the first episode...I'll just leave that happy mistake out of my life. 

Haha. Thanks for the info!&&It seemed like non-stop (terrible) exposition delivered in the most clunky way possible. I'll try episode 2 and see if I like it any more.
&&Right?! I can’t believe how many people are knocking the ending, there’s a lot of nuance to why things are developing the way they are from a narrative standpoint. I love it.

Then again, I saw someone say they didn’t like it because our friend from the prologues wasn’t used as a Hannibal-esque villain. So I guess it’s not for everyone.&&Do it. Nothing but $$&&Definitely better than the US remake. More real, less saccharine&&I agree with you that its a great film and Im pretty sad at how its been received. Going back and watching the trailers though I do feel that maybe they were a little disingenuous.&&Sorry, I didn't mean to imply he was sick the whole time.

I agree, he got sick from the dog (or the kid, or whatever). I just meant that during his sickness (near the end of the movie, when the aspect ratio started to change), the tone started to transition to that of his dreams, matching the aspect ratio.

I personally noticed the aspect changes throughout the movie. The only reason they *do* create paranoia is because they happen during his dreams, which is when the really fucked up stuff happens. So yes - you make that connection early on. Then towards the end as things get worse, one sign things are transitioning into a bad place is the slow change of aspect ratio.&&Such a phenomenal visual gag. Cut to like nine empty aqua velva glasses being hauled away by a waitress &&Yes, and yes. It's perfectly paced and expertly performed. He even managed to get a genuine performance out of Chloe Sevigny.  When does that ever happen?

The movie had me twenty minutes in at the second killing. That scene left me speechless. I had to watch it again just to desensitize myself from it because it was so haunting.  &&The coffee pot shot, one of my favorite single takes in all 30 years of me watching movies. Probably looked better in 2002 than it does now, cause we didn't know that technology existed until that shot.&&Alien 3 isn't even that bad, it has issues but it's a fine movie. 

It was a bit of a let down after Cameron's Aliens, but I liked it.

I just don't feel the need to watch it over and over again every year.&&Probably a combination of the directorial style and Sorkin jam pack of everything he ever writes with dialogue. 

&&That's my favorite thing about it. There isn't an ounce of fat on that film. The tempo of the pacing is so steady and constant, every single frame of that film holds necessary weight. It really is an achievement &&I still re-watch his essays now and then, so well done.&&Running a YouTube channel is hard work, especially if you're trying to make a living from it. Lots of things that can go wrong. With Criterion, he at least has job security. &&One of his videos was posted to Criterion's YT channel. If you're a hankering for some Tony Zhou here ya go.

If EFap feels more natural, it shouldn't be a criticism of other essayists, but a reflection of the level of training and experience. &&As for channels, there are plenty of recommendations floating around in this thread, but for VO only, I like Film Radar, kaptainkristian, and Now You See It. &&He does say that, but he also says ""he never moves the camera if he can help it."" And that's pretty far from true if we use the clips the OP does. Following the movement of a character's head as it moves an inch or so up (the Daniel Craig clip) is far from necessary. 

Making a claim about what his unmoving shots mean is one thing, but using his unmoving shots to make a claim about his entire style is what bugged me, since it shows he missed the character tracking that the OP talked about.&&This video essay came out in 1994 under the alternative title of *Moon*.&&The issue people have with everyone teaching 1+1 to people without much film knowledge is that the people teaching don't know much better either. It becomes very circular. No one makes any progress.&&Nerdwriter hate is pretty popular here at /r/movies.  I can see most of the general criticisms, but there are often bits of his videos that you can still appreciate despite those.  
&&Yep, I get the Nerdwriter pushback, but not for this video. It was short, sweet, and made one interesting point that most people wouldn't catch themselves. Good content in my opinion.&&/r/movies is not a good place for people who actually want to discuss film. Unless it's a Marvel or Star Wars movie. &&I don't think his videos are bad I just think he presents his idea in a very pretentious manner that is quite honestly difficult to watch sometimes.&&[We're trying to talk about a movie here, not a film!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrx2bv_LoG0)&&>which is fine for sharing the trailer to the next Marvel movie.

[This is for all those affected by the above comment.](https://www.drugs.com/otc/119517/Z01376A0f.jpg)&&Ughgh everyone doing their impression of that one dumb line that the “funny guy” of the movie said. 

”[SSSSSMOKIN’!](https://youtu.be/8_dfAi9hiZs)”&&He also makes exceptionally safe videos, I think casting a wide net by not picking a specific topic (like say film) lets him say the safest stuff about everything. Take this video. It's cool but KaptainKristian Every Frame both have already made (better) fincher videos with a combined total of 3.5M views.      &&*And don't forget, the pauses, which he emphasizes to make his points seem... deeper, than they truly are*&&Which is funny, because he accuses Interstellar of being all style and no substance.

He once had a video trying to define a work of classic literature. He began by saying it must be written in a language derived from Latin, or something to that effect. I turned off that video.

Don’t get me wrong, I like him most of the time.&&Because half the time they're not genuinely insightful or well-researched and just seems like the ramblings of a overly-flowery, high-school essay trying to make the page count. The Akira one on light is the worst that I'm aware of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf0WjeE6eyM

He goes over really basic animation techniques then rambles about random connections to ""light"" without either much evidence for his insights or isn't really unique to Akira, at least over other dystopian/futuristic sci-fi genres. Even if he just went over the factual history and uniqueness of Akira's animation production/budget, which was unprecedented for the time, that would be interesting, but it seems he researched none of it. 

He just rambles like some stoned, first-year art-student about random motifs and symbolisms about consumerism and etc. that he thinks he noticed. He doesn't do any due-diligence confirming assumptions with evidence from the movie or insights from the creators, nor does he seem to actually expound upon anything about Akira's animation techniques that were unique -- which is a rich subject on it's own, so it baffles me that in a video essay with such a promising topic, he said nothing directly about Akira's animation process except briefly explaining what cell animation is.&&A lot of people in this thread are saying it's redundant and ""safe"". When it comes to discussion and analysis in fields of art alot people are looking for new depth and insight. So when you get people like Nerdwriter, you'll see alot of people appreciating what he has to say because it's new info to them vs. people who have already gone over what he's doing saying it's old news trying to be profound. I think the latter needs to chill about it. It's not like Nerdwriter is the arbiter of film analysis or something. &&Enh, the GITS video is a little rough. I'll be reciting my issues from memory so please correct me if I'm wrong.

It's split into two halves: first there's the focus on space as it's rendered through a comic language. It's entirely based off of Scott McCloud's work, to the point where it's completely ripped word-for-word from *Understanding Comics*. That whole spiel, ""It's not about getting there, but *being there*?"" That image of Mount Fuji? He didn't write that: McCloud wrote that. He flat out recited what McCloud did (even up to showing the great wave off Kanagawa) word for word. In any rigorous setting that'd be considered plagiarism. It's even more troublesome considering that Oshii has much less experience in manga panelling than his contemporaries, so it's hard to claim that this *is* what's happening. It also implies that comic sequencing is applicable to filmic language, when it's more likely that Oshii's focus on aspect-to-aspect is moreso pillow shots closer to folks like Ozu. Considering that Oshii grew up on cinema, that makes more sense than comics.

The second is a thesis removed from the aspect-to-aspect emphasis. Puschak argues that this emphasis on space is precisely what GITS pedestalizes, that we are bodies extended into a space and that space reveals its own anxieties. The trouble is that this argument is perfectly fine without the former half...so why the emphasis on comic semiosis? The former feels like padding.

Also, the fact that he has *School of Life* in his recommended channels box should be a huge red flag.&&I envy you getting to watch Se7en for the first time.  That movie haunted me for weeks afterwards.  Enjoy!&&Up just has the excellent and sad opening montage and then becomes a tedious kid's movie.&&Yeah.  there are other movies that really choke me up, but nothing compared to CCBB.  Apollo 13 gets me choked up in a proud sort of way.  Saving Private Ryan comes close.  But CCBB had be bawling like a baby.  

It probably didn't help that I was holding my newborn son while watching it towards the end.  Fucking destroyed me.&&He's being Cheeky&&Why?&&But more terrifying because he exists.&&*weird teeth sucking noises*

spooky, buddy&&Me and my girlfriend watched the first few episodes the other night (after a little little smoke which made it all the more horrifying) and I've never seen my girlfriend so disturbed, it's a horrible and brilliant scene. &&Sure made fucking a dead head more appealing /s&&Bro yes. I watched that episode 3 days ago. And I cant stop thinking about it. &&Think it was just after that scene that they are leaving the prison. As they start the car they just stop and look at each other. As much as to say ""Yeah. I'm feeling that weird feeling about the psycho too"".&&Brudos?&&Dammit I can't watch it again until saturday. Too much happening. &&I don't know either way but wouldn't be surprised if they were close to how the show portrayed it. Asking people who are comfortable in their world of ""understanding"" to reevaluate and maybe admit they got it a bit wrong is hard. Asking ""good"" men to admit that what separates them from the animals could be as simple as a good upbringing maybe something people do not want to admit. I think Tenches character starts to feel it and I think it may come up in S2. I think he shares a lot of the up bringing traits that they are finding in the killers and its challenging his view of himself. I could be way off here though. &&The book will Haunt the rest of your life. &&Read. The. Book. 

McCarthy is my all time favorite author, and a legit case can be made for The Road being his best work. Dude is a master, and it's a short read. Doable in a couple sittings, easy.

Read it.&&Damn. This film convo is hitting every beat with me. Rogue One. Drive. Blade Runner 2049. The Road. I will add Arrival to the list. The questions of life and time as a circle rather than a line, and ""if you could see your entire life, would you change it"" still echo for me regularly. That said, I'm going to see Blade Runner 2049 a third time this week as well. (Edit: Also add No Country for Old Men)&&Would you reccomend the road?&&Passengers, surprisingly, has put me in a bit of an existential funk even though it had a [somewhat happy ending](#spoiler) because of the implication. Coherence did the same thing but is more reasonable in that way.&&Roger Deakins is still one of the best cinematographers working today. The shots in 2049 were beyond phenomenal.&&Sparks to city lights?&&Well then you should watch Lars and the Real Girl. He sulks in a knit sweater!&&I had something similar happen when I got to see Blade Runner in theaters a couple years ago. It was the 4K transfer of the film, so even though I was very familiar with the movie, seeing it that big and with that level of detail was like seeing the world again for the first time. When I got outside there was a thick blanket of low clouds that diffused what must have been far off lightning causing silent, bright, even flashes throughout the entire sky and every shadow of the parking lot briefly lit up and then darkened. By the time I got on the road the rain had picked up and the neon lights of the city were glowing on the slick pavement. When I hit the highway the rain was so heavy that the sound of it falling on my car overpowered anything close enough to possibly hear and I could see lightning crawl sideways across the nights sky through the brief moments my wipers kept the windshield clear and immediately thunder clapped through the air, it was one of the few times I've really considered I might be struck by lightning.

10/10, would nearly die after my favorite movie again.&&It's like after you watch Johnny English or Chef and you're in the kitchen and the right song comes on and everything just *flows*.

[Johnny English.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI2SCOIE-Co)

[Chef.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzpVmyzbYLg)

(Maybe a bit less messy than the Johnny English clip though)&&Tyler Durden could have saved us from Suicide Squad. &&And Atticus Ross!&&I'm watching it now and have no idea how they did it.  &&Agreed, but as far as I understand he never financially depended on the youtube channel and always did editing jobs on the side. He can do what he wants, of course - to me, infrequent uploads just seem to be a better solution than abandoning the channel entirely. I mean I still see people talk about it all the time, even though he hasn't uploaded in a year, so there's obviously a high demand.&&This is very much appreciated!

Edit: The clip was great, but too teasingly brief to whet my Every Frame a Painting appetite lol&&I respect your point, I just don't think formal training is all that important in the landscape of online video. Lots of young, self-thought editors on youtube are much better and have a much fresher style than ""industry professionals"".&&I was gonna make a joke about Villeneuve, but I'm too sad that his fans are going to wind up like Nolan's fans. It happened with Rick & Morty and it will happen with Villeneuve. *sigh*&&I like how you said “Nerdwriter hate is pretty popular here” as opposed to “Nerdwriter is pretty unpopular here”. I loved Nerdwriter until this sub implied I’m not supposed to. &&It's funny because this video in particular feels like a response to all that overblown hate and critique. He doesn't overinflate the value of his breakdown, he doesn't use any unnecessarily large words or draw out his video longer than needed, and his analysis is fairly accurate, interesting, and personal.&&It used to not be that way. Four years ago we would have pretty solid discussions on here. Now it's a totally different audience, who start sentences with lower case letters. &&I'm upset that he chose Fincher as a director to do a video essay on when there's so many videos on him already. As someone said above me, it's extremely redundant.

Why can't we have a video essay on Renoir? Fellini? Ozu? 

I hardly ever see anything about those guys and they're considered the masters of cinema.

I really liked when EFAP did a video on Buster Keaton because it's something we haven't seen before, and of course, such an important director/producer/actor.

&&*It's no coincidence, that..emotion..has the word, 'motion,' in it..*  

eyes rolled so far back into my head i could see my own brain stem &&Even Fincher doesn't realize what he is doing!


This seems to be the main knock on him I've seen over time. It's a little heavy handed, but it's still nice to see people putting out content. 
&&Narrator uses narrative device to sell a point. Shocking. &&The pauses kill me, I enjoy the content but cant help growing slightly more irritated with every sentence.&&> It's not like Nerdwriter is the arbiter of film analysis or something.  

This pretty much sums it up. He's just a dude making fun videos. I enjoy listening to what he has to say, even when it's old news or even pretentious, because he's good at presenting and articulating his thoughts and findings.

I am perfectly satisfied with the role he serves in my life: to keep me entertained enough while I wait for guys like Every Frame A Painting to put out something better. &&I second this. Hands down one of the greatest films to experience the first time around.&&Because: 
> Fincher's ~~Squarepants~~ **Girl With The Dragon Tattoo** adaptation is gutwrenching. Rooney Mara captures ~~Sandy~~ **Lisbeth** perfectly -- for my money it's head-and-shoulders above the Swedish version.&&And he speaks exactly like the guy in the tv show. The actor did an incredibly good job in the role. Which makes it worse because he was an incredibly intelligent and large man. He could get away with anything. Only reason he was in jail was because he gave himself up.  

Even better is they literally copied and pasted some of Kemper's dialogue from his interview into thebscene, so it's an exact word for word copy of what it would have been like to be there.&&I also loves how the crazy of Kemper shows itself like a flash then slowly burns off back into normalcy. He's a real human being. That guy is out there. &&It just gets better and better. HNNNGGGG&&ha, good thing I'm stuck at reddit! :/&&Seriously. It's not like I have ptsd, and like it completely changed me, but it's one of the few books that I consistently think back on as if I finished it just last week. It was truly an unforgettable book for me, and I can't recommend it enough to other people. It's funny that one of my favorite books of all time was sort of casually recommended to me by my English teacher, but I'll always be grateful to her for that.&&The Road, dare I say, has almost ruined books for me.

I'm not a narcissist, I'm slightly educated, & am a bit easy to distract so bear with me.

Nothing, *Nooothing*, has invoked the mood & atmosphere ""The Road"" had.  The Road made you feel the cold, the desperation... you felt the hurt, the hunger pains that the man & boy went through.

That scary part?  In the middle? (If you read the book, you know what I'm talking about) You felt the overwhelming sensation they felt to want to *run*, you felt the danger as if it was *your* life to worry about.

It was a book that scared you about the possibility of having to survive on so little & how frustrating, powerless you felt when all you wanted the characters to do is *live*.  It had passages that made you grateful for them when something not horrendous happened.  There was a lot of dread, hopelessness, fear, & mutually shared exhaustion in very few pages.

I've tried reading other books since then (I *think* I read this in 2010-2011?).  They seem bland, colorless, almost one dimensional.  They seemed, to me, to be an afterthought of someones work.  One of those books was Studs Terkel's ""The Good War"" & I found it very insightful, quite informative... but it's an unfair comparison being one is a brilliant work of fiction while the other is a lengthy oral history.

The Road is a book I will always gush over, but I warn people who've never read it before ""You're going to want a loved one you can hug when you're done reading it"".  It's a profound love story, though an unconventional one.&&Is the book as [depressing](#spoiler) as the movie?&&Read that shit so long ago, fuck. It still fucks with me. So well written.&&Whenever I'm trying to grasp ""art"" and what it means to be a great artist as opposed to just a craftsperson or someone being weird and different I think of McCarthy's writing. He's my north star for what great art is.&&I read Blood Meridian a few years ago and can't bring myself to read it again. There's something intimidating and hostile about his worlds. I read the first 50 or so pages of The Road and got the same vibe. He creates a world for the characters within the world they live in, like a bubble in a bubble. So much of the book is the bubble just floating along, barely skimming the edge of the outer bubble but whenever the two collide it always produces anxiety and disgust in me. He's a top notch world crafter and BM took a piece of me away into the world when I put it down. &&I couldn't read the book in just a couple of sitting, and that's not because it was hard to read, or because I didn't like it or anything like that. I actually loved it, and I'm usually a pretty fast reader, but the mood I was in when I first tried reading the book made it so hard to take in more than 10-20 pages at a time. It was probably the heaviest book I've ever read emotionally. I remember I was about 2/3 the way through when I went on vacation, and I finished the book while on the beach in a much better mindset, and I was able to read that whole 1/3 left in one beach day. I'll never forget how I felt after reading the last page. Fucking love it.&&Woah man, I love McCarthy but I just don't see how The Road could even come close to being his best.  Blood Meridian is on a whole other tier.

That said I would be lying if I said I wasn't open for discussion. 

McCarthy will go down as one of, if not the outright best, American authors ever.  He is a living legacy.&&I'd recommend ""Brazil"" by Terry Gilliam, that along with the ones you mentioned was another movie that kinda kept me in that universe/mood for a while. ""They Live"" by John Carpenter to some extent too, it didn't stick with me in the same way as the others where I'd think heavily about them for a week or two, or be in that mood. And then it'd slowly fade (not to an extent that I'd just completely forget it of course).

With ""They Live"" though it was more like I kinda ""forgot"" it, until a few weeks later (and a couple times since then) where I'd be standing in a mall or city looking at all the advertisements and products and for a second or two it kinda feels like you can almost see it [like in the movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JI8AMRbqY6w) (EDIT: It's not a major spoiler but if you really care about that don't watch the clip)&&It inspired the more desolate atmosphere of the game Fallout 3. It was actually required reading for the developers and it shows. If you like the dark realistic post-apocalyptic aspects of Fallout 3, you'll like The Road. &&Yes. If you're a book guy, perhaps read the book first. &&Would you like a feeling of despair and depression for the next week?&&because of the *implication*?
&&Such a good movie.&&Damn I knew I was forgetting something. They are surely a duo to be reckoned with!&&His Patreon has a crazy amount of money per video.    
      
EDIT: $7,708 per video to be exact. That's $92,000 if he put out one a month for a year.&&Likewise. I jumped off the NW bandwagon earlier this year, but this was in my recommendations and I like Fincher. I actually like this analysis he made compared to most of his. It was simple and him imitating the panning to prove the point was nice- to see him interject an experiment and personalize the message.&&Because Fincher is in the public eye right now. People are interested in what he is doing. Fellini is not. 

Videos like this answer the question “I know this guy’s work is good, and I like it, but *why* is it so effective?”

I know it’s incredibly simple, but that’s the best way to introduce a lay audience to a concept they are unfamiliar with. This video isn’t made for film students, it’s for movie buffs who want to understand a little better the craft behind the art they love.&&You might want to check out [Channel Criswell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5kBJmBUVFLYBDiSiK1VDw) for coverage of less popular topics. He even has a video on Ozu, as well as many other relatively unknown filmmakers (to the average filmgoer, anyway).


To be honest, I haven't made up my mind on his content yet, and would like other's opinions. He does suffer from a bit of pretension & style-over-substance from time to time (and he does that low, paused-filled manner of speech that all these video essayists seem to do), though not nearly as much as Nerdwriter1. He has much more substantive videos, in comparison.&&Maybe because it's what he *wants* to write about?

&&Why don't you make a video like that? &&Just reading that in his voice made me cringe&&I've always felt this way about a lot of analysis of text or film. While sometimes you can genuinely see a director doing something for a great and subtle reason, there is always just a case of the director saying it will look good or feel good. 
Analysing text like books at school, especially old stuff, really irritated me because I always felt like it was wrong to assume some guy wanted to portray a particular element of society when he could have just written a sex scene because he felt like it...&&Bless their souls.&&> wait for guys like Every Frame A Painting to put out something better.

The wait is so so so so unbearably painful. It feels like it’s been forever. Tony is the best, but sweet Jebus does the wait kill me. &&No, we get what he/she's saying but is there some underlying joke that makes him choose Spongebob rather than GwtDT. Is the question here. &&It so well done man. I love how Holden is just so fascinated and talks to him in almost the same way he talks to his girlfriend. The whole set up is just so sinister and so innocent on both their behalfs at the same time. &&[deleted]&&The whole ""don't ever have good dreams. That's when you know you've given up hope."" Will alwats stick with me for the better. I never have happier days after I have a nightmare now. &&You should read his other books because the Road is one of his weaker works in my opinion&&Very much so.&&It's bleak&&You. I like you. 

I couldn't have said it better myself. He's elevated multiple genres to previously unthinkable artistic levels. Best westerns ever written? McCarthy. Coming of age tales? Check. Biblical allegory? Killed it. Then he jumps to post apocalyptic fiction and wins a bloody Pulitzer. I don't think anyone saw that coming. 

I could talk about McCarthy for the rest of my days and never slow. Time to reread *Outer Dark.*&&The way he describes even the most mundane situations is so engaging and real that it's almost absurd. It must be a gift, because I just don't get that feeling from any other author. &&Brazil is my second-favorite movie behind Fight Club. I very highly recommend it!&&I am a big fan of They Live simple because it takes it being aliens screwing up the people of earth for everyday people to do anything about it. When it's just rich people, then that is the way it is. When it's aliens, Oh helll nah. And it probably helped inspire a lot of Co-OP scifi shooters. &&I have to check out Brazil then.  

They Live, I saw in the theaters in 1988, haha. It felt fun and gimmicky then but I was a lot younger. Probably worth a view as an older man now. Thanks. &&It was a direct influence on The Last of Us as well.&&Such a good book. Fairly accurate adaption too but it kind of showed not all things translate well to screen.&&You're not going to hurt these passengers, are you? &&They can't say no if they are in deep sleep cryostasis.&&That's pretty goddamn good job security&&Who knows? Maybe the fact that the only thing we watched the whole time including that 'experiment' was the same hypnotic and oddly personal camerawork being described to us, and in fact, combined with Nerdwriter's precise, calm way of speaking, it's a version of the same effect Fincher's films have on us when we watch them in full.

In a way, by demonstrating how Fincher hijacks our eyes, Nerdwriter has hijacked *his* sight.

And doesn't that prove his point?&&So what's Fellini up to these days?

Edit: I mostly know him for the extra half pull in a shot of espresso&&I love Channel Criswell.  His video essays on movies/cinema are the best out there as far as I'm concerned.  I wouldn't call them pretentious.  I feel like that's a word people (not you) throw around these days to disparage anything that someone has put effort into creating and/or takes effort to understand or appreciate.  Channel Criswell takes his material seriously, but I don't get the impression that he takes /himself/ too seriously.  His ""Let's Discuss Horror"" is a good example of a more light-hearted approach in his videos.&&Right? He literally says in the video why he covered Fincher. Some comments in this thread...&&I think the point nerd writer makes about Fincher is kind of legitimate though. Basically, Fincher uses this technique and perfectionist attitude to move the audience with the character, and for us to feel their behavior, but it also has unintended effects on the audience that go beyond his own intention. I can buy that&&The curtains are blue though!!!&&The person just above him said he noticed a lot of details in the Spongebob movie upon rewatching. The joke is that the person implied Spongebob was a Fincher film. &&Yes. The joke is very Fincher-esque in that you follow it until it is no longer funny. &&The joke is that /u/theTipsyYogi was talking about 'serious' shows but also threw in a reference to Spongebob which was rather incongruous.  /u/the_str took that absurdity even farther by talking about how he might feel about a Spongebob movie which had been directed by David Fincher.  Which is an amusing thought experiment.&&Yeah. Do keep in mind that it's written in a very strange way. He doesn't always use proper punctuation, he writes in large walls of text, and he never uses quotation marks for dialogue. All of that, and a little more, makes it a little difficult and uncomfortable to read, but it's a really interesting experience that contributes to the theme and atmosphere. I still recommend it, but I personally couldn't read it for long periods of time.&&In addition to what protosliced said about McCarthy's writing style in general, The Road also lacks any kind of chapter breaks. You get no respite from the story, just like the characters get none from their world. It makes it a powerful read.&&Cormac McCarthy is the author.&&Think I'll leave it off my reading list for a while, then. Thanks for the input.&&I'll wait for a while to read it then. Appreciate the feedback.&&It's definitely a bit gimmicky and it's very clearly an ""*80's movie*"" when you watch it, and that's probably also partly why it didn't stick with me in the same sense.

But parts of it did kinda make me think about it a few times, mostly the scenes like the one I linked.

Of course a ton of other movies have touched on the same kind of subject before and after that one, and it's not like it's made me into one of those ""*everybody is mindless sheep*"" kind of person at all.

But it did change my perspective at least a little bit, and I love movies or shows that can do that, whether it's something like Star Trek:TNG, The Orville, They Live, Fight Club, or any comedy/drama/thriller/animation/whatever it may be.&&Definitely way more so, you can see the level design and scenarios are similar to The Road in Fallout but The Last Of Us is basically ""what if The Road was written to be a videogame"", right down to the juicy, cripplingly depressing storylines &&no, i'm going to *N*urture *D*ependence&&It's pretty good money for the year. It isn't good *security* in any way at all. Continued contributions are not guaranteed.&&If your efforts are recognized. &&Or I'm just stoned.&&Thank you kind strangers for explaining my joke to the confused people.&&Par for the course for Cormac&&It's a book you need to be in the right mental place to absorb too. If your life is a mess or you are having real troubles, it may be best to try this book when you are on better footing. Trust me, it can affect you that much and I'm not one to be given to doing that.&&I’m surprised nobody has made a formatted version yet &&That's fair. If you don't want to be in a funk for a bit afterward, I'd say wait. However, I do recommend reading it whenever you get the chance! I love that book, even if I won't ever read it again.&&",2017-10-18 10:02:46

> A dystopian world where there are no women and all living creatures can hear each others' thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise. 

A world without women would be dystopian enough. Don't even need anything after the word 'and'.&&So fucking excited for this. Read the books a few years back and loved them like hell. I AM THE CIRCLE AND THE CIRCLE IS ME&&She actually looks like his little sister here, they did well making Holland look a little more mature and gritty.&&As a 30 year old man I think it's safe to say the young adult genre was never meant for me. But a movie directed by Doug Liman, produced by Robert Zemeckis, co-written by Charlie Kaufman, and starring Tom Holland, Daisy Ridley, and Mads Mikkelsen? Let me get my wallet.&&Come to think of it, it's been quite a while since I've heard buzz about a young adult dystopian novel adaptation. But Holland and Ridley are two young actors who have carried huge franchises on their shoulders. 

I'd love to see them play out the 2010's YA Dystopian trend in style.&&I had to google Chaos Walking... holy fuck I read these books. Now I'm so hype.

It's going to miss some of the innocence lost of the story.&&Can someone please get that frog outta his mouth? &&Wow I had no idea they were even making this into a film.&&This picture gives me a little hope for Tom Holland as Nathan Drake. Just a little.&&1) go to a far-flung beautiful location.
2) set-up $200,000+ worth of camera equipment.
3) have Ridley and Holland make a stupid face and record it.
4) go home and profit. &&She looks weird as a blonde.&&So awesome seeing the same 5 people in every movie. I assume Chris Pratt and Margot Robbie are in it too?&&I consider myself a bibliophile and thus have read thousands of books. None of them compare to the excitement and storytelling that is in the Chaos Walking trilogy. It's a magnificent story and I'm glad it's finally getting its due.&&For some reason I feel like Daisy's hair color isn't convincing.&&Why does her haircut bother me? Is that a wig? Why does it look like a wig?&&Tom Hollard is so damn fine&&Huh, you know what? I can totally see him as a young Nathan Drake. && Hate this dude’s mouth. &&Blonde is not her color.&&Blonde hair does not suit her. Yikes.&&I'm very interested to see how inventive this will be with the concept of constant telepathy that can't be turned off. The books were amazing with that, but in an actual movie I can imagine it has the potential to be really awesome with the sound design.

A little put off by the age of the actors though. &&Whenever I see Tom Holland's ""serious face"" I feel like someone took his cookie away and he is pouting...for revenge!&&She looks like Kermit the frog with a wig on&&Young Nathan Drake?&&Rey and Spider-Man&&That wig is pretty terrible.&&Fun fact. She's 4 years older than him.&&worst wig ever...&&Why does Daisy Ridley look like Cole Sprouse with a long blonde wig&&I hope that Doug Liman have a success with this movie.&&that wig...&&That blonde hair... yikes&&You know Barry Allen fucked up when Peter Parker and Rey end up together!&&Groan...yet another teen-centric future dystonia novel adaptation being plumbed by Lionsgate, a studio which has already bombarded us with The Hunger Games and Divergent trilogies. We all saw how that turned out.

**Prediction:** The third book in this trilogy ""Monsters of Men"", will be chopped into two movies, because hey, more money to squeeze out of the target demographic. Calling it now.&&Chaos Walking sounds like a new extreme sport&&🐸&&Why does she have 80s housewife hair?&&Look at that young Nathan Drake&&Is it me or does Daisy look like “Helen Hunt” from Team America World Police?

Read it ages ago, it's very good, and different context wise compared to other copy-paste YA series&&I read the trilogy several years ago and remember enjoying it quite a bit. The basic premise is that men live in a world without women and can't help but telepathically broadcast their thoughts. They are Chaos Walking. Then one day a girl is discovered, and her thoughts are silent.&&>Wonder what the story is

Boy lives in a society composed only of men because all the women died. Due to a quirk of their location, the men can all hear each others' thoughts. One day he finds a real live girl, something he thought was impossible.&&Top > leggings&&yeah honestly I only opened the comments to come say how dope her pants are&&Read the trilogy. It's terrific. Some awesome twists.&&Tom Holland is Todd, a boy who lives on an alien planet recently colonized by humans. When the humans arrived there was a war between them and the native aliens, and supposedly all the aliens got wiped out but not before the humans contracted a virus from them which makes them all able to hear each other's thoughts. Between the war and the virus, most of the colonists died, including all of the women. Then, one day, Todd meets a strange girl (Viola/Daisy Ridley) whose thoughts he can't hear...&&Oh God, was this book called The Knife of Never Letting Go? I picked it up on a whim when it first came out and it was just astounding. 

Edit: I'm going to reread them and put of a review in /r/books sometime next week. &&If there's no women then what's Daisy Ridley's role?&&> A dystopian world where there are no women and all living creatures can hear each others' thoughts in a stream of images

Man the thought stream of a perpetually horny planet would be fucking unbearable&&As I read ""A dystopian world where there are no women,"" I thought of Y=The Last Man. Wish they made that graphic novel into a film. &&Poor Daisy Ridley's character.

*Insert hotdogs-flying-at-nostalgia-chicks-face.gif here.*&&This is 100% an adaptation of the book The Knife Of Never Letting Go. A YA novel with the exact same premise. Bizarre read. Did some neat stylistic stuff with the whole ""hearing thoughts"" phenomenon. Surprised it's getting an adaptation. I didn't feel it was particularly special and never finished the series.&&Not for me!

source: i'm gay AF&&So there's no women *and* I have to hear/see other men's thoughts?

No. No, no, no, so much no.&&Well, it's less dystopien than a world with uncontrollable telepathy *and* with women.&&Sounds a lot like children of men. Assuming the girl in the picture is the last living girl.&&WHy are dystopian futures all about fucking women over lately?&&This comment just brought me back to this series, I'd completely forgotten about it. Excited for this movie.&&The spackle will rise again. &&Omg, this comment brought back so many great memories. Loved the series and the difficult relationship between David and Todd&&I AM THE CIRCLE AND THE CIRCLE IS ME&&His body says he's a man, but his face says he's looking forward to finally beginning high school next year.&&That wig is really odd too &&The characters aren't related. It'd make things pretty weird :)&&She's not supposed to be his sister though...&&Black hair, blonde hair. Don't think they are siblings. Ned stark approves my deduction. &&Adults wear fitting clothes, kids don’t, it’s an easy way to make people seem younger or older. &&All of those are good, including some of the other co-writers too, but then there's also the fact that the source material, by Patrick Ness, is great too, at least in my opinion. Even ignoring the YA tag, they're good books.&&Wait, Mads too? TAKE MY MONEY.&&Is the movie still using Kaufman's script though? I really hope they do but aren't there a couple of other writers attached to the movie?

EDIT: Nope, Kaufman's script has been rewritten by the same guy who wrote American Made and I find that quite dissapointing. I actually have no reason to care about the movie anymore.&&Also, it's based on a Patrick Ness book. I haven't read this one, but he writes really quality stuff in the YA genre. 

You should see A Monster Calls, which was another of his books.&&It's also being directed by Doug Liman with a $125 million budget. I'm pretty pumped.&&>But Holland and Ridley are two young actors who have carried huge franchises on their shoulders. 

I just realized I'm older than Daisy. That then led me to the realization that I am of the age now where every new young star is going to be younger than me. Where the fuck did the time go?

Sad realizations aside, this movie sounds fascinating. I'm definitely interested.&&In a world with no women, animals can see thoughts in the form of images called Noise?

What is this about exactly?&&Yeah I didn't know the name of the trilogy, just the individual books. They were my first sci-fi love, so excited!!&&Had the same reaction, didn't remember reading these till I googled it, but I don't really remember any of the story, all I can remember was that I thought they were really great books. &&Can't unsee&&dare you to tweet this to him.&&Well ever since she got that Star Wars money, she's been living the suite life.&&her facial structure reminds me of a monkey at times&&Be funny if it turns out it's her real hair, like Evangeline Lilly in Ant-man. It definitely looks weird on Ridley for now, but considering the background of her character in the books, I can't help but wonder maybe that will work in to the film's narrative.

Edit: and, of course, maybe it will look more natural on film and we'll get used to it.&&The wig itself seems fine, but, *holy crap*, that is a terrible hairstyle for her.&&It'll be hard to watch, knowing what transpires&&Needa poo&&Yeah, but it's pretty hard to get actual 13-14 year-olds to act. That's why things like It and Stranger Things stand out.&&In the book, Todd is 12 but in our time, he is actually sixteen. Viola was 16 too.&&For some reason lately in film and television they have people in their mid 20's trying to play high school aged kids. It's off-putting and a little creepy. For example the Netflix series ""Atypical"" and ""13 Reasons Why."" I really don't get it. ""Stranger Things"" and"" It"" proved that there are actual kid actors who can act. A 23 year old playing a high school sophomore is fooling nobody.&&That's why I'm excited to see Murder on the Orient Express. I really like what she did in TFA, so it'll be nice to see her in a big non-Star Wars role.&&As an audience, we've only seen one of her Star Wars movies so far, yet it's already quite difficult (albeit not impossible), to see her as anything other than Rey. 

She's definitely going to have her work cut out, shaking off Star Wars persona once the full trilogy is released.&&The leggings? You can have them--I want the top.&&Had to scroll so far down to see a nathan drake reference. I actually thought it was a shot of the movie. I can't wait... although movie producers always butcher video game adaptations&&It's probably difficult to get young actors to play the role well though&&I have that same thing man, i reckon it's baby fat in the cheeks, but Tom's thin lips really accentuate them &&For those wondering, ""bibliophile"" is the same as 'pedophile' but instead of kids you love books.&&I'm just worried how they will portray the Noise. In the book, it's described as a cloud of thoughts and pictures and words and the pages are literally just scribbles. I feel like that will be hard to convey through imagery without either

A, being too distracting

B, not faithful at all and only there when they need it.&&Check out other books by Patrick Ness. A Monster Calls was an absolutely beautiful book (and movie!) and The Rest of Us Just Live Here was a really fun take on YA literature.&&She looks like she's going to dance In a Sia video.  &&Seriously? I think she looks about 35 in that costume. &&Are you kidding?&&What 13 year olds so you know? She looks about  at least 25, just short&&You hang out with some old looking 13 year olds.&&To be fair, Yolandi is just Yolandi from real life. Die Antwoord just happened to be in/the movie.

After seeing Chappie, I couldn't shake the feeling that Die Antwoord got their hands on the script and fucked with it. It might have been a great movie without their stank on it.&&You've completely ruined the film for me and there isn't even a trailer yet. &&I hope not. Neither look near 14. &&If Sony ever moves to the Spidey clones, they ought to get Bell for one of those as a consolation prize.&&He would've been great in that role.&&Still waiting for Spider-Man vs Elsa to jump from YouTube to the silver screen&&Maybe because she is Rey from Star Wars with a blonde wig...&&Every Bruce Willis character is the same person.

EDIT: I wasn't criticizing his acting, I'm just saying that they're all canonically the same person.&&Corbin Dallas MultiPass: Origins: Wolverine. &&*Korben&&Looks like John McClane. Dallas had a specific style. &&Negative, I am a meat popsicle. &&I would agree.&&Donald Glover.&&Danny devito&&Multiyipeekiyaypass, bitch&&I'd watch the shit out of that.&&but....she wouldn't be IN a Fifth Element prequel&&I was thinking more of young kill bill&&Spy Young Adults.&&Have you seen the 4th one? Are you sure you want another? Lol&&if that is the case, and i'm sorry to tell you this, you have shit taste in movies.&&Watch the Kingsmen.  It's like a grown up sophisticated Spy Kids movie&&When I saw this picture I immediately knew it was based off a YA book. Not saying all YA books are bad, but the way they are filmed (or at least the way they're portrayed in trailers) are so formulaic you can spot them from a single frame. &&It's by my favourite YA author, it's really unique and interesting. Not sure if it'll make a good film, but I don't have to watch it. &&YA?&&>world without women

>broadcast their thoughts

So basically r/incels The Movie&&Sorry for the hate but that sounds like something a 7th grader came up with. &&It's not only men who involuntarily transmit their thoughts, it's every living creature on the planet. EVERYTHINGA. Except human women. It's a fantastic series, and they've been sitting on this script for years. I am SO excite!&&So, essentially it's a dystopian YA series about how men cannot understand women? &&Holy shit, I just wished for those books to be made into a movie in another thread.  &&It was. If I recall correctly, the trilogy itself was called chaos walking. I'm excited to see what they do with the books, but I am also worried they are just going to fuck it up. If anyone hasn't read the book, I would definitely recommend it.  &&That's one of the books, yes. It's a triology. I think that's the second one?&&I knew the plot sounded familiar! Those books were gripping, but seriously odd and disconcerting at times.&&Yeah it's an amazing trilogy by Patrick Ness. When I finished the second book I emailed him to say how much I loved them and to ask when the final book would be released. I was so excited when he emailed back. He's s really nice guy too (over email at least!)&&Funny thing, in a production class, my roommate pitched Knife of Never Letting Go as a possible adaptation to film and everyone hated the idea because it was anti-feminist with the whole ""no women"" thing which I think misses the point.

Maybe he didn't pitch it very well, but it's funny that it was rejected by the class, but picked up in Hollywood.&&It's only in one secluded village where there's no women, the rest of the world does&&Female version of Y: The Last Man?
&&That's the mystery you'll have to wait to see solved. Unless you read the books right now.&&Great. All the women are gone & *NOW* we can read minds.&&The very first line of the first book is the Main Character's Dog telling him he has to shit. Later in that same chapter, he mentions people with thoughts exactly like you commented about.&&A TV series is coming along supposedly&&YA dystopian sells well, regardless of quality.&&> I didn't feel it was particularly special and never finished the series.

I read two (and skimmed the third) of them on a lark one weekend and I never felt like it got better than its premise. Can't remember many of the details but it was straight misery porn for the main characters, teenagers who the world revolves around.&&I got hooked on this book when I read it in middle school. They could do some really interesting stuff with this film, especially with these two leads. &&So are the main character's adoptive dads. One of the many reasons I love that book...
&&No. There's others but it's hard to explain without lots of spoilers.&&Still thinking I'll name my next dog Manchee. &&His body doesn't even say he's a man lol&&Soooooo SpiderMan? &&Which kind of works for Todd, even though I'm pretty sure he's even younger than that in the first book.&&It's one of my favorite series ever. I listened to the audiobooks not knowing what it was really about and imo that's the way to do it. &&I love Patrick Ness. A Monster Calls is one of my all time favorite books, and The Rest of Us Just Live Here was really good.&&Honestly, of the three actors he's the one I'm most excited to see. Anytime he's on screen I'm happy.&&Considering how many writers are listed on it, I assume we won't really know who deserves the final credit until it comes out. Michael Arndt wrote the Hunger Games movies and he didn't even get a credit on any of them. At least I assume he wrote them since he was the only writer in the making-of docs on the blu-rays.&&Hollywood is screwing Kaufman.&&What's Charlie working on? :(&&~~Jason Bourne~~, Edge of Tomorrow, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and ~~The Bourne Ultimatum~~ were also directed by him with similar or larger budgets. That level of budget doesn't really seem unusual for him.

Edit x2: The __listed__ Bourne Films were EP'd by him, not directed.&&From what I remember, a kid grows up in this colonial era style town. There are no women, only men. 

Everyone can hear each other's thoughts. So some pages in the books are literally just scribbles of thoughts.

The main kid is the youngest in the town. Everyone else remembers what it was like when there was women there. He has to run away for some reason and find a girl similar age to him.&&In the books at least, its on an alien planet after Earth dies and is abandoned. During the settling on the planet all the women die and this leads to 'noise' where everyone can see/hear each others thoughts. Most animals just make miscellaneous noises but the main character has a dog who follows him around. Hard to say much more without spoiling the plot

Will be interesting to see how they transfer the 'noise' from the book to the film without it either being annoying and interrupting the film while still showing how it fucks up all the characters &&So humans left Earth right? They ruined it. The first shipment of humans landed on this planet and began to colonize it. It turns out once they got here they could read all the men's thoughts (only the men). It was weird. They fought this war with the natives that weren't very smart.

So this main character is the young lad of this one town where they killed all the women. But they dont talk about it. There's this one guy who is like religious leader who practices controlling the ""Noise"" that is the stream of thoughts.  He's crazy.

This girl is on another spaceship that is headed to this planet as a scouting mission or whatever to see whats been going on since the first shipment. Her ship crashes and her family dies. This main character feels an absence in the ""noise"" where the girl is because girls dont have the noise or whatever. So he finds her and hides her and they go on some adventures?

Oh and they eventually go to like a capital city where the aliens are enslaved but nice and part of the family. There's an uprising and they start to mistreat the aliens and keep them in concentration camps. Somehow the religious nutjob becomes the BBEG and the main character and his girlfriend fight him with the noise. *shrg*.&&I think it’s cute. &&She looks kinda doofy haha.&&Fuck I already cried during the books, I will not survive this movie probably if he is in the movies (and if he isn't, WTF were you thinking writers?)&&Poo, Todd. Poo. &&Oh I agree! But I wondered if we're meant to suspend reality and believe they're young teenagers/ same age as trilogy or if they're now portrayed as being a little older (16-18 maybe). &&Ohhh ok! Makes casting slightly more reasonable (like a tiny amount). &&And it's good to see her getting into other roles while she is doing Star Wars too. So audiences won't just know her as Rey. Same for Boyega with being in Pacific Rim.&&But more importantly it's difficult to get young actors that have name recognition to sell tickets with.&&Kids are mostly reusable though, you can only love a book so many times before you have to replace it&&am 32. checks out.&&Yeah, she looks like a single mom that made a bad choice when she was 16, but now the result of this choice is all grown up and makes big bucks playing Spider-man.&&From the promotional materials, I assumed it would be a Blomkamp movie with an amusing cameo from Die Antwoord in it. Instead, we got Die Antwoord The Movie, directed by Blomkamp. I was more okay with this than it seems most people are.&&I actually really like their characters in the movie. Chappie is one of my favorite sci fi movies ever and that's largely to do with their characters. They feel like gangsters but definitely not the hard asses that belong there which is great and gives their characters layers.

Edit: characters not chargers&&I think his character in the first book is around 13 but Tom will never pass for that &&Holy shit Jamie Bell as Ben Reilly is perfect&&Clone saga movie. Three different aged spideys. Played by Holland, Garfield, and Maguire. Sony, mail me my check&&Really? I find his acting jarring and anti-immersive.

I take that back. That was just F4 in general. He was great in Snowpiercier!&&I think that was the joke?&&Which is actually little sad since he definitely can act. Not just be a beaten dirty hero in an undershirt.&&Watch Death Becomes Her for something different.&&He's a power fantasy. Regular guy, a little down on his luck, who also happens to be *really good* at killing people. &&I like the one where he plays a cop.&&Shit bruh you serious? &&Maybe with his [mad hatter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLJCMzBiqh0) insanity?&&I 5th element...I mean, John McClaine. &&Aaand I have to watch it today. Thank you! &&Same. Now I really want that.

Also I bet there's a good chance of it happening since blade runner is getting a follow up. If that does well, I bet this will be on the radar. &&Daisy Ridley is 25, and even though Holland is only 21 I reckon you may as well just roll with SPY ADULTS&&I forget that exists. &&Or the third one?&&I have truly seen the error of my ways and I'll say 100 Hail Nolan's for my sins. &&Next you’re going to try telling us The Emperor’s New Groove isn’t one of the best original animated movies in decades. &&The original has a [93% on Rotten Tomatoes.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spy_kids)&&Dude Spy Kids gave us Machette. I am sorry to tell you that you are mr. Poopyhead.&&Spy Kids are an amazing series of cheesy, goofy, mostly self-aware humor that is perfect for young kids. Maybe *you* have shit taste in movies.&&¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯&&Because they're about desperate, dystopian worlds which somehow still have LSD saturation levels everywhere? &&it's because you have two attractive young adults, standing together, closer than friends, looking at something in awe, while dressed rugged and older than they are. 

As if they're about to go on an adventure together, totally not as a couple, and the guy is going to grab her hand and say ""cmon! let's check it out!"" and the girl is going to say ""wait, are you crazy?!""&&You are right about YA books, but this particular series stands out as one of the better dystopian YA series.  Highly recommend it.&&Yupp. This looks virtually identical to Peter and katniss, or that divergent chick and her boyfriend. &&Young adult.&&Yeah, that's gonna be a no for me dawg...&&""Chaos Walkers"" would've been a cooler term than ""incels"" tbh&&No worries. It's a YA series, so the plot does sound a little simple, I understand. But they end up getting a lot deeper than that summary sounds. It's worth checking out, at least.&&The series won a shit ton of awards. Author wrote A Monster Calls as well, which I found to be quite beautifully written. I've not read this series myself, but one of my friends swears by it and thinks it's about as good as YA gets. Interested in picking it up at some point for sure, they've assembled a hell of a cast for the movie anyways. &&Yea it's honestly one of the most affecting and thematically rich series of YA books I've read.  It came out around when Hunger Games was popular and handled similar themes with waaaay more nuance and depth.&&Not really a fair assessment. There are reasons behind the weird setting. There's a lot of moral ambiguity through out the whole thing, analysis of war and genocide. It was really quite mature as stories go and the YA tag doesn't do it justice.&&It's written by a pretty awesome author in Patrick Ness (also the author of A Monster Calls) and it's probably the best YA series I've read

Mads Mikkelsen as the Mayor is a great bit of casting as well&&That is amusingly some of the theme, but it's also how women can be capable of not understanding and accepting men as well, even when they're broadcasting their thoughts.&&if the first movie in a trilogy is named after the trilogy, don't expect fantastic stuff&&The Knife of Never Letting Go is the first one, followed by The Ask and the Answer, then Monsters of Men.&&No, that's the first one. &&Yes, really eerie and unsettling. The use of typography and fonts is brilliant.&&So... it's The Village, but women instead of technology. &&Correct, though we should probably be careful with the spoilers.&&Speaking of which, Tom Holland would be perfect as Yorick&&Or read some of the comments in this thread, I guess.&&Even when the women were around, their minds couldn't be read for some reason (Censored actual reasons due to spoilers)&&so basically a movie about /r/Incels &&Not at all true. Identifying your book as ""dystopian"" is a death knell these days. No agent or publisher will touch it. The dystopian craze peaked around 2012-2014. If I sold a book tomorrow, it would debut in 2019 at the earliest. Readers have long since moved past the Divergents of the book world. But the publishing industry is a circle. It will be back eventually.&&...not recently&&I imagine most people in that type of society would be. &&The heartbreak still feels so real, and I read those books when they came out years ago...&&[deleted]&&He's 21 lmao&&Show us yours, big man&&pfft, those pythons are way sicker than anything i saw in my high school outside of a few ridiculous football jocks.&&I'm sure yours does.

Lol.&&Michael Ardnt wrote the screenplay for only Catching Fire and was credited but he used a different name; Michael deBruyn. 

Also for Chaos Walking a lot of the recent articles say screenplay by Gary Spinelli and then put all the other writers after and so does IMDB.
&&Nothing I think at the moment. Poor dude's movies and TV shows aren't getting funded because no one in the industry cares about him. I seriously hate what is happening to people like him. &&Hmmm... wasn’t Jumper a high-concept, young adult action movie he made for a similar budget? And wasn’t it - terrible? Fun fact, that movie also starred young actors one of which was just coming off a Star Wars movie.&&He did direct the first Bourne movie though, the Bourne Identity&&He directed Bourne 1 though. Just saw American Made that he directed to. &&To bang. He wants to bang.&&He runs away due to him not wanting to complete a ""ritual"" to become a man. That's also when he comes across Viola and they try and reach a capital city that he was informed about from his adoptive Uncle.&&My first thought on it was that she looked super good with the hair. Glad someone else digs it&&And Boyega in Detroit! I think he might have more acting chops than Daisy.&&Well after a while they stop being kids.&&He's 15 in Spider-Man so same thing.&&I think Tom Holland would be better casting&&I've been saying that for years.&&I must confess when it was announced Spidey would be in the MCU, I half expected that they would have Maguire turn up and act like he'd never been away.&&Shattered Dimensions movie with all the actors instead. I'll take the staff job, double the money.&&Unfortunately I don't think Sony is too high on Garfield considering they fired him for not showing up to a corporate meet and greet. &&Like the late, talented, Anton Yelchin, Jamie Bell makes any movie better which him just being in it. &&He is really good in that Revolutionary War show on AMC. I forget the name off the top of my head, but I highly recommend it.&&Watch defiance. 

Edit: I just want to promote that movie. His role is actually a really subtle one comparitively. Great movie though.&&But he's *so goddamn good* at that.&&I really like Willis when he drops the action hero schtick. He actually makes a pretty great villain. His role in ""The Jackal"" was chilling, he really brought out the character of an assassin who just loves his job. &&That way out of normal for him at the time which is funny.  I feel that movie created the average joe hero. &&He is paid far more for the being the beaten dirty hero in an undershirt though. Same with Adam Sandler - he has done enough seriously good acting work that we know Punch Drunk Love wasn't a fluke, but he can earn the big bucks by phoning in another dumb comedy so why shouldn't he?

Edit: See also - Liam Neeson. Truly great actor, but in the last few years has only done dumb action movies because they keep throwing more and more cash at him. &&His role in Looper was pretty good. Defenitely a bit different to his usual good boy roles.&&Wifebeater: Undershirt Adventure 4&&Or Hudson hawk for something really different&&The original schlub action hero&&Except in Fifth Element they make a point of saying he was an ex-soldier.  Down on his luck, sure, but not a coincidence he was good at killing people.&&He will always be known as the Mad Hatter to me.

Been watching him since his Derrick Comedy days when I was in high school and it blew my mind when he was literally everywhere overnight after he started writing for SNL lol&&25 isn't young anymore?

Average Rating: 2.6/5&&This one's actually very good and very different. Think pieces of THE HANDMAID'S TALE mixed with even more scifi and action elements.&&I think it's the silly-young ages of the actors and their ridiculous hairstyles. They look like they just escaped an exploding sun and he had time to gel his hair and she had time to comb it out.&&But also not a fun and spirited adventure, a totally serious and dark adventure, for adults, tackling serious issues using serious tones, maturely. That's the vibe I get anyway. &&Spoilers: [Only Tom Holland's character's village is /r/incels IRL, if anything it ends up making fun of them.](#spoiler)&&I read it immediately following The Hunger Games books about 5 years ago and, honestly, it just made me a little sick that The Hunger Games was so popular when relatively few people have heard of the Chaos Walking trilogy. Not that The Hunger Games is terrible, just that Chaos Walking is a whole other level. Hopefully the film adaptations will do the books justice and be as successful as they deserve.&&Yeah, curious why they didn't call it The Knife of Never Letting Go. It has better name recognition and it leaves room for sequels.&&Well I mean Game of Thrones worked out pretty well taking the opposite approach. I would really like if they don't jack these up, so I'm clinging to that hope. Dear God don't be another Maze Runner.&&Ugh the dark tower...

Comon guys, hbo needs to buy the rights.&&Just added the first one to my library request list, thanks!&&I vaguely remember these books, were they sad as fuck? Think I read the first one in my middle school library. There was a dog I think.&&They are amazing books, and I would recommend them to basically everyone. I just hope the movies do them justice.&&Yeah, I remember that because the title was so bizarre. &&[deleted]&&Basically, yeah. The starting location of the book and main character Todd's hometown is a male-ruled enclave.&&>how to spoil a whole movie in 4 words.   &&It's actually kind of incorrect in terms of how Viola got there&&He's looks a bit too young and friendly for the part. &&Figures&&What's popular now?&&The thing is, the women have only been gone for a decade and a half.

Also your statement implies being gay is something you become not born and some may have a problem with that&&According to Google, he's 1 in taller than Daisy. His 5'8"" to her 5'7"". There's also minor forced perspective here since he's slightly closer to the camera than her but otherwise, he doesn't look that much taller than she.&&I think he's just wearing really high waisted pants.&&Now that you mention it he might be. His legs do look weirdly long&&Small shirt, plus long pants at the waist, plus boots with large heels. Maybe he's wearing lifts, but could easily be not.&&A quick google says he's an inch taller than Daisy. That seems right in this picture so no lifts.&&I've also spotted a toe thumb... neat!&&You know you think highly of your career and reputation when you don’t even want your name attached to the best Hunger Games movie.&&Damn, I loved Jumper. &&Yeah, but one of the differences is that Mannequin Skywalker can't act for shit. Holland and Ridley can. &&Jumper as a concept was pretty cool, even the special effects of the teleportation was nice, but the story and acting was crappy.&&Tale as old as time.&&MINOR SPOILER WARNING

Over a thousand pages and 3 years and he never gets to smash, Rip Todd&&That girl got bangs.&&That one shot of Boyega panicking in the sand, one of the first promotional materials from Star Wars VII, was what made me think it might be okay. He had more emotion on his face in that one shot than all characters in all the prequels combined.

My first thought ""Oh, they're going to allow their actors to act this time!""&&He didn't have quite as much muscle in spiderman. He was leaner. Plus his hair was longer to make him look younger. 

He has a bit of a baby face but with the shorter hair and stronger shoulders and arms I don't think he could pass for 13/14

Plus in boys a 13 yo and a 15 yo do look pretty different.&&Who are you, Sony?&&This was a Movie Bob video! He kinda describes his dream scenario. You should check it out if you haven't yet, I'll go find a link.

Edit: https://youtu.be/5tJ6FlVq054&&Odd Thomas was way better than it should have been. &&I'm reading Moby Dick and for some reason I imagine Jamie Bell as Ishmael.&&it's TURN: Washington's Spies&&I'll watch it for sure. Thanks for the rec!&&It's not a real Bruce Willis movie unless he gradually over its course gets stripped down to a dirty vest and a mean attitude.&&Let's not forget the masterpiece that is [Death Becomes Her](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104070/) &&And he can be real gentleman when he wants. Id like to see him in a romcom personally. And I dont normally like romcoms....&&I like when he went home with that guy and then his face was on the news and the guy gave him this questioning look so he just shot him like it was nothing.&&I liked The Jackal way better than the original, all because Bruce Willis. The original was good, but Bruce Willis is just naturally intimidating. Like you would feel real uncomfortable if you were at the theater with him and someone 4 rows down pulled out their phone to shoot a text real quick and you knew that was his pet peeve. He's the kind of guy where you're like, ""I feel really put off in this guy's presence, so I'm just going to help him with these weapons and hope if I'm obedient and helpful, he won't use them to shoot my arm off.""&&Die Hard gave us the underdog average Joe hero&&I don't entirely agree wrt Neeson.  Yes, he's done some dumb action films, many in the last few years, but he's also taken really smart films that were too smart for their own good, like *The Grey*, AKA ""WTF Marketers, we thought we were going to see Liam punching wolves, and instead you sold us a movie about death!""&&It’s not just about making the big bucks for Sandler: those cheap and dumb movies are basically a vacation with his friends. He’s basically getting paid to go to summer camp with his buddies. I can’t blame him for saying yes. &&Holy shit punch drunk love was good wasn't it?

I mean most people mention Reign over Me (which is fucking gut-wrenching) but the way PDL was shot really pulled me in. Sandler should have busted out a few more amazing dramatic performances. 

But the smell of easy money, who could argue?&&Ehhh, Sandler is a bit different. His style really hasn't changed from his earlier work, which is the problem. Back in the 90s his man child antics were fresh and hilarious and fit right in with the culture of the time, and while the public's taste in comedy has moved on, he hasn't. &&Right? Remember when blowjob girl was suddenly on The Office, and then got her own Netflix show?

I started watching Community just because Donald Glover was on it, and then the other two showed up in a few episodes.&&25 is young, just not ""young adults"" young. 25 is adult.

Or MILF, if you're a pornstar.&&Right - same with Jesus' brother Randy.  Poor guy gets the shaft.&&Mainstream audiences don't get it.  
Edit: It also has an A Cinemascore.&&Yeah fuck how much normal audiences enjoyed it. What really matters is the critical analysis of professional reviewers&&**spoilers**
It's been a while since I read it, but I remember it giving Game of Thrones a run for the money in terms of violence and gore. The first book's antagonist, a psycho priest, gets his lower jaw blown off, survives, and is finally dispatched by the female character, who shoves the titular knife through his neck. Characters are also tied up, beaten, waterboarded, and suffer gruesome injuries including gunshot wounds and broken bones. Not to put anyone off from the series, it was actually quite good, but it may be a bit to much to stomach for some younger readers.&&""The Knife of Never Letting Go"" probably sounds really stupid to people who haven't read the book.

There's nothing wrong with calling them Chaos Walking 1, 2, and 3.

I'm sure the marketing will make it clear to book readers what it is. &&They might have thought the name doesn't have a lot of Hollywood appeal and punch compared to Chaos Walking.

I think it was a good idea.&&this is probably one of those hollywood accounting movies where it just has to ~~make~~lose enough money to make the bottomline of the studio look reasonable to tax guys   
big name actors + big name critically acclaimed property + no hype + no naming sense = ender's game,the giver, the 5th wave etc etc   
feel sad for the book folk&&My guess is they wanted the recognition of the trilogy name, but were unsure if it would be financially successful enough to warrant the sequels.

If they don't botch it by smashing all three books into the first movie, the sequels will likely have a colon. (i.e., Chaos Walking: 'Name of Second Book')  &&Probably the same reason they named Game of Thrones after the first book and not ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" as the whole series. Chaos Walking is snappy and has more of a ring to it.&&I loved the books, they were absolutely amazing, especially the first one&&Yup! I’m #4 on a waitlist for 4 copies. My library also has the compendium of all 3 books. &&They're must reads in my opinion, so you're in for a treat!&&Yeah, Manchee. Fuck that preacher, man. &&<3 &&True true, but then the explanation to that's another spoiler!&&There have been a lot of sci fi deals recently. Retellings in space (Jane Eyre in space! King Arthur in space! etc) are popular. WARCROSS by Marie Lu will be huge.

Fantasy is always popular (dark fantasy in particular, like the upcoming FOREST OF A THOUSAND LANTERNS by Julie Dao, or anything by Leigh Bardugo or Victoria Schwab), but is maybe on a slight downswing after publishing houses snapped up everything fantasy related in 2014-2015.

Spec fic is big too, like Adam Silvera's THEY BOTH DIE AT THE END. And realistic contemporary like Angie Thomas's THE HATE U GIVE and DEAR MARTIN by Nic Stone.&&I didn't realize the context that they had only disappeared for 15 years. 

And no, I don't think being gay is a choice. I'm gay myself, as stated above and I definitely didn't choose it. 

However, I will say after a certain amount of time (that is if a culture of all males could be sustained for a long time in some fashion) I believe the genetic desire for the opposite sex would be filtered out and homosexuality would become the majority. 

That all being said I do also feel that after a while, the urge to relieve sexual tension would grow to a point that they would consider all options, regardless of being gay or not. At some point, your own hand just doesn't cut it anymore. &&This looks like more than an inch difference&&https://imgur.com/J6ZGlJe I think he maybe is but his legs are pretty long in proportion to his torso&&He can act. The prequels had terrible scripts, but Anakin can act. Go watch Shattered Glass.&&>Mannequin Skywalker

Amazing.&&Mannequin Skywalker is the name people call the child actor in Episode I, not the adult who played him in the other movies.&&true as it can be&&Poor Spider-Man...&&[I hate you!](https://media.giphy.com/media/Mir5fnHxvXrTa/giphy.gif)&&Never read the books but hear its a loose adaptation but I still enjoyed the hell out of it. I definitely cried at the end. &&Significantly better&&I could see Jamie Bell playing Tom Cruise as a dog while fighting ninjas on Mars. Jamie Bell, like Anton, could play any role. He's the reason why I saw Jumper. I actually enjoyed Jumper (sure there were flaws) but I dug it (except for why Jumpers are killed). Did wish a sequel happened. &&Or being dead the whole time.&&The Kid was the opposite...well, minus the dirty vest.  &&""Come down to the coast have a few laughs...

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092666/&&THIS.  The joke is that Bruce Willis became an action hero precisely because he WASN'T an action hero.  Then he became an actual action hero and now he's just an action hero. &&Also Silence. His role was relatively small but very important & powerful.&&To be honest, though, he did his fair share of wolf-punching.&&Man, that movie kicked me in the dick. Normally I hate it when a movie is marketed falsely, but this time it worked. Neeson was a fucking powerhouse in that one. So good.&&That's what we all say and assume... but has anyone ever confirmed it/admitted it? &&That's what is common with some of the popular comedy actors: they can pull off some amazing drama pieces, but they rarely if ever pull in the big pay day so they still gladly sign on when they get easy work where they can just phone it in.

I remember reading these crap movies are pretty much just vacations for everyone, that they get paid to do.&&I still put Funny People in there as well. Rogan doesn't ruin it with his usual huehuehuehue stuff, and Sandler's self-loathing is so fucking strong, man. It reminds me of Nolte in Warrior during his raging drunk scene with Hardy.

It also says something that I remember every character's name.&&And that's why I think hunger games should've been rated R&&Idk how many years it's been since they made that pile of shit that was Ender's Game but I'm still angry about it.

Probably because I've actually used it as an example of how film studios could franchise adaptations without ruining the source material for many many years, long before they made that garbage dump of a movie.

Think about that book. It's broken up into three distinct parts. The Launchie arc, the arc where Ender was a soldier, and the arc where Ender was a commander. All three arcs are self-contained stories with a beginning, a middle and an end as well. So I used that book as an example in franchising books. That ONE book could have been THREE 90 minute films. Easily. They could have kept the unnecessary CGI to fill the seats with people that only go see movies if they're special effects nightmare scapes, they would have had far more time to develop characters and plot and throw in fan service, and it would have been easily made into a trilogy to make the studio hella cash money.

I'm so tired of seeing my favorite childhood media turned into trash. The Golden Compass could have been done in a similar way as well. Instead we got...well...trash&&atleast they cared enough for those properties to give them their original names. doesn't bode well for this movie to me&&Just based on this I no longer want to read these books...&&TV and movies don't usually make me cry. Books never do. But I'd be lying if I said that I didn't have tears running down my face when I read that book.&&Fuck, why the hell am I crying angry tears. It was years ago I read that book. 

Poo, Todd. &&""Toooodd Hewwwitt""! 

Love that a gay man had one of his most disturbing characters be a relentless preacher.&&I have become the very thing I swore to destroy!&&I pretty much got the gist of it. &&Only if you set it in space.&&Speculative fiction is an umbrella term that encompasses fantasy, horror, sci fi, etc. But colloquially it tends to refer to the ""what if"" of fiction. ""Speculative fiction is any fiction in which the “laws” of that world (explicit or implied) are different than ours."" It tends to be smaller scale in scope than a space-opera type sci fi.

In Adam Silvera's THEY BOTH DIE AT THE END, the main characters live in a world in which you are informed of your upcoming death via a mechanism called Death-Cast, and they meet on an app called Last Friend. He wrote another book MORE HAPPY THAN NOT in which a boy considers undergoing a memory-altering procedure to forget that he's gay.

In Corey Ann Haydu's THE CAREFUL UNDRESSING OF LOVE, the girls of Devonnaire Street in Brooklyn know that the men they fall in love are cursed to die, and it started after a 9/11-esque tragedy.

The list goes on. It's part magical realism, part contemporary fantasy. Hard to pin down.&&Speculative fiction I think? Although that's odd because all the previous genre mentioned would be spec fic in that case. &&Yeah it's specifically titled that way to reference Tupac's interpretation of Thug Life. http://www.epicreads.com/blog/tupac-thug-life-hate-u-give/&&It’s a reference to a Tupac song. Spelling it “correctly” would make zero sense&&unexpectedly&&Just assume he's actually dead in all movies, it's just the opposite of assuming he's actually alive in every movie. Think about it..&&My assfucking friend - we were watching it on Halloween, a bunch of us, he was the only one who'd seen it. First time Bruce shows up - ""Oh yeah, he's dead.""

None of us thought much of it at the time. But then we got to the end of the movie - and...that was the whole fucking movie.

God...god DAMMIT Ramon.&&If you haven't seen Die Hard by now it's your own fault.&&Not a huge part but he was very charming in Ocean's Twelve &&Thank you for the link!&&The Spy Kids theme is so dope too.

I was confused because like the other poster I thought speculative fiction was scifi/fantasy.

*Edit-Apparently he didn't do much acting in the movie either.&&The entire U.S. box-office will only cover the cost of the *reshoots* of Geostorm, and not even touch the budget for the rest of the movie, or marketing costs.

[It was an $80M project](https://fastlane.louisianaeconomicdevelopment.com/Film/FilmSearchDetails.aspx?ProjNum=6LVzcOz4Ra2K%2fpSNqIcUhg%3d%3d).

And then they finally settled on releasing it now, after the summer blockbuster season right around Halloween time. They would have fared much better off with a February or March release this year, or next.

They now won't even make back the money it cost for *just the reshoots*. Let alone the original production budget.

Gerard Butler is probably the only reason I would go see it. &&i came for this. did he become a director?&&>In the Internet age, bad movies are fucking doomed in cinemas. Bad word travels to everyone's tiny pocket Internet boxes in an instant. It's brutal.

You'd think the industry would have learned after *The Hulk* got killed by internet buzz back in 2003. Instead, studios just got mad at the Internet.

He was absolutely hilarious in that Ricky Gervais skit and more importantly they have the same initials&&> pull a Leslie Nielsen where he does comedy movies instead

Quality Zucker/Abrahams comedies badly need a come back.&&He was in a romantic comedy... The Bounty Hunter. He was pretty funny in that. &&The CGI in the trailers looks like absolute shit. How can 1996 era *Twister* have more realistic looking tornadoes than a film 20 years newer?&&San Andreas made $474 million off a $110 million budget.  2012 made $770 million off a $200 million budget.

There is a market for this genre of movie every couple years, they just have to be not utter shit.

With that said, I do think Geostorm could scrape its way to a profit, or at least a much smaller loss, with retail sales and rentals.  I managed a Family Video for a few years and for some reason people went crazy over these kinds of movies.&&I don’t know, bad disaster movies are kind of a staple, and they can usually make some decent money too. Don’t really know why people passed on this one. Guess people finally got bored or looked at reviews for once. Might be a sign that disaster movies are officially done for. 

&&Once you see a timer in an intense part of a movie you know that’s going to last about three times longer than the actual length of the original number.&&Jesus Christ, literally one second made the difference between geostorm and the successful aversion of disaster. One second, and everything went back to normal. I wanted to slam my head on something.&&""Thank the Mexican."" 
*Literally points at Mexican flag*&&We need Eugenio Derbez in more American movies.&&My family is from Mexico. When they see a Mexican actor coming out in a big American film like this it’s a big deal to them and they go crazy. My aunt cheered and clapped when he appeared on screen. It was so embarrassing. You would think we were related to Eugenio Derbez with the way my aunt acted. Only made it more disappointing that it sucked so much.&&Seriously, you don’t have to be a meteorologist to have predicted this was a giant turdnado coming through. &&Get your facts straight. I'm 300% sure that Gerard Butler wakes up on the morning of a shoot, gets in his car and drives to Gerard Butler's house, picks up Gerard Butler and drives him to the studio. Security Guard Gerard Butler checks Gerard Butlers ID, gives him a wink and lets him through to get on set and start his day. Gerard Butler helps to direct Gerard Butler throughout the day, they get some great catering from Chef Gerard Butler. Gerard is proud of how he acted in every scene in every acting role in the film, and has faith in the Gerard Butler marketing team to give the film the best chance it can get. 

Once things are wrapped up with shooting, Gerard picks up Gerard and takes him home to his smoking hot wife, Gerard Butler. Gerard has a sneaking suspicion that Gerard has been cheating on him with that cocky cowboy of a neighbor, Gerard Butler. This is why Gerard feels like he needs to write, produce, direct, edit and market films like Geostorm, so he can win back the approval of his wife. &&I’ll almost definitely watch this on HBO in a few months though. &&Gerard Butler in a bad film isnt anything out of the ordinary. He's been in more garbage than he has good films at this point. &&I mean that money didn’t just disappear. It employed a hell of a lot of people. The only only people this is sad for is the producers of the movie and its frankly not that sad. &&i watched the movie because my lil bro wanted to watch it. gerard butler was by far the best part about the movie. they cant blame this on him. literally everything else is to blame.

oh and the actress playing his daughter is pretty great too.

Edit: how could i forget about derbez, the hidden gem in this movie. His acting ability was totally wasted in this movie. Someone with so much ability and experience, relegated to a throw away role. A real shame if you ask me.&&Dude also hasn’t made a good movie in a very long time so I don’t know what they were expecting. &&Sports car and Geo Storm do not belong in the same sentence.

I haven't had a good shit since I saw it. I blame Geostorm for my constipation. The movie causes bowel issues.&&Well, look at all the hits that Awesome-O put out. &&`Um... okay, how about this...

edit: i get it, gerard butler's been in some vaguely obscure, kinda shitty action movie that you enjoyed. i've been suggested his entire imdb at this point. they're great, i don't personally like him or his films. 

double edit: I've been called bitter, a conceited fuck and told to fuck off. There's only so many of the same film recommendations I can take, *please* stop telling me how good you think Law Abiding Citizen is, I've seen it and didn't like it.

You kidding? That's how lazy they're getting? Even the title sucks! 

Then I saw it like a year later or something cuz I love animated movies and I could. It was fucking fantastic. Like holy shit. Even the sequel was good. 

It made me realize that if I used to be an idiot, then I'm still an idiot right now. 

Whatever you get out of it is fine though, it's great. &&> In 2013, Warner Brothers hired Brian Miller to rewrite the script.[12][13] Miller was the writer for the film Apollo 18. In Miller's version of the story, U.S. Special Forces would replace the Marine unit as the time traveling fighting force.[14]

yeah pulled from wikipedia. It sounds like it went from a cool idea to a low budget thing about 5 guys rather then 2,200 marines. Also Apollo 18 was really really stupid.&&Stealing this.&&Is that the plot for the sequel?  Machine learning becomes so advanced it goes rogue and starts attacking us.

When the really heavy bomb rolls onto one character and they say their goodbyes only for the ship to tilt and the bomb to land on the other character. Or that they get saved by whale song. One of the funniest films ever. (Unintentionally)

Edit: someone asked me to link this video about The Core https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LMAAVdhKOmQ it's a 30 min comedic review akin to cinemasins.

&&Lol i forgot about the core. It's nearly the same story isn't it?&&I think it's more the success of San Andreas.&&2012 was great because it was a disaster film that focused on John Cusak just trying to save his family. Thats it. 

Yes there was science and politics but they were made more human thanks to Danny Glover and main science guys relationship w his dad.&&The day after tommorrow and Geostorm shared similar massive hailstones attacking Tokyo too lol &&> But for the most part big stupid concept movies like this seem to do pretty well.

Maybe the recent hurricane disasters and the fact that Puerto Rico keeps making headlines curbed people's appetites for weather-made disaster movies.

Otherwise, yeah, this has big stupid Armageddon movie written all over it, with Armageddon budget and expectations of Armageddon profits.&&I actually really like 2012. I've watched it multiple times.&&This movie seemed like a parody of a disaster porn movie. Something they would be trying to go see in an episode of Seinfeld. &&There’s multiple trailers, some that make it look like it could be kinda okay as a satire (I hope) and another that makes it look like a movie that wants to be taken seriously&&[deleted]&&In a world with 8 jan Michael Vincents&&Rumtum tuggernuts!&&Blade Runner 2049's gross did improve (it is doing better outside the US), and it might still bring in some more money yet.

I know it’s hard to admit.&&Of the two identical movies that came out at around the same time, I can't believe that it was *Olympus Has Fallen,* and not the Channing Tatum/Jamie Foxx version of that same movie, which got a sequel.&&I love Law Abiding Citizen I thought he out performed Jamie Foxx in every aspect...&&https://youtu.be/QMRPDOBNA20

We’ve just come out of a massive chain  of devastating natural disasters in such a quick succession. A lot of people are probably uneasy about watching a movie who’s biggest selling point is people dying from weather disasters. &&Oh yeah that's right, they had to take down a ton of marketing for this movie because their byline was ""Weather The Storm"" which is not advice you want to be giving when a real hurricane is on the way.  It's hard enough getting people to evacuate as it is&&I really wish someone had bit on this&&Law abiding citizen would like a word with you. &&Any movie where Gerard Butler tries another accent is a disaster movie.&&I liked Olympus has fallen &&I don’t really think it’s fair to say a movie failed because of the lead actor. People wouldn’t look at a new movie and go “Gerard Butler? Meh his recent movies have sucked, this one will too” now i know it’s pretty easy to tell that Geostorm was going to suck no mater who was in it, but still. If actors really had that big of an impact on people seeing the movie, what about Blade Runner 2049? Because of other reasons besides actors. I’d say San Andreas did well because the San Andreas fault is a real and scary threat, not because of the rock. Is he even a good actor or are people just that much in love with him? Anyway I can understand your points but I think it goes beyond Gerard Butler, even though you are 100% right about him being pretty bad in almost every movie he’s been in recently.  &&This sounds like a ProZD skit, lmfao.&&Close the door, ice will not get through.&&Hahaha I forgot about that scene.

Its really a shame it didnt do better.&&It was loosely based off of a children's book, so I don't think you can knock them for the title.&&Wait. That makes no sense. A whole marine unit of 2000 people or so would be able to take a Roman army, even if outnumbered 50 to 1.

The box office might not have been kind to the original but no-one can deny it's not a classic movie and will be remembered for a long time.&&I think it'll have good legs in home release and licensing too. And it'll likely get a nice bump come awards season with the exposure it's sure to get.&&more like a master piece of shit&&Yeah, a masterpiece in that it'll take a master to piece a decent movie out of it.&&It seriously took me until months later to realize the trailers I saw all the time for those movies were in fact for two completely different movies.&&Well, it's simple.

If you take out the two ridiculous scenes of Rome being destroyed by lightning and the Golden Gate Bridge being destroyed by the Sun, it's a pretty decent movie. The dialogue is good, the soundtrack is good, there's no sub-romance plot, the film embraces its absurdities (""unobtainium""), and most of the main characters are given a background story. I don't understand the people who say the movie is not realistic. Neither is Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings.

The phreakers informed Draper that a toy whistle that was, at the time, packaged in boxes of Cap'n Crunch cereal could emit a tone at precisely 2600 hertz—the same frequency that was used by AT&T long lines to indicate that a trunk line was ready and available to route a new call.[14] This would effectively disconnect one end of the trunk, allowing the still connected side to enter an operator mode. Experimenting with this whistle inspired Draper to build blue boxes: electronic devices capable of reproducing other tones used by the phone company.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Draper&&I never knew that! Thanks for the link!&&Neat!  I feel like I've been a sci-fi fan for way too long to have only ever encountered it in Avatar, go figure&&I read a great article a while back on how films that actually make back their budget in the theater actually opens up studios to losing money from having to pay taxes and losing out on potential insurance money. I mean there's so many shady accounting practices in hollywood to practically make sure a film doesn't make back the value of its budget. I mean there are so many examples of this shit. Pretty much any big blockbuster:

According to Lucasfilm, Return of the Jedi, despite having earned $475 million at the box office against a budget of $32.5 million, ""has never gone into profit"".

Winston Groom's price for the screenplay rights to his novel Forrest Gump included a 3% share of the profits; however, due to Hollywood accounting, the film's commercial success was converted into a net loss, and Groom received only $350,000 for the rights and an additional $250,000 from the studio

Regarding LOTR; the Tolkien estate sued New Line, claiming that their contract entitled them to 7.5% of the gross receipts of the $6 billion hit.[19] According to New Line's accounts, the trilogy made ""horrendous losses"" and no profit at all.

and a more relevant, recent example would be: 

Michael Moore sued Bob and Harvey Weinstein for creative accounting to deprive him of his share of profits for the film Fahrenheit 9/11. Eventually, Moore reached a settlement with the Weinsteins and the lawsuit was dropped.[21]&&""This morning I woke up with a 10 in my bed. It was me.""&&HOW&&>Wow! A triple negative in the wild. It's beautiful

It's ununundeniable.
&&> The financial success doesn’t matter.

In a perfect world, you'd be right. but in a world where jobs and people's ability to continue to make films is lorded over by cut throat executives it entirely matters. 

However it's lack of success means that no body has an excuse to make a sequel any time soon. it would be pretty cool if every thirty years another blade runner is released, whether or not their relevance will continue to hold in a world thats going down the path its on is another matter entirely. &&I agree. I'll pick White House Down over Olympus Has Fallen any day of the week. What I liked about WHD is that it didn't take itself too seriously. It was a fun, goofy action flick.&&This one?
https://youtu.be/7K8j55V3Lvw&&He does a damn good Tarantino impression on that vid too&&i've heard the same from actual set workers.  
also he pulled that sort of shit on miami vice. &&How about in uhh... in ehhhhjj JOKERMAN FONT!&&Allegedly he complained because his character didn't win and threatened to walk out. They rewrote the ending so Foxx's character won.&&fnord&&Good, old fashion Earth Unobtainium, not that alien rubbish.&&I think people are ignoring just how tongue-in-cheek that movie was. It knew how ridiculous it was and ran with it.&&But what do you say you do around here? &&[deleted]&&The idea at the time was that any iceberg big enough to seriously endanger the ship would be seen in time. For anything of lesser significance, the lifeboats were intended to be used to ferry passengers to a rescue ship.

On the night of Titanic's sinking, that actually should have happened. There was a ship only a few miles away but didn't respond to distress calls.&&What I'm getting is that it's not possible to remove the pump from the tank without unscrewing something. But it's not possible to unscrew it because it's blocked by a piece of metal. So to avoid this situation they use a bolt that allows them to unscrew it.

Ok now I'm unsure, could be completely wrong.&&Poor communication between engineers and technicians is often a cause of anguish for both. But technicians also are quick to point out seemingly obvious design changes without understanding the requirements associated with the original design.&&My friend did it ghetto. He had the 2600 tone on a CD and played it into the handset. &&And the auto dialer needed a specific crystal to generate the proper frequency for those free calls.  RadioShack sold them.&&They are called blue boxes.

I used to build them with a buddy of mine and sell them to the phreaker community in Toronto.   Used to advertise on the Pirate Box BBS.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box&&Engineers use it a lot. Mostly in snarky comments like, ""oh yeah that idea would work if made the manifold out of unobtanium"".&&The Rock + DD boobs + America getting fucked up = Success&&Very true. I mean, everyone who worked on the film already got paid, but the financial performance does affect the idea of financing proper sequels to older franchises.

I’m just glad with the direction they took it. I look to *Tron Legacy* as an example of how NOT to treat a franchise. While the visuals and score were exciting, the story and script were very watered down. I 100% believe this was Disney’s fault, trying to make it appeal to the widest audience. I actually didn’t mind CGI Jeff Bridges, but it’s just a shame that with a universe with such potential, they really fell back on tropes. *Legacy* did ~$400 million on a $200 million budget, which isn’t the worst but obviously wasn’t enough for them to continue the story.

I’m actually a film critic by trade, but I’m also drunk and lost my train of thought lol&&Wing dings please. &&Where can I get some dam bait?&&Yeah I never got the whole ""unintentionally funny"" vibe from it. That is a movie that knew how ridiculous it was.&&I told you! I'm a people person!&&Why would you base it on the weight of the ship and not the people on board though lol&&There were a lot of contributing factors to that disaster.  A lot could've happened differently so that they never hit the ice.  However, they should have survived the impact.  They used materials out of spec from the design, or were even bigger idiots.  The steel had a high transition temperature meaning it was more brittle than it ought to have been at the temperature it impacted with the ice berg (so 32f).  If it had been better steel with superior low temperature properties it would have ""dented more"" and either not spring a leak at all or a relatively small one in comparison to what actually happened.&&Nah that seems right it just wasn't quite clear that the different bolt was because the piece of metal was blocking it and that it fixed the problem in the first comment (to me at least).&&Hah, that is pretty damn ghetto.. Wasn't there a whistle that came with a cereal that was a tone match too?.. Think it came with the Cap'n..&&It's not even snarky comments...

Hollywood is as corrupt as the Republicans or Democrats. It's an institution like any other. Weinstein is a dinosaur of the old ways of doing things (casting couch mentality). 

He defended Polanski because he, like Polanski, is a sexual deviant and prolific scumbag.&&I have a friend in hollywood who said her boss said this guy is literally the devil when it comes to how he treats people, not even including the sexual advances.&&I work in the film industry. 

This has been well known for years. 

Just glad some people were finally willing to go on the record about it. &&Let's keep in mind that this is only happening now because his company hasn't been making enough money for the right people. 

How many others in power are just as, if not more, guilty than him? &&Harvey's ""Casting Couch"" has had MANY actresses that are not named in this article. Google Harvey's Girls. Hardly an open secret.

It would be a great story if those well-known/successful actors came forward with their stories. 

EDIT: Links for the lazy. 1. [Pajiba-Harvey's Girls](http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/harveys-girls-the-wouldbe-ingenues-where-are-they-now-and-what-happened-then.php) & [Defamer's 2010 compilation](http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092) &&My parents also came of age in the 60's and 70's but somehow managed not to sexually assault people. &&Ugly story but can't say that I'm surprised. &&He was a huge supporter/defender of Polanski.&&Not Harvey Weinstein but I always crack up listening to Howard Stern's interview with Rich, the now deceased lead singer of LFO. It's one of his greatest interviews (It's on YouTube) and really spells out just how creepy Lou Pearlman was. I mean he scammed people for MILLIONS and was a total piece of shit, but this interview was a very candid look into how creepy and gross Lou was, some may say even predatory. I'm sure the entertainment industry has a shit ton of Lous out there. &&In October of 2016, the A/V Club ran an article about Rose McGowan and a director she was involved with effectively working with her rapist.  The following is what I sent to the A/V Club on October 10th, 2016:

As many have pointed out, Rose McGowan was very publically involved with director Robert Rodriguez -- the majority of Rodriguez's work has been distributed by the Weinsteins.  The Robert Rodriguez-directed film _Planet Terror_ starred Rose McGowan and was released by the Weinsteins.  Again, all of this is known.  However, this is not the first time the Weinsteins -- specifically Harvey -- have been accussed of this manner of action.  Director Richard Stanley had cast actress Stacey Travis in his debut film _Hardware_.  He had wanted her for his sophomore film _Dust Devil_, but was not allowed to cast her.  The following is from the Espoo Ciné Interview with Richard Stanley ( a transcript is available at http://www.everythingisundercontrol.org/nagtloper/iviews/cine1.php )


RS:  Yeah, it's mostly set in the Zone.  I got tired of the city, I always meant to shoot it in Arizona or somewhere.  Jill [character from _Hardware_ played by Stacey Travis] is technophobic and is trying to live close to the soil.  She's stopped fixing sculptures; now she's mostly fixing tractors and combines.  And Shades fails to hook up with them and gets caught in the situation where a bunch of fleeing Mexican characters take shelter with the dirt farmers and they end up leading the droids to them. Those freaks are all pacifists and want no part in helping the Mexicans.  They're also very bad doctors; they don't believe in normal medicine, so they try to treat the Mexican character with different herbal remedies, but his leg gets gangrenous so they cut his limbs off.  So the hippie doctors and witches are not very helpful.  And then they end up besieged by the droids, and Stacy has to revert to her character, to actually fight at the end.  And I was planning to do terrible things to her because I fought to have her in another movie, she was in a position where she was forced to do things that are even worse than in the first film.

BDD:  She was supposed to be in Dust Devil?

RS:  Miramax wouldn't let her cause she wouldn't mess around with Harvey [Weinstein].  Harvey tried to get into her hotel room and she phoned with my hotel and asked ""What should I do?  I didn't let him in.""  And they asked her to do a Playboy spread and she refused that, too, and they never let her work again which is very annoying. She's only now started showing in some small parts.


If more comes to light in regard to the McGowan story you may want to reach out to Stacey Travis and/or Richard Stanley.  Also, I would like to note that Travis did continue working, but more television work than anything else.  And in 2005, fifteen years after _Hardware_, she did have a film that she appeared in -- _Venom_ -- that was distributed by the Weinsteins.  Although I believe they did not finance it, but rather only picked it up for distribution.&&I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.&&Well shit Entourage was onto something&&Not that I condone the sexual harassment but I'm glad he's getting done for it. Couldn't have happened to a more deserving guy.

Source: worked for him for a few months. Was a dick. &&Holy shit. Weinstein's statement he released today is solid gold. He quotes Jay-Z, brings up the NRA and his Bar Mitzvah, and threatens to make a movie about President Trump.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-harvey-weinstein.html?src=twr&&HIS lawyer is Lisa Bloom? LOL!
&&I bet this guy is a totally insufferable asshole in person.  The fact he feels above the law, especially in dealing with beautiful women wanting movie roles is even more believable.  He is the pinnacle of ""don't you know who the fuck I am"" and the ""I'll make sure you never work in this town again"" mentality on this earth.  &&Could not happen to a better person. Karma is a biznatch, play boy. This should shut your big mouth up for a little while. What a jerk.&&This has to be the least shocking ""Hollywood Bombshell"" I've ever read. It's been pretty clear for ages that this dude is a scumbag.&&""In public, he presents himself as a liberal lion, a champion of women and a winner of not just artistic but humanitarian awards."" 

All too common.&&I would love to see the candid reactions of actors and actress in Hwood right now... imagine it's a mix of fear and glee. Indie directors are rejoicing lol&&“Decades”? Jeez even a second’s too much and he’s managed to pull off decades?!&&Weinstein's statement in response to all of this hits all the high points: he mentions his own Bar Mitzvah, mentions the President, mentions work for women. It's a PR masterpiece.

The guy's still married, with children (5, spread over two marriages). He should be lead with that - his happy marriage.&&Is having one on one meetings in a hotel room a common occurrence? &&I worked with Jace Alexander. He was a smug, self-absorbed, nepotistic piece of shit. He bragged 24/7 and acted like he was Hollywood royalty. 

I remember he loved having Penelope Miller’s young daughter sit on his lap all the time.

Wasn’t surprised when he got arrested for child porn. He was supposed to sign up on the registry, but he hasn’t done it yet. Probably thinks he can get away with not ever doing it.

He also has a daughter the age of the girls found on his porn. Not sure if it was her or not.&&Everyone in the Catholic Church knew about pedophile priests. Everyone at Penn State knew about Jerry Sandusky. Everyone in the British media/entertainment industry knew about Jimmy Savile. 

Why should we be surprised that everyone in Hollywood knew what Weinstein was up to?&&If Polanski is any indication, Weinstein is due for a standing-O at the next Oscar ceremony.&&The noose is tightening, Dan Schneider!&&This story is utterly unsurprising. The sexual harassment allegations are new, but it’s not news that Harvey Weinstein is a well known abusive boss and terrible human being. Many of his former assistants are happy to talk about how horrible he is privately, and some publicly. The Weinstein Company is well known as one of the worst working environments in Hollywood. But the problem with such companies is they can do so much to forward your career, it becomes a game of how much abuse you’re willing to put up with. That leads to a cycle where many of those who make it in the business are those who are ok taking abuse, so they don’t have much problems passing it on to the next generation of employees. It’s the same sort of mechanism as fraternity hazing.

The worst part about it is despite the fact abusive behavior provides exactly ZERO benefit to these businesses, it’s rampant and normalized. This is something capitalism can solve, one company can attract the best employees if they become a famously good working environment a la Google in the tech industry, and that forces others to follow suit to compete. But it’s going to take a head of a major studio deciding to take very public action to differentiate their working culture, and unfortunately when all the executives have gone through this culture, it becomes difficult to find one who will break the cycle. That’s not to say there aren’t nice film executives, there are many, but there has yet to be a studio head who cares enough to force his bad executives’ culture to change.&&That this is a big story now shows how much things have changed for the better. 

They used to have a whole industry within the industry of young actresses that were on call to service Studio heads, producers, directors, and bigwhigs.  Many of the woman we saw in the tame old days of film and television had it much worse, basically going from industry hooker to actress.&&No surprise there. The story is why now.&&I know someone who worked for him and it is very true &&I find it interesting that Lisa Bloom is weinstein's attorney here. Usually i'd expect to see her on the other side of things&&This is just the beginning. &&The real crime is it taking 30 plus years for line to be shined on this or this big a way. &&I lived in LA for a while and became friends with this woman who, like many women in LA, was an actress. I saw her recently in an episode of Blue Bloods playing a porn star... anyway... she told me she met Harvey Weinstein once and I kind of asked how that went, and her words were ""he wanted me to jump on his Harvey Weinstein."" Ever since then I sort of always wondered whether or not she was telling the truth... apparently she was. &&Man I hope this is just the start of that asshole's life being ruined.&&[""Mr Weinstein will be with you in a moment, Miss Aguilera""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q61QTySesBQ)&&> Many women who worked with Mr. Weinstein said they never experienced sexual harassment or knew of anyone who did, and recalled him as a boss who gave them valuable opportunities at young ages. Some described long and satisfying careers with him, praising him as a mentor and advocate.

> But in interviews, some of the former employees who said they had troubling experiences with Mr. Weinstein asked a common question: How could allegations repeating the same pattern — young women, a powerful male producer, even some of the same hotels — have accumulated for almost three decades?

This is a Bill Cosby situation. Even if you want to grant Weinstein the presumption of innocence chances are that at least several of these accounts are true considering the similarities between the independent accusations. It only takes one to be legitimate for him to be considered a sexual predator. Unfortunate situation but good that it is receiving attention after being neglected for many years. &&He made A LOT of careers.  I'm wondering if those people are going to stand silent or step forward.  &&I keep envisioning the ""Harvey Weingard"" character from Entourage, and these allegations totally fit within my idea of who that character is. Which all seems to make sense now, considering he was based on H. Weinstein. &&And now we have this turn of events:

http://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-new-york-times-lawsuit-1201884255/

&&Anyone else just notice Weinstein bears a striking resemblence to [Hank Hippopopalous](https://i.imgur.com/5kn7UqR.jpg)?
&&An ex's friend was invited to meet him in his hotel on the basis that if she fucked him, he'd give her a part in a big movie. She said no but I can see why some people can force themselves to say yes or find themselves in situations no one should be put in. All that power can be corrupting but this sleazebag was born bad.&&At first I read this as Harvey Fierstein and it broke my heart.&&So the rumors of him and Jennifer Lawrence have some credence?&&Gross.  This dude should be in jail.&&I'm not surprised. The guy is an asshole. Total piece of shit. He forces directors working under him on a project to finish films in very short time periods under threat of termination. No matter how bad it ends up being because things weren't properly fleshed out or finished, he'll demand a shoddy patchwork. He also demanded edits to be made to Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke. He demanded the film be changed for a U.S. Release to which Studio Ghibli sent a katana to him with a label that read ""no cuts"" This guy is possibly the worst money scoundrel scumbag in all of hollywood. &&Walking the fine line of rape for 30 years. ""I'm gonna see a therapist and deal with this head on!"" Good grief. &&And down you go.

Eat shit and die you disengenious, corpulent fuck.&&is their any big time producer in hollywood that isnt a sexual predator/pedophile?&&Hollywood has a pedo problem like the Catholic church.&&Harvey is a well known asshole and his company is going down the drain after a string of big misses. He deserves to be fired and sued into poverty. &&What's scary to think is this is only scratching the surface. I imagine he'll see the same fate as Cosby, O'Reilly, and Ailes, though I could be wrong. Those Hollywood dollars and power can work wonders.... Bryan Singer is another heavily rumored one, and you also have Louis C.K. Granted, I haven't sat down and extensively read the backstory on any of these people, but when you hear multiple allegations throughout the years, you gotta wonder if something's up and these aren't just rumors. &&Olivia munn wrote a book and mentioned an incident almost identical.  I bet she was talking about him.  She mentioned no names.  But wow.  &&Strangest ""apology"" letter I've ever read.&&Harvey Feirstein and Harvey Weinstein are different people these days. Did not know that.&&Him and Roman Polanski can finally make that date movie lol&&So who did he piss off that they're just now saying something about it&&It's only been a few months since the revelations about Joss Whedon's sexual harassment, and they've all but disappeared. I expect the same to happen with this. The film industry was built on exploitation. &&Whatever,. Next you'll try and say that **Bryan Singer rapes 12 to 15 yo twinks openly without recourse.** Crazy talk...they were asking for it...&&And nobody should be surprised. Hollywood has for decades fostered a culture of sexual abuse and pedophilia, with rich, powerful men like Weinstein and Woody Allen and Bryan Singer and Roman Polanski (and that's just scratching the surface) using their money and connections to wantonly commit horrible crimes with no consequences to speak of. &&Where the fuck are our salads?  How long we gotta  wait for a lousy iceberg wedge? You slice the fucking thing you put it on a plate and you BRING IT OVER HERE!&&Yeah, this is one of those things where I read it and say, ""Hmm. Yeah that sounds about right.""&&""fucking Harvey..."" - James Cameron&&ILL EAT YOU ALIVE&&I’m imagining Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder.&&Rose McGowan has been through some *shit*, jesus christ&&Hollywood is fucking awful.&&when you settle, usually there is a gag order that's part of the settlement

That guy harassed the shit out of me in the late 90's/early 2000's when I was a teenager frequenting the CHUD.com message boards. He asked me to send him pictures and decided that my refusal to do so was unacceptable. He would follow me around the board and post harassing responses to every comment I made. I left the community for good in like 2002, mostly because of him. My first experience with online harassment. Those were the days.

I am amazed that human troll's career went as far as it did. I'm not shocked he turned out to have more serious character flaws.&&Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly too&&The weinsteins produced many of my favorite films. This is pretty fucked up. And now every time I hear those names we all have to cringe a little. How difficult is it to not sexually degrade women? I've been alive 32 years and I've managed.&&That guy from Glee who played guitar (sometimes had a mohawk) just pled guilty to having a load of child porn and is going to prison.&&Yeah, he isn't sorry. He is one of the last old school Hollywood studio heads - unapologetic, mysoginistic sociopath who suffers no consequences. Samuel Goldwyn was a notorious giant asshole, like borderline psychotic. Jack L. Warner had countless mistresses (actresses) stocked up in blatant view of his wife.

Unfortunately the Hollywood studio system has a bizarre order. It's full of sex and bullying. It rewards sociopathy. Robert Evans was probably the coolest studio head if you forget the drugs - at least he didn't bully people and was the only guy to greenlight The Godfather trilogy. 

Weinstein is just so powerful. It'll take a lot to bring him down, especially in a town like Hollywood. It'll be years before the extent of sexual abuse and harrassment in the studio system is revealed. It no doubt goes really deep.&&Worked for Roman Polanski. In fact, in 2009, Weinstein wrote an Op-Ed piece for The Independent titled, “Polanski has served his time and must be freed.”&&Lifestyles of the rich and famous&&This is the weirdest friggin way of wording a formal public apology.

Completely unrelated to the topic at hand though. &&Recently heard Kevin Smith give an interview where he talked about writing Chasing Amy as an outlet for his inability to deal with his starlett girlfriend's Hollywood indiscretions.&&Jesus that's a weird response, what the hell does the NRA have to do with this? &&>Jay-Z wrote in 4:44 ""I'm not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.""

How is he making this worse for himself?&&What a mess that official statement is. 

""It wasn't my fault (it was the 60s-70s!), and I've just been told this behaviour is all wrong. But I also knew all of this and beat you all to it, seeking guidance on all this a year ago, or maybe it was 10 years ago. I have a lot to apologize for, but I also have nothing to apologize for, because I really love all women and someday maybe we can earn their trust. Yes, ""we""--I mean, it's not just me, it's all of us! They're the victims here, except I'm the victim here: it's me that's righteously angry here and not any of you, and I need somewhere to channel it.

We gotchu fam, here's some jailtime

Let's be real though, Hollywood probably makes the Catholic Church blush in terms of sexual abuse, nothing will happen to him legally. &&Wow, almost an entire paragraph dedicated to what assholes the NRA and the president is, in a statement that is only 2 paragraphs plus 4 sentences long.

I see reddit disgusted that Scorsese, Lynch and 100 other celebs signed a petition for Polanski's return, but Weinstein has his fingers in everything so this may be worse.  A whole bunch of A-list celebs owe their fame to him.  They will speak down on how this should never happen then sign into one of his films hoping it brings them Oscar glory.&&He has been one of the biggest Champions of Polanski in Hollywood, this behavior from him doesn't surprise me.&&In film school, all my professors would mention the same thing. The biggest narrative lurking in Hollywood and NYC since the early 90s. Harvey Weinstein is a giant creep.&&The Weinstein Co purchased a movie I wrote several years ago. We were a very small movie comparatively and even though we had limited interaction with Bob or Harvey, what little we did have left us feeling like we needed to take a shower... My writing partner and I are both male, so I can't speak to the sexual harassment, but they always made sure we realized who we were dealing with and how much power they held over us, so the harassment part doesn't seem too far fetched. &&> there have been rumors for many years. 

You ain't kidding! 

[Judd talked about it in 2015](http://variety.com/2015/film/news/ashley-judd-sexual-harassment-studio-mogul-shower-1201610666/). [McGowan talked about it in 2016](http://variety.com/2016/film/news/rose-mcgowan-raped-studio-head-1201889536/).&&Many years? Try decades. Hollywood's worst kept secret.&&$10 says nothing comes of it. Weinstein is the tip of the iceberg. If he goes down, everyone goes down.&&Can Bryan Singer be next?&&I hope it's a slippery slope from here&&> As long as we're on this subject, can we also talk about of the the things Kevin Spacey has been accused of?

Wait is this a thing?&&Oh I’ve heard lots about Spacey from guys who interned at production companies. The guy’s a freak.&&I heard second-hand about this! I mentioned to my (very actively gay - does drag, works in a gay bar) partner that I really like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards and that I think he's kinda hot. My partner was unimpressed and proceeded to tell me about some experiences that the boys at the local gay bar had with him a few years ago. Collectively, apparently the word got around from the guys he'd hooked up with that he gets rough with his dates. Not like ""fun, consensual kinky"" rough but ""unpleasant, regret that"" rough.

To be fair though, this Harvey Weinstein stuff is another level. Being a creep with a casting couch at work is, I think, a lot worse than getting rough with some folks you picked up at a bar in your off time.&&This thread is crazy &&I'm about the farthest from Hollywood as you can get, but even I've heard stories from somebody who was an extra on one of his films. His behavior towards male PA's was described to me as predatory, and it wasn't homophobia talking since the guy who told me is gay himself. 

John Barrowman has a story he told in his autobiography about being young and trying to break into the business and being pursued by a creepy male celebrity that's assumed to be Spacey too.&&Spacey also seems to be pretty close with Singer. Makes me worry for actors like Nicholas Hoult who was recently in a film with Spacey, is part of the Xmen franchise and also dated Jennifer Lawrence (who may be connected to this Weinstein stuff). Horrible to think this shit might be happening to these young actors and actresses.&&Link? Never heard of this.&&I didn't know this, but it doesn't surprise me. Kevin Spacey always gave me a really unsettling feeling, whether it's in a role or a press junket.&&That sounds like some Frank Underwood shit&&The absolute best apology I have ever seen was when Jonah Hill went on some late night show to apologize for saying the F-word (the other one). On mobile so can't find the link but he just explained without any warping of the events what happened and told people not to follow his example. Straightforward and no bullshit. &&Well, Clerks 3 is not happening because the Weinstein’s never paid out for Clerks 2. Kevin still wanted to make Clerks 3 despite this, but one of the other main actors refused (because he was never paid for Clerks 2). I think the Weinstein’s essentially “fudged the numbers” in order to not pay out. Kevin said this in a podcast maybe 2 years ago.&&I feel like a lot of people might turn on him, but it will be more due to the face he treated them like shit at one point.&&I've heard tons of hearsay specifically in regards to Blake Lively and Jennifer Lawrence. You never know what's bullshit on the internet, but now I'm wondering...&&I don't think that works the same way since he isn't a French citizen.&&I really can't believe he invoked the holocaust to defend a guy raping a 13 year old.&&Both should be in jail. &&Lots of Hollywood stars defended Roman like Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet &&Scott Rudin is the twin devil. The worse twin. Seriously evil. Physically violent. Actually probably worse than Weinstein.

lol one time he was feuding with Weinstein and sent him buckets and buckets of cigarettes (Harvey had recently quit smoking) but yeah, he's been known to throw phones at interns constantly and even push them out of moving cars. He should be in jail or in a psychiatric institution. &&My dad went to college with him and had the misfortune of needing to deal with his requests for student life funds. He says Weinstein was and is the absolute biggest asshole--he's ever met. And my father went on to work in a very asshole-heavy field with some legendary assholes, so that's saying something. He mentioned that the guy was an absolute pig around women even when he was in college.

It sounds like the dude has been horrible all around, to everyone, in ways both sexual and non, since he was a nobody. Bleh. &&Bryan Singer is pretty fucking sleazy, for one. The funny thing is that if you know anyone in the movie business these are the secrets everyone knows.&&Yeah I was wondering who he pissed off. &&Well, Cosby for one. Also, it's not that easy to take down someone like this and someone with this much power. It takes serious discipline, determination, nerves and luck as a journalist to put together this kind of piece. Hopefully it becomes easier though.&&Jeffrey Epstein's a great example. A billionaire pedophile child sex slaver, who's patrons are the elite the world over.

That dude's walking free.&&No way in hell the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Alicia Vikander come forward and admit they earned their fame through sexual favors. It would certainly do Weinstein in, but it would destroy their careers. Hollywood isn't going to play nice with those that air out the dirty laundry. Judd hasn't really been doing a lot for well over a decade now, so it isn't surprising she is comfortable coming forward.&&It wouldn't be great. What it would do is take the heat off of Weinstein and put the pressure on the women. People would accuse them of being sluts for giving in, especially because there were other women who walked away. Yes, of course they had a choice. However, when you're trapped in a room with a man who's physically stronger than you are who can ruin your career permanently with a snap of his finger, it isn't much of one. People won't see it that way, though.

I mean, even with Cosby, these guys get full careers with celebrity treatment and everything they could ever hope for, and then when they're like 70 it finally catches up with them? Seems like such a waste, and so incredibly frustrating- as long as they're younger and working, the secrets will be kept.

&&A publication writing specifics about Harvey's major abuse of power is a huge milestone though... it shows that rampant sexual deviancy will not go unchecked by the media any longer. &&Someone who tries that hard to present themselves as virteous is practically guaranteed to be a cunt&&You forgot using the biggest shooting in American history to garner sympathy. &&It can be, especially when many of these producers don't have offices in the places where they are when they set the meetings (such as at a film festival). &&That is an excellent question.

You don't say. &&And now he's got the lawyer who helped Hulk Hogan annihilate Gawker helping him sue NYT. Despite his ""apology"", looks like he's gonna double down on the bullshit.&&>Lisa Bloom

The burden of proof is on the victim. It's sad that people don't think of how hard it is to prove rape, and then factor in the deep pockets of Weinstein and the strength of his vast team of lawyers.

But it also marks a shift in how we view sex with regard to power dynamics.

It was almost certainly easier to get on the cover of *Playboy* if you were ""dating"" Hef. &&Proly a great deal, I am sure there are HORDES of young actresses who would willingly make the trade too.

I daresay MANY of them are.  

Most people don't have the slightest idea what real social power does to people.  If their small town co-worker can turn into a ruthless tyrant after being just promoted into a minor managerial position-imagine how much more devious the top dogs (or even top celebrities) in the entertainment industry (or even political world) are?  They don't have the slight power earned in a corporate setting that can be dismissed by being fired at the whim of a boss; they have boatloads of money, social connections, and worldwide fame so that people everywhere they go start treating them like they're untouchable, and they begin to believe that lie all too well.  

Of course, the ones who STAY in power also learn that the world is just as much their boss as they are their audience, so they always keep their outer image impeccably polished.  In press conferences and official news statements they'll say every politically correct thing they need to. They'll appear frlendly and bubbly, just enough for fans and fansites to be deluded into thinking they 'know all about them' and gush about how amazing they are in Youtube comments sections, when in reality they are probably just as selfish as normal people are, probably even worse.  

It is a vicious cycle of them throwing their weight around because the whole world treats them as untouchable, and people surrendering to their behavior because they view them as powerful.  But sometimes -not always- their egos (as well as social conditions) come to a head in a perfect storm of circumstances that bring about their downfall.

This is not just sexually harassing. This is casting couching, groping, and who knows what else. The offers of sex that were turned down are ""sexual harassment"". But many women would have accepted it. It's an abuse of power.&&Well I'm sure he'd still be lowballing on settlement offers to shut up the women he's sexually harassing. 

>An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.

>During that time, after being confronted with allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact, Mr. Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, according to two company officials speaking on the condition of anonymity. Among the recipients, The Times found, were a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and Ms. O’Connor shortly after, according to records and those familiar with the agreements.

.  .  .

>At Fox News, where the conservative icons Roger E. Ailes and Bill O’Reilly were accused of harassment, women have received payouts well into the millions of dollars. But most of the women involved in the Weinstein agreements collected between roughly $80,000 and $150,000, according to people familiar with the negotiations.&&Repeated settlements, complaints and gossip-column pieces didn't work, but suddenly he has a realisation the moment he gets named in the NYT?&&Guessing there worse out there and this is a pure intimidation tactic against other outlets or victims.&&I'm sure he'll be excited to learn that the NYT has never lost a libel suit.&&Props to the Times for the story.

Damn, a humble, sincere apology only makes me like a celeb better!&&I'm a gay dude and despite every straight guy who says fag feeling like it's ok because one gay person in their life said they don't care, most of us kinda do. It's not an inaccurate analogy to compare it to the n-word for gay people. Even when not said hateful, it hurts.   

You're right, that's a good apology. ""I deserve the shit I'm gonna get for it,"" at the end made me chuckle. &&This behavior has been an open secret in Hollywood for a long time. The names of the guys get whispered across drinks at parties, women get warned quietly. 

Open accusations end careers. 

Very few of these rumors are false, sadly
 &&I remember watching interviews with Jennifer Lawrence and feeling uncomfortable the way she kept talking about this ""Harvey"" guy, really gushing and making it sound like they were so close.

Especially if Harvey smokes himself into an early grave.&&I still cannot believe people just looked the other way when that doc came out. I remember listening to a podcast with Bret Easton Ellis saying in a very casual way that everyone knew about his ""boys"". I guess when one of his X men flops we will hear about that again.&&I hope one day an actress who's been through this just says fuck it and comes forward anyway, knowing it'll ruin their career. It'd set a whole new precedent in the industry.&&It would be a huge bombshell if they did though. It could actually change things so other people don't have to go through it. I know it won't happen but I think the public would appreciate the honesty.&&> No way in hell the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Alicia Vikander come forward and admit they earned their fame through sexual favors.

I'm sure even in their mind - not those two specific actresses, because I don't know if those allegations are true, but in the general sense - these actresses manage to convince themselves that that's not the case.

It would be a pretty natural and expected defense mechanism, like the boss's son who thinks he really *is* the best worker in the place or the gorgeous woman who went from secretary to assistant to the CEO and convinces herself it was on talent alone when there were other factors at play beyond just talent and hard work.

And you're VERY right about this:

> Hollywood isn't going to play nice with those that air out the dirty laundry

Between the people in power wanting to protect their power and all the young performers who have been used and don't want the world to know how they got to where they are, you will *very* rarely see someone break ranks and speak out.

Not much different than the thin blue line of cops protecting cops, really. Admit that your colleague is tainted and you have to admit that your whole system is tainted. Few will do that.&&... with Jay Z. The awkward name drop in his statement is a plug for an upcoming project! That's the most arrogant thing I've ever seen. &&Wonderful&&Absolutely agree. This article is awesome.&&[deleted]&&It's pretty common for psychopaths to do this as well iirc. To provide a fake image in order to gain the trust of the local community.&&I actually don't think so. Weinstein's exploits have been an open secret in the industry for decades, but the *New York Times* has little to fear from him. It may just be that something made it possible for the *Times* to move on this now as opposed to earlier (e.g., someone was willing to go on the record and they were able to independently verify the account).

Newsrooms around the world are sitting on some horrifying stuff that can't go live until and unless they can guarantee its accuracy. It's a delicate game, because if you wait too long and don't do enough legwork in the meantime, someone's bound to scoop you (i.e., the *Washington Post* famously beat NBC to the punch on the *Access Hollywood* tape with Trump and Billy Bush, despite NBC's possession of the original footage). However, if you go public with it too early, you're a lot more likely to get caught out by a mistake, and a news organization ultimately lives or dies on its credibility. And there are additional considerations: Are you endangering a source? Could dropping something now be considered an attempt to influence events rather than just reporting on them? If you can prove some things but not others, what's the acceptable threshold for conjecture?

Hollywood, and the entertainment industry more generally, has been long overdue for a reckoning on a wide variety of issues. I wonder what else is sitting in the wings.&&Please for the love of God don't be doing any shady shit, Spielberg.

Which at this point has been sitting just close enough to the heat lamp to thoroughly warm the plate.  The edges of the lettuce are starting to wilt already.

I had a nice talk with a semi-famous actress (lead role on an HBO series) and she opened up on sexual harassment in the industry.

She didn't go into detail, or name names, but she'd been faced with plenty of sexual harassment getting where she was. I made a comment similar in vein that ""you'll never know how bad the problem truly is, not everybody will speak up"", she said ""had I truly made it, I probably wouldn't be bringing it up either"".&&Rose McGowan was one of the first ones to go public, and she's practically disappeared.&&Hollywood isn't known for their morals. Just the entertainment.&&Yep, most likely. Probably tried to screw someone over and they just were not having any of it. Pretty big egos to throw around and quite the power to back it up--just a regular tuesday in Hollywood.&&According the Variety multiple news publications have been trying to put a story together for years but Weinstein held them off with threats of lawsuits. So this has been brewing for a while. &&I'd love for Corey Haim to get some justice. He really deserves it.&&Feldman has named his abuser as they're behind bars, it was Martin Weiss, a talent manager for young kids. He actually named him in 1993 when the LAPD were trying to get dirt on Michael Jackson. On police tape he says Michael had never touched him, that he wasn't like that with him or other kids, and he would tell anyone if he had because he had been sexually abused and named Martin Weiss on the tapes, but the LAPD were so obsessed with Michael they didn't care.

Weinstein's behavior has been a long running open secret.&&[deleted]&&Yeah and Lindsay Lohan called her out on it, sometimes the ramblings of a fallen star hold truth.&&that seems unlikely.

Gretchen Mol, Jennifer Lawrence, Gwynneth Paltrow, Blake Lively. Whenever a beautiful blond girl starts appearing on all the magazines as the 'it' girl, it's one of Harvey's girls. They tend to wear his wife's creations too which is weird. He just pushes them hard on all the public media, and people won't go against Harvey. Though some of them 'hit' and some of them don't.&&I sure hope he gets back together with Ben Affleck some day.&&Red State being the most mainstream-acceptable Kev Smith movies.

(Unless he says he won't make any more movies.)&&The David cho story wow. I remember cho telling that on DVDASA in like 2013 ha. You pulled that one out. I forgot about it. &&Which is a little surprising because Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino are some of the very few people who ever had nice things to say about the Weinsteins. They were notorious for buying up indie and foreign films (particularly Asian) and then savagely cutting them down in an attempt to court a mainstream audience. Or they would just sit on them for years. The Dragon Dynasty imprint was partially launched because of how much damage they had done to their Asian imports in previous releases. Not to mention the popular nickname ""Harvey Scissorhands"" that came about because of his heavy-handed habit of chopping up films.

They weren't shy about putting a lot of pressure on directors that were working for them either. From what I recall Guillermo del Toro was quite upset at how much Bob Weinstein fucked with *Mimic* because he was a frustrated filmmaker and thought he could push around a then small-time director to more or less make the movie himself.&&I wonder if the molestation rumors are being spread just because he lives that lifestyle, or they are true and people dismiss them because they think they are only being spread because he lives that lifestyle.

You're talking about an industry that has defended a literal child rapist in Polanski. This won't happen.&&I do. &&Well Hollywood overwhelmingly supports Polanski so drugging and sodomizing a child is obviously above them.&&Did Polanski mentor a ton of these people perhaps? I wonder what sway he holds over producers in Hollywood.&&And that's *most* of the people in Hollywood. Hollywood is the island of broken toys. So much unspoken sexual misconduct occurs there, and you will get completely blacklisted if you say anything about it.

Remember when Elijah Wood talked about how grateful he was that his mom kept him away from a lot of Hollywood's seedier elements when he was a child actor? Within *24 hours* he had released a canned statement through a publicist saying that he had was being misinterpreted and that he had never seen any abuse in Hollywood.&&SCAD&&Yeah Rose just tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/916030749823852544) not naming him. &&If he's paying women not to report felonies, that brings in bribery and extortion and the felonies themselves and whether she says his name out loud becomes the least of his problems.&&Even Andy Cohen has made disgusted faces when his name comes up on WWHL... Kevin is more than notorious as a predator.&&Could you link me a few? This will be most upsetting.&&Jesus too?

Where does it end?!?!&&Why isn't Snoop Doggy Dogg bangin' at my door?&&Wow what a solid apology.  That's how it's done.  And let's give props to Fallon who was able to pull it back to a bit of humor with the 'coming out' line.

&&thanks for sharing&&That is amazing.&&It's easy for Australians to culturally appropriate when those cultures are more or less non-existant in our country.

Like the time [Harry Conick Jr. called out some guy on Australian TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEtjaZ8ZuNU)
As you can tell by the crowd, they dont really think it was a big deal.&&What parties are you at?&&I worked at the biggest tv producer in my country. I asked them one day over lunch, regarding actors, how much of the tabloid gossip is likely to be bullshit. They chuckled and said: ""Sadly, believe almost all of it. These people are fucking crazy"". Then they told me some hilarious and fucked up anecdotes about some actors (unknown to the rest of the world but big where I live).&&My friend used to work at Weinstein's office and said that when Jennifer Lawrence came in he was openly hitting on her and getting touchy feely with her while her mom was there with her. Seems pretty sleazy but he also said that all this stuff was a open Hollywood secret and that there's so many people who enable this behavior. &&Just searched their names and stumbled on this from 2010. Interesting http://www.pajiba.com/think_pieces/harveys-girls-the-wouldbe-ingenues-where-are-they-now-and-what-happened-then.php&&Depp on polanski:

>“Why now?” Depp asked rhetorically. “Obviously, there is something going on somewhere. Somebody has made a deal with someone. Maybe there was a little money involved, but why now?” Polanski, Depp continued, “is not a predator. He’s 75 or 76 years old. He has got two beautiful kids, he has got a wife that he has been with for a long, long time. He is not out on the street.” &&I doubt it. It would probably just ruin her career and be buried in the news cycle. Patriarchy sucks.&&If he is the only scumbag it would change things but if everyone turns on them behind the scenes. 

Like blacklisting them. Then the message gets out that if this happens to you and you come forward you will be destroyed. 

No one wants to be the sacrifice until your career is dead and your safe. &&It would be a game-changer if they were honest. They could get ahead of the story and possibly kill the slut-shaming angle if they focused on Harvey's harassment. 


Example: *""Harvey is a well-known creep. At that point in my career it was a make-or-break decision - Put up with this creep or possibly crash and burn my life's work. I'm not proud of it and I can't say if my career would be in the same place if I had made another decision. His lecherousness took that power away from me and indulging his harassment was a way for me to take back some of that power.""* &&He just loves cooking, women, old people, children, he'll cook for anyone &&15 seconds would still be a feat, and that's not even counting the repetition if putting out 30 of them in 5-10 minutes. What if Homie Wedge Guy has other salads to make? Like *entree* salads, or, those mother fuckers, *sides* **AND** desserts?&&Not if they have a Chef who's worth a damn manning the pass.  That salad is either run while it's fresh or it is remade.&&Wasn't she in a really bad car accident too? I thought that was why she had to have a lot of reconstructive surgery. &&He's just been really honest about the kinds of stuff his fellow actors tell him. [Here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/movies/elijah-wood-hollywood-child-star-pedophilia.html) is a pretty informative article.&&He exposed the fact hollywood is run by a cult of pedophiles.&&I like to think that they tried to get him to do a guest spot but couldn’t and that lead to the line of Jenna saying something like “who am I kidding, I’ve never met Mickey Rourke.”&&It sort of bugs me that Jenna admits that she's never even met Mickey Rourke.&&More more more! &&I don't know, I feel like I've always heard stories about Harvey being like this.&&Same thing with Big Mouth joke about Bryan Singer directing Paul Bunyan.&&Believe what you want. These balls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's ""Weinsteitutionalized.""&&Oh, please. Everyone in Hollywood knows that Morgan Freeman is a reknowned cock-gobbling slut.&&> I had a nice talk with a semi-famous actress (lead role on an HBO series) and she opened up on sexual harassment in the industry.

Hmmm I know a series regular on an HBO show who tells a story: she was a (underage) teen actress and also a fangirl of a certain hit supernatural teen drama TV show in the late 90s/early 2000s. She got personally invited to party with the creator of the show, where she got a lot of unwanted attention from him.&&> she said ""had I truly made it, I probably wouldn't be bringing it up either"".

Holy shit...&&That's what I imagine happen to a lot of rich and powerful guys like Weinstein. They just fuck around too much and get outed.&&Corruption seems to exist everywhere there's power. I bet Washington is even worse, because they're friends with people in all levels of law enforcement (who are themselves corrupt as well).&&True. Not rumors. He got her on the cover of Vanity Fair in the 90s when she was *no one.*&&IIRC from old blind gossip, Mol did get to the top for a short time due to Weinstein, but pissed him off somehow (maybe rejected him?) and that was why her fame was so short-lived.&&She looks like a cross between Kate Moss and Kate Hudson.&&She was solid in boardwalk empire so I'll still stand by the fact she has talent. &&harvey just following in the long storied history of bigshot hollywood producer/director being a total sleazeball and forcing young impressionable wannabes to give him a quid pro quo.

sad but it's been a way of life for some female actors since the earliest days.&&source?&&Might explain the dead-behind-the-eyes look she had.&&No wonder Lindsey Lohan was salty about her getting the juicy roles.&&It's all part of Harvey and Georgina's business arrangement.....ooop, I mean 'marriage.' ;)&&Paltrow was descended from Hollywood royalty. She just got her career the old fashioned way: nepotism. &&how about margot robbie? &&You know now that you've said this, automatically half the people who read your comment will unquestioningly believe that those actresses slept their way to the top. Doesn't matter that you didn't include any proof, and your whole statement rests on rumours and speculation. Clearly Harvey Weinstein is guilty of these acts but you've just rattled off a few names of actresses and said 'its obvious... they're one of Harvey's girls' Really what you've just done is no better than what all those gossip sites do. &&Well there has always been a rumor he promised Gwyneth Paltrow she would do a heavy push for an Oscar for her role in *Shakespeare in Love* (which she ended up winning) in exchange for a blow job.  &&Isn't Gwyneth Paltrow Spielberg's god-daughter? And her dad was a big Hollywood producer. And her mom in Blythe Danner. 


&&If by 'obvious' you mean 'totally unsubstantiated and almost certainly unverifiable', then yes.

Of course it's possible, even likely, that some of those actresses and other famous ones have done these kind of things. But it's also the kind of salacious story that sells copies and drives clicks and therefore one that publications have every incentive to push. It's also pretty likely that some beautiful blond girls would become famous anyway.

We have no idea, in short. I don't understand why people feel the need to be so ""in the know"".&&I'm sure it starts decades before the Coreys&&Any source? Ive heard about Elijah Wood and and Corey Feldman being very vocal about this, but never heard about RDJ.

Don't know anything else. &&Exactly, just like we wouldnt allow a registered sex offender to live near a school or be a teacher.

But when the whole cinema business is full of creeps how do you say one creep sucks and the other do not? You have to have a joint coming out for the whole industry.

It really got me down, and still does. These kids pour their lives and their souls into getting a big, meaningful role.

I found [this](http://www.ibtimes.com/jennifer-lawrence-fake-allegedly-sleeps-around-get-film-roles-says-lindsay-lohan-1575968), but it says in that article the original interview was ""fake"". So I don't know.

Edit: Went a bit [deeper](http://starcasm.net/archives/269513). She claimed afterwards her answers were in an email interview and were fabricated.

The actual interview doesn't appear to be online (old URL is gone and new one doesn't have anything written about LL).&&https://www.ibtimes.com/jennifer-lawrence-fake-allegedly-sleeps-around-get-film-roles-says-lindsay-lohan-1575968

&&Yeah people like Harvey Weinstein were probably blowing up his phone telling him he'd never work in Hollywood again.&&Oy. Vey.&&That is what a real apology does. Half the time Publicists take over and it turns in to a blank statement that doesn't really do anything to settle things. Kramer apologized but nobody gave two shits because it wasn't good enough. Humility without understanding does nothing.&&[deleted]&&Wrong supernatural drama&&And Sienna Miller. (Allegedly)

Gwyneth Paltrow has talked about an unnamed exec who wanted to sleep with her.  That could be Harvey. 

Now Ashley Judd is outright saying she rejected his advances. If he was brazen enough to try that with her, he definitely had some previous success with other actresses.&&Olivia Wilde too. When he got busted a few years ago trying to get someone (non-famous) into a threesome he said it would be with Olivia Wilde. Of course, no proof he'd run this by Olivia, but...&&I have a feeling mischa barton too.&&Gotta be. He put Mol in that Damon movie *Rounders* out of nowhere and everyone in Hollywood was like ""Who?"" and then on the cover of Vanity Fair. And she kept it up. Probably how she got in ""Boardwalk Empire.""

A few years ago, a journalist tried to ask her about Weinstein and she got really mad.

EDIT: Just read she got a part in a new Weinstein movie for agreeing to continue keeping her mouth shut with all this going on:

http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/10/blind-item-9-directors-wife-returns.html

It's about Mol, the movie ""Yellowstone,"" and Kevin Costner.&&And unlike most industries where quitting and finding a new job is merely difficult, if you're an up-and-coming actress who pisses off someone as powerful as Weinstein there goes your chance at being a professional actress forever -- and he knows it. It's absolutely sick.&&'I, Tonya' seems to be a pretty good sign of things to come for Robbie if the early buzz is to be believed.&&lol I remember Martin scorcese was called a 'creep' in the Sony hack emails&&And people either don't want to believe or don't know or remember that numerous former child stars, from Corey Haim and Corey Feldman to Elijah Wood, have come forward about the fact that the casting couch also applies to children! Hollywood is just plain fucking sick!&&I feel like he was broken up about it, people just felt too betrayed &&It is in plain sight but I wouldn't call it explicit. I think if you didn't know the rumor, it would be easier to assume Tracy is just being Tracy and talking nonsense, than to be like, ""I guess America's loveable Father Figure is a notorious rapist?"" &&Yeah, Ashley Judd's claim is pretty damning, because her parents and sister were already famous. She wasn't just some kid from Indiana that was desperate for a role, so if he was pulling that shit with her it was probably a common occurrence.&&Sigh, why the fuck would anybody want to be an actor?

Children get fucked.  Women get raped.  I'm sure the men get fucked in a different way, or maybe that sort of thing is buried so deep that we haven't seen that out in the open yet.&&She basically vanished for a while after her It Girl push fizzled out.  Getting Boardwalk Empire was her comeback, and I don't think he was involved with that.  I seem to recall her saying she had bad experiences in her early career and considered quitting.&&IMO I believe his entire tirade was an attempt at shock comedy to kinda silence the crowd but he didn't realize who he had become as Kramer and his set up just didn't work. Like at all. 

This is why you saw Jerry stick with him following because I think he knew it too. That Kramer got heckled and tried to kill the interruptions with something crazy and off the wall. If he had come out on Letterman and said ""I don't know who I am as a comedian anymore and I said some things that just looking at myself in this moment, I realize I don't even know where it came from but it wasn't a place of laughter even if I stupidly wanted it to be. I'm sorry to the people in the audience as the didn't deserve that and neither does anyone else for that matter."" he wouldn't have pissed everything he had away. He would have had something other than apologizing for getting caught.

I say all this only from watching the clip, the apology and hearing how he expected to go back up on stage for his other set before someone told him to go home.&&I can say when I first heard Tracy rant I was like oh Tracy.  Them the accusations come out and I was like wow that has meaning.  Real meaning. Crazy&&How Norm McDonald could call OJ a murderer on Weekend Update and it be OK with legal department- he always started it with, ""And now the fake news""&&[deleted]&&Paltrow is Spielberg's god-daughter. Assuming she meant him too, ya, that says a lot. &&Maybe, but it was produced by Scorsese and he produced a number of  Scorsese movies. Weinstein has enormous influence.&&I watched all of 30 Rock in a few days before it went off Netflix. When I saw that, I just assumed it was around when the Cosby shit hit the fan. Did that predate all the very public Cosby stuff?&&",2017-10-05 14:08:13
Channing Tatum Pulls ‘Forgive Me’ Film Project From The Weinstein Co.,28684,77a3r6,http://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-forgive-me-project-the-weinstein-co-1202190707/,1259,1508364644.0,,"This was going to be Channing Tatum's directorial debut.

**From the article:**

The actor and producer took to social media to announce that he has pulled his Project 'Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock' — a story dealing with the issue of sexual abuse — from TWC and will not work with the company on any future endeavors.&&Everything  I learn about this guy makes me like him more.&&Good thing the movie came with a built in apology.&&TWC's days are numbered, right? Especially now with the allegations about Bob Weinstein too.  I don't know how it keeps going. &&Weinstein had a lot of balls to pick up a movie about sexual abuse in the first place. I hope he rots in hell.&&-Channing Tatum has marked himself safe from Harvey Weinstein-&&The movie was about sexual abuse so I think he made the right call. 

Although i have to say, that was going to be his first movie as director so I'm sure pulling the plug was not easy.&&[deleted]&&'An eruption of huarrumphs from the gentlemen and gasps from the ladies rang out. After the ladies smoothed their petticoats and the men replaced their fallen monocles, a decision to part ways with Monsieur Weinstein was quickly reached. 

It was appalling that a man of W.'s heretofore unimpeachable character and impeccable standing could be tarnished by so base an accusation. Not a soul involved in the enterprise had heard even a whisper of M. Weinstein being involved in anything untoward.

 Prior to this incident, M. Weinstein had been a paragon of virtue with a reputation of being pure as the driven snow. But even now, as the shadow of his monstrous deeds blackened the once-virginal fields of this formerly pristine man, many in the production company secretly held doubts. How could someone so upright be brought so low and no one - not a one of them - had ever heard anything of such terrible deeds. Had they known - had anyone known - they would have never entered into a business relationship with such a rake as M. Weinstein.'

Fin.&&Won't be the first time someone tried to pull away from a Weinstein.&&We're doing post work for a weinstein co. Show at work right now. Everyone is a little conflicted about it. &&Yeah, it’ll go to another production company that has “Definitely 100% never sexually harassed/assaulted/abused any actors/actresses I swear for realsies don’t listen to the rumours.”&&I hate to say it, but this dogpiling on the Weinsteins seems too little too late. They ALL knew what was going on and were to scared to say something.  

Its like watching a rape occur and doing nothing because he's your boss 

Corey Feldman said it years ago and the best he got was a talking down to by Barbra Walters&&Now go lose some weight to prepare for Gambit role Channing&&Can't say I blame him.... talk about the potential of being a big flop & hurting your career&&All these actors who know this shit happens covering their asses more as we break open Hollywood. &&This may be off topic but remember when trump said the press was our greatest enemy? What is happening right now to the weinsteins is because some journalists took them to task. We didn't listen to the stories from the victims, which was wrong, but at least now something may be changing. The press is our last line of defense sometimes.&&He knew what Weinstein was doing before, everyone did. I'm pulling it now it's just b******* posturing&&I hate that people are now taking a stand against this creep not because it's the right thing to do but because they are just jumping on the bandwagon. They all knew this guy was a piece of shit but never said anything in fear of losing their career. &&Yea he didn’t wanna gamble his career. Good move on his part. &&all therse mother fuckers knew exactly what he was doing, they just doing this now because the world knows or else my black arse he would pull the film.Just like they knew about child abuse, its systemic. &&Cool but didn't he know the rumors before the outing? True morality is doing while no one else is watching.&&The thing about this though, is it's a blatant PR excersize. Don't get me wrong, I like watching Tatum, but this move if anything simply indicates that he and his associates are aware that the Weinstein company's reputation has just fallen through the floor - doing any work with them, let alone a film which deals with sexual abuse, is likely to generate negative publicity.

The thing about it, is that people in Hollywood have known
 about Weinstein's behaviour for a very long time. I cannot believe that Channing Tatum has just discovered what's been going on. He knew about the guy before, the difference now is that the world knows. Naturally he doesn't want a public association with them now. 

Are we really meant to believe that this reaction is due to him just realizing right now that Weinstein is a creep? &&Huh interesting. Looks like Weinstein being outed is creating a power vacuum, one where people can openly defect from the most powerful force in Hollywood and try to fill the vacuum themselves. The politics of Hollywood must be going insane right now&&Everyone acting like this is such a noble cause. He is only doing this because of the bad press twc is getting right now. Dont tell he he didnt know about weinsteins behaviour until this scandal erupted. He knew.&&The REAL test here would be: if CT had found out about HW without *any* public knowledge, would he have done the same thing?

My guess: HELL no.

Let's not heap adulation onto someone just because we have some perspective after the fact.&&how stupid.

Hollywood knew about this all along.

they are only doing this to pretend they care&&Oh that's just great. NOW pull out your films from Weinstein Co. Now act like you give a shit and you're just ""so horrified."" Hollywood fucking sucks sometimes. &&thats smart. also im still waiting for his gambit movie to happen&&Yeah I'd wager a million bucks that this wouldn't have happened if Weinstein wasn't just outed. Nothing noble about abandoning a sinking ship. &&Everyone loves to push against a falling wall.&&I'm sorry but, if Harvey hadn't been outed by a community that knew he was doing that shit, he'd still be making this movie. I feel like people knew this shit was going on, but can now act like their some morally-guided angel. Fuck all that.&&I feel bad for Scarlett Johansson.

Between Joss Whedon cheating on his wife with his TV/film actresses, and Harvey?  Poor woman was a pinball, when all she wanted was to go to work in peace.&&Can't help but feel that he's just cutting his losses, rather than doing the right thing.&&Yes this is a fairly important conversation.  Did his company know? 

Even though his brother who is on the board claims he is estranged from Harvey.  Also did the board authorise the money which was allegedly used to fund haves extra curriculum sexual activities but also the huge payouts to the women he silenced.

If they didn't know and the funds were misrepresented...then I believe Harvey committed a serious crime.  If they did know then they condoned xriminal behaviour and actively enabled a sick man rather than helping or stopping him.

Either way the look incompetent and unprofessional and likely criminal to outsiders and for these reasons the directors should conaider stepping down or the company being dissolved imo.&&""I am against the Weinstiens now because its good for my career""

&&He'll just take it to some other hollywood pedo ring.&&I kind of get the sentiment but isn't Weinstein completely ostracized from his own company now?&&I’m sure he knew about Harvey’s abuse long ago and kept silent, fuck this guy &&Everyone seemed to know Weinstein was a sexual predator before the ""scandal"" started.  Why should I be impressed with anyone shunning him now when they were more than happy to work with him a month ago?&&Plot twist: Channing Tatum's role in This Is The End was inspired by an encounter with Harvey Weinstein.&&Weinstein was booted so what does it matter now?&&So... did Channing Tatum not know about this before? Or did he know about this and not care until it went public (i.e., poor PR for Tatum himself)?&&Another Hollywood hypocrite. No one should lecture on morality. Hollywood should never lecture us on morality. Ever.

These allegations were floating around for decades. They were precisely that, allegations which were unproven. Channing had no problem starring in Weinstein's hateful eight. But now Channing is acting like he's above working with Weinstein? Hollywood actors are only speaking against Weinstein and reneging from Weinstein projects because TWC isn't profitable and Weinstein can't get them prestigious accolades and oscars anymore. If Weinstein was still Hollywood's most powerful, then none of these celebs would care about unproven allegations. They immediately spoke against the unproven accusations against trump but stayed silent when it came to unproven accusations against Weinstein until he was fired. 

It's the same thing with Brad Pitt. 

He claims that he threatened Weinstein after gwynnie was pressured to sleep with Weinstein, but still did inglorious basterds and killing them softly. Money talks. Brad's greedy. He didn't need the money but he wanted more. He should not have lectured people on Weinstein when he financially benefited from TWC. BTW, brad pitt allegedly dated 15 year old actress shalane mccall when brad was 24. Are people going to run with those allegations even if they're unproven? http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/98016202.html has pictures of them posing for photographers at Hollywood parties/events looking very comfortable with each other. Pitt allegedly dated 17 year old Christina applegate when he was 25 and dated emancipated 16 year old Juliette Lewis when he was 26.

But brad is calling out Weinstein?

Meryl is even worse. 

She makes a GG speech bashing trump partly because of the allegations agains trump. But she called Weinstein a ""god,"" got an oscar for Weinstein film the Iron Lady and nominations for Weinstein film august osage county. She was silent about the allegations against Weinstein because money, fame, prestige and critical praise were more significant to her. Hollywood is silent against unproven accusations when it affects the money, fame, prestige and critical praise they can get. Hollywood treats unproven accusations as facts when it's someone like trump, who can't give them movie roles, money, fame, prestige and critical praise.&&[deleted]&&Why not sooner&&Buuuut... Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the company already, right? &&Forgiveness denied.&&WOW, what a chivalrous man!!

He's not riding the hype at all!!

I am just so disgusted with everyone who is jumping ships now. I mean where the hell were you living and working all your lives.&&Channing pulled out but we all know Harvey Weinstein's dad was the one who should have pulled out&&So he pulled the project? So he can still make it elsewhere? I hope so it sounds like a fascinating movie. &&Much brave. Such wow.&&But doesnt this sound a little like bullshit? It now sounds like everyone knew weinstein and others were known pieces of shit back to 2006 at least. 

Now that its public its a PR move to distance yourself. But when it was just ""rumors"" it was fine to cosy up ?. I mean i get it. People are cowards. But to now pretend to act righteous seems fitting for hollywood but sickening in every way.&&ITT: lots of people impressed by a lot of empty gestures, as long as the person doing it is a ""good guy.""&&It doesn't take a lot of courage to leave after, it would of been courageous if he had actually never gone to them in the first place. You don't get points for this sort of thing. Not like everyone didn't know anyway, it was literally in Weinsteins contract with his company. &&Good on Jeff's part.&&He doesn't work there now all your doing now is punishing the people who work there for something they didn't do, it's like not listening to showaddywaddy because Jimmy's Saville referenced them&&Hollywood = Pedo-crats &&Didn't that company drop Weinstein too though? Makes no sense to pull it out besides PR&&Fuck your video ad pop up.&&This year's Oscars should be interesting...I just hope they don't mess up like last year and say something crazy like...

""And the winner is... Harvey Weinstein""&&I do hope this film gets made, it's a great book and I'd love to see it. I give major props to Channing Tatum though! &&""Forgive me"". Words you'll never hear come from Harvey Weinstein.&&I won't claim to know much about the goings-on in Hollywood, but I feel like this snowball needs to keep rolling until all the ""younger"" and more respectable players hold control.

Everyone in Hollywood knew this was going on, and none of them did anything until it came out. Now they are all acting offended and shocked. Fuck the fuck off.&&Good! Why the fuck is he trying to direct another project while Gambit hasn't even gotten proper treatment?
&&PR is a hell of a drug. &&[deleted]&&Meh he wouldn’t be doing this if it was his first film and he wasn’t rich&&He knew what he signed up for.&&He did that to avoid hysterical condemnation from the public. I'm sure he is a great guy, but chances are that he knew who Harvey was when he made the fucking deal. &&😂 of course

Gotta keep that image right

Fuck all these people. They all knew. And right now he's just going to change to some other production company equally ripe with power hungry wolfs praying on the weak - AND HE WILL KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUTH.

Harvey Weinstien?

He doesn't seem that great.&&Yup. He seems a genuinely good person. And after seeing him in Foxcatcher, the guy has serious acting chops. &&Yet another Hollywood hypocrite.  &&This was a practical decision, not because he's some towering, incandescent beacon of morality and goodness.

I have been watching Comrade Detective and loving it, completely surprised he would be attached to it. &&Well done...well done my friend. &&The company will change its name soon real soon.

I mean, look at our president for Christ's sake. He admitted to this behavior on tape.&&#NotMe&&I feel like this was just a smart PR move. It hasn't really been a big secret in Hollywood about Weinstein'a activity... it just hasn't been a ""social issue""* until now. I'm sure Tatum knew about this behavior, but was still on board to work under that brand. But, now that is in the limelight, he needs to save face quick. Just my opinion though


* when I say ""social issue"", I'm not trying to belittle the horrible acts. I'm just saying it has been going on for decades, and only now serious light is being shed on it, despite jokes being made in various interviews, talk shows, sitcoms, etc over the years. It's shameful. &&
*Next week: Channing Tatum Pulls!*&&The article reads like TWC owns the rights to the movie adaptation, so it's probably not going to see production anytime soon.&&The Right and Honorable Sir Tatum D.V.D.P. was at the center of the maelstrom and, as the scandal blossomed,  he was drawn further into the gyre. In short, he was vexed. 


He recalled how, at the lycee where he took drama, students had whispered reverently of 'The White Whale', as he was affectionately called. The man's preternatural ability to find hidden talent and help the rise of their stars, as well as his uncanny business acumen were legendary. 

This was to have been his debut as a director, a chance to prove that he was more than just a decorated soldier and accomplished dueler, but also a man of artistic sensibilities. Instead of bathing in the applause of an enraptured audience though, he had no choice but to act firmly in this matter. The Atheneaum had already severed ties with this jackanape and there was talk the Rapscallion Players would soon follow suit. He must do the same. Sir Tatum could not in good conscience allow his partnership with M.W. to continue, to allow his name to be spoken of in the same sentences as W.'s in the salons and gentleman's clubs. No, what W. had done was beyond the pale. 


How he longed to speak with W. but the man had, no doubt retreated to one of his many manses. From sumptuous hunting lodges to the usual chateau and pied  a terre's among the fashionable capitals, from his oceanside retreats on the coast to his sprawling estate with its huge tracts of land, there was no way to know where he was the man was. He uncorked his vial of ink, grasped his quill, and began penning a letter of rebuke with disdain.

Later, as Sir Tatum 's  manservant Blitheleysworth delivered his letter to the society editor, he brooded. Had he erred by choosing theater? Had the once-noble brotherhood of thespians been dealt a deathblow? There was Herr Polanski, the Prussian auteur, who had become entangled with some tart well below his years, though to be fair, the man still had admirers. Not even the lowest guttersnipes and urchins had kind words for William of Cosby however, another man whose peccadillo's brought ruin.  There was the Italian  Viscount Don Vito, the American upstart Woodrow Allens...was there no end to the debasement some of his fellow gentlemen would stoop to?

He must preserve his reputation. Yes, he brooded, he had acted correctly and with  all proper haste.

No, it's like hearing from a coworker that your boss sexually assaulted someone and not quitting your job.

Would you quit your job in that case?&&Doesn't matter. Better late than never. Plus it's probably helped millions more who have learned their cry for help can actually be effective. This is the type of public space we need to encourage.&&It might be too late for the many women and men who have been victimized but it's not too late to prevent future attacks. &&[deleted]&&The media is our greatest enemy and our greatest ally.&&Alas, that's typical of collective human behaviour. So many people can't really think for themselves until the masses accept the narrative. It's like homophobia and racism - Everybody's quick to call others racist or homophobic these days, but only a few decades ago there were few people speaking out. I'm 40, and when I was at school the worst thing you could be called was gay. 

I myself got called a 'homo' for not ostracising the one gay guy in my year.  Nowadays it's become the norm to accept anyone's sexuality, and a raised eyebrow when an 8-year-old sexually identifies as a trans-gender (currently happening in my old school), is immediately condemned as transphobic.

Off topic, I know, but the point I'm making is that it takes a lot of people to change the tide, and when it does change you usually end up with a tsunami. 

&&Yeah. Its PR now. &&It also sounds like he's trying to capitolize on the situation to get buzz about his movie.  &&Or because they don't fear being blacklisted anymore&&[deleted]&&>Everyone seemed to know Weinstein was a sexual predator before the ""scandal"" started.

""Everyone *seemed* to know"" that's why. There's a lot of people on Reddit claiming everyone knew. Not that many people claiming they knew though. &&I think there's a big difference between ""knowing Weinstein was a sexual predator"" and having heard some rumors of him being a creep, which was more likely what was the typical public knowledge in Hollywood.

And as unfortunate as it is, people kinda tend to overlook a lot of stuff, because they might not like what they find if they dig deeper. I'm sure you've too at some point been in a situation where you probably should've checked if everything's OK with someone or something, but you've just gone on with your own life thinking it's none of your business.&&I am confused.

He's become the scapegoat for something in hollywood that hundreds of producers and directors are probably guilty of. I don't want to say I feel sorry for him because he's clearly guilty as shit, but it sure sucks to be 'the guy' that represents an entirely corrupt industry and be laughably blamed by the entire world.

&&[deleted]&&Agreed. Doesn't take much to condemn Weinstein once you know he can no longer impact your career.

Not that he's not a good actor but that Gambit haa a lot of nuance and tics that I'm not sure Tatum's up to. 

If I don't need subtitles for Gambit's Creole, you did it wrong. &&I'm pretty sure Tatum is the only thing holding that project together at this point.  Honestly I think he's the only reason that project was every a thing in the first place.  This is pretty much how I think it got started:

Fox: ""Hey Channing we'd like to do a movie with you in the staring role.  Here are some scripts we'd like you to look...""

Tatum: ""I want to plan Gambit.""

Fox: ""Well we actually have most our X-men movies plotted out for the next few years.  Maybe you'd be interested in one of these other franchises.""

Tatum: ""I don't really care about that stuff.  I just want to play Gambit.""

Fox: ""Well maybe we could make room for you in the X-men movies, but Gambit isn't the most well known character.  Maybe you could play someone els...""

Tatum: ""No, I'm playing Gambit""

Fox: ""You know what?  Sure whatever.  Be Gambit.""&&true....well said&&Yeah, because building buzz for a shelved movie with no guarantee of release is a great business model. Y'all need to stop being so cynical. Just because it benefits him doesn't mean its a selfish stunt. &&This is hollywood, all about PR.&&screw the jerks downvoting this.  Channing was doing what he felt was right, and it wasn’t an easy thing to do. &&There is apparently no winning with PsychoKam, lol.&&No, of course not, but this isnt my issue really.

> the actor and producer took to social media to announce that he has pulled his project

This is my issue. He became a hypocrite the moment he went to social media and announced that he is quitting the company. It's like it just dawned on him right now, that this guy is bad.

I knew since I was a child that Hollywood is a bad place, and I didnt live there or even visited the US in my life. How can someone be in the business and accept to work with those people? How can this someone calls it quit, only after the bad guy gets exposed, and he expects to be applauded for his decision.&&Not only could careers be destroyed, but you could also be hit with a big fat lawsuit. Yes, actors and actresses are rich, but there's even more powerful people behind the scenes.  Instead of looking down on those speaking out, maybe we should instead put the blame on those who actually committed the crime? &&But he's soo hootttttttt he can do no wrong. The sheep will beleive anything and do/think anything to pat themselves on the back.&&I'm pretty sure most people in Hollywood were aware of the Harvey Weinstein rumours, and just like everyone else that's worked with him for the past 30 years, there's an above average chance that Tatum would also have heard of them &&Sounds like he is the producer on this; he is probably looking to set it up elsewhere. He's doing Gambit for Fox, so Fox Searchlight could very well pick this up as a favor.&&[deleted]&&He didn’t pull out because it’s a “sinking ship,” he pulled out because he doesn’t want to be associated with Hw.&&I can't imagine any other studios wouldn't want to work with him on it.

It's a relevant topic of today's culture, a great man heading it up and more.

Scandal aside, TWC was known for good productions, so that should be a good indicator that his project is worth it.

Respect for Mr. Tatum increased.&&Success is worthless if it costs you your integrity. Tatam has shown real strength here. &&What bothers me is that Weinstein has been a sinking ship for a long time. I asked someone this.. 

Why have careers been ruined in the past? If someone has the guts to speak out, why are they just blacklisted and can't find work again? That to me speaks volumes that I can't really comprehend. Or I would rather not think about it. So the saying 'You will not work in this town again'.. is actually true? This bullying culture?

If an actor/actress is good at their job then they shouldn't be judged for having a strong opinion. Dare I say it, showing that they have a moral compass. Thats the good people in life, thats people that you hire and support. Too late for a few that did speak out, it's not right.

I don't know much, I am just really disappointed.&&There are plenty of people who would have continued anyways. got to give him props&&You call it PR nightmare, some people look at it as milking a recent controversy for publicity &&What did he say??&&I mean his behavior is monstrous so zero sympathy even if he's getting an outsized amount of criticism and consequences. But yeah, he's not the only one. This could go fifty fifty, but now that this shit has been proven, it gives more credibility to accusers of other gross men in power, and may at least lead to some sort of change. &&Yeah, but it's not like Weinstein's actions are just coming to light now.  Everyone in the industry knows how much of a piece of shit he is.  For Tatum to jump ship *now* just shows this is more about Weinstein's bad press and has nothing to do with any convictions Tatum may have regarding Weinstein's behaviour.  &&THANK YOU. This is the true measure of CT's character. As it stands, this is a no-brainer as a director/actor.&&> I'm sorry but that's this is a practical business decision not a matter of Tatum going with his morals.

https://imgur.com/c7NJRa2&&It's entirely possible he's been focused on this project and others and hasn't absorbed every rumour in Hollywood. And when news got to him, he did the right thing.&&How is this not also virtue signaling? 

This was an open fucking secret. He only moved the project once everything blew up and it was bad for business. 

No one in their right mind would say with that company after this its career suicide. 

They just also get to package it as ""taking a stand"".

But against what? Harvey's already been outed hasn't he? You're gonna take a stand and not support it after he's already been removed from that power?

their 6 Days To Air seems like 22 hours now.&&[deleted]&&he did before this ""news"" came out though... you dont think he knew beforehand?..&&I wonder who owns the rights to the movie though, since it's an adaptation of a book...&&A lot of these sexual abuse cases happened when the actresses were still early in their careers.  While there might be grumblings of sexual abuse here and there, you don't hear about a lot of full blown cases.  So something might happen to you right before you break it big... now you've worked your whole life for this.  Do you speak out against it and ruin what you've worked for?  You don't really hear others saying anything, so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal?  Or maybe you do speak out about it and now you're just some young, fame-hungry wannabe actress making accusations against some big Hollywood exec because you didn't get a part.  

Now more famous actresses?  They have more sway and ability to withstand the storm, but even they aren't bulletproof.  They're often also past the point in their career where they're victimized *as much*, so maybe they try to put the past behind them or look back and think they made a bigger deal out of it than it really was or something like that.  

Either way, whenever it comes to sexual abuse it's a sickening and uncomfortable subject that's hard for most people to talk about.  &&An obscure director might because it wouldn't affect his longterm career since nobody would remember his name anyway. Channing Tatum is a known name. He simply cannot afford to be attached to Harvey or that company because he would become emblematic of Hollywood greed and amorality. Especially with a project of this nature. 

Plus I guarantee you that Fox would have something to say about one of their signed superheroes bathing in that Weinstein mess and tainting their brand with it. I would give him props if he had done this before it became clear that it was the only move available to him but nope, he played the wait and see game. It doesn't get more business than that.&&Are there though, I feel like anyone directing a film about sexual abuse realizes that the bad press coming out of this would of killed the film. It's not hard to imagine the headlines the press would make close to release and with this move he's probably going to get the project picked up pretty easily just because it's an incredibly hot topic and very marketable right now and he get's a lot of good pr just by leaving when it is also the best choice to make the most profit. It's really a win win for him unless he's unable to get the film picked up by another studio which seems unlikely.&&and those people who continued would have been boycotted? Doesn't make good financial sense. It's smart business not a heroic act.&&Paraphrasing: He called Harvey a monster, and essentially a rapist, and lamented that he just wanted to make movies, but fuck his career and movies... to him they weren’t worth any number of women being abused. He also said he isn’t the victim here, but that he never saw “this” Harvey and feels lied to, and like all his work is tainted and he is complicit because he used to talk the guy up in his spoken word shows (perhaps wondering how many people he lead into this abuser’s reach). 

He looked at Harvey as a father figure and hero, and claims to feel betrayed. He claims to have been ignorant about this (which, when you feel you know someone well and look up to them, I’ll admit you can be blinded to their secrets and dismiss rumors as just people being petty). It’s also Hollywood where abuse has been known and common since the 40s or earlier, and so likely easy to be jaded about this after a few years in the biz (and with dudes like Polanski, Bryan Singer, etc). “Casting couch” as a phrase exists for a reason. It’s real. 

Due to the taint on his movies, Kevin is declining all residuals and will donate that money plus $2000/mo until he dies to Women in Film (as he believes, likely incorrectly, that all TWC and Miramax films will become unsellable and residuals will dry up). He says he can’t give all the money back because he doesn’t have money from 20 years ago. 

But yeah, his words about Harvey were savage, and unless the man is a lying psychopath or sociopath... he sounded genuine in his empathy for the abused women, and the taint he believes is on all of his work with Weinstein. &&https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/Entertainment/kevin-smith-donate-residuals-weinstein-produced-films-women/story%3fid=50572253&&Something pretty, pretty, pretty bold.&&[deleted]&&In some ways, this scandal leads directly from the Cosby scandal. The aura of invincibility that they operated under is slowly but surely cracking. This is not the end; there will be more.&&Two weeks ago it was clear that Harvey is a shit and shouldn't be in the industry much less attached to a movie about sexual assault. Two weeks ago it was *not* clear if he would be able to ride his power to a quick comeback ala Polanski or if the company would escape unscathed. 

Guess which ones changed in the last week. That's right, that neither Harvey nor the company will survive the fallout. And that it is toxic to be attached to either right now. And now that this is set in stone now, Channing Tatum ambles along to do the only thing a star of his calibre can afford to do now - jump ship.  No backbone here, it's just business. &&I agree - he only ditched his movie after shit blew up. What’s fucked is that the Tatum (along with the rest of Hollywood) likely already knew about Weinstein’s awful actions, yet continued to work with him anyways before he blew up. I’m not saying Tatum doesn’t deserve any props, it’s just that it’d be a lot more meaningful if he chose to do ditch the movie earlier.&&You lose all credibility when you go to the absolute worst of the recent trendy and empty psychology terms like virtue signalling.

We had a teacher get fired in the middle of the semester my freshman year...everyone said it was because he was caught having sex with a student. Yet that shit never hit the news, which it would have, so I didn't believe it. I just thought it was people talking. I think it's easy to assume some people may have viewed it like that. I'm sure there are quite a few people that are just trying to save face and they knew all along, but I don't think everyone did. &&Rumors are rumors, and in the world of Hollywood you hear a lot of them. Hell, the public see's a lot of rumors in tabloids and shit all the time. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt to many of these people because rumors and accusations that serious can be hard to believe at times. Not excusing those who are still on weinsteins side, but I can understand celebrities not knowing that this was happening. &&Kevin Smith is likely a good example. He idolized the guy and probably dismissed the rumors because Harvey was always great to him, and Hollywood can be catty. 

Likely Harvey played it all off as well,  person like this is clearly a skilled manipulator. 

Harvey put on a big show in Hollywood to be a supporter of women.

Roman Polanski is a rapist who drugged and raped a 13 year old, and he also directed some movies. He is currently wanted in the USA for his crimes and has evaded justice by remaining outside the country.

They are a specialty distributor like the Weinstein Company, so it would be a good fit for the project. Fox locks him in with Gambit by doing that, and then he gets to make his directorial debut after that wraps.

If a year ago the only studio interested in doing this was Weinstein and he decided to not make it right now because he wouldn't work with Weinstein... all the props in the world for that. Backing out now, when the film is dead anyway.... bullshit.

All I see is a guy who was happy to make this film with Weinstein when the public outrage wasn't there who backed out when it was better for him to do so after the public outrage over him. 

I mean most of hollywood has done the same, worked with a monster for the benefit of their careers. Tatum isn't the worst guy in the world, I'm just not giving anyone extra credit for distancing themselves from Weinstein when it's the only option left for anyone now.

I also don't hate people for working with Weinstein, he was a cancer in hollywood(and there are many more) that could hurt your career for no reason at all. But this fawning around over people who are only now backing away from him is doing my nut in.&&It really pisses me off when people think things like this are part of making some fantastic moral stand.   

The very idea that a film concerning sexual abuse could ever have been successfuly released through a company so tainted by sexual abuse is laughable, it would have been box office poison.  

&&Bryan Singer? 

Edit:
Kevin Smith has a good heart, but if he feels shame he should maybe just take his money and make a good movie with good actresses.&&I think smith is overreacting. I don’t fault him for the things Weinstein has done.

I personally find it credible to think Smith might have not realized the extent and truthfulness of rumors. On some level one wants to think well of a friend.&&> He looked at Harvey as a father figure and hero, and claims to feel betrayed. He claims to have been ignorant about this (which, when you feel you know someone well and look up to them, I’ll admit you can be blinded to their secrets and dismiss rumors as just people being petty).

It’s real.

Could also be that he didn't believe it because he's never seen it or experienced it.

I mean, he's not just a guy. He's a big *fat* guy. Unless there's a bi or gay chubby chaser producing off-brand comedies, he wasn't likely to run into them.

He ran into a bunch of *other* weird shit in his time, but it's not out of the question that he's never been molested.&&I think Kevin Smith can be over zealous about certain things like comics for instance. But the man has balls of motherfucking steel and he puts his money where his mouth is. 

&&Holy moly. &&He's really reminding me here of the Louis Theroux documentary about Jimmy Saville. Similarly, Theroux had a relationship with Saville where he regarded him as an eccentric mentor-figure and didn't believe all the things that people said about him, and even though Theroux spent a lot of time close to him, he never saw the other horrifying Saville that clearly existed. After all the stories about Saville came out, Theroux did a documentary about it that really plays like an emotional catharsis and apology from Theroux to the victims. He seems to blame himself, that he could have done more. Really hard to watch, and very similar in tone to Smith here.&&Wow. I always respected Kevin Smith because he seems utterly genuine, but this is such an unnecessary level that he's committed to, I have no words. I love the guy even more.

Kudos to you, Kevin Smith. You are a good person.&&Thanks for the link. I was waiting to see if it got brought up on smodcast but i think hes using some episodes he had saved possibly before he talks about it on there&&It appears as if you're right; he waited until he knew the company would go down instead of instantly stepping down for moral reasons. It would be a hard situation to be in as an actor because if Harvey did bounce back and regain power CT would be fucked. Also, this was his first fucking movie and he probably really did not want to pull the plug because of his boss' sexual predation.&&Yup That's exactly my point. Everyone is so willing to just turn a blind eye to it and that allows these peoole to keep their power. But then once it blows up they all run to talk about how disgusting it is and how we need to protect women. 

Then how about black balling producers that pull this shit? Because Harvey is not the only one. &&Maybe everyone was too scared about what would happen if they did something first, so now that it's out in the open it's a lot easier for everyone to go against him. It's still good that the ball got rolling somehow, even if these people didn't make the first move.&&Idk about this case, but it's definitely a thing. Like the oscar academy kicked out Weinstein because he got them more bad press, but they allow Bill Cosby and Roman Polanski to stay. 

Or Meryl Streep who will condemn Trump for assaulting women, but again defend Roman Polanski. Or act shocked that Weinstein was attacking women, even tho she was in his circle, and they all knew he was harassing women. 

Virtue signaling is a real thing and it needs to be called out. People like that shouldn't be allowed to co-opt tragedies or events for their own personal gain. It's selfish and immoral. &&Dude thank you!!

These fuckin terms like virtue signaling, gatekeeping, mansplanning etc...

I don't think any rumours they heard would have proven it was happening, and so they couldn't exactly go to the press with rumours, but I'm hearing a lot of people say they had absolutely no idea and I'm just finding that part hard to believe. I think most of them did have an idea something was probably going on, even if it was just based on rumours or past proven occurrences.

It's like if tomorrow there was a sudden exposé that brought to light prison rape and the general population saying they had no idea. Sure people have heard of it happening, but the idea it was a widespread problem was just a rumour as far as the general public is concerned. I realise this isn't the best example to use, I'm sure prison rape is documented more than Weinstien's crimes, but I hope you can see where I'm going with it.&&> Not excusing those who are still on weinsteins side, but I can understand celebrities not knowing that this was happening. 

You're forgetting that most top level celebs are represented by 2-3 agencies. There is no way that those agents weren't aware of the rumors.

He was convicted but the judge that presided over the case was a corrupt tool who loved rubbing elbows with celebrities. The judge sentenced Polanski to a 90 day custodial ""psychiatric evaluation"" and no prison time. Polanksi asked for a delay in the sentence being carried out because it would interfere with the film he was making, and the delay was granted. Then, when Polanksi actually did go into the custodial psychiatric evaluation, he was released after only three days because (contrary to the judge's expectation) that is the way the evaluation actually works. The judge was furious and demanded Polanski serve the remaining 87 days of his intended sentence in jail, whereupon Polanski fled the US and never returned. He lives in France and has continued to enjoy the support of the international filmmaking community ever since.

I'm with you on Polanski, but Sean's case is too vague to be even mentioned or compared to Weinstein or Polanski fuckery &&> Google it

And yet, there are links in this thread, attributed to Madonna herself, that deny it. This is the problem with the misinformation age--you can find literally anything you want on the internet, it doesn't make it true. ""Google"" is not a vetted source.

This won't change a thing for you, though, will it? This is the narrative you've heard, this is the narrative you choose to believe, so any time Sean Penn's name pops up in your social media, you will be sure to accuse him of domestic abuse, and use ""google it"" as your ""proof."" And by doing so, you perpetuate the falsehood, and if the falsehood is accepted as fact, it's as good as fact, and you are therefore vindicated. This is how Trump got elected, on a wave of lies that people were too lazy to verify, so they accepted them at face value, and because they reinforced a narrative they believed in, they spread those lies, until the lies were believed by enough people that they were accepted as fact.&&the cursoriest of searches yielded an affidavit from 2015 signed by madonna stating under penalty of perjury that sean penn never tied her up, hit her with a baseball bat, or otherwise ""tortured"" her. literally fake news. google it

He clearly says they won't be developing it or any other projects belonging to TWC. &&But I mean, just because it's no heroic act doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do. It just means there's a financial reason to do it AND a moral reason to do it.&&That's a better way to change Hollywood.&&Women in Film gives money to women to produce films with women, giving them complete control. It’s the same thing, but likely more positive as it abstracts the women from having a man directing and funding their efforts directly and visibly. &&It doesn’t sound like Smith worries about what we think of him, it matters how his personal values feel about the foundation his career was built on, and how he is going to ha doe his feelings of complicity. &&Sure if a particular actor was hypocritical they should be called out.

I guess that's a side definition for virtue signalling? But it's still a nonstarter like other definitions. Basically you're cutting off all opinions and thoughts and prayers, etc. As it CAN ONLY BE for personal gain. No longer can anyone be genuinely concerned after a tragic event or outraged at a scandal.

You're setting up a real world Catch-22. They can't show compassion because it's selfish and immoral but we know they will be ripped apart on social media and the press if they stay silent.

The term virtue signalling has been co-opted by the right as a way to dismiss compassion. This makes it OK for the right to not sympathize with suffering refugees or any oppressed people because no one really feels that way, it's just fake and plastic ""virtue signalling"".&&I'm not sure your point. How are we judging? How much knowledge did each person in Hollywood have? Are we throwing out the baby with the bathwater?

From the supreme court letter that has an actual statement from Madonna regarding the matter she says, ""I am aware of the allegations concerning an alleged incident that occurred in June, 1987, whereby (according to tabloid reports), Sean allegedly struck me with 'a baseball bat.' I know the allegations in those and other reports to be completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.""&&He played the French police detective in Rush Hour 3.

So yep, influential director, comedy actor, and fugitive child rapist.&&No people, but Peggy murdered countless boxes of Bon Bons&&I didn’t try to accuse him of anything, this comment above mine asked why Sean Penn and Roman Polanski were included in the original comment’s joke, i felt compelled to explain. I don’t know very much about that story, apparently it’s highly disputed, I didn’t know that. But I did know why his name was included in that joke. 

I said “google it” not as a way of offering definitive proof, but because I did not know details of the story and was about to go to sleep so wasn’t going to google it myself. I didn’t realize a reddit comment was so high-stakes. I’m sorry to have ruffled so many feathers. &&Sounds like a game where two grown men crawl around like worms&&Nitekrollers*&&Well, I don't know how many years on this Earth I got left. I'm gonna get real weird with it.&&Sir, are you implying that he is a bird in a man suit? A bird operating his man suit from under the pants?&& [oooooh](https://m.popkey.co/138adb/MMAez.gif) &&Yeah but not ""Fox"" himself. There's a difference between ""an executive at Fox"" and ""Harvey Weinstein of The Weinstein Company""&&I mean, with the dam being broken as it is I'd think if someone was going to be outed at Fox it would have happened already.&&Have a lot of Fox News people not already had allegations about them?&&Channing is going to run out of studios to go to to pick up his film.&&I guess I meant it's so *obviously* the right thing to do that it barely counts as a major moral decision.  

I guess I find it a bit nauseating that so many people went along with it in order for it not to hurt their careers, but now they are rich and successful their falling over themselves to denounce it.  

I mean, it's Hollywood, I shouldn't be surprised that everything about it is built on lies and make-believe.&&It doesn't mean Streep is wrong about Trump, but she needs to be called out for her hypocrisy. Because she is being a pedophile sympathizer. By only calling out sexual predator, Trump, but not Polanski because she prefers one's views over the other she is politicizing sexual abuse.

It causes drama over arguments around the issue instead of pushing towards a resolution. She pretends to stand against abuse, while covering for it. So she allows for that abuse to continue. 

A clear line can be drawn. Tatum isn't covering for abusers while attacking others. He's not pretending to be outraged when it's likely he already knew what was going on. He's not making himself out to be taking a big stand against something. Just making a reasonable decision to not release a movie about abuse under a label that is known for it. There's no hypocrisy. 

Avoiding hypocrisy is all you really need to avoid being a virtue signaler. And sure people on the right use it for anything to attack others, but that shouldn't mean others from pretend it doesn't happen. Virtue signaling is basically all talk no walk when dealing with issues. It pretends to do something, but doesn't, so a problem goes unresolved. That's my issue with it. 

If Meryl Streep went after all abusers around and wanted to get on a soapbox and declare herself queen of morality I wouldn't care. But she and others cover for wrongdoing by virtue signaling. &&The distinction is whether someone takes a real risk for their values. There's no risk to being pro refugee or gays in NYC.

Thanks for this.&&Brock Turner was just some Stanford kid nobody knew. He was out in 3. 
With how little our justice system cares about sexual assault, he could probably get out in 30 days. 

It's not like he was in possession of marijuana, a CLEARLY more horrible crime. /s&&Salva didn't flip the US government the bird, which makes some people much angrier than attacking children.&&> Sean Penn tortured Madonna. Google it.

>I didn’t try to accuse him of anything

You LITERALLY said ""Sean Penn tortured Madonna.""
&&Hi! I replied to your comment and gave the court statement by Madonna. I just wanted to say thank you. If you didn't mention that Sean Penn thing I never would have been able to learn about the accusations against someone in order to sell books for a writer who had no integrity (the guy who wrote the unauthorized bio about Madonna). 

I'm sorry that people are being rude towards you. I don't believe you had any malice  in you when you made your comments (except for Polanski who is a piece of shit and the evidence backs that up so fuck that guy.) 

Years ago on reddit I made a comment about the Egyptians being cruel because they used the Jews to build the Pyramids only to be told by many people that historically this was inaccurate. I think though that I'm glad that I learned this thing and it got me to fact check better in my life on the internet and when talking with friends. 

Anyway I hope you are having a good morning!

*edit: missing period &&Well, filibuster. &&""Now let's roast this bone.""&&And so if we go into the basement you'll let us do anything at all, yes?

Will Smith Not Returning For 'Men In Black' Spin-Off,28673,73mn38,http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/men-in-black-spin-off-confirmed-official-release-date-21-jump-street-crossover-will-smith-returning-a7976686.html,1990,1506875693.0,,"Fun fact, if this MiB spin off came out in 2019, Will Smith would be as old as Tommy Lee Jones was in the original.&&That doesn't surprise me. It's a spin-off. Those rarely have main characters from the main series.&&Have we learned nothing from Independence Day Resurgence? &&Mixed feelings about this. As much as I’ll miss Will Smith, there’s so much more to be explored in the MIB universe outside of his storyline.&&So Jaden gets the role?&&Hope Wild Wild West 2: The Wildest West gets greenlit.&&And the crowd goes mild.&&I like the idea of MIB but I think it needs to get away from the characters of J and K to succeed. Probably better off as a Syfy tv series&&Doing suicide squad 2 instead &&He turns down Django Unchained to do MIB 3 but won't do this? Mkay, I guess there's something I don't know.&&they'll make it an all female cast&&Why do people want a 21 jump street crossover?&&I didn't know there was going to be a spin-off of Men in Black, but I guess I'm happy about it. I've always thought Men in Black should have been a way bigger franchise.

They have such interesting world-building, and the three movies we got weren't enough in my opinion. Really, I think this franchise needs a TV series. Get on it, Netflix.&&Better than a half-hearted spin-off with a distracting cameo. 

Loved him in the first two, but it's time to move on.&&Will Smith's career has been in a slump recently. It's been years since his last good movie. Don't know what happened to the guy&&But apparently starring in Suicide Squad did SO much for his legacy.

His agent is sucking ass at his job.&&This is going to sound extremely weird but I think it could work:

Set the spin-off on a different planet. Similar to when J is first recruited for MIB and is essentially brought to a new world make the beginning of this movie pull 2 fresh MIB recruits from Earth abruptly to another planet's MIB HQ. You can even cocktease the audience by showing the 2 about to walk up behind J & K in a hallway before they're taken.

The two are notified of their ""temporary re-assignment"" by a new MIB leader and are tasked with a basic ""tutorial"" mission which quickly escalates into something bigger whatever it might be.

That way you can show it takes place in the same universe but the universe is so big that the MIB has progressed within it even though Humanity, itself, has not yet. Peace treaties and such.

As far as who they can cast to be the main characters I would love to see another young & old character pairing. And cast two people you would never expect to be in a weird comedy action movie. Like Gary Oldman as the new K and Steven Yeung as the new J.&&To be honest im a ok with with Will Smith not being in this. &&Can we just stop? Can we not have a good movie, enjoy it then let it be? Why must you take every cow and milk it till it dies and ppl refuse to drink anymore? Why can’t we just have a good movie anymore??! &&Smith is a cool guy, a lot of fun, but I'm not dying over this. MIB is a great property, but I loved the 90's cartoon more than any of the movies. Besides, I feel that the 90's is exactly where Smith seems to have misplaced his charm.

As for the Jump Street crossover, I'm not crying over that either. I feel like that could be a lot of fun, with all the personalities we know from both movies. Between a lot of the main factoring individuals, Smith and Hill specifically, I don't see the point in it if not everyone is on board with WANTING to make it. Who wants a project that the main driving forces behind it really don't care about all that much?

I'm looking forward to a wacky alien adventure with Frank and the Worms. &&His time as a leading actor seems to have passed.&&All I know is that Men in Black II was a joyless cash grab guys.&&Then neither am I.&&Meh.&&>It also won't be the promised crossover between the Men in Black franchise and 21 Jump Street, unfortunately

Then wtf are we doing here?&&Surprised he didn't ransom a role for Jaden&&Wild Wild West was acceptable but MIB spin-off is where Will Smith puts his foot down 😂&&So he passed on Independence Day, Bad Boys 3 and now Men In Black...

Is he purposely giving a giant middle finger to every franchise that made his career, or am I missing something??&&I'm not watching it anyway.&&That’s why it’s a spin-off and not a sequel.&&Then why even bother making it?&&Good, let movie franchises fucking die before you keep making them&&Based on how things are going it'll probably be Women in Black. &&Also not returning:  Moviegoers.

Come on, Hollywood ... you learned nothing from the Independence Day sequel?&&He didn't want to end up having to fight Xenu.&&Dammit Will.... I could deal with independence day.... But, not this.... Not this....&&I mean it doesn't help that him/his agent likely demanded a ridiculous sum for him to appear in it.  And if he could just quit trying to get his No-Talent kids forced into things...&&He probably insisted his son be in it too.&&Good, he hasn’t had a good track record lately&&Would love for man in Black to become a Netflix original&&Probably couldn't persuade them to hire Jaden as his Son/nephew/new partner&&Good&&Good. Will smith is a boner nowdays&&""but puts a contemporary spin on the franchise that captures things on a more global scale"" 

All of those terrible movies were literally about saving the entire fucking world what? &&Gimme the 22 jumpstreet crossover please&&Is it because they won’t put his son in the movie? &&Thus just in, Jayden Smith will also not be featured in the MIB spinoff.&&...Damn...&&Stop, it hurts hearing how old I am &&I hope that's not true.😪


I'm too scared to check...&&Unless the word ""trek"" is in the name, then they find a way to get everyone a recurring cameo.&&Will Smith's absence was not the worst part of that movie. It could have been ok if the climax wasn't so bonkers crazy and filled with cliches.&&[Oh god this movie.](https://media3.giphy.com/media/X7jENDat6V5Je/giphy.gif)&&The real question is, is Danny Glover available to play a time traveling Will Smith.&&I didn't miss him in Independence Day: Resurgence. I thought he could've been written out better, though.&&Yo, he was busy doing that mad nasty awesome flick: Suicide Squad.  &&He turned it down because he wanted to make that ""After Earth"" movie with his son.

Which makes me worried about what he is choosing to do instead this time.&&It's a Spin Off? I""m sorry but Men in Black wasn't a series that made it just because of Will Smith. it has a lot of rich source material to work with that doesn't have to rely on the same agents to make it work.&&I, uhh... didn't totally hate that movie. Thought it was... okay. &&I don't get why people hate this movie. It was funny. Stuff blew up. An egg from space is going to help mankind deliver ass whoopings accross the universe. People really have high expectations of action movies these days.&&This guy must be taking lessons on how to pick the wrong movies.  Passes here and on ID2 while saying yes to After Earth and Suicide Squad.     

Big Willie needs to get his shit together. &&Damn, that movie was bad. &&Hollywood has not learned anything from any of their failed reboots/sequels. It's actually quite frustrating how thick-headed they are. &&I still hate myself for watching it. &&Yeah this isn't like Independence Day where his character was pretty important for the movie, the Men In Black franchise has so much potential for more and it's a shame we haven't had more spin off or sequel material that add to the world created.

I'm cautiously optimistic about this.&&They should make it a TV series. Police procedurals make good TV shows.&&I did enjoy the cartoon. &&Too bad they're not doing the 21 Jump Street crossover anymore.&&>there’s so much more to be explored in the MIB universe

You know what I despise? “Exploring universes”, especially when they’re part of a tired franchise from almost 20 years ago. I’d love to see some original sci fi flicks that aren’t sequels, prequels, reboots or spinoffs.&&How Can He Act If Everyone Is Always Acting&&> So Jaden gets the role?

They'll have to call it... Men In Black Whatever: Box Office Poison&&I like Neo Yokio. &&He was bearable on the get down.&&Wild Wild West 2; wickety wickety wil-wild west.&&2wild2west&&Honestly, I thought Wild Wild West was a good movie. Fight me.&&Smiff Smiff Wild 2&&That. Is a man's. Heeeeeeeeeead. &&Imagine the advancements in giant mechanical spider technology since the 1999 version of 1869.&&/r/crowdgoesmild&&Ever see the animated series? That was honestly pretty good from what I can recall.&&An MIB series would actually be kind of wonderful.
Syfy is doing a surprisingly good job with their shows right now. The Expanse is fucking fantastic.&&where every episode follows a different MIB Agent or partners, or civilian human or alien... different missions or stories that relate to MIB... keeping certain side characters the same throughout, like when visiting HQs...  The moon prison could be an entire season worth of characters/material...&&Syfy has been absolutely killing it lately as well. Expanse, Magicians, ~~Orville~~, etc. are all different and refreshing. One more home run series and they'll firmly establish themselves as a network that can foster new, hit shows.

I always thought of them as that one station for old syndicated shows but that has changed.
&&2ucide 2uad&&And that was a very wise decision. Smith would have been terrible in that movie.&&Women in black&&Don't even joke about that&&Women can wear black and chase aliens too!  You're all mysognist pigs for not liking this movie! Melissa McCarthy is the funniest actress alive! Reeeeeeeee &&Who cares, as long as it’s funny&&Because the first one exploited unnecessary reboots, the second one tackled hashed out sequels, and the third one was supposed to make fun of shared universes.

And I haven't seen it, but I feel like that new Baywatch movie would have fit better as a crossover contender rather than MIB.&&Because the chemistry between the buddy cops is great and the movies are about putting them in uncomfortable scenarios. There being an alien underworld would just be another sandbox for them to play in.  The tones of humour are also compatible.&&INFULTRATE THE MOTHERSHIP AND FIND THE SUPPLIERS&&the 3rd one was pretty good&&Did you not watch the third one? Much better than 2.&&TIL in 2 years an Aladdin remake will be released and apparently Will Smith is Genie.

What the fuck?&&I liked Collateral Beauty tho :( &&Excuse me? Forget about a little movie called After Earth? The best movie of all time!

major /s&&Bright looks really interesting. &&Well I saw him perform live with Jazzy Jeff in the UK recently and he was pretty fuckin awesome. I think he's just reached a point where he's made enough money and just want to enjoy doing what he loves. &&Concussion was actually good too&&Focus wasn't bad&&Suicide Squad could have been good. Will Smith isn't what made it bad, and couldn't tell up front how bad it'd turn out.&&Apparently just being Will Smith isn’t enough anymore. His agent is probably realizing he has to actually work for the first time in 20 years.&&Uhhh except he is often regarded as the best thing in Suicide Squad, I'm sure he got payed a decent amount, and being in either the DCEU or MCU is going to bring a bit more fame and honestly fun to any actor.&&Sounds expensive. Studios will want to keep it earthbound to cut down on set/costume/cgi costs.&&Eh, the most interesting part of MiB for me anyway was the idea that anyone could be an alien.  When they went to the offworld prison and stuff I found it dull.&&I don't think it would make sense to have Human agents acting as Men In Black in another location outside of earth.

The whole point is to regulate aliens and blend in with the populace and be unnoticeable.

I can't fathom how 2 humans on a non-human planet would be able to do that in any capacity or why the organization would do so.  Nor would it make sense to have them use holograms, or some other disguise nonsense, over just training agents to the native planet in question.

Unless they just had internal desk jobs and never got to go outside like aliens do who work on Earth. But that doesn't sound too interesting as that'd just make it an alien workplace comedy. Which...hmm....nah.&&There it is! Have an upvote.&&It *is* a spin-off. I would love to see more movies that are just set in the MiB universe.

Also, the last one with very little Tommy Lee Jones was good.&&As much as I hate to say it I agree. MiB doesn't need to be run into the ground, 3 films is perfectly fine. A MiB movie or Jump Street crossover without ***Will Smith*** is not something I want to see. Him and Tommy Lee Jones were the faces of the franchise.&&Speak for yourself. I enjoyed both Jump street films because of Jonah and tatum, I dont need Will Smith.&&Shatner?&&Entirely true, but surprisingly Tommy Lee Jones was only 51 when MIB came out.&&Or those other Star movies...you know...Wars.&&And the embarrassing push for an expanded universe? That's what did it for me.&&The worst part was the product placement for Chinese milk companies and Chinese social media. WTF?&&I couldn't even make it to the climax. I checked out and stopped watching pretty early on. I rarely do that, but this movie was so bad on so many levels, I was too angry to continue watching. 

I think the problem was that the first was humans against advanced aliens... this one had advanced humans. It makes sense that human technology would advance with all the alien tech around, but the humanity was missing from the story with them being so advanced. It just doesn't work. 

They should have done a sequel within a couple years.  They waited too long and it just didn't work at all, IMO. &&Can I see a hat wobble?&&What is this gif from&&I was thinking Sam Jackson.&&Isnt he too old for this shxt?&&What did they say happened to him again? I fell asleep &&Even Jeff Goldblum couldn't save that movie, with or without Will Smith it would've been awful&&""So what are we, some kind of men in black squad?"" &&*Academy Award winner* Suicide Squad&&Suicide Squad looks like a masterpiece next to ID2 though&&Before Earth, a prequel, with his daughter.&&Not quite. He turned it down to do Suicide Squad (that should say something about the quality)


He turned down Django Unchained to do After Earth&&The Aladdin remake?&&He had such a small role in that. He played someone who was injured a good part of the movie so I am sure he could have done all his scenes in a few days.

I am sure there is no way they would have cast his son if it weren't for that.&&""My suit is black I like it but I dont know what it means"". &&[deleted]&&It was very whelming  &&It's a generic and inoffensive sci-fi action movie.  Like the film version of a McDonald's cheeseburger.  It's fulfilling and mildly enjoyable at the time of consumption but not memorable or significant to you afterward.&&Hey, I actually like it a lot more than most people I know. I loved the progression of human technology and the escalation with the mothership and the queen. I also *really* appreciated how the good guy aliens aren't a deus ex machina. For me the only thing really missing was a charismatic lead. They relied too much on that scientist guy too. &&I liked it. I just wish the ending was better. I kept waiting for that orb alien thing to betray the humans and turn out to be even worse than the old aliens and try to blow up the planet or something. When nothing ever happened, I was disappointed.

""I came here to help you fight them."" Keeps its word and helps fight aliens.

What the shit is that fuck?&&I did. It was bad in almost every way I can think of.&&I thought it was the worst movie I've seen this year and I make it a point to watch terrible movies.&&Pretty sure After Earth was a passion project.  I'm glad it's around just because it has some nice visuals and ideas.  And people should be able to make their passion projects.  :)&&I still remember the cartoon. Was so great, also that intro.&&[deleted]&&There are lots of great movie universes that have amazing potential but nothing ever comes off it. It really is a shame. I would enjoy something different than the current Marvel/DC movies lately.&&Is the spin off the one they rumored for the next 21 jump street? It's a great idea really. But I think a better idea would be a 21 jump street, rush hour cross over. Tons of ass kicking with Chan and Tatum and comedy genius from Chris Tucker and Jonah Hill. Can't lose with this. Hopefully someone realizes that this is the alternate universe that joins those movies. &&Watched the first one last night. Ummm you gonna need Tommy Lee or Josh Brolin if not. Otherwise what kind of timeline would it be?&&Bring James Brolin to the future for some reason and make him the focal point of the franchise.&&There's a cartoon series that I remember as being fairly good, don't know if anyplace is streaming it these days.&&So we'll see one or two seasons on Fox, then have it cancelled when it's just starting to get good.&&For anyone looking for some nostalgia: [the intro. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rfd_8dPLYw)

Even if it was animation. I'd love to see a show that tries to be serious without being dark and brooding. &&There's a lot of great material in MIB but they're bogged down by making references and developing personal histories that don't matter past the first movie. &&The Expanse is the best Sci-Fi I have seen since Arrival. When the second season came to U.K. Netflix I was adamant that I would savour it and make it last. 48 hours later I'd finished it. &&There was the animated series and it was pretty good.&&The Expanse is a show with amazing potential and solid production value that is being hamstrung by some terrible acting performances.&&But they also cancelled dark matter which had a shit ton of fans. &&It would have been a great six or seven season series about five years ago. Eureka meets Warehouse 13 meets Stargate Universe &&That sounds like a Black Mirror or American Horror story style of writing where every episode or season is a brand new story. 

I like the idea of characters you can latch on to. Just don't get married to those characters because the story isn't about them it's about the orginization or the aliens. 

MIB the show may be fine with a small rotating cast like Law and Order. Imagine 3 teams of 2 agents as well as some tech people in the home office and anyone can die semi-constnatly rotating out. &&New agents every episode could allow some crazy writing. You like this guy? Surprise, he's dead. Tune in next week.&&I recently stumbled on Wynonna Earp, and quite like it (even with being a bit campy at times, it suits the show, and, well, SyFy).&&RIP, cursive handwriting. &&With Melissa Mcarthy.&&Honestly I liked the movie. Nothing on the original but it was far from horrible. 

If the internet hadn't been subjected to months of 'LIKE IT OR YOU ARE SEXIST' it probably would have gone down in history as just another passable remake.&&Exactly, this proposed film plan still would have continued on their meta commentary on the film industry. When I first heard of this idea, I thought it was so random, it was brilliant. It's such a shame to see it won't progress any further. &&I'd have watched the shit out of Baywatch had it been a sequel to 22nd Jump Street.&&Baywatch was much better than it deserved to be, and yeah I agree,  it would be an excellent crossover contender for Jump Street.

Jonah Hill and Channing have to go undercover in Baywatch, they could have fun with that.&&[I just wanna see Ice Cube deal with some aliens.](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_me9k5iYuqH1qgixfoo1_500.gif)&&Agreed, but I don't know if it's an amazing idea.  You're bound to ruin one of the two.  22 Jump Street worked, surprisingly.  It worked because it was self aware that it was another comedy sequel that pretty much followed the same formula.  &&I thought it was way better than the second one, Josh Brolin kills it as young K and it gets unexpectedly emotional at the end too. &&Thank you. As part of my illustrious vfx career resume, MIB3 deserves to be only mildly overlooked. &&I'll have to give 3 another shot because I see a lot of people praising it.  Only saw it once and put it on par with 2.  &&Josh Brolin as young ~~Tony~~ Tomy Lee Jones was a masterstroke in casting. Bigger win was casting Will Smith as young Will Smith - because clearly the man has stopped ageing after 38.

Edit - Tony lol&&Seemingly Disney want a live-action remake of everything they've ever made.&&Which I'm happy about because Will is the only comedian I can see doing Genie that won't completely ruin the original vision for the character and won't just be some Robin Williams impersonator.&&I'd like to hear him sing and dance to the ""you ain't never had a friend like me"" song or whatever it's called.&&That sounds shitty. I don't know who I wanted as Genie, but I didn't want Smith. I want someone energenic like Robin Williams. Will isn't energenic, he's snarky. &&I thought this was a joke.  Until I realised you were serious.

What the fuck is the correct response.&&There were some good parts. Especially that last scene with Will Smith and Naomie Harris watching the video of his daughter. But overall it was just ehh. Will Smith's acting was great though&&I'm not saying he has anything else to prove. Despite the bad reputation he's had recently for bad movies, he's a pretty decent actor imo&&Wasn't bad.... wasn't good either &&Money isn't even close to an issue for him. And I doubt the cgi cringe fest of suicide squad was fun. 

Also I doubt the film helped his reputation, or that his reputation necessarily needs help. 

Being the best thing in a shitpile isn't an achievement. It wasn't even the best Margot Robbie will smith film&&After Guardians Of The Galaxy smashed records though there's obviously a market for deep space action comedies.&&To be fair the guy they got to play his younger self was fucking PERFECT.

That's where the money is. Extended universes.

That means games, graphic novels, comic books, TV shows - everything Star Wars has.

It's what everyone wants so properties with franchise potential are valued over standalone films at certain levels and in certain studios.

&&' A L I E N S '&&> Chinese market is huge, 100 times bigger than the western market huge

No. Not even ten times. Even a very conservative definition of The West as US + EU puts population numbers at more than 50% of China, and we have more disposable income than the average Chinese. The Chinese market is huge, but not overwhelmingly huge.&&That's an exaggeration. The real problem is how foreign movies are handled in China. They only allow so many per year and to get that juicy market the studios will go out of their way to appeal to the officials who decide such things. Since there are so few foreign movies allowed each year that means each has a good chance of getting a large chunk of the market compared to elsewhere where things are far more saturated.

The kinds of additions we see include adding Chinese actors, which is fine if they are good. Writing China into the plot in some way which is also fine if it makes sense (it often doesn't). And Chinese product placement which is just as lame as western product placement.

India is every bit as big of a market but you don't see studio's bending over backwards to appease them. Why? Because India's industry isn't nearly as protectionist about foreign film imports. Just like China they have a vibrant home grown film industry that makes films geared towards domestic audiences but they don't have a government office that reviews films for their appropriateness before import. &&As someone who doesn't live in the US its really no different from all the heavy US product placement and locations in movies. &&Basically, yup: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment

WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME JEFF???&&Do not see godfather 3 unless your kink is disappointment&&Seriously. If it had Will Smith in it I would just get flashbacks to Wild Wild West.&&Will Smith wanted Tarantino to rewrite it to be more a love story.

Like powered and overpowered. &&You need to watch more young justice&&Why, Inflammable means MORE than flammable&&No need to crash the mode man.&&The first movie gets more fondly remembered for a couple of reasons.  First of all, for a dumb action film, it's a pretty well crafted film.  The plot is well executed (if a bit derivative) and paced really well.  It also has a lot of iconic moments that the sequel lacked.  If you show most people the clip of the alien ship blowing up the White House, they will probably be able to tell you what film it was from.  That leads into the other reason people remember the first film, the special effects.  In the late 90s, the kind of effects used in movies like that were a new frontier.  That kind of scale wasn't very common, so the scenes like the one with Air Force One narrowly escaping the giant alien fireball or the battles with alien craft were much more impressive than they would be now. And more importantly, they used a combination of practical effects and CGI that makes the movie feel more real.  The original movie feels grounded in reality, and it makes the film much more believable.  

If Independence Day: Resurgence is a McDonalds cheeseburger, the original film is like that rare McDonald's cheeseburger that is completely fresh and looks just like the picture on the menu.  It's memorable because it's the best execution of a commonplace thing.&&I didn't like the movie but I will say everyone was beautiful in it.&&I use to watch that and the Godzilla cartoon as I ate my cereal before school. I think I remember a Ghostbusters cartoon around that time as well.

Edit: It's called Real Ghostbusters, it wasn't Extreme Ghostbusters.&&I'm sure I watched that one, but can't seem to recall much else. The most of what I remember from the series was the episode where J, K, and blonde doctor lady (drawing a blank) all got super-powers and fought aliens who received similar treatment (along with the worms turning into coffee). Then there was the one that I swear was based on a sci-if movie about some grasshopper-looking alien trying to get his hands on a device that could create a black hole phenomenon.&&i too enjoyed this show. &&Men In Black movies are comic book movies. There's no escaping them.&&There was just a ton of media they weren't utilizing that they found out was profitable. You will probably see more comic movies than anything else in the near future.

But if you're going to continue a story it needs to improve but you already showed us the BEST thing that happened to that person. So a sequel has nowhere to go but down. &&It's nothing like arrival just so you know. But it's fantastic nonetheless. &&Expanse is nothing like Arrival.  Basically it takes place in the not-insanely-distant future and Humans have colonized the solar system.  Earth, Mars, and a number of moons/asteroids are colonized.  Earth and Mars are the two main powers in the solar system.  It mainly follows a group of people that end up in the middle of a bunch of shit.

It has a pretty practical approach to sci fi.  Humans that grew up off of Earth greatly affected by the lack of gravity.  There's no magical artificial gravity: it's either from the spin of a station or acceleration of a ship.  So lots of fun 0-g moments.

&&Dogs, bruh.&&Eh. It's context based. Like, humans fighting off a superior foe through grit and determination? Good. 

Humans fighting off a superior foe because they are the secret offspring of Gods and have hidden wells of power other species can never hope to attain? Ick.&&Actually, I see that as a film that didn't go for a franchise at all, and was so good that they were seamlessly able to make one anyway.&&even if you just took just the us as ""the western market"" 100x would mean there are 35 billion people in china. someone doesn't math good.&&Just gotta look at PUBG.&&China is still an emerging market and we need to do everything we can to milk every dollar/yuan we can out of them. &&Right. The thing about China that's exciting to commercial business is its growth potential. 

Most western consumers are pretty stable with what they do. China is a giant market where people are still first or second generation consumers. There's a boatload of cash to be made from people opening their wallets for the very first time as a global consumer. &&Layer in GDP and the statement is wildly off. &&Even worse is that if the film is partly filmed in China, it counts as a domestic film, and therefore not part of the quota. That is why so many films have a random scene set in China, to avoid that quota. See: Batman, Mission Impossible, James Bond, etc

The flip side of this is that in order to film in China, the film must be seen to portray China in a positive way, so it's all hyper glossy view of China, and the bad guys are never Chinese (or if they are, they are always rogues/corrupt, as this fits the Chinese governments anti corruption drive)&&That's why they ruined the red dawn remake&&It's not unexpected a US movie to feature US locations and US products. I mean, that's the *default expectation*. 

Also it's not unexpected a Chinese movie to feature Chinese locations and Chinese products. Once again, what else would you expect?

But it is certainly weird to see a US movie awkwardly steer away to China at every opportunity it gets, in conflict with its own plot and internal logic.

I don't mind it, but I'm just saying it stands out.

No subtlety at all. IIRC, his son is one of the pilots giving a press conference, and a reporter is like ""your father, Will Smith, was killed in an accident 15 years ago. How does it feel to be flying out of a hangar named after him?"" and then it like panned to a commemorative plaque of Will Smith or something. 

It was even worse later in the movie when  baby Thor and lady pilot are skyping and she's like ""remember that Will Smith Jr hates you because you almost got him killed"" and then baby Thor immediately watches the video of him almost getting Will Smith Jr killed, purely for the benefit of the audience. &&Presumably the spacecraft wouldn't have all of the flaws of a first gen prototype, though.

For every actual funny T&E bit/sketch there are 40 more that are just fucking stupid. It's great to smoke weed and watch but every now and again my friends and I would go ""why the fuck do we watch this?"".

"""Chef"" by Jon Favreau is the only movie I've seen where all of the conflict is at the beginning of the movie and it slowly gets more and more lighthearted. It's like a backwards movie.",27488,79idjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/79idjw/chef_by_jon_favreau_is_the_only_movie_ive_seen/,1117,1509303763.0,"Towards the beginning of the movie, the main character has a ton of conflict, with his boss for creativity, with the food critic for just being insulting, with the internet because he's kind of clueless, and with his son because he is always so busy. 

Pretty much all of these are solved within the first third of the movie. He quits his job after his boss douses his creativity, things with the food critic kind of get forgotten about because he starts to do his own thing with the food truck, things on the internet get better because his son creates such a good image for them, and things with his son get better because they start hanging out.

This is the only movie I've ever seen where almost all of the conflict is resolved by the first third of the movie, and it just generally gets more and more ""feel good"" as it goes along. This is kind of backwards in comparison with the structure of many other movies, where it can be said that they get less and less feel good, and most of the conflict is in the last third of the movie. I thought it was an interesting thing that I really liked about Chef.","Copying my comment from another Chef post I responded to: 

I love that nothing really bad happens after the initial conflict and even that issue isn't that bad. The entire rest of the movie I'm expecting something bad to happen but it just keeps chugging along at a happy pace and I really liked that. When thinking back on that movie it gives me a feeling unlike any other movie I've watched. It's not my favorite movie but it does leave me with a great feeling inside.&&There are such things as ""feel good movies"". Feels like that's a forgotten trope. I'm a single dad and my boys love watching this movie, and they probably have me making Cuban sandwiches every few weeks. Hell if we turn it off, I'll even sit down and watch the rest on my own with a beer. Love this flick.&&Fuck Twitter.&&There's a part close to the end of the movie where the boy and his dad get into a bit of a spat about the boy continuing to help out on the truck. I expected the movie at this point to go to the part where the dad has to find a way to win back his kid and win back the favor of his ex wife while experiencing a life changing epiphany. But it never came. Kt was resolved in just a few hours like most real life spats. My first thought when it was resolved was, ""..... That's it?"" And I absolutely loved it. Chef is such a great feel-good movie.&&Have you seen Chef?&&MY NAME-A CHEF&&This movie is such bullshit.  Yea the story and acting is good and it ties together nicely...  but we are suppose to believe jon favreau is not only banging Scarlett Johansson but ALSO Sofia Vergara.  Yea... ok&&That grilled cheese scene brought me close to orgasm.&&habe u sien shef&&Worked on the movie and even though we had notes for Favreau from development to production and post, he stood his ground and made the film you see today. No execs could sway him and it is truly why the film was so successful and loved by audiences.  &&This was a really good film.

And it makes me hungry.&&He basic narrative format is building to a climax and then a resolution. That's why this movie felt different.&&I absolutely love this film but I have a personal and funny memory of the first time I watched this.

I was just out of hospital and my brother bought it for me as a pick me up, i had spent under a week on hospital food (i.e. appetite was at an all time low) and in my discharge state was unsure what I could eat (medical reason) so I think I was just on tea and coffee at this point... this was the worst film to watch in this very hungry state, but I kept through it because it was so damn good! But man I wanted to eat my cupboards so bad!&&My only issue is that a SoCal chef somehow doesn't speak any Spanish.&&I dunno, the very ending seemed tacked on. Like why did the opinion of the critic matter so much, Chef seemed super happy with his food truck. It seemed like a 'p.s. always please the critics'.&&I'm pretty sure it's because the film is supposed to parallel Favreau's life. With him working with Marvel and facing the problems of making Iron Man 2 to eventually working in the indy scene and doing what he wants.&&[Have you seen Chef?] (https://youtu.be/oU7F5EffUZY)
&&It's the cinematic equivalent of the food it mocks.&&Have you guys seen Chef?&&When I see who he is, I can’t help but think he’s some sort of goof, but he’s involved in so many good projects that he’s clearly a very talented individual. &&Watch Irreversible.&&I'm gonna give this a go! The movie ""Begin Again"" also felt like that. One of the best things I decided to watch on a whim. Mark Ruffalo, Keira Knightly and Adam Levine do such fab jobs. Plus the support cast is all so cool too. &&I would say ""Room"", although totally different, is somewhat similar in that regard.  
Edit: I am not referring the Tommy Wiseau movie. &&Try the movie, 'irreversible.' Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel.&&I think this explains why I find certain movies like ""Julie and Julia"" and ""You've Got Mail"" so re-watchable. I feel so lighthearted at the end of all three of these movies, and I love them because of it. &&have you seen chef?&&I watch Chef when I'm sad because it just makes you feel good. &&Probably one of the best movies put there in the past 10 years &&I feel like 'Lars and the Real Girl' is also a good example of this. &&Secret Life of Walter Mitty.&&Never thought of it this way&&I noticed that too - there are no villains. Charming movie&&And I find the film is better for it.

No obnoxious cliches, No bullshit like a contrived collapse at the end of the 2nd act to make way for the 3rd's tension, there's little to no formulated bullshit. Just these characters doing what they do best and letting the plot work with that.

That's what I think a feel-good movie should aspire to be in the end.&&Also, the music in that movie was so damn good. The soundtrack is definitely worth listening to.

My favorite is C.R.E.A.M. by El Michel's Affair&&[deleted]&&This is an amazing movie that was completely overlooked when it came out. It deserves the same cult status as Swingers.&&I'd buy a cuban sandwich from his food truck.&&I really, really liked this movie!&&For me it's a really feel good movie.

>AND YOU COME HERE AND JUST FUCKING SHIT ON MY SHIT?!?!?!?

😆&&this one is similar (and based on a true story)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2980648/

It is a story about how the hundred-foot distance between a new Indian restaurant and a traditional French one represents the gulf between different cultures and desires. It focuses on the rivalry and resolution of the two restaurants and is based in Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val, France. The book is narrated by Hassan Haji, the protagonist of the novel, who is born and raised in his family's Indian restaurant in Mumbai, and it encompasses his journey from child to world-renowned chef.&&Absolutely love this movie. It is one that my girlfriend and I can watch over and over and never get sick of it. We love it so much that after seeing it on Netflix I went out and found it on DVD and bought it! I will one day recreate that amazing grilled cheese. I always recommend this movie to people. So well done.

&&*And* it teaches you a use for cornstarch that you've never known before!&&There is a French Comedy movie called ""Le Chef"" that came out a few years ago, it's very good.

Le Chef
http://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt1911553/&&It's interesting you brought this up because I've been tinkering with this idea for a little while now. I'm sure it's been written about elsewhere but basically that in almost all comedy genre films, there is (roughly speaking):

1) some plot line
2) comedy throughout the film that is of far greater frequency and quality in the first half
3) far greater focus on a plot line (at the expense of comedy in my opinion) in the 2nd half of the film

I have found very very very few exceptions to this rule in popular comedy movies. Notable breakers of these rules for me are Borat and Jackass. It's probably a good time to mention that I don't really enjoy almost any comedy movies mostly because of this phenomenon. I don't know if this is an inextricable characteristic of comedy movies though and I dream of the plotless comedy movie. 

Interesting that you've noted that inversion in action. &&I may be in minority in this, but I feel like Larry Crowne was the same way. The movie left me with a really good feeling. Regardless how shitty things may be we'll all be ok at the end. &&I enjoyed this movie, but was hyper aware of the lack of conflict in it. I don't think that's a fault, but it's certainly foreign to standard storytelling. My wife and I laughed at how there seemed to be a mild obstacle to overcome when the policeman asks for their permit, but, nope! He totally has the necessary paperwork to legally run his food truck. &&It's kinda like life. Sometimes you have these periods of extreme stress and pressure. It seems like everything in the universe is aligning to make you miserable. Finally you have enough and you're forced to act. You change the things you can change and learn to live with the things you can't. Over time life becomes easier. The memories of that rough patch drifts away as you float down the river of time.&&That movie inspired me to really perfect my Cuban sandwiches. I found [this recipe](http://thesauce.atbbq.com/videos-mojo-pork-cuban-sandwich/), and it's killer.  

&&It's also tough to watch on an empty stomach. &&I only heard of this movie because of binging with babbish.&&The same thing happens in the movie ""Once"". Great movie with fantastic music -- highly recommended!&&Watch Begin Again. It reminded me of almost a music-based version of Chef&&The moral of this movie is: Have rich friends to bail you out when you have problems.&&I just really couldn't stand this movie. The whole ""romantic"" scene of him cooking Carbonara for Scarlett Johansson was nauseating.&&I find this movie boring for that reason&&I don't remember the movie exactly. Just that it's the only movie I've ever seen that's made me unbearably hungry. &&I learned how to make a grilled cheese sandwich properly from that movie.&&I liked Chef as a light hearted movie. On the other hand, it really felt like Jon Favreau writing himself into fan fiction. &&Holy fuck I hate this movie so much!!!!!&&[deleted]&&Have you seen Chef !? (Idubbbz, maxmoefoe, filthyfrank reference)&&Yeah I thought it sucked big time. The beginning was kinda interesting but after that it looked like they just stopped trying. I don't really see the point of making a movie that is basically a drawn out vacation video.&&Yeah, you're using conflict literally, looking for the fights.

The conflict of this particular film was in the audience wanting to see the main character succeed, but feeling conflicted about whether he'd be the character we wanted him to be when he did.

I mean, no.  The movie isn't backwards, and all the conflict is not at the front of the movie, and it doesn't just ""get more feel good.""

It *is* a feel-good movie.  And deserves whatever idle chatter it gets at this point.  But it's not like a brand new thing that doesn't fit into the known structures of film, you just noticed that it wasn't the end of the world if the end of the movie didn't wind up being transcendentally happy.

This is the criticism at the heart of Marvel's armageddon 3rd acts.  It's difficult to structure the conflict of a superhero movie on smaller stakes, but those smaller stakes don't necessarily mean the human engagement isn't there.  Often just the opposite.

Civil War wasn't about the end of the world, it was about the end of the thing the audience is more loyal to than even the characters in the film are: ""The whole gang together and kickin' ass and not being broken up.""

Anyway, that's more context for ya.&&K, I definitely need to see this movie now.&&It was a good movie...I enjoyed it but yeah like those above me.....F—&&I love movies like this. Anyone has other examples?

So far ITT I've seen Silver linings playbook and Room&&It's about an arrogant douche nugget who thinks he is better than everyone else, and he gets put in his place and rediscovers his passion and love of cooking by being humbled.  I think it's a great film.&&CHEF BIG DOG UP ALL NIGHT COOKIN'&&I kind of can't stand the movie. Every second I watch it I'm just wondering why. It felt like one of those shows for literal babies where everyone's happy and dancing and singing and nothing bad happens and it's just a way to distract the baby with flashy colors.&&Really dont like second half of Chef. Think its so mediocre where the beggining is amazing

Its like Favreau rushed it so he can go do the jungle book&&You know what they say about backwards movies. Enjoy the movie and save the makeout session for the later part&&This was supposed to be a feel good character driven movie. (I think) Which is why there was no conflict. It means that the characters have to be endearing or deep enough to draw the audience in. Which this didn't do for me at all. The characters were simple stereotypes and the plot was mundane.

I honestly couldn't tell if this was a bad movie or a paid advertisement for social media. &&This is something I'm not sure I'll phrase right, because I'm a terrible writer myself and this could sound really pretentious but here goes:

I think 99% of the writers on movies I've seen have fallen back on heartache and tragedy as a gimmick to make me care more about the story, whereas Chef is just a *damn good story* that doesn't need it. I think that feeling you get is because you're so used to that one trick of throwing in a curveball, but Chef doesn't need it.

And I don't think it's a Hero's journey thing either. Chef has every plot point it needs to conform to the structure, it just doesn't feel like it needs that grand 3rd act tragedy because it's 1st and 2nd are strong enough to invest us.

I hope that makes sense, and isn't completely wrong. Storytelling is a subject I'm very interested in but, as I said, not great at.&&I have to say that Chef is the first movie that make me cook, seeing those  cuban sandwichs and the whole journey in the food track just make me really hungry and with the this idea of : man i want make one of those good Cuban sandwichs ( no english native, is sandwichs plural of sandwich or is it sandwiches :p)
 
 
And Chef is also one of the few movies that show how the real Colombians are, dont remeber if in the movie the Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara are Colombians  but they didnt act in this movie they were just Colombians beings Colombians &&It got it's happy ending early and most viewers where happy to just hang with the characters for awhile. It's as much a film about the joy of cooking as it is about what happens to the people actually cooking. Favreau actually took the time to learn how to be a proper chef for the film, and it shows. So kudos to him for that.&&This movie brings a great memory to me. My youngest son was in his last year of college. No classes that day. I had the day off from work. We watched it and googled closest Cuban restaraunt and found an authentic one in Nashville an hour away. Guess where we loaded up and went? He’s now graduated and married and moved to Florida. Thanks for making a dad feel good.&&This is my new go to movie to watch if I’m bored or feeling down. I love the food, the relationship with his son and everyone pretty much lived happily ever after. &&I find it sort of creepy that nothing bad happens, it's like waiting to get stabbed and then you never do. I felt good at the end and like I'd gotten away with something.

Great film btw, underrated. Man I want a steak sandwich.&&For me, that quality made it feel dramatically inert and unengaging. It's too affable and good-natured for me to *dis*like, I just didn't care. It feels like a bit of a cheat that RDJ is there to bankroll the guy's midlife crisis. If he really had to rough it in setting up the food truck business, his victory would feel more hard-won and satisfying.

Maybe it's just that I'm a miserable bastard, because the underlying anguish and desperation of The Trip movies made the comedy that much sweeter and more compelling, even though the stakes are vague at best.&&You mean it's a **feel-good movie**?&&The movie [Everybody Wants Some!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Wants_Some!!_(film\)) was like this too. Just people having a good time the whole movie.&&It screws with your head. In the second half of the movie, there were plenty of points where the other shoe could have dropped and would have if it were almost any other movie. I found myself getting more and more uneasy as potential conflicts were resolved with minimal fuss because most filmmakers use those moments as the calm before the storm, and the calmer the calm, the stronger the storm. It was only when the film reached the denouement that I was finally able to relax.&&Its a really good family and wholesome movie.&&Definitely felt incredible to watch, in a way quite unlike anything else I've seen. Spot on asessment.&&I remember thinking if this truck breaks down on the way back just to create a problem I'm going to pissed. But nope just Aaron Franklin and some brisket.&&Watch ""Hector and the Search for Happiness"". It and Chef both make me feel the same way. I watch them once a year, minimum &&I found it kinda boring. Also I found it hard to belive that his wife is Sofia Vergara and his girlfriend is Scarlett Johansson.&&I absolutely loved that film. The conflict was just the normal ""struggle"" for success, which they overcome. It's great that that movie is basically just ""how life can go sometimes"" in a positive way.&&> There are such things as ""feel good movies"".

&&The second time I watched *Chef* was when I showed it to my kids (ages 11-14 at the time). I thought it might be a bit slow for them, but they all loved it.

The corn starch scene had them howling, and they were practically cheering by the end of the film.

They've watched it another two or three times since.&&[Cuban sandwich from the movie]( https://youtu.be/hXYoduN0kWs)&&I loved the CG they used for Twitter . It was perfect . Especially added to the hilarious scene in the kitchen in the beginning where he argues with the critic . Gotta love Leguizamo and Cannavale &&at the same time its pretty realistic isnt it? a kid wont resort to never talking to his dad ever again over a disagreement, and the dad probably wont do some over the top grand gesture to win back his son's favor.

it's solidly grounded in reality, and that makes it more relatable. he's already a famous chef before he quit the restaurant to run a food truck so the success of the truck was kinda secured from the very beginning, the critic was already a huge fan before the ugly falling out, he had to swallow his pride to get his ex wife's ex husband who banged his ex wife while his marriage was falling apart to throw him a bone, which ends up being a shitty truck, and his relationship with his kid obviously got better because he actually put in time and spent time with him instead of some movie magic where the relationship is magically repaired because he gave the kid a sammich or something.&&My name-a chef&&I loved this meme so much that I went watched Chef, best movie ever brings a tear to my eye&&HABE U SEEN A ALIEN PLS&&Waiter, there's vomit and piss in my cake.&&Hell yeah dude&&[deleted]&&I'm glad this isn't the top comment.

Ok but half way through they have to stop being friends and fight over a misunderstanding. &&Yeah, it was really interesting! I'm trying to think of another movie I've seen that has done that and I'm coming up blank.&&If you look at it as an internal conflict and the climax coming at the point where he should have a breakdown after reaching LA and knowing whether it was all worth it or not, it's still got that format. He could as easily have seen the whole trip as a pointless boondoggle and a huge mistake.&&and thus, for me, boring&&I was in the hospital for like 5-6 days once and couldn’t have anything by mouth for the whole stay, so no food and no water.

August Underground, 120 Days of Sodom etc. I watched those without flinching. Irreversible is the only movie I had to turn off because of that [SPOILER](/s ""horrible, horrible rape scene."") Still haven't finished it.&&Came here to say this, glad somebody else beat me to it.


Also don't watch Irreversible. &&I think that's only half true, because they never resolve Lisa's mom having cancer and Johnny eventually kills himself at the end, but other than that it's pretty close.&&I'd compare Room to Frozen, in that it's a burst of intense, overwhelming childhood incident followed by a long, meandering spell of coming to terms with your fears and inadequacies. Much like life.&&I disagree that it's similar, the movie has conflict pretty much throughout. It did feel very different structurally though. Mostly because the first half builds up to the resolution of that initial conflict but then the movie still goes on after the climax with a whole new conflict

Great movie though&&Thanks, I was hoping I wouldn't have to be the one to suggest this.

Such a great film, IMO does the 'reverse order' thing the best since it really adds to the sadness of the tragedies. Seeing the aftermath and actual trauma take place followed by the normal lives of the victims really drives home that these sort of things can happen to anybody.&&Like I said in another reply, while the scenes gets lighter towards the end, it doesn't really feel happy or positive because you know what is waiting for the characters down the road. I assume in Chef you also end up feeling happy towards the end of the movie because things becomes better, but you don't do that in Irreversible.&&Any movie recommendations? I love rewatching Julia and Julia, Chef and You’ve Got Mail!&&My name chef.&&It's not like that at all, in fact, you don't see closure for him until the very last scene. With Chef it's 2/3 of the movie of him getting better and better and coasting along, with little conflict. &&I loved that movie, and it really moved me, but I can't remember the structure resembling Chef's movie. Does it? Maybe I have to rewatch it :)&&My example would be Larry crowne. No one really saw that movie but it started with the bad and then was just all good after. That fact made me enjoy the movie. &&Great movie but I don’t see how it has a similar structure. It has a central tension that isn’t resolved until the end &&I'd recommend ""Burnt"", if you want Bradley Cooper and the same cooking back story and food porn angle.  Chef hard on his luck, different demons, different path to fixing his life and really well done, IMHO. But I love Chef as well.&&Have u seen... chef&&Heyy, that’s pretty good!&&Buddy, Jon made aglio e olio, not carbonara.

The one thing I'll address is that the kid isn't a savant in any way, he fucking uses Twitter like anyone would&&Oh I'm too broke to open my own restaurant but let me rebuild a goddamn food truck from the ground up with brand new equipment but make my son cry over cleaning an old steam table pan...............just stupid&&Wow thank you some sense in this thread. 
This movie was so goddamn terrible in so many ways. I almost want to watch it again to write up a proper review about how crap it was oh my god it pissed me off so much.

Shame really as I loved the directors old films. Chef was cheap consumerist bullshit with Twitter plugs up it’s nose&&Hmm I feel like a lot of things that you're stating as facts are actually just your opinions.&&I don't really understand what you're saying. The movie definitely just gets more feel good. It's Favreau's situation constantly getting better and happier. There are potential conflicts that could have arisen but they do not. The ""good"" option always occurs. &&Your analysis lacks any sort of evidence. You just said some things as if they're fact but there's no backing from the film. Then you inexplicably linked it with Marvel's films — which do often have issues surrounding their third act due to their ongoing nature and the audience's knowledge of inevitable sequels — but they have little to do with Chef, other than Jon Favreau's early involvement with the MCU. 

You state that the conflict of this film is seeing whether the protagonist will successfully and effectively transform as a character by the end of the film and I would agree you with there. In that way, Chef is a cliche — a professional loses everything and in doing so, reassess their life and personal relationships. In Chef, he loses a prominent head chef position, embarrasses himself publicly via Twitter and seemingly loses everything dear to him, only to then launch a successful food truck service and repair the relationship with his estranged son. 

However, where Chef differs from most feel good movies of its ilk, and where your analysis falls short, is that there is no major conflict following the first act. As an audience, we understand the cliche and know that he will be successful, get to know his son better, find himself, etc. But we also expect minor hurdles to that success: perhaps a disgruntled customer on Twitter? Or a city official withholding the necessary permits for their food truck. The entire second and third act, we expect some sort of conflict, either externally or internally, but instead the movie just sort of happens. It's although the film was written as a short story and the ""happily ever after"" was stretched out over an hour. 

And that is why Chef is a unique entry in the feel good film genre. 

EDIT: Spelling error.&&Re: Civil War. You're 100% spot on IMO. It wasn't about ""will Cap kill Tony to save Bucky?"" We know Cap would never do that. But that moment where he raises the shield to attack Tony and Tony covers his head, *he* thinks Cap is willing to kill him in that moment. And that's the crossed line that no amount of letters and phones can take back. The Avengers can never be whole again because of the decisions that led to the team taking sides against one another, Tony to accept the Accords and governmental oversight, and Cap to act against them and try to save his friend Bucky.&&Plus whovever did the sound effects for the grilled cheese should get an Oscar for helping me cum so good. &&> whereas Chef is just a damn good story

If you break it down, the story is really nothing special at all as I see it. Successful middle-aged person gets in trouble and decides to go back to his roots and finds happiness. We've seen it a million times before and story wise the movie brings nothing new.

But it delivers so much charisma, charm, heart and positive energy in telling the story and they skip the formulaic conflicts a long they way and just bring us characters that feel alive that we care about in a heart warming simple way.&&The familiar-yet-new structure and the general ""feel good"" vibe of the movie honestly more than makes up for the incredibly rushed and confusing ending. God, I love Chef.&&> 99% of the writers on movies I've seen have fallen back on heartache and tragedy

If only it were just heartache and tragedy.

> Anecdotally, when I was a script reader, I found that 46.7 percent of the 30 scripts I’d read in a three-month period contained rape.

The lazy awfulness of script writers is unfathomable.&&It’s because the filmmakers, in particularly the writer/director/star Jon Favreau, have a particular passion for the subject matter and that’s infectious onscreen. It feels good when somebody is able to bring you along for something they love. &&For real. I hate the American ethos of ""the only way you can be good is for something horrible to happen to you"". Nah, sometimes you can just be nice and work hard and have nice things happen to you to :)&&I disagree. I don’t think it’s a great movie or a good story. But I do think it’s a fun movie and it resonates wth me on a purely emotional level.

I think Favreau is such a natural that he’s great at making you think everything happening on screen is a good story when it’s really just feel good cliche stuff that’s pandering to your emotions. And that’s fine because it totally got me with the kid and the food and the music. But it’s not a good story. It’s barely a story. It’s all emotion and food porn and anecdotal moments.

And you’re right that the hero’s journey bullshit isn’t necessary. But the ending of Chef is total crap. Come on, they get married? No. That was like the last part of a story a little kid tells you that gives away the whole story being a lie. 

But again, I left the theater having really loved the experience and recommending the movie to others. And I bought the soundtrack almost immediately for my mom who I knew would go nuts for it.

It has value, it’s just not some great or even “damn good” story. &&I think Chef does have a slight 3rd act tragedy tho, in the form of the fight that Carl has with his son while they're fixing up the truck. It gets resolved rather quickly, but it's still a sad point of conflict later on in the film. Idk, thoughts? &&If you tell yourself you aren't good at it you will never be so grow up, read a book, and analyze It a lot.  If you like you will enjoy this aspect (  or movies you can do the same thing but there is less depth to them most of the time.)&&Have you seen ""everybody wants some"" or ""boyhood"" they're one of those nothing bad happens, or nothing happens, but it's great. You'd love it &&The plural is sandwiches! And yes felt the exact same way but I am lazy and just went and bought a Cubano haha.&&I keep trying Cuban sandwiches wherever they're on the menu, mostly because of that movie. What I'm learning is, either the Cuban sandwich is impossible to make delectable, or literally nobody knows how to actually make one that doesn't come out like dried pork with way too much salt and vinegar on a tasteless bun.&&Eh, I feel like it wrapped up way too quickly. Food critic guy: ""I was wrong, you're great!"" Everybody: ""we love you!"" The End. 

That said, I watched it on a long-haul flight which is never ideal.

EDIT: I don't mean that I prefer to be spoon-fed a clear explanation of everything. I mean it literally felt like it was missing the last 10 minutes.&&> It's as much a film about the joy of cooking as it is about what happens to the people actually cooking.

 I've always looked at it as a film about the creative process. When creativity isn't working go to places where people are making authentic art, soak in their output and use that to reignite your own passion.&&Ya it was a really strange experience. I was waiting for the cliche back stab or Downey Jr to say ""no unless you do X for me"" or some shit but it just never happened. I was uneasy because I'm so used to that crap. Watching it a second time was a better experience cause you know to just relax and enjoy the ride. &&Too many writing rely on the standard 3 act structure.  It's refreshing when that doesn't happen.  That's why you feel evil afterwards.&&That’s an interesting simile you chose there.&&I completely get what you're saying and I thought I would roll my eyes at it too in the end. However, I just couldn't not be happy in the end. The music, the colour, the characters, the settings, everything just added up and left me feeling good rather than annoyed. &&All RDJ does is give him a rusted out piece of junk. Favreau did does the heavy lifting of restoring it and getting it ready.&&> If he really had to rough it in setting up the food truck business, his victory would feel more hard-won and satisfying.

I'm guessing you've never once tried to run a business if you think that being gifted a little bit of capital makes everything easy.&&Also I was pretty annoyed that his wife and all their Cuban friends just existed to hand old Favreau everything he needed to succeed and then not give them any credit. Like Sophia Vergara babysat his ass the whole way and then RDJ financier-extraordinaire rolled up with the cash and the glory. I spent the whole second half of the movie waiting for the kid to tragically die in a grease fire. 

I watched that movie high off my ass though and will never forget how the food cinematography melted my face off. That scene with the gratuitous grilled cheese is pure sex. &&No you're not a miserable bastard, not based on this alone at least. 

Look at stories in real life. People tend to gravitate more tragic and eventful stories and dynamic narratives. For example, which story here do you think is going to garner more attention, the Las Vegas Strip Shooting or the story of some guy who made it to his kid's graduation on time? A betting man would bet on the former.

Yes the latter is heartwarming and nice, but it *is* unengaging and lacks pathos. Pathos is a strong tool, almost every great story uses it to great effect. Now that doesn't mean you can't derive enjoyment out these really lighthearted and happy stories with very little conflict, but it's certainly a different kind of enjoyment. And people's enjoyment of both of these types of stories will vary. My(and I'm assuming yours as well) enjoyment of the former is definitely higher on the spectrum compared to the latter where it's lower on the spectrum.&&Totally agree.

Not only empty, it also felt kinda...false to me.

Like everything just works out. He moans about how unreasonable the critics are (even though they're right), he goes and does something and it just goes amazingly.

Felt to me like the point of the story was ""fuck critics, I'm amazing and....honesty is good?""&&Felt the exact same way. Have tried to articulate that point about Chef to many people, but nobody ever seems to want to hear it. &&Yeah it's kind of a nothing movie.&&Are you trying to say that feel-good movies don't have conflict for the characters? I mean, just Google 'feel-good movie' and you'll be served up a ton of movies that are nothing like Chef but still ""feel-good"". &&*School of Rock*

It was better than just having everyone talk about what a great chef he used to be. 

The fact that Vergara was his wife makes you realize that this is a guy who is depressed with his current life and really let himself go. The tattoos etc. suggest he used to be a much cooler guy. &&But the dude didn’t even make his own pasta.&&His spot out front of Guero's in Austin was also intensely unrealistic. Albeit across the street down near the St. Francis de Paul parking lot there's a guy in a trailer who does sausage sandwiches that I can recommend highly (if he's still there it's been a couple years...).&&namashef&&Obviously from the comments he had to be one of the executives that was unable to sway him&&The grilled cheese?

Like, it already ended happily, he got a healthy dose of self-actualisation and fostered a good relationship with his estranged son, no need to crank the happy ending up to eleven. It perversely comes off as kind of cynical (on the film makers' part) to me. 

But especially the job, like wasn't the whole point that he become master of his own destiny? Just undid half the film.&&I mean, at the end of chef, he goes back and opens up another big restaurant owned by a financier putting himself in a similar (but implied to be better) situation to what he was in at the start of the movie. 

If it is meant to be a parallel to Favreau’s directing career, it still tracks including his move back to huge big budget Disney movies. &&You can't spell Disney without Indy.&&Yeah, he also starts in the indie scene in chef by characters accounts. &&He also directed Elf, staring Will Farrel,  a very long time ago.&&With Swingers, yeah. But everyone kinda does.&&Yeah it slowly gets more lighthearted but since it is going backwards through time, you know the happiness of the characters is extremely temporary. It's an emotionally draining movie to watch.&&Exactly!  I don't know why I put myself through such depraved movies.  I tell myself it's because I'm curious as to WHY those movies even get made.  What is the point of a movie like August Underground or A Serbian Film?  Yes, they're incredibly violent and gory, but ultimately they're just boring and unoriginal.

On the other hand, I think Irreversible has an important point to make about the impact a single random act of violence can have on ordinary people.  For that reason, I actually think it's one of the best movies I've seen, though its message makes it almost harder to watch than some of those disgusting exploitation gorefests.&&Aaaand I shouldn't have Googled August Underground.&&Wait, is he referring to ""Room"" or ""The Room?"" Because those are two very different movies. &&I am tremendously excited that you would even ask me for movie recommendations, and for a moment, my brain was totally blank! 

However, if you haven't watched ""Overboard"" starring Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell or ""A League of Their Own"" with Tom Hanks (he's just the best) and Geena Davis, I would highly recommend them both. If you have, go watch it again! All of these movies make my heart ache with happiness. &&I love rewatching ""Must Love Dogs"" even though I think it was a box office flop. Lots of wry humor, I'd you like that. What's weird is the dog thing is totally secondary to the plot and feels slapped on. It's almost like the movie studio said they had to name it that and add dogs to the script.

It starts with the main character after she's recently divorced. She has a big family and they all try to convince her to start dating. Basically it's ""life after divorce"" which is what they should have named it!&&Danny Deckchair.


&&Try *Waking Ned Devine* or *Secondhand Lions* if you like light feel good movies&&It doesn't. The main struggle is Lars sorting through his emotional issues which doesn't get resolved until the very end of the movie. &&Yeah, opening a restaurant costs as much as renovating a food truck..&&To be fair, that's the vast majority of art analysis.&&[deleted]&&I think that's one of the categories that doesn't get televised. &&🤔&&I looked it up to see what you were talking about.

Mad Max: Fury Road had a very simple plot but was another example of great storytelling.&&Very true... it's almost more like a travel/food doc with great characters involved. Shares a lot with [""The Trip""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740047/) in that sense.. like a doc/narrative fiction crossover.&&The story was also as much about his relationship with his son. And how he uses his food and his cooking skills (the only thing he knows and loves, besides his son) to form a bond with his son. That was what made the movie special. He teaches is son passion for your craft, work ethic, having an uncompromising exacting standard for yourself. His kid learns to love him through his food. &&Agreed. There's a place for rape or sexual violence in media, but damn is it so often a crutch for writers to add ""drama"" that makes a lot of film and television unwatchable for some of my patients. It must be exhausting to have to research what you want to watch before you do it.&&Why doesn't she just say 14 out of 30?&&Holy shit i knew it. I got told i was making this stuff up. Rape is in so many movies for very poor reasons. Carrie Ann Moss did a movie where it was basically one long rape scene. Fucking dreadful. Terrible movie. But hey, rape scenes so it was edgy and gritty and moving right!!!? &&Sure, but if you're making a movie there has to be some kind of plot, and ""nice guy has good things happen to him"" isn't a plot.&&I can sort-of agree with you. It's definitely a sweet-toothed story that relies on things going a little too perfectly in places, but at the same time it didn't break realism entirely for me.

For me, I thought it was clear they weren't a perfect couple, but they realised they were better together than apart. It wasn't a fairytale ending for anyone other than the son, but it was definitely happy.

I think partly this is just down to subjective interpretation, but it does speak to what I see is the problem - that we're so trained to reject happy endings and stories where things work out, that now we can't appreciate them! It makes me worry that people might be becoming more and more self destructive in real life because of what entertainment culture has taught them to seek out for happiness - violence and anger and situations that won't end well.&&It matters if you're living around people who care enough to make it right.

Source: Floridian living near a Cuban community.&&It's really tough finding a good cubano in some areas. For a decently flavored cubano, the pork should marinate for a day or so...

Their Cuban is quite decent.&&No, the food critic was right the whole time - before the movie when he apparently was a fan, in the movie when the creativity is being stifled by management, and at the end when he's cooking for himsrlf again. I think part of the reason the main character reacts as strongly as he does is that he KNOWS the critic is right. There is no criticism so stinging as the truth. I appreciate the movie didn't tie it all up  nicy-nicy by coming out and saying it out loud. &&Thats cause it was not about the food Critic . its a story about a Father and son .

Lmfao&&> I spent the whole second half of the movie waiting for the kid to tragically die in a grease fire.

I kept expecting he was going to run into legal trouble and have his kid taken away from him, either because of child labor laws or child endangerment or something. I kept expecting that the social media angle especially was going to bite them in the ass. Like, the kid would document himself using a giant knife while on a moving vehicle, getting a sip of beer, etc.&& Did you miss the ending where Sophia Vergara bankrolled the new restaurant and was there on opening night clearly getting the credit for it?&&>but it does leave me with a good feeling inside.

Ive never returned anything in my life but this was UNACCEPTABLE. Of course, even though i was polite and courteous and simply asked for my 5 dollars back i still felt as though the cooks and cashier thought i was being difficult. SERIOUSLY???

Everyone loves a happy ending. &&You cast a spell on me, spell on me&&r/evenwithcontext&&Kinda makes you forget all the work that goes into a big budget movie. Even directors of these big box office movies get stressed and want to direct something more small and low key. &&Exactly. There are really two (sometimes three) ways to tell a story. You can tell it with a focus on the plot itself and let the characters kind of take a backseat, or you can focus on the development and change of the characters with a less-than-amazing plot. Chef is what I'd call the latter. It focuses on the characters, and makes it so that we can connect with them. Starting the plot how it does, with the conflicts and depressing elements first is a risky move I'll say. But it worked out to allow us to connect well with the characters. As soon as we have a small connection, the increasingly light-hearted and happy tone of the movie pulls us along. We want these characters to succeed. They're not just another action movie star who will kill everyone (although John Wick is still a fantastic movie). These are people. We root for them to win. &&There and Back Again: A Max’s Tale&&The difference is Fury Road had conflict. Chef really didn’t. Don’t get me wrong, I liked Chef.

I have not felt that pumped up since watching the end of Mortal Kombat as a kid.&&I met Yayan (Mad Dog) at the US embassy in Jakarta years ago, but I didn't know who he was. This was before the movie was released, just trailer. I remember he looked absolutely like a thug; short, with unwelcoming face, ponytail, some facial hair, good posture, long sleeved shirt covering his hands. We're there for our visa interviews. US visa is probably one of the hardest to obtain for us, we always present ourselves as best as we can. While waiting for our numbers to be called, I asked what he do for a living. Smiling politely, he said he's a fight choreographer in a movie. I noticed his folder has The Raid poster in front, so I told him, I saw the trailer and I think it looked great. He smiled shyly and thanked me.
Our numbers were called. Unfortunately, he couldn't speak adequate English and didn't have enough ""proof"" on who's funding his trip to the US (invitation by a company who bought the license, I think it's sony pictures, not sure), so his visa was rejected.

Thinking back, I'm half disappointed for not recognizing him (trailer didn't give much about Mad Dog), and half admire him for being so humble/not arrogant for being an insane ass-kicking national action star.

Side note, we're very happy for this movie for providing Joe Taslim (Jaka in Raid 1) the opportunity to work in Fast & Furious and Star Trek movie. He speaks good English and has a much marketable appearance (tons of ad appearance here in Indonesia). &&Wow haven't heard of the raid or the raid two and my wife and I have been searching for awesome action films to watch. So stoked to rent these!

Edit: the hype train has left the building and is now situated deep into my butt area. &&What about The Raid 2?&&The prison fight scene in Raid 2 was one of the best.&&an amazing movie with an equally amazing sequel...2 of my favorites&&This is a fantastic series of articles by the way. I've been following it for a while, and it's a great read.&&Don't watch it if you don't want it to ruin other action movies for you. &&The Raid 2, was good too, dood! Also check out Donnie Yen's classics. His Hong Kong films are ridiculous. It's less gritty, but still extremely realistic. Comparing rough (with mixed ""street"") fighting vs. MMA masters. one is definitely flashier than the other. 

The Raid and Raid 2, to an extent, are just more rugged. just a matter of preference, so some days I like The Raid more than Yen stuff! 

here's a [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H-3NKj8yO8), and [another](https://youtu.be/iguwXXhDzWU?t=75). if you're a fan of 1, the you're a fan of the other! (TRaid/Donnie Yen). <("")&&Hollywood is remaking this movie, watch them destroy Gareth Evans masterpiece!

Edit: If you enjoyed this movie, I recommend watching Headshot with Iko Uwais in the lead.&&Since we are all talking about Raid 2 as well, I gotta post this video which showcases probably some of my favorite camera work... the creativity into getting such a cool shot amazes me. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kutD5VHUF9U&t=1m50s&&Ahhh man! The raid was amazing. I've seen it many times still remember the scene where the guy breaks the door and then the protagonist kicks him, making him fall backwards on the jagged wood pieces of the door. :O 😱 &&I just need The Raid 3 now &&In my opinion one of the best action movies ever made. With such a low budget, they somehow managed to get such a huge audience overseas and still praised to this day. The movie is basically 80% or even more just fighting/action alone.  
This is still my go-to movie even after 6 years of release, mainly to rewatch the fight scene against the 5 machete guys.&&Highly recommend The Man from Nowhere as well. &&If anyone else is like me and interested in seeing the film, Amazon has it and the sequel bundled for 12 bucks on blu-ray.

&&If anyone needs a Raid fix, Headshot is on netflix (US) now. Its just a basic “I lost my memory, who am I? Oh, I’m a badass killer” story, but the action scenes are of the caliber of the Raid films&&Incredible film, I highly recommend this one and the second one. &&V

This is a true gem for action fans.&&Has anyone ever noticed that The Raid and the newer Judge Dredd are almost  the exact same movie?&&I think I need to rewatch it and see the sequel.  I remember not being that impressed overall compared to something like John Wick.

I love them and I have tried to show a ton of my friends the movies, but they get all critical because it’s martial arts like “There’s no way they could keep actually fighting this long!” And they laughed.

Special mention to Headhunters as another great action flick!&&/r/moviescirclejerk&&They're so good I still cant tell if I like this one or the sequel better&&If you like The Raid, check out Nowhere Man.

So back when I was online dating I would typically take a first date out to this bar downtown. This one particular night I had arrived early and had a few drinks to settle the nerves, once my date arrived I was shocked that she was even more attractive than her profile picture. So the date started off really well, she was laughing, very talkative, and DRINKING. So much so that I ""accidentally"" had a bit too much and by the time we decided to leave I was pretty much hammered.

So in my inebriated state I thought it would be a good idea to bring her along to say hi to a very good friend of mine who is the GM at a local movie theater, which happened to be a couple blocks away from the bar. Now I had no intention of taking this bomb shell of a girl to a movie, I just wanted her to see that I had friends, I guess? So my buddy says hi and asks us if we want to see a movie (he let's me in for free movies all the time so it wasn't like a special favor or anything) I politely decline but she insists and really wants to see something. Now looking back on this moment I get the impression that she didn't want to actually watch a movie but was more interested in going somewhere dark and secluded with me since the date had gone so well so far. So I went along with it since I am always down to see a movie and I was oblivious to her real intentions. So my friend says that he has the perfect movie for us and doesn't say anything more about it and he wants it to be a ""surprise"". 

So I buy some drinks and popcorn and we go sit down in the theater, this is when I immediately started to realize something was up...there was only 1 other person in the theater. There was a guy maybe in his 20s sitting in like the fourth row all by himself. I started thinking that my friend had pulled  a prank on us and set us up with some stupid random movie that was on its last showing. When the movie started and I was watching the first few things I got my second hint that this whole situation was ""off"", lady laying in bed, dude doing crunches, lady laying in bed, dude hitting a post, lady laying in bed, you get the idea. Then the subtitles...
I turned to my date and chuckled and apologized that this was probably a joke from my friend and he set us up in some stupid foreign film and we could just leave...then the movie changed scenes and there were a bunch of swat guys in the back of a van...""Or maybe we could just see where this is going...""
The next hour and 30 mins were packed with some of the greatest fight and action sequences I have ever witnessed. So amazing in fact that I kept yelling out (partly due to me still being a bit drunk) at my date and the gentleman in the fourth row ""DID YOU SEE THAT!?"" ""No FUCKING WAY!"" ""Get WRECKED SON!"" (mind you the guy in the fourth row was also participating in my yelling antics. My date was obviously annoyed and was totally not into the film or my excited responses. Safe to say that I did not get a second date, which is fine cause the next girl I went out with became my wife of 5 years now and FUCKING LOVES The Raid.&&visceral in a title, what year is it???&&I remember randomly seeing the raid 2 in theatres with my uncle at like 15, craziest experience ever. I cherish that memory&&Watch the subbed version.the dubbed sucks.&&An absolute favorite. The Raid 2 was also awesome, though it was a different genre almost completely.&&Yes!! Ditto for the comments blow on the Raid 2 - it was somehow even better than the first.  Both are amazing martial arts/action films.  &&There's a weird issue in Hollywood where people equate ""simplicity"" with ""low-quality."" But ever since MST3K showed us you can enjoy a bad film, there's a trend among audiences to appreciate films that could be considered failures but had a lot of passion, sincerity and audacity to do what they did. Audiences react to that, and Hollywood has tried for years to synthesize it without success.&&I got free tickets to see advanced previews and it opened eyes how sadistic I am... took my parents and girlfriend with me, who were gasping and complaining how gruesome it was. Me, I was in fits of hysterics. 

When done properly, violence in films like The Raid just make me laugh my tits off. &&Reminds me of the later judge dredd. I want to see this. &&My favorite action movie of all time!! &&The director studied the same course I did at uni, I love the raid because it makes me realise that a career in film can exist. I love that a Welshman made an Indonesian film successfully. He discussed the techniques he used to me and I was surprised to find how well he made these simple ideas work. Plus he was a really nice humble guy when we talked
 which always helps.&&Mad dooooooog&&Lethal weapon 5 does it for me&&Talk about timing, just watched ***The Raid 2*** last night. What's most striking to me about the films isn't the incredible fight scenes, but the cinematography. &&Hands down one of the most undernoticed films of all the time. The fight scenes are just epic and a lot of them were long scenes&&I liked sequel even more. Really hope Raid 3 will live up to expectations.

Rumors:
> The Raid 3 was planned for a 2018 or 2019 release.

> The Raid 3 will take place two hours before the end of The Raid 2.&&I come from Ireland this happened to be playing in the cinema, an hours drive away in 'the city', for one night only and I made my folks drive to go see it. Definitely worth it, mind blowing. &&I remember hearing about this movie and being shocked to find it in the theater I was at after I bought a ticket for the Hunger Games. Ended up slipping into The Raid instead as they had the same start times and I and my buddy had the theater to ourselves.  Not that the Hunger Games wasn't entertaining but The Raid was just great. &&I like 2 even better.

It was really a cool moment. &&That boss battle against maddog had checkpoints. That's how long that fight was. You don't need muscle to fuck somebody up.

Every bit as lightning fast and superhumanly agile as a Bruce Lee, but oh so much more brutal and realistic.

Maybe realistic isn't the right word... but it just felt more like what an actual fight to the death between martial arts experts might look like. Sweaty and dirty and bloody and brutal.

&&Also, don’t use the English audio. Completely ruins the movie. &&The Raid and John Wick franchises are the best action films in a long time. Strongly recommended&&buy em!  they are worth it.  two of the best action movies ever&&you'll want to own so you can watch again and again&&Check out Dredd, too.  Practically an identical story.

Elite Squad is also worth watching if you like the whole ""cops battle drug dealers and corruption"" aspect.&&It's brilliant! Don't be confused by an actor playing a bad guy from the first one showing up in the second as a different character. He's a great guy, I just wish they hadn't used him again in a direct sequel playing someone else.&&You are in for a treat. The action in these movies is so well thought out and choreographed. Its like beautiful physically violent poetry.&&Don’t rent; buy it. These are movies you definitely want to own. &&Ah, to go back to watching The Raid for the first time... I envy you. Enjoy! :D&&I'll also recommend The Man From Nowhere (2010) and Dredd (2012) if you haven't seen them. The former is very visceral and a little slower than The Raid, but a great movie. Dredd is very similar to The Raid in terms of environment (single building, multiple floors) but more gun-based. &&They’re a hell of a double feature. 

My mouth was actually agape during the last 30 minutes of The RAID 2. &&The fight scenes are amazing. 
I was really impressed with movies for sure. 
After I watch the raid all other fights in movies look bad for a few weeks. 
It just seems real. &&The raid 2 sets such a high standard for actions movies. The fights are brutal, relentless, and beautifully shot. The story is a great crime drama between all the action. It's easily my favorite action movie with 'The Protector'as a close second and also highly recommended just don't watch the sequel. &&Check out ""The Man From Nowhere"".&&Check out The Man From Nowhere, another nice action / drama film that I feel has a lot of emotion. Not as visceral but really well done IMO. &&Both Raid movies are basically 1h45m amazing fight scenes. &&Keep in mind too that The Raid was made for a million bucks, and the sequel, though much MUCH bigger, cost less than 5 million. Two of my favorite movies.&&Watching the Raid 2 on the big screen is probably the best movie theatre experience I've had.&&I think the Raid 2 is exactly what a sequel should do. Expand on the world and characters while still delivering the same thing people expect from the first film. Though I kinda get why it might turn people off who wanted the exact same thing as the first one. But to me it's a great sequel in the way Alien and Aliens are two different genre of films, yet both complement each other and work in the same world.&&The raid 2 bogged down a lot more than the first one. It lost the simplicity. But the scene where he's in prision is better than anything from the first one.&&The Raid is basically non stop the entire time, its pure action driven.

2 could have cut out maybe 15 minutes and been soooo much better. The action is definitely more brutal and visceral and the fights are insane, but if im gonna watch only one i still pick raid&&Once every few months i go back and watch the kitchen scene over again&&I think most people will agree that it's the better film, although The Raid is definitely more famous. &&It's not as simple or concise as the first, but boy was that so fucking fun to watch.&&One of the best movies I have ever seen! Incredibly choreographed fight scenes, perfectly executed.&&Probably my favorite action movie of all time. It's absolutely insane. Every fight or set piece I was like ""no way they top this!""

Then they do! The boss fight in the kitchen with those hooks or whatever is flat out insane.&&The Raid 2 is much more ostentatious and bloated than the Raid. It doesn't really get to the heart of what the article is praising IMO.

That said it's still a great action movie and the bigger budget translated to more impressive sequences and set pieces than Redemption.&&Raid 2 had no sense of danger. Rama was basically a superhero who you knew would go super saiyan in every fight. The kitchen fight was amazing though.&&Raid 2 was good, but it was kind of an example of ""too much of a good thing"" for me. Gets to the point where the fighta don't have weight or tension because he's already beat up like 100 people, so what's a few more?&&Nope. The Raid 2 tried to have a more complex plot which didn't really work that well and just took away from the amazing action sequences.&&talk about visceral, watching inmates kill prison guards with their bare hands...whew &&Absolutely, I'm real thankful for learning about this series. I just saw [First Blood](https://film.avclub.com/john-rambo-makes-his-dramatic-entrance-in-first-blood-1798250721) (the first ""Rambo"" movie) for the first time, and the author really spells out why it's essential viewing.&&Totally agree - I’d encourage anyone who cares about action movies to review the entire series. Every entry is super in depth and interesting - I look forward to reading the new entries every other Friday. &&Same, I absolutely love action movies and when I see a good one, I just eat that shit up. It sucks that my other friends who aren't as movie nerdy often see action movies as dumb macho explosion type shit. Like Transformers or something.&&Edge of Tomorrow was fun... and I'm not even a big fan of Tom Cruise.&&Ip Man is pretty good too.&&at this point after seeing both of them, fury road and john wick, i don't know how anything will ever compare. i'm hopeful for pacific rim 2, but as awesome as the action was in the 1st, the cheese factor makes it such a different experience&&I'm sure that people said the same thing when stuff like Die Hard and Hard Boiled came out, and yet here we are 25-30 years later because talented directors will always find a way to innovate and/or make action movies enjoyable.&&When I first saw ong bak I thought it was the pinnacle of awesome and no one could out-stunt Tony Jaa. I feel the same way now about the Raid movies. Hopefully another film will have the same impact on a few years.&&People need to watch the SPL movies. Probably the most underrated franchise out there. They're not as ""realistic"" as The Raid or John Wick but more a modern take on traditional martial art crime movies. It sucks the best fight scene from the second one isn't online in its truest form because of copyright.

This is the first movie most famous scene with Donnie Yen and Wu Jing

 https://youtu.be/0xMY5Nv2Kmw

This is a fight scene from the second one with just a *glimpse* at the final fight in the best form I can find. This has Wu Jing and Tony Jaa taking on Max Zhang from IP Man 3 in this one which is a ""sister"" movie of the first one. 

https://youtu.be/XHAZD54vAas&&Meh, fuck that. I love all types of action movies, the Raid was just pretty unique when it came out. It's awesome, but it ain't ruining action movies&&Maybe. I still prefer Tom Yum Goong. &&This is more true than I think most people realize.&&Honestly I feel the same way about watching some of the Hong Kong action movies of the 80s, most American action movies from that era doesn't do anything for me because I watched those after having seen things like Police Story and A Better Tomorrow. &&Ip Man is where it's at.  The scene where he demolishes all the Japanese trainees and reveals his strength is legendary.

EDIT: [Here we go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fgr0zwHG1Q)  Fight itself starts about 5 minutes in.&&Man, the music in the alleyway fight in SPL always gets to me.&&I'd forgotten how big Samo Hung has gotten and he can still move like a ballet dancer. That man's a legend.&&It's more wire-fu than his other stuff, but I'm partial to Dragon Tiger Gate: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rjYWipext_E&&Should also check out Flash Point. The [final fight scene is one of the best ever IMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmwjfoel79o)&&Any specific recommendations from Donnie Yen's classics?&&Why was it snowing in that one scene in Raid 2? Isn’t is always hot there?&&Some of his newer stuff is great, though. Flash Point had some of my favorite fighting scenes, mixing a variety of styles and making the fights look *real*. &&I thought that got shelved a while ago&&Literally what's the point, the first Raid basically didn't have a plot. It was all physical talent and camera work.

How do you think you're going to match that without using the same actors?&&If it's more than absolute garbage I'll be impressed&&The action in Headshot was pretty good, but I thought that the movie part of the movie was pretty bad.&&Headshot was dogshit. So disappointing after watching the raid. The raid 2 is worse han the raid as well but still great. I think that he should stick to movies that have 0 or minimal story and he just beats ass for 90 minutes &&Isn't Dredd pretty much the same movie? He's stuck in an apartment complex with everyone trying to kill him. There's parallels with drugs, action, corruption, and plot twists.&&This was soooo cool when I first learned how they did it. &&The machete/hallway scene! Yes!&&Then you don't remember enough because he grabs his shoulders and jumps backwards forcing him to slam his throat on a broken door. It's way better than you remember. &&You could also watch Merantau, from the same director/Lead Actor combo as The Raid. Very different film in terms of story, but equally enjoyable, and with all that juicy silat action.&&+1 for headshot, fucking great movie&&I would have liked the movie more if they didn't employ shaky cam.&&Not really. They do have Iko Uwais in it, and I’m a fan of the directors for their other movies, but Headshot sucked in term of stories and actions. This movie suffers from shaky cam, bad story telling, etc. It’s so sad because I was hyped for months to see that movie.&&Fuck you EA. &&A true le gem&&""It's the best kind of martial arts movie: the kind where they have to king fu each other to death because in the first half hour everybody runs out of bullets""&&I love the car chase more than anything. &&Yep&&Omg hop on it. The Raid 2 was amazing. It was the Raid 1 with an innovative story LOL&&[deleted]&&Gotta throw in *Fist of Legend* and *Tai Chi Master*. Early 90's Jet Li was no fucking joke.&&[removed]&&Ehh have you seen Ong bak 2 or ip man?&&[Dredd was started first, but released second.](http://screenscreener.blogspot.com/2015/05/competing-film-showdown-raid-redemption.html)&&i think the first one is more raw and brutal, but the 2nd has the best fight scene (the kitchen fight...oooooh its good)&&You mean ""The Man From Nowhere""?

And I second that, great film.&&Also sports movies&&I found the Raid very much cartoonish when it comes to the fighting. You see characters get hit over and over and over again in the face, but they jump up again and start fighting without worse for wear. 
   
This is like if Die Hard was John endlessly walking over broken glass, there's blood but he never actually slows down or gets injured or has difficulty walking.&&When isn't a martial arts over the top?&&Agreed. Felt like more of a back and forth of guys helping each other do pretty telegraphed stunts and trying to look impressive rather than actually being impressive, giving an illusion of realism, or losing me in the action/story. I never felt tension nor was I invested in the outcome. Just guys doing stunts. The last fight was the best at avoiding this but by then I was exhausted. It was no crouching tiger or drunken master. &&Rumors:
>The Raid 3 was planned for a 2018 or 2019 release.
>The Raid 3 will take place two hours before the end of The Raid 2.

edit:

The Raid 3 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3448656/)

Also Gareth Evans mention The Raid 3 back in 2014 after The Raid 2 release - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=YbUmRTXdkRw)

&&Hey man, if a movie knows what it is and delivers exactly what it's promised, I'm sold. &&dude, every time I watch force awakens I get so angry about their cameo. What a huge waste. I mean I was happy to see them in a billion dollar movie, but a huge waste of their talent.&&Fluorescent light tube broken on the ground? [Let's use it to fucking rip out this guy's voicebox](#spoiler).&&The raid 2 kitchen fight is my favorite haha&&Have you watched Hardcore Henry?&&The only time I witnessed something similar was when I saw The Mighty Ducks in the theater on opening night back in 4th grade. The whole place erupted in joy when they beat the Hawks. &&I thought the same. It was way too long, given all the characters were exhausted and had been much better and faster in all previous fights&&There was an english dub? Holy shit really? &&That scene in the second movie where the son has to apologize in English is just so dang cool. It's ruined with the dub tho.&&*Poooo leeeeeeeeeeece...!*&&Don’t forget Dredd. Another recent excellent action movie&&I thought Equalizer was good too. Wish there was a sequel.&&I felt John Wick is to guns with The Raid is to hand to hand combat.&&Equilibrium is also really good. Came out in 2002 and has Christian Bale kill 100+ people. &&I've always much enjoyed well choreographed fight scenes so both of those franchises are high up on my list, but as an overall action film I still have Mad Max: Fury Road above everything. Can't wait for Furiosa!&&John wick 2 was just too ridiculous to me. I couldn't take it seriously.&&That hand fighting scene in the hallway between the MC and the dozen enemies while caring for his buddy was pretty much pure insanity. [(3 min)](https://youtu.be/uI-V0rrlZBo)

My best buddy in college was stoked for this movie and I went in so mild but it was crazy good all around.  Loved every second.&&I watched Raid 2 in a downtown San Francisco in a nearly empty theater. One of my favorite parts of the film is a couple, guy and girl, snuck in about half way through, sat two rows in front of me, and started making out as people are wont to do in nearly empty theaters. Then one of the fight scenes kicked in the dude was like enraptured. Pretty soon he was totally into the movie and girl was like ""Uhhhh..."" before finally leaving. 

The dude stayed through the end of the film before running out. &&Dude. The club scene in a theater.  Dat bass.&&If The Raid is a punch to the stomach, then Raid 2 is a shotgun blast to the face. &&I saw both in the theaters (in NYC). The first one had a smaller crowd, but was totally into it.

The second had a packed theatre and was audibly louder, but wasn't into it as much as the crowd I watched it with for the 1st movie.&&I'm jealous you got to see it in theaters. I bet the fight scene in the *drug warehouse (er first one?) was intense on the big screen. My favorite shot is when the guy jumps through the window and the camera follows him while retaining the side angle. 

EDIT: sorry Porn warehouse.  couldn't find it at the moment, this little section: https://youtu.be/MG9uFX3uYq4?t=1m34s&&I absolutely loved The Raid. I couldn't really stomach the sequel. The first made violence seem real, the second one ramped it up a bit too far for my fragile constitution.&&That car chase doeeee&&I'm a little bit late to the party but I think I have the best story ever about the raid part 2. Living and growing up in LA you have a lot of friends that are in entertainment. One of my friends emails me on a random Tuesday and asked me if I want to attend a movie premiere for an Indonesian movie. I said why not because I love attending premieres. I had no idea what the Raid 2 was Nor had I seen the first movie. The director comes out before the movie and announces it and brings out Rama to do a little martial arts demo and talk about how much they loved making the movie and how excited they were that we were about to see it. Right before they get off the stage the director says ""I hope you enjoy our nice little kids movie."" It was some of the most incredible action sequences I've ever seen, and to see it on the big screen in a packed house is one of the best memories of my entire life. Got to hang out in the after party for a bit and meet the cast. Good Times! 



Fun note: went to go use the restroom and after washing my hands was walking out and ran straight into Iko. We did that little dance that people sometimes do when they both try to go around each other and laughed about it. Two guys were watching outside the door with their mouths hanging open. I hadn't recognized him, and I was like, is that him? Is that the guy? And they were totally in awe and said yes. Iko was incredibly friendly and stopped to chat with everyone and take photos and sign autographs throughout the night. 



https://imgur.com/a/LXLTp&&No. It was too long and overdrawn somewhere in the middle, other than that I might slightly be agreeing with you.&&It's one of those films I never got around to seeing on the big screen, and I really wish I had. It fell totally under my radar until I caught it on DVD a year ago, and I was totally blown away.&&I saw the raid in theaters and at the end of the mad dog fight people were cheering and clapping like it was a sporting event, best movie experience of my life.&&I loved it at the house, we could fast forward through the talking.&&One of the greatest. Agreed.&&I saw the Raid 2 and as soon as the subtitles kicked in, like half the theater got up and left. Their fucking loss. &&[deleted]&&plus the hallway fight with bat and hammers&&As the other user said, I kind of agree that it achieved what a sequel should achieve. I don't think it *could* top the first in simplicity, and the expansion kinda gave it merit as a sequel. Felt like a John Woo Heroic Bloodshed movie with a fisticuffs over firearms focus.&&I prefer the Raid to Raid 2. It was more compact and straightforward. Raid 2 was awesome, don't get me wrong, but there was a rawness and a realness to the first movie that the second didn't have. &&I think The Raid is a better movie, but I go back to Raid 2 more for the just outrageous sequences like the entire last 30 min or so. That car chase, followed by that hallway fight, followed by the kitchen fight. Every time I think ""hey can't top that, time to catch my breath"" they go right ahead and blow themselves out of the water&&I felt the narrative of Raid 2 was overly long and rambling.  The Raid proved that all that narrative was unnecessary.  Its structure is something many major action films have tried to emulate since.

I think the Raid is a much more interesting and important film.&&[deleted]&&The Raid 2 is so forgettable to me. Maybe I need to rewatch it, but The Raid is in that top spot. The in theater experience for this unknown gem was everything I could have ever ask for&&Yeah so I haven't seen either of these movies and there's really no excuse as to why I haven't. I'm going to watch them tonight because it sounds like I'm in for a treat. &&As a kid when I saw Kong rip a Trexs jaw in half, it scarred me for a while. Then I saw that prison scene... 

Though for me I could barely watch the friggin hammer. Like if they used the crushing part, sure I can deal with that, but who the heck uses the other end?!&&> There are still people, even after the Oscar nominations, who think that Sylvester Stallone can’t act.

Wow, after what we found out about Hollywood and the Oscars these last couple of weeks, that sure comes across differently.  &&I envy you. After over 30 years, it still holds up fantastically.  

For that matter, so do the first two Rocky movies.&&Honestly it helps if you're NOT a fan of Tom Cruise because, well, spoiler, you see him die a whole bunch. Sometimes hilariously.&&There's a sequel in the making too, I'm pretty excited for it.&&Yeah I still need to check that out &&The ten man fight is bananas. &&It suffers from a terrible case of Sequelitis, though. First movie is great.&&You ever see Dredd? It drew a ton of inspiration from The Raid, if i remember right. I'd put it right up there with JW and MM:FR &&Fury Road I still loved, the action was very different. Honestly though I think this kept me from enjoying John Wick as much as most people. They seemed similar in that they wanted to go with minimal story and let the action do the talking. It took me a few years to watch John Wick and after hearing people hype the action so much it felt very underwhelming. I honestly spent most of the movie thinking ""damn, I should have just watched The Raid again"" 

Loved Pacific Rim but like you said it's very different in tone&&Let me put it this way. I used to like the fight scenes in The Matrix. Really I think this just applies to martial arts based action movies. 

I felt much the same way once I discovered Tony Jaa.&&I think it will be harder to top The Raid movies because Gareth Evans is pretty good at writing and directing.  Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong are amazing, but only because of their fight scenes.  I don't think Gareth Evans would make an Ong Bak 2.&&It still give me chill after watching this scene for like 10th time. The ""I want to fight 10 people!"" has became the meme at that time the movie first shown.&&From the Wikipedia article on Donnie Yen
> Yen was at a nightclub with his then girlfriend, Joey Meng. Inside the nightclub, Joey got harassed by a troublesome gang that had taken an interest in her. Yen warned them to leave her alone, but they persisted to cause trouble. As Yen and Joey left the club, the gang followed and attacked Yen. According to the news, Yen beat up eight members of the gang who were later hospitalized.

He's a real life badass...

&&love that scene! I love how its all 1 on 1 fights and the one time somebody fights 3 he gets his ass kicked. Then Ip man wrecks 10! such a good set up&&Jesus Christ yes! I loved that fight.&&Sick. &&According to IMDb it's still active with Joe carnahan directing & producing&&The actors were amazing that is true, but the real talent was the stunt team, stunt coordinators and the martial experts also several of the cast had martial arts expertise, I really don't know how hollywood is going to top this. &&It would make more sense for Hollywood to do a third film with Evans at the helm imo.&&Also hard to see how you would translate the setting. The original is all about a team of cops being cut off and overwhelmed in an urban setting. In the US you would just expect them to send increasing numbers of armoured vehicles, snipers and helicopters to solve the problem.&&One of my favorite things about The Raid is Pencak Silat is such an underrepresented martial art in action movies.
&&I'd argue that Merantau is a better Ong Bak.&&*sees the word visceral*


****TRIGGERED***&&Have you seen the behind the scenes for that part of the movie? The camerawork is nuts. They have a guy dressed as a car seat, that's all I'll say. &&Sort of like The Raid meets The Departed/Internal Affairs. &&Oldboy as well one of the best fight scenes I have seen. &&need to watch this one....&&Oh my god, The Protector is one of my favorite martial arts movies just for that long ass take. So fucking amazing&&Tony Jaa is a beast. The first ung bak had a special place in my heart and the protector was awesome as well (member that one scene where he did a guile blade kick and shattered the bulb in the street lamp? By gawd!)&&Opening fight scene in FoL! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0765hEzZtqk&&ip man is like a kids documentary in comparison....&&I meant like I absolutely loved both movies. But it was always something interesting I noticed.&&People talk about how viseral, raw and real the film is but nobody fights like that, it doesnt work and so are the gun fights. Its like they ghosting on COD they are  running through the building pretty reckless until they come to the room where the bad guys are camping - then they are super careful. Same thing annoys me so much at the end of Heat when Al Pacino is running after bobby and all of a sudden he is super careful where de niro is camping.

 If you are into over the top action films I get you liking it, thats not my taste in film. I watch so much fighting from thai boxing, boxing, kickboxing, mma and to the trained eye it looks so fake and none of it would work. In that case I like jackie chan films better because its tongue in cheek comedy about his fights and stunts not to be taken serious. 

EDIT: In action films i rather watch car chases, sword and gun fights because I havent seen real ones so to my imagination and logically it doesnt bother me.&&The link goes to front page Reddit?&&Hallway fight where he bounces the guys head down the wall and the camera tracks the guys movement was mine. &&I was about to say.

>Action movies don’t come much more visceral, simple, or awesome than The Raid

The first thing I thought of when I read the title was, ""Did you see the sequel?"". That kitchen fight was probably the greatest fight of all time. &&Those fucking knives made that fight brutal as fuck. Holy shit. That was bloody.&&Yup holy shit. Raid 2 wasn’t as good as Raid 1 but the kitchen and night club scenes might be two of the best fight scenes I’ve ever watched. 

Also shout out to “Headshot” on Netflix. iko uwais is in it. Another amazing action film. 

other fight films I love: Ong Bak, Kill Zone 2 (Tony Jaa, fuck yea), Ip Man, The Man From Nowhere.&&This. Best fight scene I have ever seen. The choreography is ridiculous. &&The Kitchen Fight is the best fight seen ever. It is so real how they get more exhausted and weak from all the punches. It is so brutal and yet so amazing and beautyfull. I watched that scene at least 50 times.&&HCH sets the standard. That movie was wildly entertaining, as long as you go into it thinking, ""this movie has been created just to see how cool a first person action film could be."" 

That being said, the actual ""boss fight"" in HCH was fucking glorious. &&Motion Sickness The Motion Picture&&Spoilers! &&It's not worth winning if you can't win big&&What, you've never super-effectively punched somebody a thousand times after being brutally beaten and stabbed through the hand?&&Yeah. It's bad. Really bad.

I normally don't mind dubs, but in this case it was unwatchable. &&It's really shit and just spoils the movie&&Like the hilarious Steins;gate English scene the dub ruined. &&Was that actor really bi-lingual, or did they do a dub? Because if he's bi-lingual that's a really good American accent. &&Absolutely. I think it was pretty heavily influenced by the Raid as well....given it has almost exactly the same plot.

Went in expecting over the top action and visceral violence. Did not disappoint.

Edit: apparently the similarities were just a really crazy coincidence.&&The action in Dredd is nowhere near as good as the other two.&&I'd add the Equalizer as well... it's not on the same level as Dredd, The Raid or John Wick but it's good&&The documentary about Steve Buscemi's time as a firefighter on 9/11 wasn't exactly an action movie but I also highly recommend it. Gets your heart going nonetheless. &&I believe they are making one. I just rewatched the Equalizer the other day, and it’s easily one of the best action movies imo. &&They're filming the sequel in Boston right now.&&Wick is also pencils though.&&Suffers from a bit of post-Matrix cinematics but still a solid film&&*Equilibrium* is solid but it's not really in the league of these films or similar to it. It's much more story based and the action scenes are nowhere near as technically proficient or wells scripted - although gun kata was cool as hell. &&Fantastic film. So beautiful. Do Planet Terror and the Desperado films count as action? They are fantastic too. Love Rodriguez. &&I honestly can't think of a more entertaining movie. I'm always down for rewatching it. Not just, because of the action but all the bonkers characters too. &&>One of my favorite parts of the film is a couple, guy and girl, snuck in about half way through, sat two rows in front of me, and started making out as people are wont to do in nearly empty theaters.

Uhm... That wasn't part of the movie.&&It was a good story even without her walking off. Your embellishment killed it. &&r/thathappened&&Got to have priorities.&&I feel like I'm one of the few who like the second one more than the first one. I can't believe it's over 2 1/2 hours long. &&Eka would like a word with you...&&Nice! That should be on the poster.&&[deleted]&&I tried watching it while drunk. It didn't go well. I had to stop and go on a run after the Prison fight because holy goddamn that was brutal. Went back a few days later and enjoyed the hell out of it, but good lord it's... yeah.&&The sequel felt more like a wuxia movie to me with superheroes and villains.  What I really liked about that first one is that authenticity of the tone.  Like these could be actual gun battles and fistfights taking place.  The sequel was grander and entered that uncanny valley of action where superhero movies exist.&&I've only seen the first one I think. It was awesome, very visceral. &&I feel like John Wick 2 was really missing a climactic final battle like its prequel.

The Ares fight had so much behind it, but ended with no real suspense and just fell to pieces.&&I think both sequels went too hard on the ""expand the world"", *specially* John Wick 2. Is there ANYONE on that city that isn't an assassin? I think they went too ""LET'S MAKE THIS BADASS!"" with the assassin guild to the point of making it, IMO, stupid.  
The Raid 2, OTOH went from a movie focused on a very narrow action and time scale to a grandiose epic that went a bit too far. The movie is too long, to the point of getting a bit tiring. I liked it more than John Wick 2, although the action scenes in JW2 are just amazing.&&Jw2 was quite boring compared to the first one. There was no reason to care, no villian to hate, and they pretty much broke the rules of the fratenal order of assassins because its John Wick. And they lied in the trailers about a car chase with his mustang. &&And the kitchen fight - probably my favourite fight scene in any movie

I absolutely loved the girl with the hammers though, was such a cool, unique character and weapon choice&&Old Boy was great!&&when he hits bat-man in the face with his bat so hard, the bat gets stuck. jesus I loved that fight. &&Oh yeah it was definitely a worthy sequel. I'll always prefer the first, but it's impossible to top that one.&&Agree wholeheartedly.  The beauty of The Raid was in its simplicity:  The bad guys are holed up in a building.  The good guys go in, and everything goes to hell.  There was the brothers subplot, but that was about it.  Otherwise it was visceral, balls to the wall action.  The second one was awesome, but it got pretty convoluted and bloated with too much unnecessary plot twisting/turning, IMO.&&I still prefer The Raid 2, but that is a good point. Watched The Raid 2 with a family member a few weeks ago and spent a lot of time explaining what was going on. &&[deleted]&&Agreed. Raid 2 had some better scenes but needed an hour cut out of it.&&Raid 2 killed off his bro in the first scene. Instant fail &&one of my all-time favorite car chases &&Same here, despite me liking 2 plenty. &&Yeah, the claustrophobic feel adds up to the experience.&&I totally agree about the in-theater experience. My friends and I were looking for a movie to go see, scrolling through Fandango and we saw The Raid, had no idea what it was, watched 2 minutes of the trailer and bought tickets for the next showing. Loved it ever since. &&Honestly think most of the he can't act stuff comes from three things. 

1. He's an action star. So many people just immediately write of action movies and actors simply because of the genre.

2.  He made a lot of duds back in the day. Just very poor script choices. See ""Stop or my Mom Will Shoot"".

3. He's been fairly open about being a Republican. Not saying all people let that affect their opinions but it is certainly not gonna help you in Hollywood.

Of course many people just might not like him because he's not their cup of tea. Totally fair. For example I think Meryl Streep is ridiculously overated but I'm sure most people think I'm nuts saying that.&&While absolutely true, I was hoping fans would enjoy the hilarity as well.&&It's Sci fi, it's intense, it's a little mind fucky...and it's even funny at times which suprised me the most. &&From the Wikipedia article on Donnie Yen (actor/martial artist who plays Ip Man) 
> Yen was at a nightclub with his then girlfriend, Joey Meng. Inside the nightclub, Joey got harassed by a troublesome gang that had taken an interest in her. Yen warned them to leave her alone, but they persisted to cause trouble. As Yen and Joey left the club, the gang followed and attacked Yen. According to the news, Yen beat up eight members of the gang who were later hospitalized.

He's a real life badass...&&Watching it the first time I thought it was a bit cheesy. Then the war broke out and I realized it was just setting things up so the change would be drastic. Then that fight scene happened and I was blown away. It was just so....brutal. &&When I tell people about that movie and they say it sounds boring/lame I show them that fight scene. Their thoughts about it quickly change. &&You can feel his rage during that fight. It's so great. All those Japanese martial artists had no idea what they were in for. &&I don't think you'll ever get a successful Chinese movie without a ton of sequels and knock offs.&&Dredd and Raid came out close together, but Dredd had actually been in production for longer, and any similarities are coincidental. Which is a shame, they're both awesome movies but I think Dredd suffered a bit in the cinemas due to comparisons room Raid&&I enjoyed Dredd, but it didn't feel nowhere as intense and thrilling as The Raid honestly.&&oh i was including fury road in the awesomeness haha, and john wick i think i loved so much simply because i hadn't seen any hype when i watched it and was expecting mediocrity to decent, the soundtrack, the style and the boldness in just going with whatever they wanted made it such a wild ride

have you seen turbo kid? that's a fun ass trip that can best be described as fury road on bikes&&I still really like the matrix. When neo fights Smith in the train tunnel, in particular, when he shakes the dust off his shirt and beckons Smith forward, that's one of my all time favorite single moments in a fight scene. Might be a lot of nostalgia, but I think the movie holds up.&&Weren't the actors the martial arts experts?  I read in an interview that the director came up with the movie when he saw the actors for rama and mad dog sparring in their traditional martial art (the one in the movie).&&Iko Uwais (Rama) and Yayan Ruihan (Mad Dog/ Prakoso) are both Pencak Silat practitioners for many many years before they got into this movie/acting business. Like even for John Wick, Keanu Reeves had to train rigorously with Taran Tactical for like a year to pull off what was displayed in the brilliance that is the John Wick franchise. For actors with no martial arts background to be in a remake of a movie notorious for its raw fighting and physical talent/skill? It’ll take a miracle to be even half of what The Raid is. I mean even the Assassin in Raid 2’s Kitchen fight was a practitioner of Pencak Silat for most of his life. Batman if I remember correctly does as well, Hammer Girl however does not. But mainly the lead actor Iko and Yayan who are experienced martial artists themselves choreographing the fights is a big plus to the way the movie is filmed and put together. &&I know that word is thrown around a lot and it kinda loses its meaning and all, but holy fuck am i triggered. We waited for star wars 1313 to come out, gets cancelled. We wait for this new star wars rpg to come out, gets cancelled. Im positive we wont see a 3rd person jedi game until after this new star wars trilogy. Fuck you EA. &&Oldboy is not even in the same realm as a martial arts movie though.&&[Boss battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV-n03sB4bE)&&These children you speak of, they have good taste. &&I did too. Interesting blog post about it.&&I’m glad someone else shares my opinion of this series.  Also makes sense since I also watch a bunch of Muay Thai and MMA.  Apart from the fight choreography standing out as ridiculously over the top, I also can’t stand how everybody in that movie knows kung fu, even the science guys in the drug lab. It got to  he point where I felt it was repeating the same 3 fight scenes over and over.  

I also had to laugh at how convenient it was when he ran into guys with weapons, he also had weapons, and when he had no weapons, his enemies also had no weapons.  

Give me Jackie Chan’s Drunken Master any day.  Or for a serious action movie give me Mad Max Fury Road.  Hell, I even liked the newer Dredd movie over The Raid, which had the same plot. 
&&I understand your point.  I'm no fight expert but I agree with you that nobody fights like that in real life.  I think it all comes down to film makers just wanting to keep the action fast paced and entertaining. What action movies would you say have more realistic fight scenes?  Only one I could think of would maybe be the movie Haywire with Gina Carano. &&It's how /r/movies works with spoiler tags. \[](#spoiler) doesn't work on mobile. https://i.imgur.com/OCXEpy3.png&&The part where he impales the dudes neck on the broken door got me. &&There is an episode in Arrow where they pay homage to that scene specifically. I remember seeing it and going ""that's from The Raid!"" at the time.&&That was the moment where I said to myself ""This. Movie. Rules!"" 

Obviously many more followed&&That was the first Raid movie &&Apparently the cameras weren't sped up or anything. That was real time. &&I've wanted my own set of karambits ever since i saw that. But they'd be illegal to carry for self defense haha&&Bro, the hallway fight with the bat dude and the hammers chick though, bruh.&&It's too hard to pick a favorite out of the two for me. The first one had better gunfights, the second one had better fist fights. The first one had better pacing, the second had a bigger story. Both films are so intense and gnarly as fuck. I still show friends and coworkers the kitchen fight from Berendal if they ask me what ""The Raid"" is all about &&Headshot is crazy good as well! &&put some more respect on the car chase scene, the fact that they used so few cuts makes it just so beautifull!&&Camera work during the car chase in 2 was on point. &&The Raid 2 was DEFINITELY better than Raid 1.  It's one of the few times where a sequel has to contend against an insanely strong first movie and surpasses it.

The Raid 2 was amazing.&&Never have I felt “my body is ready” more than when he saw the adrenaline.&&I watched that film on acid with no idea what the film was about except for a friend saying ""watch this film""

my fucking word it threw me for loops&&Visually that movie was beautiful. I hope it encourages more creative movie perspectives.&&Nah that’s Cloverfield&&I think it depends on the person, I didn't really have a problem with it, but know my friend complained a little bit despite enjoying it.&&Shit I was gonna show this to my dad but he hates subtitles. Is it really that horrible? &&I'd go into it like a B-movie and enjoy the shit out of it!&&I felt that was the only scene in the dub that was painful to watch.  IIRC, the rest of the dub was great, though.&&Yes, that was all him.  And he's at least tri-lingual;  Grew up in Germany.  &&Actual Lee, the plot similarities were coincidental.  Production started on Dredd first, but the Raid happened to come out first.&&They were both being made at the same time. Funny how that works, but Dredd was based off of one of the comic arcs IIRC. &&The violence in that movie was beautiful. Perfect use of slomo&&It's essentially a more restrained John Wick. Very good at just setting up the protagonist through what he's doing. 

Haven't heard about it anywhere, but it's a legit movie.&&I think the ideas raised by the movie hold even more value than the action. I think the cinematics were done well enough that if I didn’t know matriz came out first I’d have thought matrix copied from it. &&Desperado = Death Proof or do you mean the Mariachi trilogy? &&hahahaha
hahahahahahahahaha&&It is now.&&To be fair she wasn’t mad, just seemed sort of confused and bored &&I'm sure something similar has happened thousands of times. Maybe the girl doesn't leave but people go to a movie to mess around all the time and sometimes it ends up being a really good movie.&&Lol I read the same comment in a thread when the movie first came out&&/r/nothinghappens &&The first is really cool for being so tight, simple, and quick. But the plot in the raid 2 was actually *good.* Good tension, better cinematography, better fight scenes, all that. &&I was just glad there was more of The Raid.&&I actually preferred the narrative and action in The Raid 2. Such a successful sequel on all parts.&&This is because the sequel wasn't originally a sequel. The script was written for something else entirely, and they just bolted some Raid things on to it. This is also why Yayan Ruhian is in both movies, but playing different characters.&&Yeah, they didn't really need to complicate the story that much. Still good though &&I agree. The first one knew exactly what it was and ran all the way with it. &&I really wished i knew 2 would ramp up the story. Didn't find it to be as enjoyable because of it. Maybe if I knew going in&&the mirror sequence combined with the music was one of the smartest and most beautiful fight sequences of all time tho&&For me it was pretty good because it really shows that this badass John Wick is now running for his life because the entire world of assassins is against him.  He's got no weapons and possibly no hope to go back home to his dog.  &&it set up the 3rd movie though. John Wick vs The World&&They didn’t expand on her character too much, you don’t know what she was capable of,  so I’m guessing the writers got that as well and just had John kill her so easily because of it. &&Exactly. Both of these movies were groundbreaking because of not trying to feign a bad story like most action movies. Both sequels wound up doing exactly that and not living up to the firsts because of it. &&That's just your opinion. &&The kitchen fight was maybe the first time I *really* noticed how amazing movie makeup can be.  By the end of it they look like raw meat and it's amazing.&&That kitchen fight is amazing! It starts out very formal and technical, but by the end they’re just nakedly hacking one another to pieces.&&I watched a lot of martial arts movies and the kitchen fight from Raid 2 left me absolutely speechless, definitely the best fighting scene I've ever seen.&&that fight is seriously jaw dropping.&&>I absolutely loved the girl with the hammers though, was such a cool, unique character and weapon choice

Her introduction on the train (or was it a bus?) was incredibly brutal. I winced a bit at one or two of her executions. &&True, that was a golden film. &&And it was basically beat for beat the same film as Dredd. Both excellent. Both released within weeks of each other. &&I think Raid 2 has better overall fights but the plot is a bloated mess.

Raid is compact and perfect as a story telling vehicle for kick ass action. &&Raid 1 and Wick 1 were a lot more grounded so I definitely agree. The second ones make it feel less real. &&Interested to hear why you thought JW2 was retarded&&I’ve lived in Jakarta for a bit and I’m amazed that they managed to shoot it at all. IRL the streets are jammed as hell.&&Some of the things they did to film that were crazy. 

http://youtu.be/ErrRhXItBWc&&Also don't forget the *yoga scene*&&He learn Wing Chun since he's a kid and i think his mother were one of the renown martial artist too. Everyone know not to mess with One Inch Punch man.&&It's more than just a martial arts film, it's an emotional rollercoaster.  The tragedy of having to use violence to survive instead of using it as a hobby and self-improvement... it's almost like a serious version of one punch man.  The conflict isn't ""Will Man kick their asses?"", it's ""How much longer will he have to kick everyone's ass?""&&I'm fine with sequels conceptually, but the sequels to Ip Man don't really do anything other than make it way more obvious that it's all just Chinese propaganda. Which I'd still be okay with if they were also good movies, but they aren't.&&About a year apart. I thought it was more. But considering production time, yeah.  Wow, im really surprised.  Im remember skipping Dredd's theater release. I don't think it was marketed very well. It definitely seemed like just another reboot/cashgrab but im really glad i finally watched it &&I feel insane sometimes for thinking that Dredd is better than The Raid. &&No but that sounds really cool, I'll have to check it out &&Yea they are&&I was actually hyped for this new Star Wars game as an avid Cyberpunk fan, really sad it's never going to happen since Visceral was one of my favorite devs.


CD Projekt Red gets my money now.

Honestly I only ever liked Battlefield 3, Bad Company 2, and MoH:Warfighter and that's about it, EA can go fuck themselves up the ass.&&No, but like I said still has one of the best fight scenes I have seen. &&oldboy isn't a martial arts movie tho, but it does have that one amazing fight scene that's on par with the greats&&I actually watched Oldboy because I was under the impression that it was a martial arts film based on how people talked about that one single scene. Boy was I surprised!&&i don't like this word, but that's epic.&&Yesss. Just referenced drunken master in another comment! If you haven't read it check Roger Ebert's review http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-legend-of-drunken-master-2000
Unfortunately, I didn't quite enjoy Fury Road as much as I was hoping :/&&Works on RIF&&I loved that one. After few minutes of great hand to hand fighting they just just came up with something so beautiful and innovative (well, as far as I can tell at least) my jaw actually dropped and I gave this really  dumb smile. The kind you might give when you absolutely didn't see that shit coming, and you know you don't deserve it, but it did happen, you got to experience it and you just feel happy and grateful.&&This scene made me jump up in the theater...I had never done that but it was so brutal and awesome at the same time it was a just a reflexive reaction&&This is the shot I immediately think of any time The Raid is brought up, just the quick 2 seconds of carnage.&&What?

Jesus Christ that's fast&&Fuuuuck yeah. That’s some live action anime shit. Yo okay. So that whole movie is just killer fight scene. The prison fight when he takes on like 20 dudes jumpin over the bathroom wall? &&That bus scene tho! Holy shit. &&""Don't stop me now!""&&I'd love more first-person films. A crazy idea we'd never see is a Metroid film that takes place primarily in first-person. &&How can u hate subtitles?&&It's not *awful* but it's absolutely not as good. Completely changes the feel of the movie in a way.&&How old is he/does he like spaghetti westerns?

My dad doesn't mind cheesy dubbing but hate subs.&&why is everyone in raid 2 so amazing and I'm here like can't do that fighting... only speaking one language. I'm lame 😫&&[deleted]&&Dredd's script got leaked shortly before the Raid went into very quick production. Maybe coincidence, maybe not.&&MingLee&&Actual Lee. Wasn't that a Garbage Pail Kid?&&Ahh the Lee family. Why havent they made an action movie of them yet. Actual , Essential, Apparent, General, Sexual and Decisive (Lee) take the streets back and sweep crime under the rug. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Directed by Michael Bay. A Weinstein Co. Production.&&What I had heard was the Raid had gotten a hold of a leaked dredd script and basically copied it. Not that it matters to me they are both awesome movies &&And 3D!  One of the few movies where 3D really heightens the experience&&The thing about John Wick is that he is a badass and he looks like a badass. Robert McCall looks like a Dad and you wouldn’t expect much out of him considering his slow and thoughtful demeanor, but he ends up being just as badass as John Wick. &&I tried.&&It was probably me because it literally happened and made the entire experiences more memorable &&When a movie doesn't feel like it's run time, that's excellent pacing. I think it's a total of 2 hours and 40 minutes. &&Yeah, even though I fucking loved The Raid, the sequel managed to top my expectations. Great characters, interesting narrative, phenomenal set pieces. That car chase sequence is amazing.&&iirc the raid 2 was the initial movie they wanted to make but couldn't get the funding, so they did the raid basically a proof of concept so he could make his original idea, now a sequel &&Considering that they jettison everything that has to do with The Raid in the first 15 minutes, that isn't surprising.&&I've never been more confused by a movie than I was when Mad Dog showed up in The Raid 2.&&Yes. But its really hard if not down right impossible to beat the club scene from the original.

I think the only thing that really comes close (not counting the raid) is the Church scene from Kingsman &&His dog was running with him.&&My dad loves the old Kung-Fu movies, and he heard about these ones, and saw I had them both. His face after the kitchen fight was priceless, b/c he said fighting movies nowadays don't stack up to the old Bruce Lee ones. &&I don't hold Dredd in as high esteem as some almost solely because I saw The Raid a few days before I saw Dredd. Like the twist in Fight Club would have been better for me if I hadn't seen a more stunning one in The Sixth Sense a few weeks prior.

On a less similar note I tried watching Ghost in the Shell (2017) this week, and I probably wouldn't have considered it a good film anyway, but after seeing Blade Runner 2049 last week it was like trying to watch a student film.&&True!  I enjoyed Dredd but I honestly never made that connection somehow.&&Raid 2 was like lets combine The Raid with 'The departed/infernal affairs'.

Except I just wanted action.&&The Raid 2 wasn't that complicated. Just wasn't as simple as The Raid. The Raid 2 was actually first written, but The Raid was created to help lead into two. Imagine if The Raid 2 came out first and The Raid came as a prequel. One might have a completely different opinion. &&Wasn't it the other way around? The Raid 2 has more plots and dialogues while The Raid 1's plot is like an ""excuse plot"" in older video games. &&[deleted]&&I read somewhere that the scene was basically cars going around some loop over and over again.  Also, there's a [pretty cool shot](https://youtu.be/6D-ArhREOS0?t=1m51s) leaving the front vehicle, moving outside and then back into the trailing car.  &&You pretty much have to leave your objections to Chinese nationalism at the door to enjoy Chinese cinema.  They may be worse than the U.S. about it since they have a central film authority.  But I expect people from other countries would often voice the same objections about Hollywood films.  It's generally a given that Americans are going to be the good guys in any film produced here.&&I think a lot of what was wrong with Dredds marketing was that they kept advertising it as a 3d movie and I think that hurt it&&netflix has it, fountains of delightful gore&&Ya theyve had few diamonds in the rough. But overall theyre a money whoring company who dont give a fuck about their customers. &&You know, I got hyped watching Oldboy waiting for a badass scene. I wasn’t impressed at all. &&Can confirm, was just blocked out text until I clicked. &&I don't understand why /r/Movies uses (#spoiler) when majority of other subreddits and mobile clients use (/spoiler).&&The part where there are like 4 or so members of the team left fighting in that small room and one of them gets stuck in the hole leading to a room below....that entire sequence was nuts as well. &&Oh yeah,martial artists have been slowing down for the camera for ages, the old ones just caught blurs if they went full speed.&&The highway scene is so well shot. Check out behind the scenes if you can. One camera man is literally a car seat. Another camera man is in a little cage outside the car. They went through great lengths to make that movie as amazing as it was &&The fight in the prison courtyard was my favourite scene, when he's trying to stop the other guy getting killed &&*picks up pool cue*&&I know a shocking amount of people who hate subtitles.  &&Because it takes away from the action when watching an action movie. You have to read the subtitles and watch the action at the same time, you're guaranteed to miss at least a little of the action.&&Films are meant to be taken in with your eyes ... they're visual. Subtitles take your eyes off what's happening visually and make you focus at the bottom of the screen.  

You can miss so much of the nuances of acting and directing because your eyes aren't on the characters, they're on the words at the bottom.  Sure, you can bounce back and forth, but that's NOT what the director of the film ever intended your eyes to do. It ruins the director's original vision for the cinematography. 


&&Name's Lee. Actual, Lee.&&To be fair it isn't a super complicated premise.  I could definitely see it being a coincidence.&&> A Weinstein Co. Production.

Is that the one where Weinstein has a cameo as Abhorrent Lee?&&Yeah that's pretty much spot-on.&&I like your username. We’re putting together an elite team of power shitters and we’d sure like for you to consider it.&&that Club scene is all-time. best moment is when he tries to fire an empty clip and reloads like a fucking machine to get the head shot just in time. &&this is basically a genre in itself: random awesome total crazy killing machine scene&&Thats another movie whose sequel fell short. Thr first Kingsman was great because it was so unique, so when the 2nd didnt really add anything to that, not to mention it kinda fell back on a lot of action movie cliches and it was pretty predictable.

But i like John Wick 2 a lot. It was better than the 2nd Kingsman movie.&&Oh yeah, just checked it again.  Well at least he's got his dog now.&&Haha my father says the same, after watching The Raid the first thing he said was ""I bet that guy would put up a good fight against Bruce"", and same with Mad Dog&&Well you're on the money, because the raid 2 was a different film script the director of the first raid wanted to do. But after the international success of the Raid they renamed it and did minor plot tweaking to make it a sequel&&Thank you!  I don't understand how viewers think the sequel was anything but a straightforward story.  The director said he definitely wanted to make a different film than the first one- plus if a final one comes out, it'll be different than the first two.  A Raid horror, perhaps?  He's got some experience with his VHS 2 entry. &&I didn't really hate it [the action scenes easily save it] but I totally agree with you, they exaggerated on the plot stuff.&&But he killed those two guys! With a fooking peensil!&&My Jakartan friends were a bit disoriented because they recognized the locations as far apart to each other but wow, they really did close off those major streets for a couple of days. That in itself is no mean feat, and the results were mindblowing. Thanks for the featurette!&&And it's annoying when we do it, too. But it's just another reason on the pile of them that makes the Transformer movies useless, artless pieces of garbage.&&It really did. People got sick of the whole ""COME SEE THIS, ITS 3D!"" b.s., even though the film didn't actually lean on it that much. 

I really hope the rumors that there are talks about a Dredd premium television show staarrojg Karl Urban are true. It'd be like Law & Order, except called Law & More Law. &&Which sucks because it's one of very few movies that I actually think used 3D right. Those drug scenes were absolutely amazing in 3D.&&Eh, I like it not so much because of the choreography, but because it was a pan view with no cutaways unlike all the shitty American fight scenes. That's what made it so great for me. &&The bench curb stomp and the leg break get me every time from that scene&&When he puts the knife in that dude's leg and drags it all the way down to his ankle OMFG&&It does involve a lot of reading, which isn't ideal for those with sight issues.

Personally, I prefer subtitles over dubbing.&&>Sure, you can bounce back and forth, but that's NOT what the director of the film ever intended your eyes to do. It ruins the director's original vision for the cinematography. 

I guess that's fine if you don't mind the fact that if you're watching a dub, literally none of the voice acting is the director or any of the original actors' visions and the voice script is usually even farther away from the original dialogue than the subtitles would be.&&It's such a great, straightforward premise though. The Raid really ignited my love for siege thrillers. Assault on Precinct 13, The Green Room, 30 Days of Night. There's something about ""hoard mode"" that really works for me as a movie set-up.&&Where do I sign up?&&Hi there&&Not sure I ever needed to hear the phrase ""power shitter,"" but here I am.&&The Raid 2 should've been the guy fighting his way back *out* of the building.&&No, Raid 2 was the movie Gareth Evans wanted to make as Raid 1. He could not find the budget/resources for it, and decided to go with a simpler movie which is how you ended up with the first one. Raid 2 was the movie he wanted to make from the beginning.

[Source](http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1531619/welsh-director-gareth-evans-second-raid-movie-all-action)&&The only thing the Raid 2 adds is a third self-interested faction 1.
 (Rama and the cops; 2. Bunawar and his mafia and; 3. Bejo and his upstart mob) and therefore a third storyline to follow. Personally, The Raid 2 is my very favorite action movie. I'm a sucker for kung fu movies and it has peerless action.&&I am the Law & Order &&> show **staarrojg** Karl Urban are true

Are you doing alright?

&&Oh yeah I totally appreciated that. Seemed incredibly realistic.

Marvel Studios' Black Panther - Official Trailer,27164,76qb1h,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjDjIWPwcPU,4574,1508158842.0,,"The tree scene looks like it might be about delving into the more mystical side of Black Panther which could be cool&&This looks tight, but my main takeaway is, ""Black Panther *really* likes to hang off of cars.""&&I get the feeling from Killmonger's little ""burn the world and start again"" speech that he's looking to end the era of Wakandan isolation and begin an era of Wakandan domination. Fits with the ""superpatriot"" nature of the character.

Wakanda first!&&My reaction watching this trailer http://i.imgur.com/8Lglal0.gif&&Jeez, that suit in live-action just...*works.*&&I'm unclear about this revolution. Will it be televised? Can I stream it? Is it going to be a Twitch thing? Lot of questions on my end.&&My jaw dropped when MBJs suit materialized&&The suit materializing on the wearer is really fucking cool. Looks like Black Panther is beating Iron Man to the punch on the Bleeding Edge armor, I wonder if it will inspire Tony to build the BE armor.&&More importantly Funhaus finally got ‘Mothers Be Aware’. &&music: [Vince Staples - BagBak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF6x7g5ZfwM)&&I love it. And the world-building that they're setting up in establishing Wakanda's culture, society and government - man, Coogler is going to *kill it* and I cannot wait. Not to mention that the futuristic set design and costumes are on point. 

And the colours and cinematography, sweet jesus. So *lively*.&&He has by far the sweetest superhero suit. Trailer has me looking forward to this.&&DAMN....&&Loving the purple on the new suit.&&WHO WILL SURVIVE IN WAKANDA&&As a black man, I appreciate the rap for what I assume they think goes well. But I would've much preferred to hear some tribal beats and drums. Think it would've fit ALOT better personally. &&So...its Grambling vs Prairie View?&&Andy Serkis looks like the most badass motherfucker ever. Sure he's like the greatest mocap actor of all time, but I really want to see his actual face in more movies. Maybe this can do something with that.&&How many times are we going to have the hero face someone that's a darker version? Iron Man, Iron Monger. Ant-man and Yellowjacket. Hulk and Abomination. Imagine Black Panther had to fight the Iron Monger, or Yellowjacket. &&the secret world is so cool its like African atlantis. Feeling it. &&This looks every bit as badass as a Black Panther film should be.&&Boseman is killing it recently. So psyched for this&&I am obsessed with the costuming in this movie. It's an art form unto itself. Everything seems to fit together so seamlessly into this world they've built. I can't WAIT to see more. &&That scene at 1:12 must be a vision of some kind meeting with the Panther God, since there's Panthers in the tree.

Looks beautiful regardless.  &&Damn!!! That’s all I can say&&[deleted]&&I hope we spend a lot of time in Wakanda. It looks fascinating.&&Huh, it looks like this one has that Toyota/Lexus money flowing in. They've had Chevy, Acura, Audi, and now Lexus. Are they building up to Infiniti War?&&Those car chase scenes filmed in South Korea look dope!&&I'm going to take my 7 yr old son to see this the day it comes out. I want for him so badly to see people that look like him on the big screen that he can look up to. &&I wanna go to Wakanda.&&I really like the African Sci-fi city they made for this movie. It reminds me a little of Numbani.&&Best trailer I have seen in a while! Can't wait.&&Hooooly shit that suit&&Bilbo and Gollum unite once again.&&They have active camo up over the city/country?  Looks pretty rad!!!  &&This looks amazing. Between Michael B. Jordan and Chadwick Boseman, along with Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson, the MCU is doing it's black characters justice. I love these actors and cannot wait for more.&&Where is all of this technology coming from?

Set and costume design are looking amazing. Can't wait!  &&I’ve seen gods fly. I’ve seen men build weapons that I couldn’t even imagine. I’ve seen aliens drop from the sky. 

But I ain't never seen an elephant fly!&&black panther's really about the whole fighting on cars thing isn't he&&This trailer is really lacking in MCU quippiness, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing.&&Well he does take herbs and meditate to keep him with supernatural physical ability, so that might be explaining it in the movie. &&Really hoping that scene has him consulting Bast the panther goddess&&[deleted]&&They cut it off before he looks up to see ~~Mufasa's~~ T'Chaka's face in the clouds.&&""We have this one cool CGI-finished moment and *we're gonna use it for all our trailers*, dammit.""&&I'm just waiting for him to bat things off tables.&&If you have an indestructible suit that absorbs literally all physical damage like captain America's shield, you can do whatever the fuck you want. &&While he sounds very American. He’s an exile from Wakanda. As much as he wants to return home and make it even greater under his rule, he still spent so much of his life in a foreign country that he’d probably be more American than Wakandan by now, and that breeds some fascinating inner conflict.&&Make Wakanda Great Again.&&I agree with that, but it's also the kind of motivation that fits really well with the cookie cutter Marvel villains that we've seen over and over again. 

When the villain's objective is ""burn the entire fucking world"", there is no moral ambiguity. You cannot realistically root for the villain, because burning the entire fucking world is almost certainly not a good thing. 

And on top of that, particularly in an extended universe like this, we already know that the world isn't going to burn. The stakes are so high that we already know our hero is not going to fail. 

Of course all of this stuff is not set in stone, and I'm still really interested in the story. But the trailer is really hinting that we're going to get another boring villain. &&Wakanda Numba 1!!!&&LMFAO&&We got action scenes where they give us a glimpse of the tech without spoiling any of the plot. What a trailer.

Edit: to the people being anal about plot points being spoiled, Black Panther is the king of a technologically advanced kingdom. That's been established in Civil War. It's also a hero movie, following the very common hero storyline. Introduction to the story and background, conflict with a villain that provides a contrast to hero, context and motivation onto what happened and why the villain is doing what he is doing (which could be a result from the action of our hero), and finally, stop reading if you don't wanna be spoiled, a resolution to the conflict that might or might not have a twist to it.   &&I have a feeling like this movie is going to be huge and by this time next year there are going to be little kids running around obsessed with Black Panther the way they're obsessed with Iron Man and Spider Man and that just makes me feel AWESOME

&&It's my understanding that the revolution will be streamed live for Patrons and then uploaded to YouTube a week later.&&It will be available exclusively on Wakanda's own streaming service.

Add to that the fact that he's working with Coogler, with whom he's produced nothing but awesomeness, and this looks to be on track for the best phase 3 film by a mile.&&I was disappointed because it means that the villain is ultimately just going to be another carbon copy of the hero but he's evil. We've had that fight sooooooo many times now in the MCU. &&I groaned. Yet ANOTHER super hero movie in which the villain needs the exact replica of the hero's suit. Ant Man, Spiderman 3, Iron Man, Hulk with Abomination (if you classify exact same power as suit), etc. It's been overdone to death and makes fights so much less interesting. I want fights that mess with something a hero is not used to fighting. Like Mysterio messing with Spider-Man. &&Really? I thought it looked really bad. &&my jaw dropped when the superhero did the superhero thing WHOOO I LOVE COOL MOMENTS&&The rumours have that his suit in IW will be ""proper"" Bleeding Edge, really hope that's the case although I guess now it'll look like he was copying BP&&Wakanda is always a bit of a step ahead of world technology. Plus they have a monopoly on vibranium so they can price gouge the shit out of people.&&Wakanda is the most technologically advanced society in the world in the comics iirc. They just hoard it. &&Oh my fuck. I just read up on the Bleeding Edge armor. That would be nuts if Tony created the bleeding edge armor in the MCU.

“The Bleeding Edge armor took the extremis concept and took it to the next level. His armor was stored inside of the hollow of the bones and he could mentally command it to come out of his skin whenever he pleased. The armor is extremely powerful and it's the armor Tony is currently using. It was created by Tony and also with a little help from Reed Richards. It can lift up to 500 tons (with boot jets activated) and fly up to speeds like 5 miles per second. You can read about the creation of the armor in Iron Man #500”&&The Mothers Be Aware arc is perhaps the greatest thing in the history of demo disk and I'll be sad to see it go, but it went out with a bang.&&WAIT FOR REAL?

But it was spectacular and I’m so fucking proud of these boys!&&FUCKING HOW IS THIS SO FAR UP? I LOVE IT&&spoilers! &&I feel like he's getting featured in trailers and promos a lot lately and I love it. Can't wait to drink a refreshing Sprite during Black Panther. &&And [Gil Scott Heron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGaoXAwl9kw)&&I love the song when its out, but kinda dont like it in the trailer. I thought the first - Aha, Yeeeah, Hola was kinda displaced, I was like What why that funny AHA! at that moment. Should have started with Lets go... &&Coogler and Ludwig Göransson really know how to choose the soundtracks to their films. I haven't felt this type of hype since the Creed soundtrack&&First they had an RTJ song and now Vince? My literal top two hip hop acts? I think my dick is out. &&You think T'Challa is going to advise anyone to grab a Sprite in the movie?&&I think Wakanda is what will set this apart from other superhero movies. It takes the film into a genre (Afro Futurism) that is rarely explored in the West.&&Maybe too early to say, but I feel like Marvel has really hit the ball out of the park especially on lesser known franchises like this and GOTG. I think part of it is the extra freedom with the world building, since people don't already have preconceived ideas of the characters and story should be. &&With this, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Thor are marvel starting to actually create their own world's now. 

Because those movies look very distinct, they look completely unearthly. &&That one tree scene looks straight out of Lion King. Now I want a Lion King directed by Ryan Coogler.&&You can totally see the blackness of the casting and creation of this movie and it's fucking great. I'm comparing this to the other recent trailer set to a rap song - Pacific Rim 2's trailer made me cringe a bit; this one looked *owned*. 

And I'm so glad Coogler is the one on this. He's got what it takes to make it a part of something but still uniquely his, after what he did with *Creed*.&&His movements are so fluid. And they look so badass in that suit. &&The cast has me looking forward for this. Everything about this movie is just phenomenal.&&It's easily one of my favorite superhero designs.

AND THE NEW WORD TO HAVE IS REVOLUTION
&&I'M LOST IN THE WOOOOORLD&&🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊&&WHO WILL SURVIVE IN WAKANDA,&&Agreed. It's obvious it's done to attract the audience it wants, but it would be nice to have some traditional African music in the film and/or some modern takes on the style.&&When the trailer first said ""uh huh"" and then ""yeah"" I thought I had a different tab open playing something else. Felt really out of place to me at the start. &&Don't you know, if your black you only listen to or want to hear rap. I agree though I didn't feel like it fit the hero. &&I actually would've liked it a lot with with some of the vocals removed, it was weird to have them mixed in with voice-overs from the movie, especially [here.](https://youtu.be/xjDjIWPwcPU?t=1m15s)&&You put into words what i was feeling. The music did not seem to fit at all. All of the visuals seem to be more traditional African culture, then you have an American song over it. Odd fit.&&""tribal beats and drums"" are as stereotypical for Africa as Hip-Hop is for movies with predominantly black actors. Wakanda is a super advanced society so neither of those really fit.&&Winner gets to lose to Southern.&&This is why I loved Jessica Jones so much. Kilgrave was such an interesting villain and had nothing similar to Jones in anyway. But like /u/prophetofgreed said, they don't have much time to set up a villain in a movie where over the course of 10 episodes or whatever there is a lot of space for development. &&Feige has addressed this before. The reason they do this is to cut down time they may need to introduce and understand the villain since scenes with the hero can also act as a way to mirror the villain. Like a 'how this hero didn't lose his way' kind of deal. 

It also thematically creates an even match since it's like a dark reflection of the hero. 

Edit: Here's the [source](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1561390/the-blunt-reason-marvel-uses-mirror-image-villains-in-its-movies-according-to-kevin-feige). 

When talking about Doctor Strange:

> You want to have characters that inhabit the same world when introducing a new world, a new mythology for lack of a better term. You want to explore that as much as you can. 

> When you're teaching an audience about sorcerers and that reality, and you're going to talk about the past anyway, and you're going to get into their history anyway, much better to tie-in your bad guy with that instead of laying all this groundwork of parallel dimensions and sorcery and say, by the way, a meteor hit on the other side of the world, it went under the water, and this evil thing developed. What does that have to do with magic? Nothing... That's not the way we've developed them up to this point.&&ProZD take on it

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/0zPEtyAsM94)
[Part 2](https://youtu.be/UaNWFHLy2NI)&&I feel like a recent movie that did well with that dynamic is Spiderman Homecoming. It seemed like a very uneven matchup with two distinctively different fighting styles/abilities. &&...that is kinda the point of the superhero mythos, the baddie being a dark reflection of the goodie. Plus it makes for a relatively even match.

From below: Joker is a dark reflection of Batman, all of his main enemies are. He's the chaos to Batman's order, he uses practical joke/clown related gadgets, he's colorful while Batman is not. Magneto is similar, both he and Professor X want mutant rights but they have different ideas about how to achieve them - Xavier prefers cooperation and diplomacy, Magneto prefers a more militant approach. Magneto manipulates the physical world while Xavier manipulates the mental.&&On the DC side too. Superman and Zod, Batman and Ras, Wonder Woman and Ares (?).

And I guess Spider-Man and Venom in the old trilogy count as well, kind of.&&Or the Winter Soldier

oh wait&&Heroes fighting ""evil"" versions of themselves is a Marvel comics staple&&Wait what's Andy Serkis doing then ??&&""Badass"" is the exact word I was left with after seeing this trailer.

I'm not that big on comic book/superhero movies, but this trailer looks awesome and somewhat distinguishable from the rest. I'd definitely watch this.&&i really hope this inspires more afro-futurism.&&I want to live in a world where I am able to see a live version of that infamous meeting of the Panther God and Dr. Doom.

&&The revolution will not be televised!&&I'm so hyped for this&&Yeaaah, I live in Busan and watched them film the car chases for a whole night! I have some videos. It's the only reason I want to see this movie so bad.&&In the comics, Wakanda sits on THE mother lode of adamantium/vibranium in the world which allowed them to spearhead a lot of technological advancements while they deliberately maintained their ‘tribal’ look overall.

The motherlode also affected the flora and fauna in some way, such as the mystical plant that the warriors and Wakanda kings ingest for greater strength.

Wakanda ultimately stays isolationist and deliberately gives the impression they’re not more advanced than the rest of the world, to keep the mother lode for themselves. They are likely THE most advanced human city on Earth, even in the comics.

T’challa is one of the more non-isolationist kings, and even then he places Wakandan interests first and so he does not share his nation’s tech or other advancements with the rest of the world. Tony actually called him out on this once - there was a plague on US soil, T’challa basically said the Wakandan labs had the cure or could easily sythesize one faster than Tony or anyone else. But he wasn’t going to because Tony had lied or done something underhanded earlier (they of course, resolve the issue later).

Also in the comics, should be noted that Wakanda actually has legit connections to the spirit realm in some capacity. I mean, once T’challa became the King of the Dead and summoned an army of the dead.

Now in the MCU, I think Wakanda is basically the nation that gives Earth a fighting chance because they have tech that can be a challenge for Thanos’ armies. T’challa also successfully repelled Black Dwarf/Cull Obsidian in single combat in the comics. But then the rest of the Black Order came along and took over in the end.&&Wakanda isn't using alien tech. All of the vibranium on earth comes from a massive meteor. Wakanda is built around that meteor. The kings of Wakanda sell off minute amounts of vibranium for vast amounts of money, which they use to send some member abroad to study the best science the world has to offer, which makes Wakanda one of the most advanced societies on earth. &&In the comic books Wakanda is the most technologically advanced country/civilization in the world - even before the events of the first Avengers. Looks like Coogler is keeping that consistent with the MCU. 

Edit - Also all that sweet sweet [Vibranium](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Vibranium) probably doesn't hurt either. &&Snuck off to the bathroom to watch. Now I’m hyped AF hiding in a stall. &&I think I’ve seen this comment on every marvel trailer since Doctor Strange came out, they must be doing something right now.&&I'm so glad they got a good design instead of dark concrete everywhere. Avenger movies are so freaking stale in their sets. Also looks like the soundtrack will stick out. &&I love the fact that the Marvel films are finally starting to get a little more colorful and they're allowing their directors to be a little more unabashedly creative with the look and cinematography of their movies.  This and Thor Ragnarock both have a very distinct and deliberate aesthetic that are completely different than what we've seen in the MCU before. &&I take herbs and meditate, but I only get supernaturally hungry :(&&I too like to take some herb & then sit about for hours &&I think it would be him communing with the past kings of Wakanda. They were all Black Panther's as well as being King of the Dead in their culture. &&So Vince McMahon is directing the film? &&God that would be amazing. Every scene with a table, T’challa nonchalantly knocks something off of it. &&I did not realize how desperately missing from my life this is. I am suddenly incomplete. Thor had the Darrell videos. T'challa needs this. I want to see him nonchalantly nudge Mjolnir off a table.&&yeah, which frankly makes the character a lot less interesting to me. There is no sense of danger in these Marvel movies because every character is practically invincible. The prime example of this being in ""Age of Ultron"" when even Hawkeye and Black Widow were destroying 7 foot tall death robots like they were made out of tracing paper. &&So basically he's Theon Greyjoy&&thanks for this! I felt really turned off by the fact that Boseman worked for that accent, everyone else seemingly playing along, while Michael B. Jordan didn't even bother. What you said makes total sense!!!&&They're not bringing their best people. They're sending Norse Gods, Iron men, Archers, and their smashing Hulks. Some of them, I'm sure, are X-Men.&&Would you say the trailer is safe for people that hate spoilers and all the good bits being given away? &&I really hope this is the case, despite the fact that it will inevitably spawn a whole ""is it ok for my white child to go as Black Panther for halloween"" debate which will likely be very annoying to see play out. &&WHAT'S UP, EVERYBODY?! I'm Black Panther and this is my movie!&&Greg Miller is that you?

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up I still love you /u/GameOverGreggy <3&&but what about the television? :(&&Wakanda's streaming service?

...Watchonda?

Watchonda TV!
Watchonda phone!
Watchonda computer!
Watchonda go!

Wherever you go, Watchonda!&&Also interpolated with Vince Staples’s song “Bag Bak”

On mobile so I can’t link&&Not a bad one, either. Thought I was just going to roll my eyes when I heard the first snippet of his voice, but by the end I was actually kinda hyped.&&And the original Gil Scott track was a response to the Last Poets track [When the Revolution Comes](https://youtu.be/8M5W_3T2Ye4) and the lines in it

When the revolution comes some of us will probably catch it on TV, with chicken hanging from our mouths

You'll know it's revolution cause there won't be no commercials

When the revolution comes

Side note: Biggie's Party & Bullshit also comes from this track&&Hadn't heard of him before, it's like Smooth Jazz 70s RATM.&&Knew I recognized that voice from Who will Survive in America by Kanye&&
*Sending hopes and prayers*


Well, I did my part.&&Calm down, Owen Wilson.&&I already hope he doesn't get beaten too hard by T'Challa, looks like he could be a great reoccurring villain&&I don't know, Thor: Ragnarok looks like it's going to be pretty good. I'm excited to see what Taika Waititi does. &&Thats a legitimate concern. Call me crazy, but I bet that the fight between the two black panthers wont be the climax battle. I'm thinking that after all the supersuit tomfoolery theyre gonna be all ""lets settle this in the ways of old"" and it will end with that 1v1 spear+shield fight on the rocky cliff we keep seeing. &&I know that all these villains all have their basis in comics and all, and I still like it don't get me wrong, but that suit just reminds me of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaNWFHLy2NI) ProZD's [videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zPEtyAsM94) It's in so many Marvel movies I'm beginning to think they're doing it intentionally just to mess with us. &&If you're fighting someone at the exact same power level as you, then it's not about who has the stronger powers or better tech - it's about who has the heart of a champion or whatever. Like all that stuff in spider-man about who you are *without* the suit. It's cliche, but I see the reason it's cliche. It lets you apply their struggles to your own life by saying, ""I may not have a nanotech vibranium suit, but I have the heart of a champion just like BP so I deserve that extra piece of cake.""&&I mean these movies are unapologetically formulaic. Can't really say I was expecting something brand new here.&&Even past that, the TV show Arrow and Flash, Iron Man 2 (to an extent, it was the same technology with a slightly different application) Captain America 2, the villain is just a bad version of the good guy. Definitely tired of it. Batman and Spider-Man have great villains because they're all so different from the hero themselves. It forces the hero to get creative rather than just engage in hand to hand combat&&I don't really mind if it's Tony ""copying"" BP because it should make sense that the heroes would learn from each other and take inspiration from each other's ingenuity. Plus if it's proper Bleeding Edge then I believe it'll be different than what BP is using, as this doesn't appear to come from within his own body.&&Based on leaked concept art it's looking like it's going to be a lot closer to Model 51 (current 616 suit) in function than Bleeding Edge, or at least in combat.&&> Wakanda is always a bit of a step ahead of world technology.

So is Stark Industries.&&I would love for T'Challa to aid Tony in creating in just as Reed Richards did in the comics. It seems like the perfect way to move forward. Or, since Princess Shuri is supposed to be the genius inventor for Wakanda who is basically their version of Tony Stark, maybe she helps Tony develop the armor.&&> His armor was stored inside of the hollow of the bones 

Just how much space does one have in the 'hollow' of one's bones and wouldn't that transition hurt really badly?&&Are you kidding me? They still have to get Queen of Drama. The saga isn't over yet. &&Can I get a quick insight as to what this is pertaining to? I haven't watched Funhaus in a few weeks and I'm not caught up to it all.&&A very funny [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCboMX_UNgaPBsUOIgasn3-Q) that features videos of a group of guys and a girl casually playing games and just cracking joke after joke.  One of their most famous series involves them [playing random demo discs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoKlTIhCFwM), which often feature terrible games that lead to a lot of great material.&&DUCU is above all&&These revolutions make me so thirsty!&&Ironically, this revolution will be televised worldwide&&GIL SCOT HERON!&&Rolling.

i love that

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback and recommended readings/listenings, especially the This American Life podcast.  I kind of feel silly not knowing Afro Futurism was a thing, but it's great to educate myself on new topics like this every now and then with the help of Reddit!&&This is like the first Afro Futurism movie I can think of since Sun Ra: Space is the Place back in 74.


Well unless you wanted to count [B 14 **ONE AND TWO!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGcaOZjFN-k)&&Except even when audiences know the world a lot because of past movies, the world building is still very good. How they handled Spider-Man showed this. 

They never had to say 'with great power comes great responsibility' because Peter was already living that way and made decisions based on that. &&too early is right. when i get my moon knight movie, then we'll see.&&Unless it's their TV division. Woof. (Outside of AoS)&&Once they got rid of Ike, Marvel has been free to get weird with it. &&Since Ike Perlmutter's influence left the movie division after Age of Ultron, it looks like the directors and even the producers have gotten more creative freedom. &&The thing I worry about is the movie being 'African-American' and not 'African'.&&He's like a cat . . . with like black pants.

Black Man Cat.&& all of us&&ANOTHER WOOOOORRLD PREMIERE &&DAMN&&Well it works because after the first trailer had RTJ I was fucking hooked &&It's a microcosm of the tension between making an American movie for Americans about Africa. 

&&But Wakanda is very old-school tribal in terms of its aesthetics, traditionally. It's like Latveria, where it looks antiquated in spite of being cutting edge. Wakanda still has soldiers going around armed with just spears, but they shoot lasers or something. &&Fisk in DD s1 and Kilgrave are by far my most favorites villains.  Cottonmouth gets an honorable mention.  I think you're right, just with more time they can establish a proper villain.  Im hoping Thanos with two movies could do well. &&Cornell in Luke cage was also pretty badass &&The MCU is known for having fairly weak villains in terms of characterization.  So while Feige may be operating under that reasoning in theory, it isn't working as well in practice.  Many of the greatest villains of all time aren't just shadow versions of the hero that will ultimately pale in comparison, but incredibly distinct characters in their own right that bring their own unique history and style with them to the screen.&&I didn't consider the time constraints. I should have put my faith in our lord and saviour, Kevin. &&> a meteor hit on the other side of the world, it went under the water, and this evil thing developed

Is this a reference to a specific villain?&&I was expecting someone to post ProZD. 

*DARK ELVES*&&I completely agree, but I feel like we're like 14 movies deep, we can throw the rulebook out the window. &&... but it's kind of a trope at this point. Joker, Magneto, Dr Doom, etc don't have the same abilities as their hero counterparts.&&Oh shit this ones an even match i wonder who's gonna win &&Id say Ras is more than just a darker side of himself. He is like a Darth Vader to Luke. Mysticism, Domination, Family. &&Vulture was also similar to Peter-both were the little guys-but instead of staying positive about The Avengers he went full Walter White&&Muscle bro that fights muscle bro with metal arm. &&It is generally what happens in origin movies.

Thor is reading a paper. TC nudges Mjolnir towards the edge with a scraping sound. Thor bends his paper down and glares at TC, then let's the paper back up. TC nudges it again, Thor bends the paper down and stares at TC, saying ""Don't do it"". TC, not breaking eye contact bat's Mjolnir off the table, to which Thor responds ""God's damn it, stop knocking my shit off the table.""

Camera pans out to show their apartment with a bunch of Thors stuff sitting on the floor, leaning up against a bookshelf, a kitchen counter, coffee table, etc... TC has been doing it all day.

They're ""Will the main character save all of the civilians and their whole family?"" and we had two different movies last year where the conclusive answer was ""Definitely not."" Black Panther's dad, the previous Black Panther, died on screen because the main characters were arguing and lazy about security and pissing off powerful people with their screwups.

&&I wouldn't watch it if I were you. &&This is a story trailer, so it might not be the best to watch if you're really careful on spoilers.

Nobody cared, everyone thought it was awesome, and the best part was we met a bunch of other kids while walking the neighborhood who were dressed as other Avengers and they were super stoked to see a Black Panther.

This all culminated in lightsaber battle between the Avengers and a bunch of kids dressed as the Justice League in a fire-lit cul-de-sac while all the parents ate free burgers and hot dogs that a family was cooking out front of their house.

BP just looks cooler to me, but nothing would make me happier than *two* awesome movies.&&Fuck. I def see this happening. &&They should just go full Star Trek and have the villain be the same actor and costume but with an *evil* goatee.&&They aren't doing it to mess with us, they are doing it because works. Every marvel movie follows the same formula and it's financial and critic success every time. Until it stops working, they won't change it (Or they run out of origin stories).&&I mean, aside from Loki and Zemo... have there been yet any decent baddies?&&I look at it as a way to prove they're more than just their powers or suit or whatever. You take a copy and the hero wins because he's the hero not just because of his powers.&&I was super interested in how certain mutant powers in X Men destroyed other OP mutant powers, similar to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, wherein even a weak power used smartly could beat a stronger one. Like how there is absolutely no way Wolverine could ever touch magneto or how Kitty Pride could essentially beat a variety of opponents. But nope, the hero movies just want huge explosives or fist fights. &&If Tony got wind of how that tech worked, theres a 0% chance he wouldn't make his own version.&&Bleeding Edge is a shit load of tech Stark has accumulated over the years all coming together. Being made of nanobots which can be stored inside his physical body is only one feature.&&It’s more than a little impressive to me that in the Marvel world, Tony is so intelligent his tech is comparable with the entire civilization of Wakanda research and without vibranium. &&""Tony Starks arrives, the metal emerging from his skin forms an indestructible suit of armor. Peter asks:

-How is this possible? How can you store that inside your body?

Tony smiles. The visor comes down and he looks Parker dead in the eyes. 

-In my bones, Peter.

-But Tony - He asks, confused. - There is not way you can fit that much metal inside your bones. There is not that much room inside of the bones of a normal man.

Tony retreats his armor back into his body.

PS- I acknowledge that This American Life is probably the whitest way to be introduced to anything. &&https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrofuturism <- my favorite creative aesthetic, so I'm hyped.

For more depictions of afrofuturism, [here's a good article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/afrofuturism-the-next-generation.html). [here is another.](http://www.okayafrica.com/african-future-okayafrica-introduction-afrofuturism/)&&r/Afrofuturism/

Personally I recommend the album 'the splendor and the misery' by Clipping, which involves an escaped slave on a space ship. &&Afro Futurism was already a thing. It wasn't just made to describe this film&&There's a couple of interviews that the set and costume designer spoke on. Marvel let them travel to Africa for inspiration. That's friggin legit.&&Well... there was that other film, [but we don't talk about that one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayniggers_from_Outer_Space)&&Exactly, thank Feige they didn't show us Uncle Ben's death all over again. &&That's a good point - maybe it's about being free to carve out their own world while still being connected to the overarching narrative? GOTG/Black Panther have this freedom because the source material is obscure. Spider-Man had it because we've had soooo many interpretations and it needed to differentiate himself &&Daredevil, Jessica Jones and half pf Luke Cage were good.  Basically anthing without the Hand. &&*Marvel Studios.

Look at the mess which is Inhumans.&&Part of what made District 9 so refreshing was the authentic feel of the setting. I doubt this will go anywhere near that far, it would be great to have something like that to give this film (and others in the series) more identity. many of these Marvel films really feel too similar to each other, I get they are going for one 'world' but breaking the tone and style up a little more for some of the movies would make them better imo.&&That's sort of my fear as well. Anybody talking about ""blackness"" as if that's a relevant concept doesn't understand Africa, nor really any part of the world outside of America. ""Blackness"" is a pointless term on a continent where basically everybody is black, and thus cultures aren't defined by race.

I think the movie is going to be solid in portraying an African setting rather than an African-American one, but the marketing department doesn't seem to have gotten the memo. Using African-American music in the trailer really made me cringe.&&Give me a run for my money&&RTJ loves marvel. They're doing another promo with them soon.&&And it is often best to save them for the 2nd or 3rd movie where more time can be spent delving into them, and not when you are already introducing the audience to the hero.

&&I think the Batverse's villains are next-level because they're characters driven by specific compulsions and psychologies. In Nolan's films, Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, and even Bane are *crusaders*. They deeply believe in their causes. Those causes say something specific about who they are as villains (al Ghul's thirst for reciprocal justice, the Joker's true faith in anarchy as a solution, Bane's glowering sadism). You gain an understanding for them (well, Bane a little less so, because he's played more obscurantist).

Whereas so many of the MCU villains so far have been boilerplate despots and greedy businessmen. They do villainy things, and so they need to be stopped, but there's little sense of empathy. Loki's still the only one I've really given a shit about, and I think that's largely because you get that early sequence in the first *Thor* where he learns of his true heritage, and we see real, raw despair. Which forms a foundation that carries through all of his films afterward. We really understand him.&&Don't think so, probably something he came up with on the spot to answer the question. &&It makes an easy starting movie.  Outside of the Vulture and Loki, every first movie so far has been a mirror enemy.

I agree though, and wish they would throw varied enemies at them first.&&It's marvel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ &&They don't have to have the same abilities. Joker is a dark reflection of Batman though, all of his main enemies are. He's the chaos to Batman's order, he uses practical joke/clown related gadgets, he's colorful while Batman is not. Magneto is similar, both he and Professor X want mutant rights but they have different ideas about how to achieve them - Xavier prefers cooperation and diplomacy, Magneto prefers a more militant approach. Magneto manipulates the physical world while Xavier manipulates the mental. &&Yeah but their powers aren't really comparable at all&&Saying that they were the same just because neither were as big as the Avengers is quite a stretch. Their powers were different, their motivations were different, their place in the world was different, their personalities were different. They were different, and in a way that was more complex than just polar opposites.

If you look really hard, you can find a connection between any two characters. That doesn't mean they are similar overall.&&Cryogenic Old Timey Musclebro at that&&I really like how Marvel invented 'The Hero's Journey' as a story archetype. Clever&&Not to be confused with a hyper poop. That shit can send you airborne.&&Right, The Guardians movies definitely have their own very specific aesthetic too.  GOTG2 was probably one of the most colorful movies I've ever seen.  
&&[deleted]&&THAT'S NOT EVEN THAT EXTREME OF A WORKOUT! JUST A REGULAR WORKOUT!&&But but but what about his hair?&&In addition, keep the AC off in summer and the heat off in winter to strengthen the mind!&&That's just a mediocre training program. I don't understand!!!!!!&&That . . . doesn't sound good for you. 

Can't I just ride my bike everywhere and help people?&&Wait. Shelton Benjamin is back?&&Gotta make Thanatos look strong.&&But they aren't even on the same brand tho.&&You might be the Black Panther but this is the Big Dog's yard OOOOOOOAAAHAHHHAHAA&&""Black Panther is coming to break up our smuggling ring, sir.""

""Deploy the cardboard box diversionary tactic!!""&&I laughed way too hard at this.&&[deleted]&&Superman is dead man.  I don't think theyd cheapen his death by having hin come back the next movie.

If they did that they might as well totally negate his death by hinting at his return at the end of Dawn of Justice,  using something dumb like floating dirt.&&Dude he's like 16 in the movie. &&I don’t think they nerfed him a whole lot.

He caught that 2 ton fucking car at 40 mph. They made extra sure we saw how powerful Cap and Bucky were, pulling down a god damn helicopter and catching a battering ram singlehandedly, only to further show naturally strong Peter is when he beats Cap hand to hand (but not in strategy) and catches Bucky’s arm like he was a child.&&I think people often forget how strong Spider-man is because strength isn't one of his most recognizable powers. Having little reminders in the movies always makes for really awesome moments, like in Homecoming when he lifts the building off of himself or the bit in TASM 2 where he catches a police car out of the air. &&This guy gets it. The sooner you accept that the main character won’t die the sooner you’ll actually enjoy the movies. The characters in the comics have stayed alive for 60+ years and people still read them and love them. 

Also something I would like to add is killing off main characters has to be the most lazy way of “raising the stakes”, I would much rather see more complicated and creative ways of raising the stakes like the movies already have been doing that people seem to ignore. I don’t get why people want all these main characters dying, I actually really like these characters and want to see them grow and develop. Most MCU characters are nowhere near full potential so killing them off is a waste of that potential, the best way to kill off an important character is to do it after they have peaked, not before. &&For now&&I mean, we don't KNOW he has them&&He has plenty of balls.

Did you see he threw 3 balls at those trucks after dropping from that flying Wacandan plane? &&Expect a big redemption for him by series end.&&Don't forget the Inhumans. No, on second thought do forget them.&&It's gonna be ""guy gets powerful suit, fights guy who has a similar yet slightly more powerful suit"" just like Iron Man and Ant-Man.&&Any trailer will give away some. It's just the nature of a trailer. &&As long as there's no blackface involved and it's just a white kid in the suit, sure. &&If you really want to be visible should go as reverse flash instead&&I went as Kid Flash in the 1980s. No one had any idea who I was supposed to be.

My son wants to be John Cena for Halloween. I said no way, literally no one could see him.&&Or ya know Cultural appropriation in the other direction. I can see both ways&&I hate this argument that's stirring up this year. I understand the roots of it all, but can't we just let kids be kids and enjoy Halloween and their costumes like we did when we were younger? Kids don't pick out costumes because of cultural insensitivity or wanting to play into a joke. THEY PICK A FUCKING COSTUME CAUSE THEY LIKE THE CHARACTER. &&I mean, one of the leaders of the ignorance disguised as intelligence movement claimed that The Dark Knight Rises was the liberal media trying to take down Mitt Romney because Bane and Bain are homonyms. It's pretty much a guarantee that there will be a claim that this movie is trying to recruit everyone into the Black Panthers.&&#getpaid&&What are you going to revolutionize? A shoe? &&Well they already monopolize vibranium, why not their own tv service?&&Psh, don’t act like you know GSH. For all we know he would be proud to support a film of strong African characters saving the world. &&This sort of thing happens all the time in advertising.  ""Lust for Life"" was used to sell cruise vacations.  ""Sixteen Tons"" was used to promote the coal industry.

&&Spoiler: He's confirmed to be in Infinity War &&I'm still salty that they [killed off Kaecillius. Such a shame we won't see any more Mads Mikkelson](#spoiler).&&He's one of BP's main archenemies. They won't kill him this early.

Give him the Vulture treatment and we're all good.&&You got to keep MBJ around for as long as you can. &&I mean, just cuz its predictable doesnt necessarily mean it's bad.&&The villains aren't what makes the movies critical successes though. Most critics agree that Doctor Strange and Antman had awful villains.&&Ego could have been a great villain if the 3rd act didn't pitter out. 
&&The Vulture&&And it also shows the viewer just how destructive the hero's powers could be if used for evil. And while I don't necessarily agree with it, the choice to have a villain with similar origins and powers in hero origin films means you can spend more time introducing the hero and their abilities to the viewer. Most characters's sequel movies give more variety to the villains&&Yes, a Rock-Paper-Scissors dynamic! As seen in the majority of strategy gaming. It would be incredibly interesting... these are *teams* of superheroes after all, and the necessary strategizing would add another layer to the plot, in addition to spanning multiple movies.

But like the other commenter said, these are formulaic movies. It probably sounds like too much extra work for the studios, given that moviegoers will see them regardless.&&I don't think we'll ever see a fight like Sticky Fingers vs Grateful Dead in a Hollywood movie &&Well, in the comics Tony does use vibranium sometimes. But in the comics Tony isn't nearly as far ahead with tech as he is in the movies - in the comics Reed and Doom are way better than he is, and he is at a similar level as Hank Pym, Bruce Banner, Peter Parker, Hank McCoy, and, of course, Black Panther. &&Ah yes ok, I remember them trying that on one that I watched.&&Laws are just ideas.&&It's also in the first line of Norf Norf.&&Ha! NPR and PBS have taught me a lot and broadened my view so much. But I know that feeling well. Every time I mention hearing something on NPR, I have a little feeling of nerd cringe...&&Thanks for this.  I've honestly never heard that word used, interesting stuff!&&So I guess thats where Overwatch's Numbani falls, because honestly the large pan-over shot of Wakanda reminded me a lot of Numbani as well.&&Seems like this movie is going to put it on the big map though. The works they list above are all novels and some art, and of course the comics that you'd need to seek out. 

This is really going to expose it to the masses in a way never before possible. Marvel marketing is going to expose this to millions.&&Did he say that it was? Or did you just needlessly and passive-aggressively correct someone to prove your intelligence? &&You know Africa is like a 10 hour flight right? Its not another planet. &&Hopefully they got the proper pronunciations for places and things this time. Last avengers movie they went to Lagos, Nigeria and didn’t bother to ask a Nigerian how to pronounce Lagos. It was the worst part of that whole movie. &&At least that cinematic universe never really took off.&&I'm still so curious what the first Spider-Man would have looked like if David Fincher had stayed on. He wanted to do the entire origin story as a short, wordless montage at the very beginning &&Which at this point is only half of the Netflix content. Half of DD S2, IF, DEF and the other half of LC.

We're at a tipping point. If Punisher ends up being bad then I'm probably done.&&The day that man is out of Marvel completely, I'll throw a fucking party&&I mean that was a mess before it started, a network television show about heroes like that? Most of the Inhuman comics were action and battle driven not character driven(which is what you need to make a show with limited special effects budgets work), it would be damn near impossible to make it feasible within a network television show.


It would be like deciding to make a live Dragonball Z series for network television. &&Plus, you don't want to burn the 'best' villian on the first movie. Who would they fight next? &&And unsurprisingly, Loki and Vulture are the only two villains in the MCU that are pretty much universally liked. &&Loki has a different skillset but in a lot of ways is a darker version of the ""good"" Odinson, he turned evil seeing that he would never reach what his brother was going to achieve ( movie or comic version)&&Here, take your arm \\&&Logan just had Wolverine fight a *literal* evil clone of himself. And everyone thinks that's the best movie ever so it clearly doesn't matter that much.&&Your last sentence just blew my mind.&&Was gonna lay down the hurt on you until I realized...

But let's not point it out, please.&&*That's my secret Captain, I'm already balding.* &&Smackdown Live.&&Yes, but this might also be in reference to Vince calling another black wrestler Shelton after he left the company a while back.&&If they fed Cena and Taker to Roman while they were on Smackdown then no one is safe&&So...?

It'll spoil and cheapen the movie for you.&&That’s the point. He’s not invincible at all. Boy got his ass kicked half the movie.

Wolverine's technically done it twice in the wider X-Men series, Cap had Red Skull in his first movie, Hulk had Abomination in his sorta-canon pre-Avengers film, etc.&&> guy gets powerful suit

At least we got this out of the way already. One of my favorite things about Civil War was they knocked out the origin stories for two upcoming solo introductions. I think we can all appreciate not having a third Spiderman origin movie.&&What if I'm a dude playing a dude, disguised as another dude?&&To me you've been visible for centuries&&That's funny. I've seen somebody try to explain that the whole Dark Knight trilogy is about George Bush, and that the Joker was the war on terror (the surveillance used by Lucius Fox would have been the Patriot Act) and that Bane was the ""occupy Wall Street"" movement. While it sort of fits, I highly doubt Christopher Nolan adapted batman for a whole trilogy just to idolize George Bush.&&Worth the money Greg. Love KFGD&&Perhaps he would, but the tension between his words and what Disney is doing should be blatantly obvious. &&At this point it’s more surprising if a character isn’t in Infinty War&&Didnt dormammu just take him with him?&&He has to remain. The mcu is the human torch rehabilitation center. &&Was pretty awesome for ironman. If it works for the story, I say go for it.&&Antman had a villian? Oh ... yeah... I guess that's right. 

Like, literally, it was a big training montage and then a heist, with a fight at the end. The villian wasn't important until that little end fight. &&Goddamit it upsets me every day that Reed and Doom aren't in the MCU.&&Flashback to [the suburban mom flipping out over Norf Norf.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m3CBwoAsBU0)

[And who could forget the remix?](https://youtu.be/o8NmvEt_cVA#t=1m25s)&&Aint nothing wrong with being nerdy! I've listened to NPR nearly everyday since I was 15! The amount of shit I have learned is astonishing, one of the best ways to stay informed in America. It may be ""super white"" as the og commentor said, but they really take lengths to take a multi-angled lens to current events, and their human interest strories (i.e. this American Life) do anything but focus on white middle class American issues. 

Just don't let people know you get a sensible chuckle out of wait wait don't tell me, that's when the real nerd cringe sets in lol.&&Congrats on being one of the 10000 today. You have found a very rich vein of an often ignored portion of science fiction to go exploring. Enjoy your stay.&&I absolutely love Afrofuturism - The late great Dwayne McDuffie of Justice League and Justice League Unlimited Writing fame and creator of Black superheros static shock and Icon created some rich Afrofuturism characters during his run of his company Milestone Comics before it was eventually acquired by DC comics&&I'm not familiar with it so I googled - and looks like it is definitely part of that aesthetic. Super cool. &&Marvel probably could afford it too!&&Which do you think, BvS or Spiderman 2? Because both did it quite differently.&&You mean like the opening to Watchmen? Gave you a lot of information and history to a great song.&&What was wrong with DD S2? I liked it, they made the Hand seem actually dangerous and mysterious, and had actual ninjas instead of wannabe gangsters.&&I really liked Defenders&&Good news is that early reviews of punisher have been very well liked. The biggest issue was that it probably glorified too much violence and guns, but that's literally punisher.

 It was supposed to be released around nycc, but they delayed it because of vegas.  

Hell even runaways has gotten great reception so far.  Basically anything not related to Scott buck has been well received. &&Ike did a lot to help Marvel out of a mess back in the day, but that day was a long time ago. He's been an absolute albatross with his policy on the properties Marvel lost, particularly X-Men and the Inhumans.

There's still not a single fucking X-Man in the new Capcom vs Marvel for fuck's sake.&&I've no doubt that it could've been done well. It's totally possible to turn something from action-driven to character-driven.

But it's been a piss-poor attempt thus far. &&Yeah, they're easily the best so far.  Though I really liked Red Skull as well.  Outside of origin movies, I think Baron Zemo has been the best villian.&&And it's not like they way out there, completely different concepts.

Vulture was just a man that was screwed by the Avengers, while Spidey wanted to be an avenger.      
Loki wanted to be the king of Asgard and so did Thor.

So they can be really similar, just don't have to completely mirror each other.&&That's supposed to be Andy Serkis' character&&Thank you friendo&&I get your point, but Logan had a fuck ton more going on that just Logan vs. Evil Logan.&&Logan was a movie where the villain wasn’t supposed to be half of the main plot. The movie was about Logan finding his end. But this looks like a standard Marvel intro film, so the villain is going to be a major part of it.&&Well, time was probably the real villain in that movie.&&Their philosophies are reflected in their powers - Xavier prefers to win hearts and minds, while Magneto thinks that's foolish, that only physical action can help mutantkind. &&Wait. Smackdown is live?&&""Bring me the cucumber.""&&INFINITY GEODES, MARIE&&Good. Hopefully he doesn’t just attack empty cars and buildings.&&That was such a Forrest Gump moment.

""Your momma name is Martha, too?""&&No way a script like that would make it to production. You know how many eyes would have to sign off on that?  &&Already?&&That's basically the point of spiderman. Most of his villains are more powerful than him. He only wins his battles because he keeps going after he's gotten the shit beat out of him while annoying the bad guys with constant jokes.&&UUUU&&so is yo-yo&&Thor vs. Loki, Iron Man vs. Iron Monger...

It's a common trope because it makes establishing the setting easier, and it shows us the dark side of the hero's powers. Once that's been done in the origin story, you can do more interesting villains in the sequels.&&Incredible Hulk is 100% canon&&What do _you_ mean, ""_you_ people?""&&Dressed as a big black cat too.&&Yeah. It is kinda queasy to have the status quo make money off the feeling of revolting against the status quo. 

Simple Rick's freedom wafers: enjoy the feeling of overthrowing society, in stores now. 

But then again, this is clearly Disney updating and adapting. How many flicks are there in African countries that aren't completely depressing? I think the song is good but still feel, like I said, a bit queasy. &&They made it look like he was being disintegrated, so IDK. I suppose Dormammu is keeping him just alive enough to feel the pain, but it seems like they won't be bringing him back regardless. Dormammu would have no reason to.&&A burn ward, perhaps?&&This guy gets it&&I think the opening montage of *The Incredible Hulk* is probably a better example. &&Personally I really liked the portion dealing with the Punisher and the gangs. The whole blood magic, Noobu(sp) coming back randomly (I know it's been explained now) and ninjas everywhere was a drastic change from the first half of the season. Threw me off a bit.&&The FF are getting it worse than the X-Men, but we're a much smaller segment of the fanbase &&What? Really? Even Wolverine?

&&He's the only villain that won&&Baron was cool in the over arc but for some reason I can't stop obsessing about MK's Vulture. He was just so perfect. &&Red Skull doesn’t do much for me but I understand the sentiment. And I really like the understated approach of Zemo in Civil War and how he effects the film but not necessarily the character himself, if that makes sense&&I think he has a missile arm now. He can shoot missiles out of his fucking arm cannon. What a time to be alive!

I bet he mocapped that missle too. &&Wasnt this supposed to be a sort of parallel to Malcom X and MLK?

Or maybe I just read too much Ultimate SM lol&&Actually, Spider-Man is more powerful than all his villains except for like Venom, Carnage, and Morlun (interdimensional vampire being). He is also much more intelligent than any of them, and has Spider Sense. He's just written to be a jobber most of the time, LOL.&&Lash, while underused, was awesome too&&I wouldn't count Thor vs Loki in this comparison. They may both be asgardian gods. But Thor is more about brute strength, while Loki uses deception. That's like saying that superman and lex Luthor are the same.&&Claw?  Man-Ape?

I love Black Panther as a hero.  I like the Dr. Doom style combo of mysticism and high tech, backed by a nation.  The designs for Wakandan tech, drawing from ancient motifs and scifi motifs kinda like stargate is so awesome.  Plus the whole heavy crown, and juggling identities and backgrounds.  But I never got into any of Black Panther's villians.  Was always better when he was battling Avenger villians or other major Marvel bad dudes.

Nope, he will get 3 movies and a reboot.&&Plus, Loki is the most fleshed-out and sympathetic villain in the MCU, and that was accomplished in his first film and has been successfully built upon to set up Infinity War. &&You know, I never really thought about it before, but Dr. Doom and Black Panther would make a really interesting adversarial dichotomy. Has there ever been a big story between them, like a war between nations?&&Yeah, it's less forgivable if it's done twice in the same series like Iron Man did. At least they made up for it in Iron Man 3.&&Ah I see. Did not know about Mindless Ones. By the time Dormammu returns, hopefully Dr. Strange is a fully realized Sorcerer Supreme and they can tango 1 on 1.&&I always thought that the Incredible Hulk was a sort of follow up to that hulk film (I never saw the ang lee one and because I thought this back in 2008 I still kind of feel like it's true in a way, even though it's not )&&Dude.
