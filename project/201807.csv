Cool to see everyone back together after all these years.&&Please don't suck.

Please don't suck.

Please don't suck.

&&Cue Metallica's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""&&when it comes out it will 10 years since the first 😲 i cant believe its been 10 years. i remember when the first one came out, i was just a single guy living in a filthy studio apartment. now, i'm, uh......nevermind....&&Time to nut up or shut up!&&Several years late, but I’ll still give it a chance. The characters and setup are so good.&&Truly cannot believe Zombieland came out in 2009. Holy shit. &&Huh, I wonder why they recast Michael Cera with this Jesse Eisenberg fellow.




















/s&&Bill Murray should come back as a zombie !&&Not a film I expected a sequel too. Never knew it was a big hit.

But if they can recapture the same tone I'm all for it.&&I think it's interesting that this article came out the same day that Bill Murray was announced in the cast of another zombie comedy movie.

[Reference](https://thefilmstage.com/news/jim-jarmusch-in-now-filming-a-zombie-movie-starring-adam-driver-bill-murray-selena-gomez-and-chloe-sevigny/)&&Finally! I haven't cried this hard since Titanic&&This comes out the same day as news Bill Murray is filming a Jarmusch zombie film? 

I wonder if Bill is in this sequel as a zombie.&&[deleted]&&WOOOOOOOOOOO what a good Friday the 13th today has been oh my god&&I've heard this too many times. Please stop playing with my heart!&&I have mixed feelings about this. 

on one hand i love zombieland, i found it to feel quite original which is saying something for a zombie movie and by far is my favorite zombie movie. 

And on the other hand zombieland ended so perfectly with literally all the bows wrapped and tied beautifully i find it hard to see where the sequel will pick up from without taking away the magic of the first one. &&Good to see the cast and director returning for the sequel. Loved the first one, so I'm looking forward to this!&&Can't wait for Woody to do his promotional tour and do an AMA here about it. I just hope people remember to only ask him about Zombieland 2, and nothing else.&&So goddamn excited.

I really didn't expect a whole lot going into this movie, and was really surprised at how good it was. I think it's perfectly fine as a standalone, but as long as they put some effort into the sequel and don't make a half-assed cash grab I'll be stoked.&&Glad to hear it, loved the first one&&I hope woody does an ama about this where we can finally ask him about the movie rampart&&And they brought back the entire cast?!?! Instantly hyped to my most interested non-Marvel and non-Nolan film!!!&&Four Oscar nominated actors for a fun zombie movie... Well, lets not fuck this up Hollywood. &&Can't wait to see the expanded Rules!&&Sigh...

*puts on For Whom the Bell Tolls*&&Ummm seriously?! That's amazing!&&Won't be the same without Bill Murray&&No man I'll just talk about the Facebook movie all day shit man you have to be so interested in the shit I have to say about the Facebook movie fuck dude I just watched it a year and a half ago fuck Jesse Eisenberg man he fucked over Spider-Man crazy Winklevoss twins rowing.&&I met Jesse Eisenberg once.  He was super super nice.  But really nervous.  It was at a signing for his new book and he read excerpts from it.  When he drank out of his water bottle, he was shaking so much that it was tricking everywhere.  He says he has stage fright.  Felt bad for the dude kinda.  Still the nicest celebrity I've ever met.&&But why?&&*Floss dance*&&I think the zombie ship has sailed. I don't think anyone really cares about that shit anymore....&&Meh.. &&I read that as ""Zoolander"" and got excited.
Then I remembered I've never seen Zoolander and got really confused.
Then I realized there's already a Zoolander 2 and I give up.&&That movie was the first R rated movie I have ever seen and it was with my brother so it had extra special meaning I could not be happier with this news  <3&&Wow I’m actually excited 😊 &&I have been waiting so long for this. Especially when there were rumors a few years ago but nothing happened. Thank god. &&Now give me an extended Jeff Goldblum cameo and one minute cameo with Keanu on a motorcycle clearing the place out while chanting and flying away like that squarespace commercial.&&Need second source because rule #2&&Please dont suck....Please dont suck. &&Zombieland 2: Rampart&&Zombieland 1 spoiler alert:



I hope bill Murray randomly drops in, totally ignoring anything that happened in the first movie&&Bill Murry needs to come back as an actual zombie.&&Fuck yeah! That was one of my favorite movies! Bill fucking murrey!!!!&&I mean, that's great and all.  But can we either stop or slow down the sequel trend and get some more OC movies going?&&The first one was pretty good. You think they would have made enough money to afford Michael Cera instead of Jesse Eisenberg. &&Yassss!!!&&There are two things that survive the end of the world. Twinkies and cockroaches. &&SNOWBALLS???&&I hope the dashboard of their car will have 4 oscars glued to it&&Academy award winner Emma Stone, Academy award winner Woody Harrelson, Academy award nominee Jesse Eisenberg and Academy award nominee Abigail Breslin in ZOMBIELAND 2. (Commercial ends by the time he's done saying it all, also not sure I got the awards and nominees right)&&Maybe Woody Harrelson will do an AMA&&Without a doubt it will. Not that that type of marketing matters for a movie like this, but it's certainly something to brag about anyway. &&Get Alan Alda to play a zombie they have in the trunk of the car. 😂&&What was Michael Cera nominated for?&&Actually... that’s not bad. &&2 Zombie 2 Land&&Ralph Breaks the Internet: Zombieland 2&&Zombieland 2: No More Fatties &&Left 4 Zombieland 2

Sequel within 2 years? Rushed out and will suck.

Sequel after 3-6 years? Might be good

7+ years? Needed just to fill a launch date slot, and looking to capitalize off of hardcore fans and will probably suck.&&I hope it’s as good as RAMPART&&In the tune of ""We hate you please die""

Please don't suck.

Please don't suck.

Please don't suck like the tv show

shitty, shitty, shitty like it

&&Have you tried watching zombieland twice in 1 week? &&Whenever I hear this song, I ALWAYS think of the intro to this movie. It's my favorite opening sequence ever. &&""Enter Sandman"" this time, I guarantee that. &&I'm not sure there's a movie that wouldn't be improved with that song. &&Dude, tell me about it. It was the first date movie for me and my (now ex-) girlfriend. It was a fantastic night and I hold that memory dear. We were only together for 8 months but it felt like an eternity and I fell for her SO HARD. 

Now she’s a lesbian. &&I was Little Rock's age when it came out and now... I still am I guess ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&&I was too!  My married friends asked me to come see ZombieLand and I was like ""Naw man that sounds so stupid!""  They never let me forget how wrong I was.&&at least you have a place of your own&&""That may look like zombies destroyed it, but that's actually ~~Garland~~ my life.""&&I remember the transition. Hell, sometimes I define my life by the change between pre-Zombieland and post-Zombieland because it showed me something.

I loved zombies. I learned it from my brother. He was a big Romero fan, he went to a John Russo acting workshop (he said it was terrible, they basically didn't learn anything), he introduced me to Evil Dead and all other kinds of things.

I was a sophomore in high school when Zombieland came out. I remember it distinctly because for years, I'd talked about zombies, I'd included them in writing assignments, I'd bring them up when I could find a reason to in class, I was the weird zombie kid. I liked other weird things as well, but at the time I was the weird zombie kid because, pfft, zombies? Who's that into zombies? They're B-movie trash! Sure, the Resident Evil movies had come out, but they weren't big hits. There were zombie movies trickling through like there always had been, but nothing major. Liking zombies, especially how much I liked zombies, was weird.

That changed over the course of a week. Zombieland came out and suddenly everyone was into zombies. My brother would read The Walking Dead a lot, he loved it, but I didn't know anyone else who'd even heard about it. Then Zombieland came out. I don't know about other places, but in my high school it went from me being the weird kid for liking zombies to EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL BEING CRAZY ABOUT ZOMBIES!

I was pretty sour about it for a while. I wasn't seen as being ahead of the trend or anything, I was still the weird kid. And it's true, I was weird, and I was a dick about it, I recognize that now. Zombieland coming out helped change my world perception. For a while it made me feel like a victim, like people are going to hate me no matter what. Later I realized the true message was that people aren't going to hate you or like you for what you like, it's for how you act about it, and I purposefully made myself an outcast and I was a jerk, though less intentionally.

Ten years. I honestly thought the zombie craze would have died out by now. That it would have gone back to the realms of B-movies and low-budget gems. But it still has a huge following, it's no longer a centerpiece, but it's still a major fixture of pop-culture. I think about that a lot, even ten years on. Strangely enough, I got overloaded with it fast. I stopped watching the Walking Dead by the 4th season. I stopped paying attention to zombie movies coming out. Zombieland changed my world, for good and bad. And it's strange that one seemingly insignificant thing like a big budget zombie movie could alter a life so completely.&&Possibly my favorite line I use in real life. &&This should've come out on 2012 at the *very* latest.

I'm guessing there will be a timeskip... Though would zombies still be a problem after an entire decade? Where would the characters live? Travel around constantly? Without dying?

I guess my questions will be answered. Maybe. &&Fun fact: Zombieland was supposed to take place in the same universe as Left 4 Dead 2, but Valve opted out of it.&&zombieland was michael cera's best role and it wasnt even michael cera.&&This is the only way I'd be ok with him coming back. Loved him in the first one, but it would be really really lame to bring him back to life in the second one. &&It's the second highest grossing Zombie Film ever, IIRC. After World War Z, but before Dawn of the Dead. &&It’s been on ice and in pre-production a bunch of times since 2010, kinda lost track &&That cast looks fucking awesome. &&Hopefully he will make some king of appearance in the sequel. I'm totally fine with a twin switch.&&>zombie comedy movie

Zom-Com
&&What if they made Bill Murray play an actual zombie and they have to kill him again? &&WHY DIDN'T ROSE MAKE ROOM FOR JACK ON THE DOOR, CISCO? THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM&&When I first saw the Bill Murray announcement I thought it was Zombieland two....and then Zombieland 2 was announced. What an astronomical coincidence&&Give me Randy Quaid. Keep it going with people Woody was in Kingpin with&&Nah, bring Bill Murray back and kill him again a la Kenny.&&Little Rock: Wait, who is Dan Aykroyd?&&“Any regrets?”

“Blues Brothers 2000, definitely.”&&Nick Cage as a crazier version of Nick Cage.  Like This is the End level Michael Cera parody.  I would be all in&&I'm kind of pulling for either Christopher Walken or Jeff Goldblum.&&Tom Hanks appearance would be pretty great.&&What if I have a burning question about Rampart?&&Scrolled down way too far for a Rampart AMA reference. &&Those things *do* have an expiration date. 

EDIT: goddamn none of you people realize this is a quote from the movie&&Show me **potato salad**!&&And Ozzy Osbourne &&Cher and roaches, cockroaches and Cher&&And cockroach twinkie hybrids. &&But not Bill Murray&&Not the taste. The consistency.&&That they stole from Bill Murray's house, who stole them from other actors and no one dared to stop him.&&I have no doubt there’s going to be some humorous improv referencing to some of their previous work. &&I just want to see Emma Stone kill a zombie with her Academy Award.&&im so glad reddit does not write movies&&I want them to have all stolen Tesla's in some weird product placement from Elon Musk, and they've each bolted an Oscar to the hood as an ornament.

I also want the cars to be self-driving (so they can sleep and drive), but it ends up placing them in mortal danger because it comes across a horde and refuses to run over ""pedestrians"", so they have to reprogram them on the fly, so that instead of braking for pedestrians their cars speed up.

And then they accidentally run over Bruce Campbell. Or Psychostick.&&Woody hasn't won yet, other than that you're right.&&I think only Emma Stone has won an Oscar no? Also, Abigail Breslin was nominated for one before Zombieland.

&&If he jokes about Rampart we officially have to stop giving him shit.&&Let's only ask questions about Rampart
&&I'd love it if he did another ama and reddit only asked him questions about rampart&&Let's stick to Rampart.&&They could use it to make the trailers funnier too.

Just go with Zombieland: Double Tap.  Also, what happened to the TV show?  Wasn't there supposed to be a spin-off series?  &&#2ombieland&&Sounds like a ""Zombies on a plane"" kind of movie!&&left 4 zombieland 2&&Why doesn't he Wreck the Zombieland? &&Needs more emojis&&Seen it, the ending is shit&&The all anal final chapter &&Zombieland 2: When In Doubt, Know Your Way Out&&And shady people trying to militarize zombies &&I'm ok with that if it means Woody Harrelson running in high heels&&>Yes I have here a fucking dinosaur, lets start the bidding at five million...  and sold for twelve million.  
  
Literally the worst part of that shitty movie. &&All the actors are more relevant tbh&&You know, if he made a genuine attempt to learn about the site under an alt, post here and get an idea for how the culture is/how AMAs work- I think he could do another AMA and people would enjoy it. Especially if he could make jokes about his own mistakes. I really like him as an actor, regardless.&&And everyone can ask about rampart&&I wish I could go back in time before I read your comment and watched the trailer. &&There was a TV show?&&Just saw it... and hot damn. They casted different actors to play the original characters? No thanks.&&The what.&&Let's keep it about rampart&&Jesus that looked bad....

Not sure if the actors made the movie that great or if the writers of the TV show are just that bad... maybe both?&&Eisenberg: *Aheh, a-wahoo, ahey. Mmmmmfph!! A-hoo-hee, fight night*&&But wait 30+ years and you get Mad Max: Fury Road and Blade Runner 2049&&Incredibles Two would like a worse with you&&[deleted]&&Fun fact: that wasn't really *We Hate You Please Die*. It was *Last Song Kills Audience*, but for some reason the runtime couldn't spare the extra minute needed to include the real song even though they did film the scene for it.

Edit Bonus: [Here is the deleted scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3z1oLKjSEA)&&One of the best uses of a song in a movie of all time&&Kinda extra special since Metallica is very selective about letting their music be used in film.&&I'd like to see/hear 'Fuel' or 'Blitzkrieg' and see a hyper-edited fast opening showing the destruction of the world.&&Errmmmmm.... Finding Nemo? Actually no that'd be pretty cool.

I actually think you may be right&&She was always a lesbian, my man. &&[Weezer - Pink Triangle](https://youtu.be/QsVyBHJrNQw)&&We lost another one.&&Costanza?&&RIP(enis)&&I mean 8 months is pretty long. Nearly a year. People will marry after dating that long.&&Sounds like the start of a Weezer song&&I used to be as old as Little Rock.

I still am, but I used to, too.&&It can be hard getting Woody Harrelson to agree to films sometimes. He's a little like Bill Murray in that regard.&&Woody Harrelson has become a pastry chef because he heard about homemade twinkies &&They made a TV pilot that got terrible reception. Amazon doesn’t even let you watch it anymore. &&I mean people still like Zombies, so the rest of the shit is easy to figure out from there.&&Holy shit really?? I loved those games....&&I’m from Columbus and I loved that Michael Ceras character was named after my city!&&Whoa, whoa, whoa. Scott Pilgrim. &&I could have sworn that was Michael Cera in it. It’s ridiculous how similar they are.&&They should just go ahead and actually have Cera.&&I legit thought the head character of zombie land was Michael Cera for the longest time. &&Honestly introducing Michael Cera as an awkward, nervous character who almost steals Wichita away would be an interesting arch for Columbus . I’d like to see Columbus starting off as insecure about not being manly compared to the only other man around. Then someone who’s an even more exaggerated version of those traits comes along in some ways appeals to Wichita more, showing Columbus that his perceived flaws aren’t actually that bad. 

I don’t think it’d work great with the character as they were at the end of the original, but it’d be a rare take on a love triangle. &&No, just like shuffling in the background or something. &&Shaun of the Dead isn't anywhere in there? Seriously? I'd have never guessed.&&World War Z would've been better if they actually used the book material instead of just ripping the name.&&I had *no* idea.

That's impressive.&&Warm bodies was a Rom Zom&&Was this a quote from The Flash?&&I was hoping he'd mention Kingpin when rattling off Bill Fuckin Murray's movies.&&Or his old landlady!&&That’d be challenging considering I’m pretty sure he’s not allowed to leave Vermont &&Ms. Claudia for me. Preferably near a cold fridge and someone needing a beer. &&Pretty sure Randy Quaid might actually be eating people now.&&That could actually work. We saw him get shot and slowly drift off. And then it cuts to him wrapped up and thrown off a roof. It's not too much of a stretch to think he survived and then stumbles into a room and gets shot again. 

I would rather they try to do something original though. A lot of sequels to comedy movies fail because they repeat the same gag. &&Bring him back as a zombie and they have to kill him again. It's just as tramatic if not more so. Killing Bill Murray once is hard for anyone, killing him twice would emotionally break most people.&&[deleted]&&Oh god, imagine if anytime he does an AMA we only ask about the previous thing he did an AMA for.&&Someday very soon, life’s little cockroach gage is gonna go.........

&&*prove it*&&Favorite episode, when peter comes in with the hazmat suit and Chris is just like, “THE GOVERNMENTS HERE RUN ET RUN!” And ET just comes running out of nowhere lol&&Now I want it to come out that he's really done this and whispered ""no one will ever believe you"" each time&&If Woody Harrelson mentions Rampart, I will eat two Hershey bars.&&""I ever tell you about the time I fucked Alexandra Daddario?""

genius premise, as always, from sequel-of-sequel-of-sequel-etc cash-ins&&Fuck yeah.  I’m up for the return of Galaxia. &&Yeah that blew my mind. State of the art dinosaur created in a lab that kills on command using a fuckin Lazer gun and that’s only worth $25 million? The fuckin movie cost more than that to make. Actually, the budget of creating CGI dinosaurs was less than the entire haul of selling every Dino on the black market&&""We could make a *hundred million dollars* on this unethical murderous shit! Do you understand how much money that is?!""

""...Uhhhh yeah, with you as the business manager I think I'm starting to understand why this whole thing toppled over. Have you seen *Austin Powers*?""&&Let's keep this about rampart. &&[deleted]&&If he'll give Reddit another chance, Reddit would return the favor.

I put half the blame on whoever arranged the AMA for him--he clearly wasn't prepared for the venue, and a Reddit AMA isn't the run of the mill promotion stop for an actor.&&Your sacrifice saved me.. &&[deleted]&&Bruh I literally stopped half way before giving up. It was such a fucking suck fest. I personally felt betrayed. &&You only watched the trailer? You poor summer child...

From what I recall, it may not have been terrible if they hadn't tried to use the same characters with different actors. A zombieland TV show would've been a slam dunk at that time if they'd just introduced new characters in the same world. I recall it had a couple o  things right, but it was indeed terrible. About half as bad as the US IT crowd, which is the worst thing. The worst.&&There was a pilot. It wasnt very good. &&Funnily enough, it was always meant to be a TV show. The movie spawned out of a plan for a TV pilot, the different rules and zombie kill of the week were all meant to be recurring jokes in each ep. &&*force feeds you a Jolly Rancher*

EDIT: What have I done?&&Fuck me those two are fantastic 

The 30 year method is tried and true! &&Blade runner was tight&&As would Aliens and Terminator 2, literally two of the greatest sequels in movie history.&&>**probably** suck

But yeah I did overly generalize that 7+ year sequels are only to fill a launch date slot. That's not why Incredibles 2 finally got green lit.&&so sad.&&Where is My Mind by Pixies in Fight Club.&&The intro to the Dawn of the Dead remake says hi&&Top Gun would like a word with you on that.&&That and stuck in the middle with you, never do I hear that song without that scene playing in my head, you know the one.&&The End in Apocalypse Now is great too &&All Nightmare Long would work too and be appropriate given the music video was about Russians using zombies. &&I think Battery would be a better fast song to use, or Creeping Death for name alone. ~~They're also both off of Ride the Lightning like For Whom the Bell Tolls.~~&&*gimme fuel gimme fire gimme zabbazaddaziiiire*&&Disposable Heroes or Blackened would also be awesome.&&That’s what I tell myself. She came out just a few months after breaking it off with me. Her parents weren’t very supportive of it at first and I think she was afraid of it and was trying to prove to herself that she wasn’t. But it turns out, you can’t just say you’re not and magically not be. &&Maybe not. Sexuality is weird. But yeah, usually.&&Can we please get back to Rampart?&&It was so dumb too. It could have worked with new characters, but recasting the old ones was just weird &&Zombieland is full of characters named after places, except for Bill Murray. They could have used Orlando Bloom or Dakota Fanning instead to keep the gag going.

Fun fact: while driving, they talk about Hannah Montana. Bam, named after a place.

Fun fact bonus: Columbus's hot neighbor who tried to eat him isn't named, she's just called 2E (or whatever it was), so she's also named after a place.&&I gotta pee on her.&&Tell it to cleaning lady on Monday.&&I think garlic bread would have to be my favourite all-time food. I could eat it for every meal. Or just constantly, without stopping.&&Jesse Eisenberg was the poor-man's Michael Cera (at least at that time).&&Cameo as a zombie. This needs to happen.&&That would be great. I'd love that. &&Its not really very high up. It did better on home video than in theaters.&&I think the only way they could really stay true to the book is if Netflix or Amazon turned it into a TV series. Every chapter tells a different story in a different setting, so those could be the different episodes.&&World War Z would've been incredible if it had an original name. 

Although, some of the scenes made no damn sense. Like how a zombie got on an airplane (transformation takes 12 seconds, theres no way he got on the plane with an infection, got a seat, waited till the plane was in the air, and then turned).&&I mean it wasn't *that* bad of a movie&&Yep. Season 4.&&I literally frowned when he didn’t.&&You really jarred something loose there tiger&&Unless they openly joke about it like 22 Jump Street. &&I'm pretty sure he'd be in a coma after how many times they bumped his head trying to get him out onto the balcony.

If they don't dress up like zombies and go play golf I'll be upset &&Is that the one with the dick nose?&&Holy Jesus. I forgot about that movie. Fucking Humpty! &&This has to happen.

In fact, we should ask about Rampart regardless of who does the Zombieland 2 AMA.&&That's the most Reddit thing that could happen.&&I see your bet and raise you 4 to 1 odds....&&A mini golf castle with a zombie on the Rampart that no one is paying attention to except Woody. He keeps saying “Guys, up there on the Rampart” and they keep ignoring him because of some bullshit fight.  Eventually it’s a bajillion zombies and he screams “LOOK AT THE FUCKING RAMPART!!!!”.  Or something. &&We need to strart a twitter campaign to inform woody that his AMA was soo bad that its good and dank meme-worthy.&&https://www.reddit.com/r/TTDSWAD/

NSFW&&Oscar De La Hoya zombie incoming. &&They must not have seen rampart&&A lot of it is Hollywood politics, and he seems like someone who might rub a lot of voting members the wrong way.&&...reddit doesn’t decide if he gets an Oscar or not&&I mean, he's a consistently great character actor, but it doesn't surprise me he doesn't an Oscar. His problem is probably that he's sort of type cast. His characters tend to have very similar personas, in a way that anytime he pops up in a movie you probably immediately recognize what kind of character he's going to be. So even if he's really good in a movie, Oscar voters are never going to be like ""Wow! I'm amazed that Woody Harrelson played THAT part,"" which is the kind of reaction that tends to get people oscars. &&White Man Can't Jump? That is a classic. Criminal he didn't win anything for that.&&Time for your medication, Mr. Beatty...&&Emma Stone does make some pretty good pictures, glad to see her get recognized for it in Moonlight.&&yup&&Or him crying over his lil ~~puppy~~ baby boi&&Not that the two are related...&&His only regret was Garfield&&Don't do that to me.&&Zombieland: The Search For More 2inkies?&&Sounds like some place in south African &&Dont tease me. I would watch the shit out of this. Just people drifting through crowds of zombies in spike covered death cars. Same cast. Same quality acting. &&👉👌👍&&I'm very interested in seeing that&&Devil’s advocate- there have been dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park universe for about 20 years by the time JW rolls around. It’s not entirely inconceivable that they’d think to use dinosaurs as weapons.

Does that mean the movie did a good job establishing that? Nope. Not in the slightest.&&> These things will replace thousands of boots on the ground

Well I didn't see you doing that with wolves or tigers in the past, and those animals are a lot more cheaper to make than raptors&&*I feel like dancing, dancing!*🎵🎵&&[deleted]&&I was thinking that too. But I try to rationalize it by saying by the dinosaur auction was extremely illegal, therefore they couldn’t exactly advertise or attract a larger number of bidders. The auction also had to take place very quickly by design. Anyone who buys a dinosaur would also have to keep it secret due to the legality of it(probably violates a few UN laws as well)....So the buyers don’t gave nearly as many ways to profit off these Dino’s...at least not in the short term. Not to mention the fact that dinosaurs have been around for decades and they would be *quite* as amazing as they would be if they were a brand new things (like at the original park).

.

But even considering all of that they still shouldn’t have been selling for a good deal more (maybe there was a massive price of several million just to be part of the auction? Who knows. &&Nothing is more relevant. &&Looked at some of her recent films on IMDB.

Yeah...not good.&&She was pretty funny as Chanel #5 on Scream Queens (which wasn’t a great show, but it had some campy horror fun)&&This question must be stickied by mods and answered first;   


I swear this is (allegedly) a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you (allegedly) crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You (allegedly) ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanne. You (allegedly) didn't call her afterwards. She (allegedly) cried a lot.

>I'll never understand the vehement hate the pilot received from die-hard Zombieland fans.  You guys successfully hated it out of existence.

also the church, that one is horrible&&It wasn't but it had no right to be called World War Z. Could called it generic running zombies movie and no one would have cared.&&It was also mentioned in the second season of Luke Cage&&Huh. I should catch up on the show - I heard season 4 was shit.&&That's a good point. I totally forgot about that, that was a sequel that lived up to the original, if not surpassing it.

I don't know about other people, but I like Zombieland because it's different and original. I don't want the sequel to just retread old ground. I want to see something new that stands out from anything else, and repeating the same old gags from the original wouldn't really work in the same way the almost 4th wall breaking 22 Jump Street did. That movie worked because not only was it a sequel whose story was the same as the original, but it was also based on a TV show of the same premise. All that adds to the humor of it. It's a lot different than a sequel to an original movie just doing the same jokes again. 

I wouldn't be opposed to it, but it would be pretty hard to do. 22 Jump Street managed to pull it off but there a plenty of similar movies that failed. 

At the end of the day, I don't care what they do as long as it's funny. And repeating a single joke isn't gonna make or break the movie, it would just be kinda predictable.  &&That’s 8 Hershey bars you mad man!&&I’ll beat you to it and eat 20😏&&Can we please talk about the Rampart??&&I wonder if he even knows that his PR team did an AMA&&Thanks&&Holy OG name, batman.&&[deleted]&&I feel like we're getting off topic.

>Film producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, along with music supervisor Michael Dilbeck, had over 300 songs to employ on Top Gun. Testing compositions against the dailies of the opening scenes at the aircraft carrier, nothing satisfied them, and Bruckheimer asked soundtrack producer Giorgio Moroder to write something. With the help of songwriter Tom Whitlock, he composed ""Danger Zone"" and had Joe Pizzulo record a demo. With the approval of the producers, soundtrack distributor Columbia Records requested Moroder to have ""Danger Zone"" performed by an artist signed by the label.[4]

>The band Toto was originally intended to perform the track, but legal conflicts between the producers of Top Gun and the band's lawyers prevented this.[5]

>Bryan Adams was approached to allow his song ""Only the Strong Survive"" on the soundtrack and perform ""Danger Zone"", to which Adams declined any involvement, feeling that the film glorified war, and he did not want any of his work linked to it.

>REO Speedwagon was also approached to perform ""Danger Zone"", to which the group declined due to not being allowed to contribute any of its own compositions to the soundtrack.

>Corey Hart was also approached to perform ""Danger Zone,"" to which he declined, preferring to write and perform his own compositions.[6]

>Eventually, the film producers agreed that ""Danger Zone"" would be recorded and performed by Kenny Loggins.[5] Whitlock went to Loggins' Encino home, and once shown the lyrics, the singer added his own improvisations.[4]&&You're right, I'm an idiot.&&At the time, all she would tell me is that it was over. No reason. No if’s, and’s, or but’s. Just done. 

In all fairness, at that same time, there was a lot of instability in her family because her parents were fighting a lot and ended up separating like a week before she ended our relationship. So with everything spiralling for her, I can’t say I’m surprised at the timing of her coming out. 

There were clues about her though. The biggest one being that she had a crush on a girl from school. Which I was cool with. I figured she was bi-curious, or even bisexual, and had no issue with that as long as she didn’t cheat. (Before someone asks: no, to my knowledge she never hooked up with that crush before or after breaking up with me.) 

When I found out that she came out as a lesbian rather than bi, I was pretty shook. Partially because I was the last guy she ever dated. Partially because I never fully got over her. And partially just because of my own insecurities. 

I’m starting to ramble... to answer your question, *IF* I had known at the time, I think it would have been easier (but not easy) for me if she just wanted to be with someone else. But that answer will differ for any person who has been in a similar situation. &&Well, now you've doubled it.

Plus, British films don't make big bucks in the US now, let alone 14 years ago.&&No one really did.  As popular as Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright may now be among filmgoers, they were unknowns when Shaun of the Dead came out (In America at least, I don't know about Britain).

Say in passing that the main character bumped into Columbus who told him about the rules on how to survive zombieland and the whole naming method.

You can then introduce the ""navigation"" character aspect and spin it that way (I think you have to do it later in the show,  but it could possibly work).

But because they used old characters who were already established, everyone had a predetermined picture of who those characters where* (and it was far from what they thought...)


I kinda hope they acknowledge it's failure in 2, but we'll see :)

FML&&[deleted]&&In CO every movie ticket will come with a joint&&Inhaling's fine, just don't exhale.&&Mannnn don't even joke it took me like 2 days to calm down and get that shit outta my head lol. Still not as bad as the first time I did shrooms though, thought I was stuck in Subnautica(was using my Vive) a la Sword Art Online and that I didn't have any lives left. That was another lesson learned for sure though, I thought that since I was taking them wet(fresh) that I had to take 10X as much, 30G and like 2 hours later I wasn't feelin it so I was like ""Oh it must be like weed and my first pass metabolism means I'm just gonna have to do a bit more than my buddies said"" so took another 40/50g's. Was definitely not the smartest decision I've made, bout an hour later that first batch hit and I felt fucking GREAT, then I got tired and was like oh well might as well lay down. 

Then the rest hit and holy fuck trying to go to sleep was the worst decision ever, my kidneys started hurting and I thought maybe I hadn't thoroughly inspected them and maybe some evil mold had gotten through or that I OD on some vitamin or something possibly. If it wasn't for the little stupid finger thing that told me my heart rate and oxygen% I probably would've flipped my shit even more. Shit was terrifying especially if I closed my eyes, worst nausea ever but kept drinking water just to throw it back up and put on Finding Nemo on repeat b/c that's like my goto chill movie. Ended up being fine of course but holy shit woke up with like the 2nd worst cottonmouth I'd ever had.&&Now it will happen cause you read that and it's stuck in your subconscious muhahaha.&&I guess idk shit was terrifying for me, the concept of being alive for eternity and reliving things over and over because you've essentially gone insane. I was having like an existential crisis n shit, like ""If I didn't do something while I was alive and try to do it now will my mind just make up what it believes would've happened, or will my mind prevent me from doing that action? Like if I never saw a movie while I was ***really*** alive, would it just be what I imagined I thought the movie would be like? Or would I never pick a movie that I never saw, as in my mind would *direct* me to a different choice? If it's the latter then am I not just a prisoner in an endless loop until my mind finally deteriorates to nothing? Maybe that's why I've got frontotemporal lobar degeneration because I've been through the loop too many times, maybe the reason I'm really choosing to distance myself from the people around me is because my mind is losing more and more of its ability to remember what they were actually like and I've been through so many times that I'm also losing the ability to imagine new scenarios?

This is about as true as it gets.&&Seems like a good, well thought out statement. Nice to see the whole cast come together like this and support James Gunn, I think that shows how much they like and respect him. I highly doubt this will actually change the situation, but it's still nice of the cast I think.&&Thank God I'm not famous and 4chan is an anonymous board, because the edgelord things I said as a teenager were often offensive bordering on reprehensible. &&I'm sure Disney would prefer to not be judged on some of their previous actions and movies.&&[deleted]&&Dear US: Stop Making People Apologize All the Time

You aren't even offended. You just want to judge people. And it's some kind of sick power high in forcing someone to humble themselves, and then destroy their career. &&I've read the statement twice, and it's interesting how it does not actually call for his reinstatement.

Yes, they support Gunn. Yes, they are encouraged by the support. Yes, they look forward to working with him in future. But at no point are those three statements put together in a solid support/threat for him to return as director.

~~Some people are very aware which side their bread is buttered.~~  
Edit: Apparently they've been asking outside the confines of this carefully worded statement, so maybe not....&&Wow.

I think we need to take a minute and realize how much this is unlike any situation we’ve seen. It’s really starting to feel like Disney made a knee-jerk decision. I wouldn’t be surprised if they do for Gunn what AMC did for Hardwick- let things cool down for a while, conduct an “investigation”, and then bring him back into the fold. 

I can’t believe that all of these prominent voices are sticking their necks out in support of Gunn for no reason. It’s clear at this point that the man who directed the last two Gaurdians movies is not the same man emotionally or mentally as the guy who made those absurd and gross tweets 9 years ago. I’m someone who believes strongly in second chances and giving people opportunities to change. He should come back. &&Serious request: the cast and multiple Redditors have said Gunn apologized for this tweets before.  The only apology i can find is in 2012 , which is for anti-gay blog posts, not the rape/child molestation tweets. 

Is there a separate apology where he directly acknowledges the tweets and rape jokes prior to just recently? Source?&&just give it to Uwe Boll already&&Social media was fun, but now it is time to end the experiment.&&Ironic that Reddit and it’s users are probably the single most prevalent promoter of mob responses to these which hunts. 

The only difference this time is the subject of the mob makes some art the commentariat adores. If Dunn was politically objectionable he’d be finished. &&Can I ask why is there a difference between James Gunn and any other person who did something similar?  I'm a little surprised by all the support, I feel like if he hadn't been the director of GOTG and it was someone else everyone would still be critical, and I can't help but think the only reason people support him is because of GOTG.&&The Reddit mob is no different. &&It's not often that you can say that an entire film cast ""gets"" what's actually going on these days. This is one of those few times where you can. They've just gained my absolute respect, and the expression ""there is no due process in the court of public opinion"" is one I'll be remembering for a long time. I think Gunn's tweets were sick and tasteless, but they pre-dated his tenure at Disney and they weren't an endorsement of child pornography.
&&Outrage mob gets someone they don’t like fired: 

>......

Outrage mob gets someone they like fired: 

>Oh my god. We cannot allow this. We must give people second chances. He’s a changed man. &&*Jack Sparrow punches a lady in the face and gets high-fived by Mickey Mouse*&&Never thought Hollywood would admit to the character assassination culture they created.  I wonder if they are getting tired of getting caught in the traps they themselves set?&&While I agree with most of that letter, 2 things:

1) Gunn himself was very much part of the narrative that is polarizing and splitting apart America. If celebs don't want to be part of that narrative, they should simply stay out of heavy politics.

2) Gunn's own political side set the precedent for this type of corporate zero-tolerance firings by cheering on Roseann's demise. 

So yes I agree with what they are saying in the letter, but in this case he pretty much dug his own grave.&&Disney should get off their high horses talking about morals and what not when they blatantly stole The Lion King from Kimba the White Lion.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&I was banned from r/marvel for saying that I actually support Disney in their stance of cracking down on this behavior. They banned me for ""spam"", my only message there was saying that I agree with Disney.

I don't really care if you agree with me or not. Getting banned from a subreddit for that is pretty sad. I'm actually glad they did, if this middle ages censorship is their way of dealing with people they disagree is not a place I want to be in. &&Gunn got fired by The Walt Disney Company, not Marvel, not Disney Pictures. That's like Comcast firing a director on an Illumination film, the literal layers they broke down just to fire Gunn is fucking insane, and honestly I've never seen it done. Even Roseanne got fired by ABC, the company she actually worked for directly. Disney took control from Marvel.

My guess is Kevin is probably pissed. Very pissed.&&Kevin is still silent on the matter. One would hope he’s trying to either 1) hire a new director/changing the MCU release schedule or 2) negotiating with his bosses on possibly hiring Gunn back in some form &&I'm sure this is the kind of headache they hate, but then, he was hired in the first place and it's not as if they weren't aware about his past (or at least they should have been, given that the source of the controversial statements he made is Twitter).&&Who’s Kevin?&&Pretty sure Kevin didn't get any input on this one.  The mouse gave him his orders and had them carried out.&&Probably nothing because Disney prefers to distance themselves from controversy or things that could hurt their image or their intellectual properties and the various companies it owns. I wouldn't expect them to say anything unless this starts getting a lot of airtime in the news.

I kind of think Gunn is being punished for some misguided jokes that many are blowing way out of proportion. Disney just fired him to stay ahead of the curve given how quickly the internet SJW hate machine can get rolling whenever a public figure does something stupid or controversial.&&*Next week Disney will announce the new cast for the Guardians vol 3!*&&[deleted]&&POM\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_k&&Pom___________ff&&“A BIG ASS H”- John Mulaney &&Meanwhile Bautista's is smooth as butter.&&It's kind of interesting to see all of their signatures.

I didn't recognize her name or who she was in the movie, so I googled her and came across her wikipedia page.  Holy shit:

That's...that's very weird to me. &&TwoSpidermenPointingAtEachOther.jpeg&&In the past week or so alone I can recall two stories where Reddit was outraged only for them to be false alarms/fabricated. 

The people who requested (politely) people wait and see before they react were all downvoted.

Reddit is just as bad as any other social media website when it comes to moral or political issues. &&We're up there with Twitter and Tumblr when it comes to being baited into foaming at the mouth with outrage. But I'd say Twitter edges past us still for first place. Mostly because there's no character limit and it's easier for some semblance of rationality to get through here.&&I feel like this is one of the more underrated comments here.  We have such a knee jerk reaction to so many situations like this in America.  It's like a clock starts ticking once we hear/read some piece of news and we have to give a opinion in less than 60 seconds.  &&Thank you for putting the thoughts in my head into words.

&&Attorneys, like me, have a weird ego about signatures. I've made copies of letters that I've nailed in terms of the signature and have researched signature design. Telling a lawyer he has a nice signature is a HUGE compliment. &&People are quitting twitter now because they supported Gunn and then everyone starts attacking them.  The entire thing is fucking stupid. &&It's almost like politicizing every little thing in order to get people you don't like fired was a bad call.&&They should have said this 3 firings ago&&I just saw this posted on Pratts IG - He even wrote that while he doesn't support the jokes from years ago, he wants him back in the directors chair for GOG 3.  I really hope this changes the course of the decision to remove him.  &&> I highly doubt this will actually change the situation, but it's still nice of the cast I think.

Yeah, it's hard to imagine Disney going back on their decision, but still to see the cast united behind Gunn like that speaks volumes about their feelings towards him.  Even if this doesn't lead to him being rehired for GoG Vol. 3, it should help Gunn get work in the future.&&Honestly, I think it's good that some actors are taking a stand against the ""court of public opinion."" It's not even like he said anything hateful or honestly advocated for anything morally wrong, his jokes just weren't funny and in extraordinarily poor taste. I hope more actors (and society as a whole) take to the defense of people getting fired for things that happened many, many years ago. I know that I won't be seeing Guardians 3 in theaters if Gunn isn't the director, since I don't support this kind of behavior.&&Thank God you were smarter as a teenager than Gunn was as a 40 year old man by making your edgy offensive jokes anonymously.&&After much thought, I have decided to personally fire Disney due to their 1946 movie Song of the South, as well as the racist centaur scene from Fantasia. I expect them to disband their company and have everything out of their desks by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.&&It’s ironic that Gunn was trying to unleash one on Ben Shapiro and it backfired when they used the same trick (bringing up old tweets) on him. &&Don't act like Reddit doesn't do the exact same shit.&&If you give twitter fuel, you better be prepared for fire.&&Nobody thought it was such a bad idea a month ago when it happened to Roseanne. Including James Gunn.&&Lots of ppl have become too comfortable w/ playing the clean out your desk card.

Chill the fuck out. Your moral compass is spinning out of control.&&I really hope you mean US as in us as a people, and not US and in the United States alone, because this is hardly a single countries problem, and acting like it is isn't very good step towards stopping this behavior. &&It likely went through a whole bunch of lawyers and what have you.

&&Chris at least asked for it on his Instagram:

>prattprattprattAlthough I don’t support James Gunn’s inappropriate jokes from years ago, he is a good man. I’d personally love to see him reinstated as director of Volume 3. If you please, read the following statement- signed by our entire cast.

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3OVfeF8Dc/&&[Some of them](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3OXm6HLX0/) [are saying it](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3OcIbhU9e/) [on Instagram though](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3OlKGHlEH/).

EDIT: Fixed a link.

EDIT 2: [Pratt, too.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl3OVfeF8Dc/)&&They all directly said in their accompanying tweets that they would like him reinstated as director. &&Open letters aren't really the place to make demands or threats. This is a statement of solidarity.&&[deleted]&&What AMC did to Hardwick was amiable. At first I hated the dude but AMC investigated suspended him and tried to reach out to the other party. When AMC finished it's investigation they saw no evidence of wrongdoing and cleared him. They didn't fire him without due process and they didn't ignore the other parties accusations. It was very professional on there part.

Now if they can make TWD good again.&&One of two things are going on. Either Disney is really, really afraid of being associated with any negative press, or someone in the studio has been waiting for any reason to fire James Gunn for personal reasons... Considering the speed of his firing and how long ago these were posted, I assume the latter.&&I just can’t help but think this was a good excuse for Disney to get rid of someone they had a problem with. Not sure if it was financial, or creative - but I don’t think this was just about the jokes...&&I think Disney is in a tough spot.

They cancelled Rosanne because of controversy, and then James Gunn's issue popped up.  Most likely Disney took the ""Zero tolerance"" approach to keep things level on both sides.  A lot of conservatives were upset about Rosanne being cancelled.  The president himself even made a comment about it asking why Disney doesn't look at Libral issues like that.

This is most likely Disney showing that they don't care about the politics view of things and just being even handed to both sides.&&They should have just announced a ""suspension"", and, like you said, done an internal investigation.   At the end Gunn would have to issue another apalogy and maybe go to sensitivity training.

But the judgement Disney handed down was so swift and so strongly worded it would be hard to walk back, now.  

&&""...'I felt like Guardians forced me into a much deeper way of thinking about, you know, my relationship to people, I suppose. I was a very nasty guy on Twitter. It was a lot fucking edgy, in-your-face, dirty stuff. I suddenly was working for Marvel and Disney, and that didn't seem like something I could do anymore. I thought that that would be a hindrance on my life. But the truth was it was a big, huge opening for me. I realized, a lot of that stuff is a way that I push away people. When I was forced into being this"" — he moved his hand over his chest — ""I felt more fully myself.'""

And what's ""this""?

""'Sensitive, I guess?"" he said. ""Positive. I mean, I really do love people. And by not having jokes to make about whatever was that offensive topic of the week, that forced me into just being who I really was, which was a pretty positive person. It felt like a relief.'"" - from Gunn's Buzzfeed interview https://www.buzzfeed.com/amphtml/adambvary/james-gunn-guardians-of-the-galaxy

I don't exactly know why they say ""he apologized"" but he did express regret. Not that I support his termination, I just... don't get that either.&&Some of the guys that worked with Uwe already worked on GOTG.&&Uwe is retired, and even then, he only does video game movies or bad exploitation films&&Chris Pratt is a conservative and very pro-gun. If this was *him* they'd probably be ripping him apart.&&I'll trust their word on Gunn's character rather than a bunch of angry, reactionary strangers who think someone making an offensive joke automatically means s/he condones despicable acts.&&Theyll do whatever is advantageous for their career to do so. 

Cover up an insiduous pattern of sexual abuse one week, then gloat in the glow of castigating it the next. &&Look what they did to Michael Jackson. Holy hell.&&Lol that’s exactly it &&Gunn had already defended his firing, BTW: https://i.redd.it/92zqh5goyvb11.jpg

&&Absolute truth right here. While I don't support James Gunn's firing, I don't think he did himself any favors with the Roseann situation.&&>  If you want to shame me for being an Islanders fan, I doubt you can say anything to hurt me more than that team already has.

lol damn son.

Great write up though I can get behind this.&&In a real world with integrity and balance this would be top post. 

You literally hit everything on the head.

Moments like these do nothing but reinforce the bias and massive double standards that people show when it’s their political aisle on the hot seat.&&> ""Fuck the alt right"" - Indeed. Outrage culture and demanding firings is certainly not a tactic of their exclusive use or invention. If society in general set a standard that people (like Justine Sacco) must suffer consequences for their jokes, we can't then get angry when it affects someone who's work we enjoy. There was certainly a ton of digital ink spilled regarding Paula Deen losing her job in 2013 for saying racial slurs in her past, I did not see pieces like this written then. I didn't see much support offered for Hulk Hogan when he said abhorrent racial slurs on an old (stolen and private) video of him that became public. In fact, there are STILL articles all over the place criticizing the WWE for giving Hulk a second chance years after the comments came out (and he apologized), and even more years after he actually said them. We can't hold Gunn to a different standard because he's a talented writer and director with work more widely enjoyed than Deen or Hogan's. And we most certainly can't hold him to a different standard because of his outspoken liberalism.
> 

This is what gets me. The left has been the ones leading the charge on setting limits on what you are and aren't allowed to joke about, as well as (at least from my perspective) being the ones who organize massive internet lynch mobs to try to get people fired who make a comment they don't like. Some woman made fun of David Hogg on Twitter and thousands of people attacked her and her advertisers to get her fired.

So suddenly James Gunn, Liberal Extraordinare, makes dozens and dozens of jokes about baby-rape, and now it's ""woah guys hold on""? Even if it was 'alt-right trolls' who dug up the comments, they're playing by the same rules Internet Liberals not only made, but relish in.

Games aren't fun when you're losing.&&Right. I’ve read that he tweeted that he “likes it when young boys touch in his silly place” ... I feel like there’s nothing “political” about his firing — I fully understand why a company like Disney, with a huge young audience, fired him over his tweets. &&Exactly. 

A regular Joe gets fired for saying offensive things on Facebook or Twitter and no one bats an eye.

Some peoples preferred director says similarly offensive things on Twitter and gets fucking 300K+ votes on a petition and a defense force.

James Gunn directing an enjoyed movie series does not exclude him from the same consequences everyone else suffers from when poor decisions are made.&&Mickey: ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROL&&The layers:

GotG (The actual movie production) > Marvel Studios > Walt Disney Studios > The Walt Disney Company

Disney (as in TWDC) took control from both the Disney movie studios subsidiary and the Marvel Studios subsidiary of that to fire Gunn.&&> Gunn got fired by The Walt Disney Company, not Marvel, not Disney Pictures

Which makes it far worse because The Walt Disney Company had no problem with owning Miramax (crass humor, Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Weinstein) or making money on movies like Clerks, Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, or Reservoir Dogs, all of which had some pretty obscene moments in them. 

If it were Marvel, I could possibly accept it, because it would be an internal decision that was coming from the specific studio worrying about their own image... But this was a firing by the people who rubbed elbows with Weinstein, and allowed Kevin Smith's crass ""Clerks"" humor to hit theaters. It's wholly hypocritical. &&Yep.  Mouse came from the ivory tower to snatch away one of his best directors, probably without consulting him at all.&&I hope South Park brings back Mickey to rip on Disney for this&&> My guess is Kevin is probably pissed. Very pissed.

I can imagine Alan Horn hiding in the corner of his office while Feige angrily pounds on the door.&&Who is Kevin?&&More specifically, by all reports in the industry media Gunn was fired by Alan Horn. Kevin Feige was strongly against it. This wasn't even Bob Iger's decision but once Horn made the choice I Iger had to back his studio chief. This actually makes Iger's job of convincing key people at Fox to stay harder because Horn pulled the trigger before story even became public.  &&This won't work for Gunn but it's a fun secret-rehiring story anyway:  the puppeteer of Salacious Crumb in Return of the Jedi, Tim Rose, who also performed Admiral Ackbar (on camera, not voice), had to be [pretend-fired](http://starwarsinterviews1.blogspot.com/2010/01/tim-rose-interview.html) because he (as Salacious Crumb) made a disdainful comment about Harrison Ford between takes, and Ford was not having it. But Ford couldn't see Rose and had no idea who he was, so they just changed Rose's name on the call sheet to ""new guy"" and he kept working, doing more scenes with Ford in both Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens 30 years later.&&""We've got a new director. His name is Jim Gann.""&&I could see Disney bring Gunn back on as a producer, but that wouldn't matter creatively all that much, it'd just be them trying to regain some good press&&It must not have seemed like a big decision for them at the time.  I mean, they didn't hire Gunn to helm a billion dollar franchise; they hired him to direct a shot-in-the-dark sci-fi comedy.  Of the three bankable stars attached, two of them were only doing voice work, and the third was a woman in green face paint.  No one had ever heard of the comics.  Everything about that movie was a gamble, including the director.

The irony may be lost on them that Gunn is responsible for making it into the franchise that it became.&&[deleted]&&I'm talking about Kevin Feige.

This is like if somebody got fired from a Sony Movie



Movie Production > Sony Pictures > Sony Entertainment > Sony America > Sony Japan (which Reddit mostly knows for tech).



That is how strange it is for the Disney Company to get involved.&&Well the movie production is basically a shell company, since Marvel Studios runs their own productions it's a top-down thing (unlike an indie production company). But yeah, it's Feige's show, essentially.&&I just find it hard to believe Disney has connections with Tarantino when the media does the exact same thing that some outlets did to Gunn, and they didn't bat an eye&&Well the difference is the Marvel brand is representative of Disney. Its in their theme parks, they want stuff associated that close to be kid friendly. Miramax is kept separate entirely specifically for things they don't feel belong connected to the Disney brand.&&Welcome to Hollywood. If they didn’t have double standards they wouldn’t have any standards at all. &&>Kevin Smith, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Weinstein

that escalated quickly, didn't it&&Let's not forget that Nightmare Before Christmas is a Disney film, and that condoned some serious violence against Santa:

http://www.metrolyrics.com/kidnap-the-sandy-claws-lyrics-burton-tim.html&&I honestly believe it was a legitimate knee jerk reaction following Roseanne. She made racist comments amd was insta fired with huge support. Regardless of who or why, his old comments surfaced and I assume Disney was playing it safe and just cutting him loose. He also wasn't actually the director yet, though heavily assumed to be (by himself also). People are up in arms about this only because it became political, originally nobody really cared or opposed the decision. I dont think he should be fired for comments in the past like that at all, just the precident was recently set for comments to get you fired and their actions make sense. Plus it IS Disney, and he had comments about raping children, that is rather far for the mouse.&&*Nobody tells the mouse no*&&Frankly that's why I'm so iffy on this whole situation.

Stuff like this doesn't happen. Last big director firing was Paramount's animated ""Amusement Park"" and Paramount fired that guy, not Viacom, and that guy actually did things far worse than make tweets. The big overseeing corporation wouldn't get so publicly involved like this. It makes me wonder what do the Disney Company know that we don't because the firing is a huge overreaction based on crappy tweets from 10 years ago.&&After telling us not to look at all those old racist videos they made. &&The episode opens on a caveman in the Paleolithic era.

At the height of his fame, some of his past misdeeds from a primitive era are made public through the discovery of ancient cave drawings. His status is destroyed overnight by a political smear campaign and the public sentences him to another 3 million years of deep freeze. The episode ends somehow. Mickey Mouse is there. Huh-*huh*! I don't know, I'm high.&&Alan horn is 75 years old and his contract expires this year. I don't think his opinion is going to matter for very much longer regardless.

There's only so much actors can do with source material though, and pro wrestling's source material doesn't allow much room between ""sufficient"" acting and ""great"" acting. You can point to Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage as exceptions, but they weren't just propped up by their personas—they had an entire industry's marketing wing assisting them (furthermore, while I acknowledge the utter cocaine-fueled energy needed to sustain such a personality, it's not demonstrative of *range*, which is often a strong facet of how great actors are judged in the long run).

Alternatively, I'd love to see Bautista in something closer to a hybrid Wuxia-style movie. I think one of my favorite fight scenes is [Meals on Wheels—Jackie Chan & Benny ""the Jet"" Urquidez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-ltRBEu0IU). I'd love to see Bautista in a sequence that *technical* and see what his shape and acting bring to such a role.

“Fuck your Facebook events”... is my response.

Make no mistake, I’m not as close to friends or family anymore but that’s how it is... if I don’t care about them enough to text them? I don’t need them. If they don’t text me back after I text them? I don’t need them either.

Fuck Facebook, Fuck Instagram, Fuck Twitter. 

They’re all a bunch of time-wasting bullshit, for the most part, and carry no more added value to your personal life than a credit card does to your finances... is it good to have? Maybe, but it’s fucking risky to use except in certain ways and,  most people are probably better if it’s just not in their wallet at all, tempting them to use it all fucking day. 

Edit; to those of you bitching about how I’m on Reddit while dissing social media, I’ll take that on the chin but just add that *I HAVE NO FRIENDS ON REDDIT*.  You’re flanking the premise of my argument as I suspect is your intention. Because, if you’re trying to point out that I’m a hypocrite? I’ll beat you to it and just admit that I am. Grab a mirror, you are too.&&Ok not to be a dick, but I use this excuse when it's someone I don't want to be around but don't want to confront directly. Yeah I know, it's shitty, but it may not be bad to consider maybe they're dropping you a hint. &&I noticed that after dropping facebook, I have fewer interactions with friends, but the interactions I do have are far more fulfilling.

He was the one bringing up comments by Ben Shapiro when he was a teenager as a way to attack him.  People simply did the same thing to Gunn.

They did their own investigation and re-instated his job. I personally don’t know if what he did was true, but AMC seems to think that either what the truth is was not terrible enough to fire him or they were not the truth.&&Per everything I've read, Disney was in a tough spot because they can't afford to have their share prices drop during the 21st Century Fox deal, and even though they could probably ride out the negative PR associated with Gunn, they don't want to take the risk that the stock won't rebound in time. The timing of the whole thing just sucks. &&The problem is there is so much mob mentality overreaction right now that companies are in an extremely tough spot if they don’t want to be catch the shit too.

Nope. Marvel Studios is a separate company from Marvel Ent. which is ran by Perlmutter. Marvel Studios is under Disney Pictures, Marvel Entertainment’s it’s own thing which control the toys, TV shows, and comics.

We live in a world where our digital footprint can make a huge outcome regarding careers. Disney has had no problem hiring other people with incindiary attitudes and humor (I think someone mentioned Sarah Silverman, Johnny Depps current controversy comes to mind.) but the other side of it is we are continuing to see people draw hard lines on humor,  conduct and speech. Who can say what comes next? I don’t believe James Gunn will work with Disney again, but I do think other studios will be will to snatch him up. &&Honestly, have petitions ever worked for anything?&&Dave Bautista put it this way on Twitter:

*“I will have more to say but for right now all I will say is this..@JamesGunn is one of the most loving,caring,good natured people I have ever met. He’s gentle and kind and cares deeply for people and animals. He’s made mistakes. We all have. Im NOT ok with what’s happening to him.”*


https://twitter.com/DaveBautista/status/1020502763430559744&&They have no chance of re-hiring Gunn, but this sets a good precedent that Disney may think twice before firing someone else for joke tweets from many years ago.&&I'm not justifying either decision but if you've read his statements regarding all this I feel like they speak to his character pretty well. It doesn't seem like many people in hollywood can make that straightforward of an apology or directly own their mistakes without justifying them somehow or trying to make it seem like they were having a ""personal crisis""

I guess all i'm saying is his apologies seemed very genuine and in this situation im not sure what else you can expect from someone.&&I doubt they will rehire him because Disney has a VERY strict policy about stuff that their directors/actors say.

Edit, fewer ppl,&&The weirdest part to me about this is the people who are going reaaaal far to defend the tweets. You can think his tweets were garbage AND that he shouldn't have been fired but people are acting like it was some tame one off joke he's being fired for. Like the sheer volume of his tweets is insane. Also they weren't really even jokes. There are so many people in here going 'Oh comedy is dead, other comedians have made off color jokes like that!' A comedian isn't getting up on stage and going 'I jerked off a kid HAHAHAHA' because there isn't a joke there.

Edit: I seriously question some of your reading abilities. Since I've gotten so many 'Yeah but he shouldn't have been fired!' responses when I literally said that. &&For all the people saying, “but it was 10 years ago he said these things”. The whole thing started because Gunn was giving Ben Shapiro shit for tweets he made 10 years ago. So there is an element of instant karmic payback for his hypocrisy. 

Me, I’d be happy if both sides ditched the politically correct BS.&&I wish some of these so-called defenders of liberty would start to understand what freedom of speech is AND isn’t. Roseanne is allowed to say whatever she wants. It doesn’t mean @ABCNetwork needs to continue funding her TV show if her words are considered abhorrent. 

— James Gunn (@JamesGunn) May 29, 2018

ayyyy lmao&&So, I feel like a lot of people don't really know the whole saga here.

There's a director named Mark Duplass. He wrote a tweet saying that if liberals want to try and reach across the aisle, Ben Shapiro is a good person to follow because he's honest and genuinely a nice person.

Mark Duplass got mercilessly harassed by liberals on twitter over this. James Gunn then defended Mark, but in doing so he kind of threw Ben Shapiro under the bus. Specifically, Gunn brought up things that Shapiro wrote over 10 years ago, (That he apologized for a long time ago.) as evidence that Shapiro is a terrible person.

That was why people went through Gunn's Twitter and held him accountable for things he said 10 years ago. Because Gunn had just done the exact same thing to Ben Shapiro.

Furthermore, left wing activists have a pretty long history of going after the jobs of conservatives whenever they find dirt on conservatives on social media.

So now conservatives are out for blood. I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm just stating an observation. This is part of how politics is done these days. This may be the first time conservatives have gotten a liberal fired for things said on social media, but it won't be the last I think.&&Given this whole thing started with him harrassing someone for no reason, and how pro twitter-mob he's been in the past, as much as I like him as a director, it's the kind of justice he advocates for, so I can't in good conscious prevent him from falling on his own sword.&&I respect him for his statement, and I'm sure he has changed and matured. 

But holy fuck, those tweets were pretty awful. &&This is why you shouldn't support outrage culture, because the social mob won't always go after the people you think deserve it.&&Unless you are conservative then its torches and pitchforks.&&You fuckers created this mob mentality. Now, when it strikes someone you admire, you lament how this sort of action is unjustifiable. 

Literally be careful what you wish for and what you mob mentality. Stop with the double standard and excusing behavior. Fucking ridiculous. &&Oh cool, I’ll get in on this.&&""my just sense of morality applies only to people I dislike""&&He played the game of digging up old tweets and taking things out of context against Conservatives. Well surprise, they can play that game too.&&Hmm. I feel like I’m on the outs of opinion on this matter in that I still feel Disney is justified for firing him while also understanding the guy gunning for Gunns firing is an irredeemable individual who only did this for revenge and not some benevolent reason.

I love it! &&Regardless of whether or not you think he deserves to lose his job, Disney made a smart and completely understandable business decision by not wanting to be associated with someone who is now infamous for making pedophilia jokes.

To hold people accountable for their words and actions from years ago, or does that only apply to people we aren't supposed to like.

Yeah I get why people are pissed about someone getting fired over a Tweet, but Disney didn't have a ""bad"" reason for it.&&He also already apologized for them 6 years ago when he started with Disney, and deleted the tweets at that point. It wasn't something Disney didn't know about. They're trying to be reactionary after Rosanne, but hers was in the present 

Edit: I have been corrected that his apology 6 years ago appears to be related to other comments he had made in a blog post. Sorry for the mistake&&Dude, look at one single thing you posted on social media TEN+ YEARS AGO, you will want to strangle yourself. People change so much in 10 years, and the climate back then was completely different. It's so fucking stupid to hold everything people did in their lives to TODAYS standards. Whoever drudged up those old ass tweets and made a stink about them should be very ashamed of themselves. &&Were reaching a point where pulling your penis out and peeing on a tree when you were 7 will ruin you for life.

Are you saying they had never seen a James Gunn movie before they hired James Gunn?&&I wish that were true. If it was, Johnny Depp wouldn’t be hired anymore. &&Not strict enough to hire him in the first place lol&&True, that's why they put so much effort into photoshopping the cigarette out of Disney's hand in every picture they could find, and did their best to make us forget how racist a lot of their movies are&&The thing is - Disney had to have known about his past sense of humor when they hired him.

People keep saying ""well i said some stuff when i was a kid"". The thing is he wasn't a kid, he was 46 years old when he made those tweets, and he made those tweets for years. People make mistakes but don't act like he didn't deserve to be fired. I also hear people saying it was decades ago, his last tweet that i saw was in 2012, that's just 6 years. &&Right!

Edit3: Bautista makes it clear that Chris and Zoe are supporting James Gunn. He doubles down on his belief that James Gunn is a good person and was cyberattacked.

Edit2: Chris and Zoe have acknowledged what has happened, but left cryptic tweets. (this is old: not really siding with anyone as of yet.)

Fede Alavarez, Justin Roiland, Selma Blair, Lloyd Kaufman, Will Wheaton, and Michael Rosenbaum have all defended James.

The creator of Thanos and Drax Jim Starlin said Disney got played.

Co-creator of The Punisher (and several DC characters) Gerry Conway retweeted the petition.

Sean Gunn showed his love toward his brother, and Michael Rooker said that James already knows what he thinks (support obviously)

Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper have not said anything.

Patton Oswalt complained about his firing on Twitter

Joe Caranhan tweeted out the petition.

Bobcat Goldthwait asks Disney to remove his voice from an attraction at their parks because he has said “dumb” things in the past too. He still Loves and Supports James.

David Dastmalchian (The russian Kurt from Ant-Man) showed his support as well.

This is definitely within her brand of humor.&&I'd have to say joking about raping children WHEN YOU WORK AT A COMPANY THAT MAKES CHILDREN MOVIES is alot worse.&&At least the Silverman thing was kinda funny and mocked Hitler's insecurities instead of a 'Jews in ovens' joke.&&Go check out some of the things Sarah Silverman has tweeted in the past I guarantee it's worse, and yet she is currently the voice of a Disney Princess.&&If they really cared, they wouldn’t have hired him in the first place.

James Gunn was 40. He wasn't some little kid making these totally awful and unacceptable tweets. That said, his apology seemed extremely genuine so I think he deserves a break.&&He was 41 years old ten years ago.&&I dont know there this 10+ years ago came from - the last tweets there from 2012, he basicly stopped when Disney hired him - which maybe was part of the deal.&&I'm betting a large percentage of people don't have jokes about raping children on their social media at any point. Just saying.&&Not just posted.  
Some stars in the franchise *cough* *RDJ* *cough* had a way worse history to the brink of hollywood to completely ban them, yet here we are.

> I don't defend my 16-year-old comedy at all. And like, even part of this movie is me going back and trying to forgive myself for what I was expressing at that time. ...

> I have a lot of material from back then that I'm not proud of, and I think is offensive and I think is not helpful. But also, I can't regret a bit of it, because I deeply believe in the butterfly effect and I am so grateful to be here right now. I do not think my intention [with my first video, ""My Whole Family""] was homophobic, but what is the implicit comedy of that song if you chase it all the way down? I don't think it's perfectly morally defendable.

> But the issue is — and it'll be an issue I think for a lot of young creative people — ... [that] the first stuff I wrote is out there for everybody to see. So I just hope on my own behalf and other people's behalf we're still allowed to think out loud and fail publicly and grow. ... At a certain point every presidential candidate is going to have every bad joke they made when they're 13 immortalized on online. So at a certain point, we're gonna have to call amnesty and just get on with it.

The whole thing is worth a listen.


Edit: another bit relevant bit: 

> You know, like, it's - the conversation of what is actually, like, permissible language has probably appropriately evolved very quickly. The sentiment in that one I enjoy. But I have personally soured on probably explicit satire. You know, there's certain, like, tools of satire that I think people have very little patience for now, which I understand. You know, a lot of this stuff - like that one probably made a lot more sense pre-Trump. But now that Trump is (laughter) here, it feels like, let's just not use these words. Like, there's no point to use this stuff in order to satirize the thing because the satire of the thing and the thing actually look very similar now.

The tweets are genuinely disgusting - as soon as I mention this in the real world the first thing everyone did was roll their eyes about the political climate of 2018, but the dudes tweets are legitimately unsettling and repulsive. I want him back, but a massive apology was definitely in order.&&[deleted]&&I did not read the tweets. the highest comment in this thread chain has the only one I've seen so far and god it makes total sense why disney had to axe this guy. I don't need to look at mrGunn's motivations or sense of humor to see why a company whose primary target demographic is children and their parents would have to remove a guy who made an unfunny joke about having once jerked off a child. The appearance of impropriety, the aura of sexual offender rhetoric is absolutely toxic to their industry. In an era where #metoo has made long-standing rumors of child sexual abuse in hollywood more prominent in public consciousness, there must not be any tolerance for anything like that, whether it was serious or in jest. If disney had internal documentation of these tweets, then got sued in 20 years or something by a child actor in Gunn's films, the blowback could be tremendous, regardless of whether real harm ever happened. Responsibility is on disney to not only prevent abuse, but to do everything they can to not seem liable in the rare event there really is abuse of any kind. &&Fanboys don’t like it when it happens to their franchise, that’s all it is.

They come tonresdit, see people saying the tweets aren’t a big deal, and then make up a story in their heads where the tweets were “probably” some edgy race-stereotype or sexual jokes. &&They are awful, unfunny, and he was also a man in his 40s at the time, old enough to know how insensitive his ""jokes"" were.

That said, Disney would have known all this before they hired him, still, they decided to hire him on in spite of all that, and he went on to direct two movies for them that made over a billion and a half in the box office. Disney's behavior firing him was hypocritical.&&Pewdiepie isn't movies so maybe this is barking up the wrong tree, but those tweets are literally worse than the pewdiepie stuff.

Pewdiepie had two incidents with off-color stuff: 'kill all jews, subscribe to keemstar' stunt and the ['what a fucking nigger'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QklCpbgmf0) thing. And boy did he get a lot of shit for that, also got dropped by Disney. Look, he's alt-right!

Gunn's twitter feed is worse — his jokes are worse than what Pewdiepie has done: Pewdiepie's stuff is at least a little funny if you understand the context ('killalljews, subscribe to keemstar' was basically a poorly-executed 'look how bad of a person keemstar is' joke) and the other comment was basically getting frustrated about something. Plenty of Gunn's stuff is unfunny to the point 9gag and /r/funny feel like the best humour you've ever seen — and there's _a lot_ of it. 

Despite that, a lot of people who were condemning Pewdiepie are rushing to defend Gunn, saying he did nothing wrong, something about alt-right.

Just for the record — I'm not really offended by his stuff and I wouldn't demand him to be fired over those tweets (but I also understand why Disney fired him), but it's really fun to watch the double standard in action.&&I like it when kids touch my dick

If you go into it thinking it's all bullshit you won't get anything out of it and ironically you will prove one of its main points. &&I don't think this is cynical anymore. Plenty cynics stay bitter but carry on fighting for what they believe. 

This is either pessimism or full on [nihilism](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nihilism); which has been very common in this age and why some argue things like Morty & Rick are so popular (despite the fact that this nearly drives Rick to suicide). In a way, it is good to remove the shackles of defining what *should* be good or bad. But for a society to work on nihilistic mentality undermines whatever happiness or success we expect. So many who casually adhere to this are setting themselves up to a long term pessimistic outlook. 

Fortunately, many aren't giving up that easily and why B Nine-Nine, Clone Wars, Family Guy, Futurama, and other shows and events are revived solely by the fans. 

So I do hope Gunn gets rehired and I am one of the bitter cynics who still carry that small spark of hope that I might see some good news in my lifetime.

They even [hired minders at times to reign in his impulses](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/disney-john-lasseter-harassment-bob-iger-1202734060/).

Look at the backlash against the Fantastic Beasts movies in that fandom because Depp is in them. People are sick of actual abusers being rewarded and people who fucked up once years ago with a tasteless and offensive joke getting dragged for it. This entire mess is because of those shitstains Posobiec and Cernovich, who have said waaaaay worse than Gunn, and continue to this day. They’re just salty that Gunn hates Trump. &&I think the better comparison is how they let John Lasseter stay for so long despite the work place sexual harassment, which they covered up, [and even when it became a public issue they they let him stay on until the end of the year.](http://www.vulture.com/2018/07/former-pixar-employee-details-john-lasseters-harassment.html)&&I mean, does anyone believe they're doing it out of a sense of outrage? Come on. It's all about money, they know Gotg3 will make huge bank with some other director. They have what they need from Gunn - the template to follow.

They'll pay the new guy less I'm sure, they won't have to worry about the minority group that would be massively loud online if he wasn't removed, and they don't have to worry about any bad press going forward because, for some reason, it's OK to immediately ax someone over words that everyone understands to be empty of real meaning or intent. We understand that as much as we understand they were in super bad taste and shouldn't have been said in the first place. 

Honestly, anyone that cares about their potential professional prospects at all that still has a personal social media account and doesn't run it like a business... Seems risky to me.

&&Now I'm probably one of the first to talk of all the virtues that guy has as a director but his feel is different than the James Gunn feel.

Johnny Depp's alleged abuse is not in the limelight as much, and isn't really being lashed onto the current political climate. However, these Pizzagate folks took James Gunn's tweets and want his head. They made a ton of noise. Disney wants a large audience for their films, and that includes least common denominators. So they don't want to uspet Pizzagaters, since they are tangentially associated with the greater Trump machine.

Exactly.  A lot of the big MeToo scandals have been about things that happened a lot time ago.  It's just that many of them are for things that are horrific enough to be unforgivable.  Especially when the person seems unrepentant.

So that's why Disney is still concerned about a scandal despite this being 10 years ago.  Because a lot of other celebrities have had their reputations ruined by horrible things they did 10 or more years ago.

Of course, that's completely ignoring the fact that making a bunch of extremely ill-advised offensive jokes isn't even comparable to straight-up raping people.  Ultimately I disagree with Disney's situation.  But I can understand why they didn't just immediately dismiss the issue with ""it was 10 years ago"".&&It will come to a head eventually. This is all new. When we get to a point where every human being has tons of posts you can find from 30 years prior, of them saying something that wasn’t offensive for the time, but is now considered unacceptable, we will have to just accept it as a part of the new reality and agree to let it slide as long as the behavior was corrected as the times changed. &&Actually i remember a lot of people speculated that his apology interview, about a month before disney announced him helming gotg 1, was a condituon of employment.&&He apologized for his tweets before disney even hired him.

The Max Keebler ""tweet"" was actually from a blog what I was thinking of. There's more fucked up shit in this link. For example him posting (hopefully jokingly) that he had just watched a video of 100 girls masturbating, sent by his friend who is currently actually being prosecuted for CP distribution as of this year. Obviously people aren't responsible for the crimes of their friends, but the fact that he makes so many pedo jokes and then posted ""jokingly"" about watching CP from someone we now know to be an actual pedophile...well it's troubling context.

*******

Someone link the imgur album because the ones you just linked are actually missing some of the worst ones. For example, it has the tweet about telling a story about a monkey jerking off on Max Keeblers big move but it's missing the much worse follow up tweet where he says ""you have no idea how happy it made me to think about that monkey splashing cum on a kid's face"" or something.&&Not a single one of it is a joke,there is literally no humor there.&&Just the fact that she is Jewish, or that she wrote their uniform?

Don't buy into the myth that people are more sensitive nowadays. Comedians are edgier than ever and pop culture is becoming increasingly less prudish.

[self] Dear Netflix - stop auto-playing every time I want to look at a title.,70583,8x9c6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8x9c6b/self_dear_netflix_stop_autoplaying_every_time_i/,2606,1531121278.0,"I mainly watch Netflix on my Playstation, but often on my computer too. I’m very close to canceling my service based solely on this one unbearable design flaw.
If I want to read a description of whatever I’m thinking about watching, I should be able to do it without having my eyes and ears assaulted. In fact, I frequently skip over titles (including, of course, a lot of Netflix original content) simply because I don’t want it to come blaring through my screen and speakers before I’m done perusing.
I don’t even see why this is an option. Nobody wants this.
Stop.

Edit: wow, I did not expect my wine-fueled rant to gain anywhere near this much traction. I finally understand “RIP my inbox”. I’m thrilled to see so many people here share my sentiment. And, of course, thanks for the gold!","I think autoplay should be an option that you can turn on and off. Or just have a view trailer option when looking at every title like they used to have.&&I have to mute the tv when i browse netflix. I can cope with the movement, but the audio really annoys me.&&I called them to complain about this a couple years ago. The lady said that they get that complaint a lot. That’s about all I learned from that conversation. 

Edit: I do want to mention that the customer service lady was very polite, and I have zero complaints about their call center. I’m just frustrated that I can’t turn it off. &&When you live in a place where every GB of data counts towards the throttle limit, the last thing I would like to see is this stupid Auto Play feature consuming unwanted bandwidth. I literally have stopped scrolling through the Netflix library and just go to search and watch what I want. Stupid fucking annoying feature. I'm sure Netflix knows that the majority of their userbase hates it. But they are arrogant enough till now not to do anything about it.&&Dear Netflix 


My list  

Continue watching 

EVERY  

OTHER  

FUCKING  

CATEGORY  

Don’t god damn change the order&&Still bitter about the thumbs up, thumbs down system. &&You’re 100% right. Whoever chose to do this is an idiot. I’m sure some marketer can tell you it works because of this or that. 

No. No. Stop. I’m already paying for your service. Just let me browse in peace. There should be at least a ten second delay if not 20. &&And stop recommending me the People Versus OJ Simpson when I've already seen it. No lie or exaggeration that show has been on my banner since the day it came out. Everyday I log onto Netflix to see Marcia Clark's perm.&&This and also they should bring back the 5 star rating system. I used to get way more intuitive recommendations, now everything is like a 96% match. &&The worst thing about them is that 99% of them aren't even real trailers or clips. They're just scenes set to stock music.&&Also, if you happen to let something roll on for too long, it gets added to your ‘Continue Watching’ list. 

That is super annoying&&It's worse with TV shows if you hover over it it'll begin playing the episode or where you left off, while hidden. Which is really annoying because my wife is deaf and the subtitles are hard to read at that point. &&The trailers disrupt my ability to think, and that is a problem for me. If I have a say, I vote them out.&&I love you netflix, but you used to be so much more user friendly. I used to be able to get rid of things i knew i didnt like. You have a look at the settings and its just so fucking bare its ridiculous.&&Also, can you set the delay of autoplay to greater than 5 picoseconds? It will save your servers supreme amounts of data by upping the delay for autoplay of trailers by like.... 6seconds. Consider this. I'm scrolling and reading titles, sometimes I scrolled faster than I read. Cue the 2 seconds to catch up aaaaand I have to wait for your shit to get into gear as it desperately tries to cram that shit in my face, even though IM NOT INTERESTED IN THAT AT THE MOMENT. THANKS. It breaks the flow of browsing and interjects moments of frustration EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.&&This is a huge issue when you have small children in the house. Every time I start up Netflix it's a gauntlet of ""make sure my 3 year old doesn't see some bullshit"".&&I browse Netflix on my phone now to avoid this. After I decide what to watch I just search for it on the TV.&&Yep, just put in a ""play trailer"" button to let the user control what they want to do.

Netflix probably has the data to show that autoplaying a trailer results in more clicks.&&Did they make a deal with internet providers to waste our data on this totally pointless feature? This is worse than clicking on a website that has autoplay music.&&That's the first thing I tried to turn off when I signed up. I couldn't believe there wasn't an option. Quite ridiculous. Piracy is so much more user friendly and there's not even any profit. 

You'd think a paid service would have a higher quality user experience than doing it myself (with the aid of Plex).&&I 100% agree, I've often thought this should be an option. I'm glad I'm not alone&&Dear everything: Stop auto-playing. Just stop it.&&Stop that awful music too.  Most of the time the tone is so inappropriate for the title too it's maddening &&Yeah...I've had to stop browsing NetFlix entirely because of this.  What an amazingly user hostile choice, especially with no way to turn it off.  Every update the NetFlix makes just makes it that much harder to use.&&Whatever happened to reviews on Netflix for Playstation. All I have now is a thumbs up/down. This is worthless. They changed  the rating to &#37; you would watch vs rating. There's so much garbage to sift through now, takes forever to find something new to watch. If I want to know if it's good, I have to look up the reviews now on the internet. There's no rating to go by. ALso, they should include imdb and rotten tomato ratings on the titles.&&Absolutely agree with you. It's absolutely annoying. Sometimes when I watch on my tv, I want to keep it idle, but I can't because it just starts blaring whichever title I had stopped at.&&And if you leave it on a title long enough, it'll start playing the first episode.&&What’s next? Commercials? &&While we’re at it: Dear Netflix, please let me be able to easily remove shows on my  ‘continue watching’ list, not just on my computer, but also TV, tablet en phone. Thank you!&&Yes. And it's so much worse when they play the shitty theme music that isn't even specific to the movie. Like they had some poor guy write a bunch of shitty music for each genre. Whoever thought this would be a good idea should be shot. &&If we're doing all of our Netflix UI complaints here:

* The autoplay sucks.
* The new rating system still sucks. I trusted the old one on 90% of the stuff I watched, I trust this one zero.
* Five seconds is not nearly enough time for me to hit ""watch credits"".
* ""Continue watching"" needs to be in the same place every time.&&Since this was implemented I have found myself watching netflix less and less. &&YESSSS!!! And the annoying zoom in on the title. When scrolling the windows pops out. &&YES! I am always hopping around titles as to not trigger the autoplay. It is such an asinine design. I was on the fence about canceling my service and this pushed me over the edge.&&I unsubscribed because of this, rising costs, and a few other annoyances. &&Also stop playing trailers RIGHT when the credits to a movie start. Some intense music is playing, befitting of whatever ending I just witnessed and all of a sudden BAM. ""HAVE YOU SEEN SENSE8?""&&The practical effect is that I am forced to scan through each title *before* the auto play starts, which is about a second and a half. So instead of lingering on a title and saying, “Hmmm... this seems interesting,” I scan off the title pretty much immediate. Then usually switch to Amazon Prime.&&Give us options/settings, dammit &&Yes, i absolutely HATE this. Glad Im not the only one&&Not to mention it's a drain on bandwidth for those of us that have data caps.&&I actually called Netflix about this to see they're was a way to remove it and the guy said no and was extremely apologetic. I don't think it's the first time he got a call like that.&&What, you mean you arent convinced to watch a movie by seeing a bunch of split second moments? Seeing Rachel Weiss look around a corner in a dark house or Gary Oldman putting papers in his briefcase only to look up at the screen when somebody walks in doesnt get you pumped to watch an amazing movie?&&I don’t even want to use Netflix anymore because of this. I actively avoid it on my Roku unless I know exactly what I’m going to watch. Maybe that’s what the want. &&I seriously don't know of anyone that LIKES this. I agree that it has to end. I hate the autoplay, and I hate the previews with the cheap music playing over it. They have an opportunity here to scrap this and focus on something else to make their interface better. &&I hardly every watch Netflix now entirely due to this issue - it annoys the HELL out of me trying to search through the different titles. 

PLEASE FIX THIS SHIT NETFLIX&&seriously, wtf? i have had to adjust my browsing habits because of this. i hover over a particular title just long enough for the preview to queue up (1 to 2 seconds), then i move on.&&Netflix has so many annoying little issues that I really don't even use it that much tbh, it's easier to watch things on Hulu or Terrarium&&It is the single biggest flaw with Netflix currently. Too many times I have just simply decided to not watch Netflix because I don't want to deal with listening to an annoying jingle/ potentially spoiler-y preview that slows my Roku down. 

My new theory is that Netflix doesn't want people to just endlessly surf the options, so this a deterrent to get people to just figure out what they want to watch prior to logging on. Stupid idea, but honestly I cannot figure out a smart reason for it. &&Not to mention, it eats up data.&&This UX flaw drives me absolutely insane. It's worse for me because I don't like to know much about a feature before watching it.&&I've opened several issues with Netflix support on this and I can tell you that they just don't care what you think about it. I still have my account, but I'm using several other services as my primary source at this point in time. 

A while back, I decided I wanted to watch one of their original movies. I queue it up in the selection screen, walk into the kitchen to make a snack. By the time I got back to my TV, several major plot details had been shown during autoplay and the movie was ruined. &&I upvote these requests every time I see them.  If you cancel, please contact them and tell them why.&&I agree completely. At worst this should be optional, but to have it be an unchangeable default? Utter idiocy. And it makes the scrolling process so much slower, because it's trying to load the stupid trailer when I'm trying to move on. I find myself watching a lot more Hulu lately, and only using the search function on Netflix for things I know I want to watch. I hardly ever browse Netflix anymore because it's gotten super annoying to do so.&&It's relentless, and for something that should be so benign, it leaves me feeling frustrated, rushed and on edge. &&Stupid anti consumer stuff like this is why people resort to piracy. WE PAY YOU MONEY and you are giving a worse user experience than the one given by popcorn time or pirate Bay. If the industry wants people to stop pirating movies they need to supply a service that is actualy worth paying for. &&Dear Netflix - stop disguising your shitty catalogue and bring back the rating system.&&I don't even have Netflix anymore and I'm getting annoyed remembering it does this.&&Auto-play also lags the hell out of my crappy roku sticks so once you start moving you better move quick* before auto-play kicks in again.  Its the worst.  

*=Assuming roku remote decides to operate in a timely manner.
&&the auto play preview is not designed to make you watch it. It's designed to fill in the silence and force you to pick something now. The longer you spend idling the more chance you will close the app. So the average user will sit and pick something instead of wandering off or choosing something else or else they get bombarded with audio and sound.

I agree i hate it also. so i usually back out or keep moving to avoid it :D&&I thought I was the only person that had this issue!!! I feel like I can’t relax and scroll through Netflix because I have to quickly skim through titles to avoid auto play.. I wish there was an option to turn it on or off. &&The video auto-play is annoying.  The thing that I really hate is that this feature takes up 2/3rds of the screen.  So the list of stuff I'm actually interested in looking through is crammed down into the bottom 1/3 of the screen.  Whole thing needs to be fixed.&&I just want them to stop shrinking the video I'm watching, up to the top corner, in favour of some trailer or a full screen prompt for the next episode.  Sometimes I want to see who that familiar face was, or whatever.

Just let the video I'm watching, keep playing in the foreground.  You can put the trailer suggestion, or ""next episode starts in 10"" in the bottom corner out of the way!&&This also needs to be put in r/Netflix &&I believe ""Dear Every Relevant Website- stop auto-playing."" is a more relevant title.&&Auto-play can go to hell&&[deleted]&&Yeah I kind of hate that Netflix auto plays trailers for every single show lol. Sometimes I want to know as little as possible about a show, go in blind, see if it grabs my curiosity and give it a try myself, not because of what I see in a trailer.

Could they make it optional? &&Agreed. I fast toggle back and forth when reading to avoid this. I thought it was just me but it makes sense, because this incredibly intrusive and disruptive.&&Seriously. Who there thought that was a good idea?&&Also, the ability to mark things as watched and then hide the stuff you’ve watched&&So there is no way to turn this off? I was hoping it was just a setting I was missing.  
As a side note, I just realized yesterday the reason everything was so blurry was because I had the quality set to ""low"". Didn't realize until I logged in on the computer (I usually watch on the TV) and started messing with the settings. It's so much better now.&&Netflix should take polls on what they are changing.

Make mock-ups and let us browse them and vote for them in-app/channel.

Winner gets implemented.&&Let's swamp them. 
[Netflix Feedback](https://media.netflix.com/en/contact-us)&&Just cancel anyways and go to Hulu.. Hulu is getting more and more titles from Netflix and is overall a better streaming experience.. &&Netflix back in the day was way better as far as interface goes (a lot less content of course but a lot more good content too). 

They had comments so you can see what other people said and leave your own, the lists were organized more and wouldn't just show you the most popular shows of the genre and actually make good recommendations.

AND THEY ACTUALLY HAD A DECENT RATING SYSTEM. I haven't rated a single movie since they did the whole stupid thumbs up and down thing, I WILL NOT support it at all&&Also stop asking if I'm still watching. I'll stop watching when I'm damn good and ready.&&What drives me insane is that they are spending, what, billions on new movies and shows, but they have pretty much abandoned their user interface.  Same for Amazon, although they are much worse.

Hey, Netflix, you DO realize that the UI is the ONLY way we use your service, right?  If it doesn't work, then people will stop using it.  Just like I don't use Amazon videos.  I can more easily download a video than use your clunky interface.&&Oh how I hope they fix this...really annoying!&&came here hoping someone had commented a trick or workaround, sadly not.&&Also:

Something that came out last year isn't a new release, stop that.&&[deleted]&&I couldn't agree more. I've called and reported that I want the option to turn this feature off twice in the past year because I hate it so much. But now I believe it does them more good than bad, and they really wanna up those viewcounts.

I am fairly certain that Netflix runs analytics on user behavior and they know that having trailers autoplay increases the likelihood of someone commiting a view. With multiple stream services, they have to do everything they can to get you to play something when you open the app, rather than browse for a bit then dip, which thousands of people do every day.

They will not remove this feature or add the option to turn it off unless there is some negative publicity about it, which maybe there will be someday. Write to Kotaku or something!&&Probaly someone work too hard on selecting specific scenes on each movie to show semi interesting moments to be played as a demo together with some music that was made from zero that could actually fit with the representation for that movie, little he/she knows that people will find that generic and annoying as shit.

netflix knows this but they dont want to put someone's hard work to trash so easy like that, so, we are forced to deal with somebody's hard worked bad idea.&&A cause worthy enough to stand behind. &&I really don't understand why we don't have some sort of rule against autoplay being on by default in any case. Nothing should be allowed to stream, download, or much less play audio or video without explicit permission by the user. Turning off AutoPlay next episode on Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube makes it way less easy to sit and binge the day away, we should have the same choice for any and all other autoplaying things like ads and trailers.&&I sent them feedback for this over and over again with no response - it just hit a point where I cancelled my streaming service. It wasn't entirely the autoplay that caused it -- I had been with them for about ten years, and I noticed that the GUI they use was designed to cover for the fact that some of their genres just don't have half the content they used to. (That's why they make it such a bear to find anything.) They fill in for it a bit with the 'Netflix original' shows, and I'm sure there is definitely an audience for them, but it's not really what I had gotten Netflix for. I still have the DVD service - for $5 a month, you can get up two DVD's per month (which is all I'd probably go through anyway.)&&I also want to be able to remove something from my ""Keep watching"" list. I dropped that show for a reason. I don't want to keep seeing it on top of everything. &&I hate this ""feature""&&Plus one for this, I have definitely skipped out on shows simply because the blaring garbage that plays when trying to read the blurb&&THANK YOU. I contacted them the MOMENT this started happening on my Xbox. It annoyed me so much that I actually called their 800 number, for the first time ever, because I couldn't find a feedback option anywhere online or through any of their apps. The person I spoke with said, 1) it was a pilot feature they only deployed to certain platforms (i.e. Xbox), and 2) they pretty much only accept feedback via phone calls. Needless to say I felt hopeless that this feature would ever go away. 

Please Netflix, if you're reading this, GET RID OF THIS FEATURE. I've honestly been using Prime more and more since this god-awful feature was introduced. I like Netflix, I want to keep using Netflix, but I will cancel my subscription if this feature isn't disabled... at the very least give us the option to disable it ourselves!

Edit: typos and stuff. /end rant.&&I cancelled my Netflix subscription recently too. Can't stand the previews playing or the goddamn show itself starting while I'm trying to read a synopsis. Then I came to the realization that 90% of their original programming and movies are discount bin garbage. Really the ""a ha"" moment was when I was watching Barry on HBO and I suddenly thought ""the quality of original content is 1000x better on HBO AND I dont have to hear shoe-horned, shameless plugs for other HBO shows written into the fuckin script like Netflix does.""&&It would also be great to bring back the rating system so I don't have to go on IMDb every time I want to know whether a movie/TV show sucked dick. &&Too bad Netflix doesn't have a complaint form. I'd like to send them this link so they can see 65.1k people liked this post in a matter of 15 hours and 2477 comments all in agreement.

E: maybe we should all agree to cancel together. Nah, who am I kidding? The only way large groups of strangers agree to act is if some kooky zealotry is involved. &&Can we just rage on the autoplay video trend everywhere?

Phones included. Imagine it just starts playing during quiet time? It drains battery and data and no one likes it.&&I loved almost every move netflix made until this one. Called, couldn't get it turned off. It's awful and it makes my wife and I use it less because we don't like trying to choose a show together anymore. &&You need to click the circled i, for info.&&[deleted]&&As Jean-Luc would say, make it so.&&The store on the Xbox One is like this too.  Any game that has a trailer, it auto-plays when you go into the game in the store.  You might browse a game or two that have no trailers, and it is nice and quiet.  Then go into one with a trailer, and you're blasted with sound from the trailer.

Everyone complains about auto-play videos.  Why does anyone still think it is a good idea?&&i hate it so much. have to jump between two shows/films to read what the description says, so it don't start watching said show/film or a trailer start playing. &&Yes, I totally agree. Very annoying sound & being forced to endure the same trailer repeatedly.  

My least favourite new category: 
""Why not watch it again?"" Dumb.

Thumbs down reviews: Seriously, if I said I didn't like it, I probably do not. Stop giving me them!

Also, why is 'Continue watching' sometimes shuffled? No obvious reason.  Annoying. 

Idea: ""Korean shows"" as a category instead of ""Asian films""  

Edit: We have family membership, would be nice to share ideas.&&Netflix has quickly become the last place I go to look for something to watch. &&I hate this so much. Please Netflix. Listen. Auto Play is annoying af. &&This is the main reason why I don’t watch Netflix anymore.&&Fun tidbit: The Netflix app on WiiU, while terrible in other ways, doesn't autoplay. I don't know if it's because there hasn't been a new version, or if it was just something they felt wasn't necessary. It was even late to catch up to the thumbs up/down rating system.&&And while we’re at it bring back star ratings! I don’t care if a movie is a 97% match for me if it’s a shit movie.&&Yes it's extremely annoying. &&God forbid you want to view the details screen and see who’s in it, when it was made, and read the description. Netflix just plays the bitch. WTF. No. Stop. &&Agreed. I hate this and always mute my TV when searching Netflix. &&Yeah either this or make the delay time like 10-15 seconds to give people a chance to read it. Not fucking 2 seconds &&This is a huge pain with kids. If I don't make it to the remote fast enough, the next episode starts playing and they get pissed if I turn it off.

Granted, I just tell them to suck it up, but it's still complaining I could do without.&&I can't understand how it's not even an option to turn autoplay-preview off.&&But how would Netflix keep artificially inflating their view counts if it didn’t start playing the shows if we breathe near them? &&Not just that, but Netflix is using up our data to make those previews of shows or movies we don’t have any interest in.


Shouldn’t that be illegal?&&It’s not even part of the movie’s theme, either. It’s always some crappy free use music that’s supposed to be different for every genre, but just sounds so bad and out of place.&&I don’t want everything I read the description of to show as partially watched.&&I had never written a company about a gripe I had had, until that god damned music. It's so generic and awful, it really brings my perception of their quality down.  &&The Netflix UI is so terrible I don't even use it to browse.  I use https://instantwatcher.com to queue up titles.&&Yes! It drives me fricken mad. And I'm barely through the paragraph when it fades out altogether and now I'm just watching the show/movie. I have to click back now just for another chance at reading it. The Roku interface used to be great, but this shit is killing the experience of finding something new to watch.&&I just quit Netflix. I've had this discussion with at least 5 Netflix customer service reps, I sent feedback many many times... They refuse to make the change. Not sure why, I can't imagine what they gain from autoplaying trailers. But I do now they'll only feel it if you drop em.&&This is why I canceled Netflix.   

Hulu messes up their home screen / browse screen as well.   

&&Yeah they definitely need this as a setting to toggle&&That's what the Netflix rep told me when i complained about it. I ended up canceling on the spot. I had planned to cancel in a couple of weeks anyways. &&They use generic catchy music on different trailers/previews, too. I don't like that. &&Also, what the hell's up with the super loud ""DUH DUM"" when Netflix starts up?&&I did as well.  The rep just kept calling it ""an enhanced feature of the app"".

I have been thinking about dropping Netflix over the issue. &&You can call them to complain? &&Same. I call every few months when I've had a bad day and the autoplay is particularly pissing me off. They tell me they hear that complaint a lot and maybe if they get it enough they will change it. When will it ever be enough?&&i once called about an issue i had. i cannot stress enough how the guy on the phone was actually really nice and listened to my issues.  i asked him though if anything could be done about it and he said ""sorry, makes sense but most likely not"" and he seemed genuinely sorry.&&I don't work there but I guarantee Netflix experimented with this and liked the results. My guess is a significant number of people saw the autoplay and thought ""eh fuck it"" and just clicked out of laziness, increasing some metric like watch time. &&Honestly I don't think it's arrogance, it's a workaround for their continually shrinking library. They've lost like 50% of their movie catalog as studios pull content to put on their own walled gardens. If you could actually just see a condensed list of the titles available on Netflix it would seem pitifully small compared to 5 years ago. They use algorithmically generated lists to keep you from hitting the 'bottom of the barrel' so to speak.&&And so the circle continues. Blockbuster was too arrogant to buy Netflix or go online... now Netflix is the market leader and make the same mistake. I have only one explanation for this and that's overpaid execs that have no reason to work there at all.&&I didn't mind it but if I had to worry about throttled limits I would be furious.&&Holy fuck yes! Why does my list keep moving around??? What the actual fuck are they doing?&&Close. It should be:

Continue Watching

My List

Everything else.&&Where the fuck is My List even supposed to be?

Sometimes I'll scroll down a few, not see it, scroll up above the big advert, not there either, then go back down and it's suddenly fucking appeared.

Is it really so hard to always default to my list?&&It was like this for a little while. Start on highest trending (almost always a Netflix original they were trying to push). Then... Search was up, continue watching was down, then down again for my list. It was great. 

Also, it didn’t auto play then either. Those were the golden days... &&I dislike the “because you watched..”. 

I don’t care! Just give me real categories and skip that shit. &&I have actually called them about this in the past. The response was basically ""that's just how it is"". He said in order to keep My List higher up, use it a lot. Add things to it frequently, and launch shows from My List as opposed to Continue Watching or other categories.

The system gauges how much you use My List, and lowers it if it sees you don't use it much (at least, that's what he told me) I always launch from it, and that seems to be working for me.&&How would they push their 'Netflix originals' to you then?

/s&&Their categories have always been horrible. None of them are even relevant to half the titles in them, they change around all the time and disappear/reappear for no reason. The same titles appear in 5 or more different categories.... UGH&&And they're removing reviews, too. Wtf&&And continue watching shouldn't be 3 down!&&This, but also 'Recently Added' in third. &&Yea, I hate when I have to play hide and seek with ""My List"".&&I thought was just going insane&&Don't forget about the ""you accidentally clicked on ""there is nothing wrong with white nationalism"" movie when you were frustrated at us auto playing shit, and cancelled out of it 2 seconds later, Let us create a new category for ""related to your recent (accidental) watch"" - here is a shit load of films you'd never watch, even if someone paid you $100. &&those fucking assholes do this on purpose. they want you to get lost in the sauce of Their choices (content) they push on you. No different than why Casino lobbies don't have clocks anywhere and are designed so that you get lost and sit down and continue playing the Slots. That's why it's so difficult to even navigate.  Fucked up UI. Stupid ass UI team sucks balls.&&I miss going through their listings and rating everything and actually being pleased with their recommendations.&&Same. Their old 5 star system was *excellent* at user preference prediction. Probably the best recommendation engine I've encountered in media and shopping! I used to be able to try out 4/5 star shows with some confidence that I'd like it.

Now everything's at >95%. It's absolutely useless and I don't browse anymore.

It's incredible that it was a purposeful business decision to break what was already fixed.&&It's actively harmful to the rating system imo. Now everything I see is a 98% match and there's no way to see a genuine rating based on quality. &&I love that they rolled it out right after some if their original content got low ratings. ""People don't like our content! Should we make it better quality?"" ""Nah, let's just change the rating system.""&&Never forget.&&The ""you'll like what we tell you to like"" system. We want to see what the general consensus is Netflix, not the odds you think we'll like it. Can you imagine going on IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes and only being told what people like you thought of a show/movie? Fucking hell.&&I'm still bitter about the party watch system on Xbox no longer being a thing&&This is especially frustrating. Let's say I watch a sci-fi movie like The Cloverfield Paradox, and it sucks, so I give it a thumbs down. That gesture factors into the algorithm that will suggest new movies and shows for me. But what's being extrapolated from that?

Do they assume that I don't want to see sci-fi films anymore? That I don't want more Netflix originals? (Actually that would be a fairly accurate assumption on their part) The problem with a movie like Cloverfield Paradox is that it is a bad movie, regardless of genre, director, cast, whatever other terms factor into marketing. So me giving it a thumbs down may only negatively impact my overall Netflix experience.

So I just don't thumbs up or thumbs down anything anymore. A rudimentary binary like that is nowhere near enough info to accurately tailor my streaming experience. At least with a 5-star setup, I could rate one sci-fi film a 5 and another a 3 or something, but now all I can do is either say **""I loved it!""** or **""I hated it!""**&&Amy Schumer. &&You know what I think that marketer focus-groupy reasoning might be?  It kind of forces you to make a decision on each title quickly because you're trying to avoid the autoplay.  I bet people tend to browse more titles more quickly this way and therefore might be more likely not to give up and say ""eh Netflix doesn't have anything I want to watch.""  Just a theory that occurred to me!  I hate this feature so much though.&&Ah yes, the seemingly unavoidable ""annoy your customers for profit"" plan that so many marketers love. It's tough for companies to avoid falling into it. And sometimes it works in the short term.&&98% Match&&Their matching and ranking logic is absolute trash, by far the worst I've seen on any paid service.

It is on a ""Reddit Search"" feature level of garbage.&&Netflix somehow thinks I am really interested in prison shows. No idea why.&&On the opposite end, one I've finished a movie, it disappears from my recently watched list and I have to go searching for it again. Maybe just checking leave it there and let it naturally progress to the back of my list, just incase I want to watch it again.&&This smacks of Amazon recommending me shit I've already bought.  I bought a wireless phone charger and for the next 3 days all my recommended items are wireless phone chargers.  WTF?  I don't need this anymore, I have it!&&I still have no idea what the % match thing means. Star system actually made sense&&Omg. I have never agreed to anything more on reddit. 


I absolutley hate everything Netflix is doing.

The auto play. 


Making 100s of shitty ""Netflix original"" shows and movies.


And the loss of the freaking rating system!!! 
Now all I get is that Netflix thinks TROLLS is a 95% match for me because a kid I was babysitting wanted to watch The secret life of pets. 


&&The fact that Battlefield Earth has 94&#37; match says enough about this stupid system.&&I'm honestly more bothered by the recommendations I *don't* get anymore. Scrolling past stuff I'm never going to watch is annoying (at least bring back the ""not interested"" rating!) but there's content I would actually watch that I never see (usually until I stumble across it in one of those ""lists of stuff leaving Netflix this month"" articles). &&Horrible stock music &&I've actually not watched things because Netflix's auto-generated trailer made them look shitty, but then once I saw a real trailer I went and watched on popcorntime or some other service. &&This could be solved if we could remove content from the Continue Watching list, but we can't do that either....&&It does it with movies too and it really shits me. I started watching Blue is the warmest colour...for reasons...then once I was done it was of course paused in the middle of a sex scene. So now whenever I am browsing with other people in the room I have to quickly skip over that in the continue watching section so everyone else in the room isn't blasted with a screenful of minge. &&This is my issue. When I scroll to a different section, I can’t even read the names of the shows/movies in that genre before whatever title is selected starts shouting for attention&&Seriously. I think the trailers engage my fight or flight response.&&I think the feature makes me watch less Netflix because I'm always so uncomfortable when I'm browsing their selection that I don't realize there's things I'd want to watch. &&I automatically press the back button and never read the synopsis, and then pretty much never watch the show. 

It’s the worst when I’m trying to figure out something for the kids to watch. I have to judge whether it’s appropriate before it starts playing, you know?&&This is one of the issues to use when contacting Netflix to complain. Another one is to complain about data usage. The autoplay feature is using data when you haven't specifically requested it and wasting your data. Netflix doesn't need to know whether you have data caps or not. I would hope these methods could get results instead of just telling a Netflix rep that it's annoying. I don't even ask that they remove the feature---just give us an option to turn it off.&&The way autoplay works is pretty annoying with kids, too. I don't want to have to manually turn on the next episode, but FFS stop skipping the intros and outros! My kid likes the music and *wants* them to play. It's gotten worse lately and the next episode starts as soon as 3 seconds after the last one. If I want to stop it before the next one starts I have to literally run over so she doesn't get invested in a new episode before I can turn it off.&&""Honey, want to watch White Fang?""

<toddler sees Mother Goose Club>

""Shit.""&&Yup thats the worst part for me, got to be super on the ball with the scrolling before it starts autoplaying a trailer for something massively inappropriate&&I do this sometimes too but I’d also just rather not&&Can just use a cromecast and cut out the second step. &&I think YouTube Red did that to me too. I clicked off the stupid ad for some Karate Kid remake every day it felt like. But that didn't make the ad go away at all, just kept coming.

My best guess is the extra clicks removing the ad on my end was showing increased interaction with that widget. The same way Netflix gets more plays by autoplaying. Even though it is a bad interaction, an interaction is better than no interaction.&&They used to be better than piracy. Still are, in some respects, but they're rapidly losing that advantage.&&Yeah to avoid this I either press back to get the categories/accounts overlay to come up or I mute the tv &&absolutely &&Hit the search button. &&We at Netflix have heard your feedback and are proud to introduce our new tiers of service!

Tier 2 includes an ad-free experience (this plan is the same as what you had but is now almost double your normal monthly price. What? You don't want to pay more for the same experience? How else are we going to pay for six more Netflix original movies starring Adam Sandler? These pieces of shit definitely don't pay for themselves).

- Netflix, this time next year probably&&I cancelled my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions because of this stupid shit. I jailbroke my firestick and watch everything for free through kodi. I paid for subscriptions only to be rewarded with shrinking libraries and unwanted features. Fuck 'em.&&instead of leaving the netflix screen on, i now close it altogether. i initially chose Netflix because it didn’t have autoplaying ads. &&Doesn't work for me. I've stopped watching Netflix because I can't stand the auto-play on the list sreen. I've moved over to YouTube, which is fairly static on my TV&&> the auto play preview is not designed to make you watch it. It's designed to fill in the silence and force you to pick something now. The longer you spend idling the more chance you will close the app. 

Yet it works the exact opposite way. I now instantly click off the TV when I'm done watching something instead of letting it fall back to the menu where I might, and regularly did, watch something else.&&the other streaming service?&&What's the other streaming service?&&HBO does this too and it's actually way worse. The HBO pre-roll ads are over 60 seconds long!&&That isn't  actually a way to contact them. It's a bunch of FAQs and their phone number. Which, I'm sure whoever answers will be just thrilled to listen to my 20 minute complaint. &&There's also a [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/stopautopreview?lang=en) dedicated to this, and a [hashtag #stopautopreview](https://twitter.com/hashtag/stopautopreview?src=hash).&&> Why does anyone still think it is a good idea?

Decades in software development has given me some insight into this: most UX designers suck, and they copy the trend du jour. Microsoft did their modern UX, everyone started copying it. Google did Material, everyone started copying it. Before those, people tended to copy Apple, at least before Jobs died. 

There's a very small percentage of people who are innovating UX design (arguably, rarely for a good reason) and the rest are just following the trend (with no understanding of the implications of doing so).&&Even the ""autploay next episode in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1"" is far too fast imho.  I find myself scrambling for my control in a panic just to get to cancel it if I want to watch the credits or exit if I'm done for the time being.

Make it something like 15/30 seconds (as it used to be?), people can still click the dialogue box ffs.

(for tv shows btw)&&No thanks. Sometimes I just want to walk away from a menu for a piss or a beer or whatever and not have half the show played by the time I get back. &&That type of autoplay can be turned off in the account settings.&&You can actually turn that off, but you have to do it in a browser. The toggle can be found in Playback Settings.

https://www.netflix.com/HdToggle&&At least that one you can turn off. I have it off. It's the autoplay trailers on the main menu, and autoplay of the movie/show on the details screen that is the real problem. &&Yeah, this doesn't make sense at all as a reason for doing this. For their own shows, no one but them knows the numbers anyway, so it doesn't matter. 

But for shows they license from others, *I believe* they mostly pay based on the number of views. The more people watch a show, the more they pay. So artificially inflating the numbers would have no upside at all, and a very significant downside. &&Lol what? Netflix doesn't even publicly announce their viewership numbers... what reason could they have to inflate view counts? Their not a fucking Youtube channel. All that would do is hurt them.&&[deleted]&&Mine glitched because a horror movie trailer was playing but it had the feel good comedy music playing.
Then again that horror movie was The Darkness which was laughably bad so I guess it fit.&&I noticed yesterday that they are using the actual Star Wars theme for THE LAST JEDI. 

Usually that would be reserved for a Netflix original, but Disney probably payed. &&>different

&&Have you heard the Mad Men one? Jesus...

Or Fargo... Ugh, it totally ruins the perception and mood of the show&&The originals tend to have relevant music or almost a trailer of sorts attached&&This is my biggest problem with it. I want my ""Continue Watching"" list to be stuff I'm actually in the process of watching.&&This absolutely baffled me when they made that update. I don't mind the auto-playing trailer if I'm hovering over something. Really, that doesn't bother me so much. I fucking HATE that I can't go into a movie and read the description and actor without worrying about being on it too long for it to register as having started to watch the movie.

It was such an idiotic design choice that I find it hard not to call it an obvious flaw if not for that one other comment pointing out that it inflates their numbers. Holy shit, what an asinine feature.&&It’s not just your perception.&&Have you used any other providers UI? Stan and Prime are even worse. &&The unfriendly UI serves a purpose. When you use one of the alternate Netflix browser sites that actually shows you organized search results, you realize how much less they have now than they originally did. They fill in the gaps with the 'Netflix original content', for better or worse.&&I honestly think that Hulu's crazy UI is better than Netflix right now. At least with Hulu I can take my time and browse around without being bombarded by autoplaying videos and music. &&You can call and complain... And when you quit Netflix, there is an option to leave feedback. I recommend both of these actions.... And hbogo. Such better content (unless you only want to watch comic book based shows... Then you should stick w Netflix and call them daily!) &&Yup.  Forget where I found the phone number but I'm sure it's readily available on Google.  The rep I spoke with suggested unlocking the firestick and downloading a previous version of Netflix as his only solution.  That, or putting the TV on mute when you scroll.  Not very helpful.  &&I would call and complain if it wasn't for the fact that I as a call center employee, know that complaints fall into deaf ears... literally every company or corporation is like this. There is pretty much nothing that a customer rep can do about certain situations when the people on top have decided already what they want to do with their services/products... calling to complain almost never solves the problem.&&No, do not call and offload your bullshit onto a minimum wage call center slave. They don't even have any real mechanism to ""pass your complaint along"" even if they wanted to. Social media is the mechanism for getting attention now. Don't bother the poor people who answer the phones. &&X=number of customers, X+1=customers than need to complain&&KPI driven business, same shit different day. Every time. What starts off as a good product is then pushed to the brink of idiocy because of them. &&Netflix takes data analysis seriously.  You bet your ass this was tested in a variety of ways.

Sure, it sucks for the people complaining.  But it's probably getting more shows watched and keeping people on Netflix longer than before.&&So their plan is to annoy me with what little they have left? Sounds like gold.&&> They've lost like 50% of their movie catalog as studios pull content

Netflix has made a conscious decision to stop chasing other people's content and make their own. Networks and studios realized they were under-charging Netflix for what the streaming rights are worth, and Netflix has chosen not to pay it and to make their own shows/movies/specials instead. &&Executives are often disconnected from reality. They see things in terms of money-making metrics, not consumer sentiment or practical realities. It happens in every industry that matures far enough. The push for profits never ends, even when it starts to crush your ability to bring a good product to market. It takes very good upper management to keep the ship on course.&&I don't know if it's a matter of making the same mistake, though. Netflix has made it obviously clear they don't even have the *option* to buy the titles like they used to, so they've had to change gears and focus on becoming a production house.

There literally isn't a player in the game anymore who can offer that level of content because everyone has taken their balls to their own courts.  &&Netflix is making the same mistake as Blockbuster by including this annoying feature? &&Don't you love it when continue watching ends up being at the very bottom of the page?

Like, WTF, seriously,  I'm on season 3 of a series and have watched nothing else since starting it. I'm not fucking interested in anything else yet. &&I like how sometimes my list or continue watching aren't even on the list&&I'm sure it's so you have to browse through all their original programming.

Maybe something will ""catch your eye."" Or some BS. &&They want you to change up your viewing habits&&Before this thread I thought my roku was broken.&&They're doing the same thing grocery stores do when they keep changing their layout. They're forcing you to wander around the place looking for what you came for, in hopes that you'll make some impulse decisions along the way. &&Seriously. I use Netflix because I want to binge watch something. I want to do that by opening up netflix, and it being the first thing for me to see. 

If I have to *scroll* to get to continue watching, that's just ridiculous.&&Also ""continue watching"" should only include things that I've...started watching. If I stopped it when the credits roll, don't show it. Also give me the option to remove it from there, or just don't show it if I've started it but only watched fifteen minutes then rated it thumbs down.&&And while we're at it, Spotify, would you please do something similar? If I'm halfway through a podcast episode, or album that I want to finish, please put that in my home screen instead of making me wade through 20 different screens to find where I left off.

I want them to break it up into halves and stack them on top of each other. 

I don't know how UIs work. I'm insane!&&Also if you watched said movie/show, it should be removed from, continue watching and placed in, watch again.

Continue watching should only contain what I have not finished watching. &&How about just letting *me* customise the categories that appear in the interface for *my* account?! I hate the fact that things are never in the same place and I have no control over that. Hell, even the ""Continue Watching"" category is a bit of a disaster as it's never in the order in which I watched things! No Netflix, I don't want to continue watching that mediocre movie I abandoned two weeks ago because it was boring, I want to continue watching the series I've watched half a season of in the past week and was the last thing I watched yesterday! &&I hate to go down 1 000 000 of ""because you"" before i find recently added&&If you watch in a browser, it helps to just bookmark [https://www.netflix.com/browse/my-list](https://www.netflix.com/browse/my-list). Add any show you're watching to your list, and that's all you see on this page.&&Sounds like you're scrolling up and down when you should be scrolling through the 4th dimension of time. It's right there, you just have to scroll forward a couple minutes.&&On mine at the minute it says ""Because you watched Planet Earth II"" and lists fucking Anchorman 2 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2.

OK Netflix, I don't think ""2"" is a category.&&Because you watched The Blues Brothers: ...Cake Boss.&&Because I watched *To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar* I was recommended *The Andy Griffith Show*. Seriously.&&Also, how about stop showing the same 20 items in every single fucking category. 

And while we're at it, don't hide the categories within a menu item titled ""search."" 

Honestly, Netflix has the WORST UI and somehow it keeps getting even worse.&&I don't mind that one so much. Sometimes I've found something in that category to watch I've never heard of or dismissed. 

Watch it again can go though. &&I complain to my GF constantly about this and it doesn't seem to bother her. 

""Continue Watching"" makes sense but after that, give me the regular options. ""Horror, Drama, Comedy etc"" &&This is a lie because I almost only use the ""Continue Watching"" and it does not appear at the top.&&If I watch 5 originals a month, will they loosen the grip on their algorithm? Please Netflix overlords! The search for shit I just watched 5 minutes ago must stop!&&Thing is, that doesn't benefit them. 

Netflix doesn't make money per-viewing. They don't charge per episode, they charge subscription. If they piss you off, you're more likely to cancel.&&I love when the same thing is in almost every genre and definitely isn't even some of them.&&[deleted]&&If they still did that, they might accidentally recommend something that's not a Netflix exclusive.&&Yeah it's shit now.  &&I used to always use the ""What should I watch"" or whatever it was called. Basically Netflix would give you a suggestion, you say yay or nay, and it would go to the next if you said nay. kinda of like Steam Discovery. &&Back to a google search to get a better idea through RT and IMDB data...&&I miss going through b horror movies and ignoring anything that is 1\* or 4\*+ and looking for those gems at 2-3\*s&&The problem is that tech companies don't know how to stop ""innovating"". They reach perfection and they don't realize it, and new people come in and have to make their mark on the system to prove their worth, so they change things. No need to understand what's there or why, just keep changing. Tech companies always pride themselves on being bold and willing to change, so they promote this kind of thinking. But if you have no way to recognize when you've nailed something, it means you'll always go downhill eventually.

&&Yeah, I never watch anything I don't already know about on Netflix anymore. Because I have no idea if the quality is good or not. 

Was a really dumb decision to change like they did. &&I remember when Netflix had crowdsourcing competitions to improve their ratings system. It was pretty interesting stuff. Now they've let the marketing team take over -- always happens once you've got enough money flowing through the system. &&> It's actively harmful to the rating system imo. 

Yep. I never rate anything anymore. If its not firefly or Trek It does not deserve the top rating (thumbs up) and if its not honey boo boo or whatever 'fat family does something' show is on this week, it does not deserve the lowest rating (thumbs down). &&Plus I don't know how to rate movies that are just ok now.

Armageddon is an ok movie. But if I Thumbs Up, it'll start giving me suggested crappy romance movies or B-level Disaster movies because I ""liked"" it.

I'd watch a movie with Armageddon's budget, and star lineup for sure, but that just doesn't exist so things that are somewhat similar to it just don't actually have what made Armageddon interesting enough to watch to the end.

This has led me to giving Thumbs Down to anything that wasn't amazing, because the recommendation engine now totally blows.&&*No, it's the viewers who are wrong.*

\skinner&&Yea have people watch crap over and over for five mins and close it. That's a surefire way to make me cancel. &&I think you’re right. Which means they’re prioritizing engagement over a good user experience. &&Typically when I get too frustrated with autoplay I hop over to Hulu or Prime. &&Joke's on them: When scrolling to view titles I know I want to watch lags because their stupid auto play preview feature stoppers the UI experience, I move to Hulu and watch something else entirely.&&""Recommended for you: *Silence of the Lambs*, because you watched *Bambi*""&&It has taken an incredible turn to absolute trash, noticable so since it changed rating to the thumbs up/down system. I was getting annoyed on the weekend from my suggestions/more like this options. 

Ex. Because you watch the exorcist, here are a few horror shows, full house, fast and the furious, family guy.

I only have 1 profile on my account, just me, no kids. &&I am house sitting for my brother. He never uses his own account any more because he has kids. Was scrolling through Netflix and was shocked at how much better his recommendations were then mine just as a basically default user.&&The % match means they can recommend shitty movies in the same genre as a good movie you watched, without admitting they're shitty. &&Ya, it's like there are no weighting algorithms or something. You could have watched 30 crime dramas shows over the last year, but having that one episode of Life of Pets is given equal weight in terms of what Netflix thinks you like.&&My ex and I ended up making a profile just for kids after her profile got corrupted with kids shows from her daughter. 

You used to be able to just delete shows from your history and it would fix the corruption but they took that option away to. Now it's just ""hide"" from viewing history.
Which pisses me off.  I'll be looking thru lists and find something that sounds interesting only to find out is not in English and no English audio for it at all. I want that crap off my account so it doesn't think I'm interested in more of that type of shit.&&> Making 100s of shitty ""Netflix original"" shows and movies.

YES put more real 4K movies in 4K instead of the same two for months.&&Yeah! There were all these awesome documentaries/weird movies from 20 years ago recommended that I definitely never would have found. &&You can if you go to the website.&&Or god forbid you want make popcorn or go to answer the door. &&There is a work around. Hit play on anything. Then back out immediately. Now you can scroll without auto play. &&Unwanted use of screen-space is always perceived by the user as pollution.

Same with ads.&&Same here. I usually get so mad I bail out of Netflix and go to Hulu. Maybe this is their intention. Keep us paying but not using the service. I should just cancel. &&They also seem to have shorter delays for their own content. So it might be 15 seconds before it auto plays the next episode of The Office, but only 5 seconds if it’s OITNB. I hate both, just let me click next if I want to, it’s not a burden. &&That's another thing that should totally be an option.  It doesn't seem to always skip the intros either, so when I decided to finally watch The Office, that fucking song... ugh man, that song.  Over and over and over...&&I never see anyone else talk about the intros/credits either, but I agree with you 100%. I really enjoy opening credits. It helps set the mood and tone for the show. I don't want to skip them, I don't even want the annoying pop up button option. They put a Skip Intro button on Stranger Things now, and it almost ruins their amazing intro credits. For 10 seconds during the awesome intro there is a big ""Skip Intro"" button. No thanks! The intro is amazing, but now you've ruined it. &&agree, it's pretty obnoxious. especially late at night and the volume of the previews is way louder than the actual title.&&Something legally questionable no doubt. &&Ah yes, the r/movies equivalent of ""Nevermind, I fixed it"".

I need at least 20 seconds to make that decision&&Unless it's changed recently, I think the 5-second timer is only on Netflix originals.

Outside studios are not privy to their viewership numbers on Netflix. They receive a flat fee for their licenses.

That's why most studios pay market researchers like Nielsen to try to give them estimations, so they can tell if Netflix is underpaying the value of the show and if they need to kick up the asking price when it's up for renewal.&&“Inflating the numbers” is just one of those things that someone convinced themselves sounds right when really its not the case at all. &&I doubt 3 seconds of it playing counts as a view anyways&&Right?

At least I can relax while I look around and read descriptions without the UI stressing me out.

They'll end up with less though as people don't want to subscribe to a dozen different services (not to mention that Netflix has near-ubiquitous device availability).

Netflix saw what was happening and hence the originals. They don't want to be held hostage to the whims of content providers and they have killer user-preference data.&&See - EA with “games as a service” and cancelling anything without a multiplayer element. &&It's not about long term success of the company, it's ""what can I get out of it now before my 5 year contract is up.""&&And they don't care because even when they crash and burn, they have more money hoarded than most will make their entire life.&&Yesterday my ""continue watching"" literally wasn't even an option.

I swear I’ve scrolled fathoms deep and never seen the bottom.&&I mean, in terms of what they are aiming for, it does make perfect sense. They hope that by having you scroll all the way down you will see something else and start watching that as well. 


Like the whole idea behind having the milk in the back corner of the grocery store so you have to walk past tons of temptations on the way to that basic good most people need. &&Or at the top (non-PC) and you have to scroll up to find it. &&This is the worst. 
I was 17 episodes into a show and had to search for it. Using an Xbox controller. 
No continue watching. No my list.&&All of these tech giants are purposefully making things less convenient in an attempt to increase user engagement with the product. It's infuriating when you know what you want, but they make you put up with bullshit to find it. 

Youtube has done this several times to me recently, where I will be watching several videos or an enumerated series related to a specific topic. After a few it floods my suggested videos with unrelated crap.&&Same reason grocery stores re - arrange their shit seemingly 2 times a year. &&They can wait till I’m done with my show&&What do they care? I'm paying the same amount regardless of my habits.&&I went with Netflix because I didn't want cable to decide what shows I can view and when, while assaulting me with commercials. Now I load up Netflix and have to scroll through rows and rows of featured (advertised) shows that I have zero interest in just to continue watching. I would not be surprised if in the next update I'm scrolling through advertisements for cars or other unrelated bs.&&Samsungs TV UI has the last 3-4 shows you watched on the home screen for the Netflix App. Don’t even need to open it up; can select your show and away you go. Small thing but makes using the TV app over something else just that little bit better. &&Wait, you don't like the MASSIVE autoplaying trailer of some generic new Netflix original that has literally nothing to do with your tastes? /s&&I can't tell you how many times I've had to refresh the main page just to see the show I was watching five minutes ago.  Sometimes I've had to literally type it into the search bar.  That's just ridiculous.&&>I have to *scroll* to get to continue watching, that's just ridiculous.

UGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!&&[deleted]&&And please, don't add something that I literally watched less than 10 seconds of (thanks to autoplay) to my continue watching queue. Please. Please. Please. &&Also, we need a button to remove from continue watching. &&Is there a way to delete some thing from your watch history. I have a seperate account on my girlfriends account and it's also logged in at her cabin.

I would like an option to remove shows completely from all the lists if want. I'm never going to watch Ralphie May or any of his dozen standup acts, so please let me just remove him entirely. Let me remove Katt Williams, please! I beg you to never let me see that stuff again.


edit: and please please please let me remove all the foreign language standup comedians. I select one thinking I'm getting an english speaker, only for him to speak Spanish. Comedy doesn't exactly come across very well when you have to read subtitles. Course once I started watching one then so many others are recommended to me.&&I think they've definitely improved on that tbf. I remember a few years ago my Continue Watching list was almost entirely films stopped in the credits&&Anything you give a thumbs down should stop appearing on any lists.  Why would I continue watching or ""watch it again"" if I said I don't like it?!&&Congratulations you just landed a job at Netflix!&&[removed]&&Yea have a setting for wrapping.&&Continue watching five minutes ago...&&It probably just assumed you were stoned, like 80% of all Planet Earth viewers.&&In that vein, it's annoying as fuck when you search for something and they don't have it so they say ""titles similar to...."" and put a bunch of unrelated shit on the screen like I'm gonna watch any of that instead of what I searched for.&&For me: 

*Because you watched Peaky Blinders: ...New Girl.*

&&You can't just declare yourself the BOSS of a food. I'm the boss of...meatballs.&&Andy Griffith is great, to be fair.&&I like ""watch it again"" because I like to throw a movie on when I take a nap or something. I prefer that it's a movie I've already seen a few times so that I don't get sucked in and not fall asleep, so it's a good category for me.

But like all the other categories that should just have a set spot (like My List and Continue Watching), they keep moving it around and it's fucking annoying. &&In their defence, ""My List"" could operate differently from ""Continue Watching"" so it's not necessarily a lie...just almost certainly&&No, unfortunately that would just show them this style of ads is working and it would cause them to have a big autoplaying preview every time you scroll to a new category.

I've been actively avoiding Netflix lately just because I am tired of the loud music for Luke Cage that autoplays when I open the app on my roku tv. I'll stick to Hulu and Prime Video for watching things until netflix becomes a little less annoying.&&Alright, assuming they're not trying to push shows to us.

Why else would they reorder the lists like that?&&Sure, but let's say you're only watching one show without being (made) aware of the other stuff that you could like. When you finish this show, you could be tempted to just end your subscription right then and there without taking a look at the rest.

So, as annoying as this is, I do think it benefits them. I just wish there was at least an option hidden somewhere to disable this behavior.&&If they successfully push viewership from regular shows to their originals, they can then end contracts for shows that they don’t own. &&They rated one of my favorite movies as a 60%. &&It's not a 98% rating, but a 98% probability you would like it based on their algorithm that uses viewing history and the thumbs up/down crap. 

You can still review and view the 5-star method ratings, but only manually, per title. It's pretty stupid. &&They are only rating off of sinilarity to other things you watched

They arent user reviews at all

I know I will like my genre’s content all the way down to 20%. It literally has 20% consensus amongst the population

But when 8% things have 98% reviews on my tailored netflix, I notice, and avoid everything they offer like its the plague. I dont want to see ANY of that uncomfortable anime they recommend to me, none of it.&&""Your job is to rate movies on a scale of good to excellent.""

""What if I don't like them?""

""That's what 'good' is for.""&&What's that, Netflix? A 98% match for The Emoji Movie you say? I think I might be a 98% match for another streaming service. &&""The Disappointments Room"", which still holds a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, has a 98% ""Recommended"" or whatever they use to not call it a ""Rating""

EDIT: For me, where I've used my account for a lot of horror-related stuff&&Mine is exactly the opposite. I've binge watched 8 seasons of a show this month? 57%. I'm watching a series for the 4th time? 57%.&&Holy shit, is there a way to tell Netflix ""I like good movies""?  It thought Spotlight was a 73&#37; match for me (Added to list), but Gilmore Girls is a 90&#37; ""Top pick"" for me... how did they think this new system was a good idea?&&I agree with you generally, but it's also worth considering what ""perfection"" is in this instance...

For us, the customer, perfection = a good recommendation system

For Netflix, perfection = more views!

It's very likely that this new crappy system has led to more hours spent watching content, or specifically, *Netflix-produced content* than the previous ""perfect"" system. There's little business incentive for them to give us a good product if an average product makes them more money.&&They really need a ""meh"" button &&Why why why did that become trendy&&They've definitely got it worked out in their favor.  The number of people who switch services because of this is probably vastly outnumbered by the number of people who scroll more quickly through more options, and thus get exposed to more of the content that Netflix wants you to see.  They know this feature sucks and nobody likes it, but they keep it because it's benefiting them in one way or another.&&Same. I've just been using Netflix less and Hulu more. Hulu has a janky UI, but at least it doesn't move/play on it's own. &&I just turn on Bojack for the 50th rewatch. Netflix is basically Bojoxflix for me at this point. &&I've seriously almost watch entirely Hulu or Prime because of the stupid fucking auto play.  It annoys me so I just use another service. &&I had it recommend *Downfall* because I watched *The Office*.  

Sure, I can see the link:

*The Office:* a witty, tv mocumentary about mundane office work.

*Downfall*: movie about the last days of Hitler, where you literally watch people force feed their children cyanide.&&I had to make a brand new account last month after having my original account since Netflix started (dvds) and I was really worried I'd lose all my good recs. Nope. Totally forgot about it till this comment. &&The system is complete shit. It just throws stuff at you. Shit you not in the recommended tab it said ""because you liked the hateful eight"" and listed fucking yu-gi-oh(sp?) if I remember right. Fucking stupid.&&Exactly. It's all a way to make it appear that everyone loves all the content Netflix carries. Especially the Netflix originals.&&Some times they recommend movies to me that I would never watch, like the Adam Sandler movies. Other times they'll be a movie I really love at like 57%. (like O Brother Where Art Thou). I think they just want to peddle the shit movies that aren't making as much money &&Battlefield Earth has 94&#37; match on my netflix lmao&&This is like when you do a good job at work for 10 years, then one day you fart in a meeting and everyone calls you ""fart guy"" forever.&&Yeah.

""We'll, guess I'm doing this now.""&&Also when on a console, 5 seconds isn't enough time for me to turn my wireless controller back on...

And at least with the Joel McHale show, i wanted to see the credits!

And if you don't hit that button. Netflix acts Like you finished the whole video file and so when you go back to it you then have to fast forward through the show to get to the credits. And then sometimes make sure to hit the button to prevent another skip forward&&It's obviously to make people sit there and watch more. But it's just so quick it's annoying.&&Pfff, i click on ""skip credits"" even if it's just 5 seconds. Sometimes it's faster than me.&&> Outside studios are not privy to their viewership numbers on Netflix. They receive a flat fee for their licenses.

Interesting, I did not know that was universally true. I knew some shows were licensed that way, but I was under the impression that many shows were paid on a per-view basis. &&I very much doubt playing the rains trailer when I hover over it counts either&&One of them probably paid for it.&&lol I always hate that.

Prime sucks. Netflix playing trailers is not even the same game as prime's UI failures

It was really weird. First was recommended then My List, then genre recommends and no continue watching. I just restarted my TV. Like fuck am I searching for a show. &&Youtube has been really intense with that lately. At least twice a week I'll watch one random video (let's say a video of some stand up comedian) and then my recommended feed is literally 100% videos of that same comedian for days after. 

Also, they're really bad at determining what makes me interested in a video in the first place. I'll watch a John Oliver clip of him discussing the antivaxer movement and then my feed will be full of pro antivaxer videos for weeks. &&I'm tiered of the pop up for youtube red every time I want to watch a video. I believe I read where Google's plan is to literally annoy you enough that you just give in and start paying for Youtube.&&$the$ $technology$ $just$ $isn't$ $there$ $yet$&&Well not that I agree with fucking up the user experience to try and get people hooked on your service, but the more shows you find that you're interested in, the more reasons you have to come back.  It's probably weighing the probability that someone will find something else they like and stay longer vs. someone being so pissed off that the list moved that they literally quit Netflix over it, the latter of which doesn't seem very likely in comparison to the former.&&I wouldn't be surprised if they are paid to put certain shows/movies higher up in the lists. &&Also from my Samsung TV I don't get the random music and clips from everything on Netflix as I scroll through. It's wonderful.

It still plays immediately when I click a title though.

They are both fantastic.&&You guys are misinterpreting what they're doing. It's not just about finding similar content...they're looking at people with similar viewing habits to yours and throwing suggestions at you based on that as well. Not saying it doesn't result in some silliness, but it's the reason. They're not trying to explain the correlations...just acknowledging them.&&> I've been actively avoiding Netflix lately

Yes but it sounds like you're still paying for it, in which case they're not getting the message.&&You don't enjoy Eric B and Rakim's 1987 hit ""I Ain't No Joke"" interspersed with voice over and explosions?

E: I love the song, just not in this trailer.&&They really need a hide/ignore option for shows. There is 0% chance I'm watching Luke Cage season 2.&&My assumption is that their logic goes like this:

*To retain subscribers we don't want them to watch only a few shows that they might get bored of, so we should really try to expose them to lots of shows so they have plenty of reasons to keep their subscription*

My suspicion is that this is counterproductive, precisely because it annoys their customers so much, but I don't have any numbers or anything.

Makes me wonder: are there browser plugins for this kind of thing?&&I dont believe anything they say about their rating system. I firmly believe it purposely favors their own shows and nothing else. Some of my favorite movies which I rated 5 stars and usually put on in the background while gaming are sitting below 70%. I have never seen one of their shows below 90%.&&Fargo (film) 60%... Ghostbusters 2018 98%.....

Fuck off Netflix&&I thought that the rating system worked to show you a percentage of how much it thinks you'd enjoy that content?

Like not a gauge of quality but a percent of recommendation. Because otherwise yeah no one would watch the shit movies.&&[deleted]&&Ooh, where can you see that? In browser only I'm guessing? I only use the app on my TV..&&I hear you. This is one of those cases where the original meaning of the phrase ""the customer is always right"" applies. I agree they have some isolated metrics that are showing improvement. I also think that metric doesn't measure how they are annoying customers and it will ultimately backfire.

I mean, Netflix is going to do fine as a company, but someone will use this as a chink in their armor to compete with them.&&Because it works better than caring about customers because it’s not bad enough and you spend more money(views)&&I canceled my netflix because of it and I made that clear to their service rep when I asked how to disable it. If enough people ask for it and/or cancel then it will happen eventually&&You watched Bananas in Pyjamas. 

Recommended for you: The Boy in The Striped Pajamas&&I'm just guessing here but I think it's kind of like Amazon's list of 'customers who bought this also bought this' list. 


So someone or likely many someone's who watched hateful eight also watch yu-gi-oh or at least their kids did on that same profile. &&Tbf Seto Kaiba hates Yugi quite a bit. &&I watch primarily on my XB1 and I'd rather just press the menu button or something on a movie and have an option that says ""Similar programming"" and let that bring up a seperate menu.&&They actually want you to watch movies for which they pay less royalty, such as Netflix Originals and shitty movies.&&In theory, you don't need a separate account, just a separate profile or whatever. Still, that's solving a problem that really shouldn't exist. Even Youtube seems to *eventually* learn that clicking on one piece of clickbait every 6 months or so is not a good reason to keep my recommendations full of clickbait, when they have stuff I actually want to watch.&&I think that works on all platforms, i miss the opt our beta days&&It does work. It's annoying though. We shouldn't have to do that. &&Depends on what it is.  It's annoying as fuck on the Joel McHale show because the credit songs are unique each episode and hilarious, and it literally pushes you past them before you have time to react and stop it. &&You actually share the majority of opinion on this. That’s why Netflix changed it to a shorter time.  They’re not going to change it back lol &&Which is why I turned it off. I found that right after the end of an episode, I couldn't wait to see what happens. If I wait 20 second, I realize I couldn't care less, and do something more productive.&&That's exactly why they did it.

I try to keep the selection moving just so I can prevent one of the movies from starting the shitty canned music and random clips.&&I don't think I can do that within the Roku or iOS apps. I've only seen that in the web interface.&&Honestly I think this is kind of part of why their suggestion algorithm is so bad. They really just don't have that much content in the grand scheme of things, and then half of that stuff is awful stand up or shit like Sausage Party, so everyone just watches the few good items and it connects them as ""popular"".

It still thinks I want to watch exclusively stand-up comedy, simply because a stand-up special was the first thing I watched under the thumbs up/down system.  I can thumbs down the entire comedy section and it still shows me stand-up comedy specials as the recommendations. &&Sure, but think of the customers who are engaging with Netflix through channels where this doesn't even happen (mobile, tablets, desktop, etc.)  It's likely you're outnumbered even from the start.&&They can also make it an option.

And them not changing it does not at all mean that it is the majority preference, there can be other reasons. Boosting view numbers can be one of them.&&Wish that option was available on streaming devices and game systems.&&It makes sense, but also, I’m not sure why Netflix cares how much you watch.  It’s not like they’re dependent on page views or ads or anything — once you subscribe, they get paid the same whether you watch 30 minutes of Netflix a month or 12 hours every day.

Maybe I’m wrong. &&Holy shit, is that a real thing?

They analyze and test everything. I'm sure they would love for people to pay for their service and not watch anything (less server resources, less royalties, etc.) but there's a reason they have autoplay enabled by default. First off, it increases viewer counts which they use to compare themselves to traditional TV ratings. No famous TV producer is going to go from producing a show that gets 10 million viewers an episode to go produce a Netflix show that gets 1 million viewers per episode. I'm sure they've also watched unsubscribe rates. If people watch less Netflix, odds are they'll just cancel their subscription.

Fox has 3 things in the top 30 of 2018, per boxofficemojo.com.  Disney disappointment is already Solo only being the #6 movie of the year.  No different than any other industry consolidation.

Alexa play despacito &&MCU fans telling me “I wish all comic movies were made by Disney” and I get shit on for telling them it’s not exactly a good thing since I’d rather see various companies take on various comic properties, for the obvious sake of variety, to promote different ideas and to avoid media concentration.

I really want the Marvel rights to revert, but FOX is way more than some Marvel rights. This deal is toxic as hell.&&That's not how market share works. Disney and Fox don't compel 40 percent of the moviegoing public to come to their films. Rather, historically, the people who make independent choices of what movies to see have, about 40 percent of the time, chosen to see Disney or Fox movies.

It may seem pedantic but it is important to recognize where the locus of control is. Filmmakers cannot compel viewership. 

&&Honestly, the fact that the US government keeps getting out lawyered, out maneuvered, and, at times, subverted through various means in their enforcement of anti-trust legislation is one of the biggest underdiscussed problems in our economy right now. It's pretty incredible when you go look at transcripts and the arguments leveled when the relevant departments actually bother to get involved. It's like they went and got some of the worst, most unprepared lawyers they could find. Don't get me wrong. There are good ones there but they're so clearly outgunned and outmanned most of the time that it's crazy. That's something that should never happen - the US Government should never, under any circumstances, get out lawyered.&&If Disney already owned Fox then Deadpool wouldn't exist or would have been way tamer. This is what happens when one group of people with a certain mindset are in control of everything. This is why I am so against Disney buying Fox.

Fox/Disney would controlling ""40%"" is almost just a baseline at this point and I could easily see the combine force muscling a ton out of the field. They could easily have their contracts with theaters be ""you only show our movies"" or ""you make 80+% of the viewings our movie"" and theater chains won't bat an eye.&&While comcast plays jacks without a rubber ball.&&More like Monopoly...!&&This just in, Disney now owns Chess.&&Iger cementing his legacy as the best Disney CEO since Walt himself.&&We're in the endgame now.&&It's a shame antitrust legislation isn't enforced fairly, this would never be approved in a fair society.&&Meesa propose that the senate give immediately emergency powers to the supreme mickey&&Dread it.

Disney is getting awful close to controlling enough of the market to simply demand that some theaters show only Disney films or not get any Disney at all.

He was absolutely incredible and in my option, probably had the most fascinating life any person could have (closely followed by probably Cleopatra or Julius Caesar). I actually just finished the book while [visiting the Badlands](https://www.flickr.com/photos/145592693@N08/42694310334/in/dateposted-public/) in South Dakota this past week! 

Anyway, the dude did sooo much more than what we give him credit for today. From Child Labor Laws, to Women rights, to starting the FBI, Food and Drug Laws, and even had the idea for the league of nations farrrr before anyone thought it would be a good idea.

He was a smart naval tactician, an amazing police chief (who we still look to and implement practices he developed), an amazingly prolific writer, and rancher, a deputy sheriff in the Badlands, a Vigilante at *two* points (not kidding) . On top of all that he was a crazy conservationists and protect nearly 198 million acres of land. 

He did scores of other stuff too, like trust busting of course, winning the Nobel Peace Prize for stopping a war between Russia and Japan, refused a commander position in the army and volunteered as a front-line colonel  fought in Cuba and cared dearly for his troops. He immediately, at 51, asked to lead another squadron in WWI on the front lines. You name it, he did it.


I have tons of TR stories I like to share, but my favorite is probably his relationship with the ""Emperor of the Badlands"" (Antonie-Amedee-Marie-Vincent Manca de Vallombrosa, The Marquies de Mores) a Frenchman who wanted to gain the throne in France and was raising money by doing all sorts of schemes in the Dakotas. He nearly challenged TR to a duel and Teddy confined to his friend that he would have chosen long rifles at 7 paces, because the Marquis was a better duelist. The Marquis quickly backed off.


Edit:

Another great one is during the 1901 Republican nominations TR was unanimously voted to be the Vice President except for one vote...his own. He was adamant about not becoming the VP because he claimed ""It is a stepping stop to nothing but oblivion"". The big republican bosses figured he could actually do the *least* amount of damage as the VP because every other role TR ended up in he would make it powerful and gain more popularity. Senator Hannah said to McKinley when TR became the VP that ""your only duty to the country is to live for four years."" 

Edit: because people are asking for more:

TR had a really great relationship with Booker Washington - a southern black professor, who TR invited to the White House and became the first black to ever dine there. TR, as you can imagine, got a lot of backlash for this, and Washington sent a clipping from the *the Baltimore Herald* that recounted a true story of his (Washington's) encounter with a elderly southern colonel:

""Suh, I am glad to meet you"" The colonel said. ""Always wanted to shake your hand suh. I think, suh, you're the greatest man in America."" 

Washington modestly replied that he thought President Roosevelt was the greatest man in America

""No Suh!"" Roared the old man, ""Not by a jugful, I used to think so, but since he invited you to dinner, I think he's a --- scoundrel"" 

Roosevelt was vastly amused by this story and stated ""I think that is one of the most delightful things I have ever read, it is almost too good to be true.""

  &&Please explain for the non-Americans.

edit: thx guys&&One of Disney's goals is the death of Netflix. They want what Netflix has and all the revenue it makes which is why you won't see original Disney branded products on Netflix any more. You still see Disney's other movie departments, but actual Disney ^TM is gone. Disney around Christmas bought a massive piece of hulu.

Edit 1: As someone has pointed out, the new Star Wars area isn't officially opened yet in Hollywood Studios in Orlando. What I was referring to was the Launch Bay area and themed events at the park.

Such as: x number of sessions per day on your largest screen, x number of weeks regardless of attendance, etc. In some cases, particularly with the remaining single screen venues or drive-ins, it makes it impossible to carry the Disney product or the competing product at the same time. I have also heard of studios punishing exhibitors through denying, or holding back later bookings for turning down films due to the booking conditions. We’re essentially there, just not quite as brazen as it’s expressed above.

Edit: And the turning over like a crankshaft in his grave, it's an expression meaning he'd be very bothered if this were to go through.&&During the early 1900's America had some of the most wealthy people ever to live in the world working in business at the time. Something crazy like 14 of the top 100 richest people ever to live (including JDR at #1) were in America just steamrolling business.

Until then, businesses could openly pay politicians to make policy that would increase/protect their businesses. That was until Theodore Roosevelt stepped in and started the trust busting. J.P. Morgan, Carnegie, and Rockefeller could neither intimidate nor buy TR, and he began to tear down the trusts starting with the insanely powerful Norther Trust company that was a mix of US Steel and Standard Oil. 

Teddy's motives are questioned by historians, but as the first progressive president, he believed that the president and executive branch should have the most power in the country, not the 'wealthy criminal class' and 'muckrakers'. &&The country is founded on the idea of free and equal people that aren't ruled by royalty or dictatorship. Turns out in the long run people are still assholes and just get greedy and powerful enough to control everything anyway. It isn't royalty, but there is still a small percentage of people making all the calls like any of the things they wanted to be different from.&&There was a time when presidents actually fought against monopolies. &&So, Theodore Roosevelt was the 26th president of the United States. He is famous for many things including: giving a speech after being shot and before seeking medical attention, kickstarting the American conservation movement, establishing national parks, and finally for being responsible for some of the most aggressive trust-busting policies in American history. Roosevelt was a progressive. He believed in limiting the influence of any single corporation over their respective industry (anti-monopoly stuff).

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/8xcwds/a_map_of_every_company_that_disney_owns/) is a recent post that made the rounds showing a visualization of the various companies that make up Disney. It is huge. This thread is discussing the prospect of Disney controlling 40% of the content entering US theaters. This is an unfathomable amount of money we're talking about, and what's more, Disney not only would control what is entering the theater but could potentially exert its influence over every aspect of media consumption. Look at the lift of companies. There are TV stations, streaming services and movie distribution companies. This demonstrates that Disney controls its own content from supply to demand. This is is something that Teddy would not have wanted back in the day, hence my comment. Now, some users accurately point out that Teddy wasn't totally against trusts, as should be the case. Trusts are an important part of our economy. But when corporations control as much of the market as Disney does it's hard to argue that any competition can make an impact with viewers. &&He is saying that the merger would result in a monopoly, which Roosevelt was strongly against.  

Not sure if it actually could be considered one, since 40% is less than half, but that's how I read it.&&Long story short, where he was understanding the necessity of big businesses, he was against shitty big business. He broke up several monopolies. Notable one is Standard Oil as well as a railroad monopoly. Things like comcast, Disney, all these companies forming monopolies that price gouge and remove competition in the name of profits, teddy would be all over them.

You should check out his wiki page some time, he had a pretty interesting life and him as a Republican, you'd wonder what the hell happened to the party that made it the way it is today. &&That's true, and with that Fox deal Disney will end up owning Hulu (if the deal goes through). So say goodbye to all of the Disney movies in Netflix.&&What does that mean though? Theyve got Star Wars, Marvel and the new Disney musicals like Moana and Frozen. What other categories do people want from Disney?&&Netflix is pretty clearly moving away from licensing others' content anyway in favour of making their own. In a few years, it'll be like a regular TV station: almost all its own stuff with select few 'syndicated' shows and old movies cycling in and out. That's already more-or-less how it's been for a few years now and people just seem to have not caught on yet for some reason.

Amazon Prime and Hulu are the ones doing what Netflix used to do. I'd imagine Disney would just dump its stuff on Hulu once they abandon their new solo service (which will happen because people have already maxxed out the services they're willing to pay for and all the new ones keep tanking).&&[Uhhh...](https://i.imgur.com/uB2UXTs.jpg)&&Then who would be WalMart?&&[Herfindahl-Hirschman Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hhi.asp) helps explain. It’s not >50% itself, but exceeding 50% is of significance. &&That 50% number is literally made up. Here's the actual guidence (emphasis added)

>4.134 The Market Share of the Acquired Firm

>Entry through the acquisition of a relatively small firm in the market may have a competitive effect comparable to new entry. Small firms frequently play peripheral roles in collusive interactions, and the particular advantages of the acquiring firm may convert a fringe firm into a significant factor in the market.29 The Department is unlikely to challenge a potential competition merger when the acquired firm has a market share of five percent or less. Other things being equal, the Department is increasingly likely to challenge a merger as the market share of the acquired firm increases above the threshold. **The Department is likely to challenge any merger satisfying the other conditions in which the acquired firm has a market share of 20 percent of more.**

https://www.justice.gov/atr/non-horizontal-merger-guidelines&&It's not quite that exact. Monopoly power is the ability to control price or exclude competition. So 50&#37; could be the threshold, but it depends on the particulars of the market.   


But more importantly, the government is supposed to block any merger that would ""substantially lessen"" competition under the Clayton Act. The merger doesn't have to create a monopoly to be illegal. DOJ and the FCC blocked AT&T from buying T-Mobile several years ago even though Verizon and Sprint would have still existed as competitors. &&How convenient&&Not if they BUY THE GOVERNMENT!!!

Comcast is my ISP. With net neutrality gone, there's nothing stopping them from saying, ""Hey! You can stream Hulu without affecting your data cap now! ^(Also the price is doubled and we're cutting Netflix's bandwidth in half.)""  
  
Disney's interest is in leveraging Hulu purely as a vehicle for their content, and running it as an actual business that competes (relatively) fairly with other streaming services.&&Austin and Ally and Ant-Man&&Cory in the X-Mansion &&Yeah.

I'd like to know your perspective, if that's okay. &&> the fact that they have shaped and created the MCU

They didn’t create the MCU nor have they shaped it. They bought Marvel after production on Avengers was completed and have let Kevin Feige continue what he started with little interference. 

Iger’s brilliance was in seeing the potential and then buying Marvel, but he has had nothing to do with the MCU.
&&People joke about Eisner being a dick but he saved Disney from having to go public. Under his leadership, Disney entered a new era of success with titles such as the little mermaid, lion king, toy story, etc. Who knows what Disney would have looked like without Eisner today.&&This has been mostly unsubstantiated speculation from family and friends, but I've heard recently that Eisner was apparently one of the biggest assholes to ever do it.

They were both positive.), he got an email saying they had overbooked the visit and he couldn't come. When he complained a bit he got someone that said basically, ""We're reserving spots to visit the set for people who will appreciate it."" That was the reply when he asked if it was because of the BvS review. A friend of his who got to go to the set visit got a good bag type thing with 100's of dollars worth of Marvel swag.

Bottom line is Fox is for sale. Either Disney gets it or Comcast does. &&Antitrust  cases can occur without a monopoly position, all it takes is a company having a large market position, and taking measures that are deemed anti-competitive. For instance, requiring theaters with only one screen to run Star Wars for 3 weeks straight with nothing else shown, or not show it at all. Which uses the demand for one popular film to force other films out of the market all together.&&And this is why academics, among others, are discussing changing the definition of what constitutes a monopoly. There is more to it than just marketshare.&&Keeping in mind that this statistic only applies to the box office, how do the other holdings Disney has affect an antitrust case? I mean, Disney has holdings in streaming services, television stations and other forms of media dissemination. I guess my question would be how much of the media market does Disney actually directly control from a consumer point of view and what sort of threshold would be deemed problematic in that scenario?

The Muppets ran from September 2015 to March 2016 on ABC.

Muppet Babies premiered on Disney Junior this year.

The Muppets had a show at the Hollywood Bowl in 2017 and actually last night and tonight they have a show at the O2 Theater in London.

So they've actually been pretty active with the Muppets in the past few years. &&I miss Jim Henson.   &&Well they certainly want to show non-Disney movies too.

Damn.&&Just from my casual perspective... Who was CEO before Iger, was it Michael Eisner? I associate his era with diminishing influence of the Disney Company. The quality of their animated films went down and they were churning out a lot of straight-to-dvd sequels that diluted the memory of their classics. With Bob Iger they acquired Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and all of those properties seem to be doing better than ever right now, and collectively consistently dominating the box office. Also the quality of their flagship animated films is way up. 

And maybe most impressive of all— even though people are getting skeptical of how much power Disney has now, they generally still have the public’s goodwill.&&I can.

Disney: 5  


The rest of the studios' box-offfice-breaking films have come out variously in the 90's, 00's, and early 10's. But **all** of those five Disney films have come out in the last six years. Two of them are **still in theatres right now**. &&The story is long and winding, but the tl.dr is that the previous disney ceo did some good things (saved the financial aspect of the company, made good movies like lion king, built top notch theme parks) and then went on a power trip, lost confidence once the numbers dropped and the company experienced massive brain drain along with a string of financial failures (chicken little, disneys california adventure, disneyland paris). He almost ruined the relationship with pixar by threats of making bootleg sequels. Bob Iger took over, and gracefully restored peoples respect in the company through a series of brilliant investments like Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, and long restoration projects to fix the parks that Eisner had rushed or crippled.&&

honestly that's a pretty uncommon feat for a lot of parent companies&&To be fair under his leadership they also produced a ton of those shitty direct-to-vhs sequels of the classic movies and built the disasterous California Adventure and Euro Disneyland.

They still have a chance for consumer access, but they will make significantly less than a Disney movie. &&Being pushed to Netflix is less than ideal. And forcing pretty much every player out except Disney in the Theater market would put us right where we were in the 30s when movie theaters were outright owned by studios. 


That has a chilling effect on competition and would in no question affect the type of movies we'd begin to see. 


Studios would stop offering competing blockbusters because they'd know no one will see it as it's meant to be, in theaters. 


With the lock on the blockbuster Disney would sow up more money and further monopolize the industry.

He definitely cared for labor/child labor rights, and hated money influencing politics, love nature, ect.. but it was more of his personal morals than out of kindness. Some historians argue that he broke the trusts up to make the presidency (himself) the most powerful person in the States rather than the businesses. Because before then, the president was not the most powerful. It was either the big political bosses, rich business owners, or ever the governor of New York. Remember, this was the early 1900's.  

He also had an extremely progressive agenda for the time, and the businesses and political bosses got in his way of passing legislation. So it could be he took them down to have less competition himself. Looking back, whether it was out of the goodness of his heart or own personal power play, it turned out that his policies were pretty good for humanity. &&Yeah at some point it shifted back to that.. didn't it.&&This is essentially marxist theory.&&Social democracy is the way out. &&Carter had a good heart but was a poor leader.&&I know, but owning that much of Hulu will make them the company in charge of any big decision and could incite Comcast to either sell its stake or build a case so that Hulu gets sold.&&Even with their own streaming platform I'm not sure Disney would let their classics be streamed. They are extremely careful with those movies and make gangbusters by ""re-releasing"" them every so often&&I think a majority of people would still go for both, unless Netflix really starts fucking up in the original content department. &&I understand that. But I also think it's absurd that people seem to expect everything to be on Netflix. Then Netflix is just doing what people are pissed at Disney for doing. To me, it makes sense to have a few of them in competition. Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime are a pretty simple balance and it's still cheaper to have all three than cable. If you have the trifecta, you have access to most of what's available for streaming, period. Having a bunch of little services is ridiculous because no one is going to pay for more than a few. That's why all of these new studio-exclusive services fail. But it's also absurd to expect everything to be on just one platform. It's convenient, but it'll never happen now that there's money to be made.

If it were up to me, the government would enforce its anti-vertical integration position and none of the studios would be able to control their distribution at all. But I don't see that happening until/unless the crooks are done away with.&&Netflix has a deal for theatrical movies to hop onto Netflix for a year once they hit home distribution.  Once that ends it won't be renewed.&&I expected this when writing my original comment. &&as all things should be &&I would guess theres a lot of paying people off rolled into those fees since writing a ticket selling program would be pretty easy&&Ticketmaster exists to be hated.  That's their main purpose, and they're very good at it.  they don't keep all those fees they charge, they just take the blame for them and then kick back to the labels and the venues and whoever else is taking a cut.  Then the performers get to say ""we're trying our best to keep ticket prices low, but we can't control the ticketmaster fees!""&&Sure. Well 1. Ticketmaster owns a lot of venues. So if you want to play there, you have to pay thorugh them. 2. Bands PURPOSELY USE TICKETMASTER because they can get better money for tickets! I mean, bands make the most money from touring, and they can get the most from that. THAT BEING SAID, They LET TICKETMASTER take the negative press and outrage, while they reap the money rewards (OH YEAH sorry bout those high prices but its not poor me tayor swift its evil ticketmaster). And while other companies are shying away from that, actually charging decent fees (smiths tix, stub hub, ) others are following their example( Altura) and fucking people over even more. 
&&Or paying for shipping only to have to call them days before the concert because the tickets never arrived. It's happened enough with Frontgate Tickets that I think they just pocket the shipping cost and wait to see if you'll actually jump through their incovienent hoops to get your tickets placed on will call.&&Yeah I’d rather movie rights get sold rather than the corporations themselves. &&> Presenting... Disney's ""The Simpsons""!

I'm... not sure how I feel about this.&&Captain America: Pirates of the Caribbean &&Tell that to the people writing the comics.

If you're a fan of Disney properties, you're going to have a harder time feeling bad about more of what you personally enjoy filling the market. Even if it's bad for consumers as a whole, they only care about their personal product.

You can't get more Marvel movies by restricting the company that owns them, after all.&&I really don't want them to add the X-Men into the MCU. Sure, let the people that are responsible for doing the MCU right make good X-Men movies, but leave them separate.

The MCU already feels a bit like the world changes depending on whose movie it is, like a lot of things that happen in solo character movies are canon but only in a ""still canon but we don't talk about it anymore"" way. Shield in particular just doesn't work with the wider MCU after season 2, with all the inhumans everywhere that just don't exist in the movies or the other shows. I feel like adding regular mutants would be the same thing again, except on a wider scale and thus more obvious.&&Is it so awful to want Marvel to have all their movie rights back while not approving of the rest of the merger?&&>The Muppets Present Great Moments in American History is a ten or so minute show at Disney World in Liberty Square that opened in October 2016.

As an example, they almost broke up with Pixar over licensing disputes at the end of his tenure.

They would be stupid to let the only thing keeping them relevant go, so he turned around and bought Pixar outright.

And that gave then the added benefit of putting John Lasseter in charge of their entire animation operation to lift them out of the slump they were in.&&Do you recall any involvements of Eisner and the Disney parks? A ride, a new land, etc. I'm interested in learning more about his history as CEO. &&> The quality of their animated films went down

I'm not big fan of Eisner but the [Disney Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Renaissance) did happen on his watch. It's easy to forget how much of a cultural watershed films like *The Little Mermaid* and *The Lion King* were.&&To be fair Michael Eisner was the ceo during Disney’s late 80s and early 90s renaissance.&&A lot of the responses are just wrong to write Eisner off as CEO.  Eisner bought ESPN which is not just the most valuable media property Disney has by a mile, but the most valuable one in the world. It’s worth more than almost everything mentioned by the others combined. At it’s peak it was worth over $50 Billion which represented a huge % of Disney.&&Also, this. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/walt-disney/stock-price-history

Purchasing marvel and lucasarts coupled with their enormous film budgets has led to the future success of the company at this point being extremely multi-faceted. Even if one part of the business fails (theme parks, star wars, disney animation studios, pixar, marvel, fox if it happens, etc.), another will succeed. Especially since most (if not all) of these mentioned are still expanding so much, indicating management’s success. I guess ESPN’s recent PR struggles would be an exception to note. 

Go through here and see how many are Disney owned:

They're just trying to be like the movies now.&&**Any** institution has the full capability to become corrupt, it does not matter if it is media, communications, religious, governmental, corporate, educational, medical, industrial, technological, humanitarian, etc. This can happen quickly and easily everywhere from the largest company to your local police. This is why people have to stop putting *biased blinders* on (yes, even Redditors do this) when it comes to those in positions of authority, power, or influence. Here's the kicker: when we put our blinders on and don't prosecute / punish people for it, it gets exponentially worse. &&I haven't seen the shows myself, since I haven't been to Disney since 2009, but I know the week the show opened a few people filmed them and posted them on YouTube. With the way the Mouse operates I don't know if they are still up or not, but I believe there are 2 skits.

One about Paul Revere and the other about the Declaration of Independence &&Missing out on great music from Sam the Eagle such as ""Great Moments in History (but just the American parts)""&&Absolutely agreed. 

I liked it before the retool that happened at the midseason point and I liked it afterwards as well. I guess people just weren't into it by the time midseason came around, dropped it and ABC just said ""fuck it""

I'm glad though Disney keeps on trying to make it work. The Muppets are a great property and they really can work in any situation. It's just does the audience who is watching want them there. &&I mean...they essentially restarted half way through season one&&That’s still not as long a stretch of bad luck as the Muppets had before Disney bought them, though. &&How bout a hug&&DisneyWar is a great read on his time as CEO. Basically he took a company with great history that had turned stale and made it the powerhouse it is today. He kinda let the power get to his head at the end (where the War comes from) which is why there is some revisionist hate on him but without him the 90s animation boom doesn't happen and the parks wouldn't have modernized. 
Edit: buying ESPN was also pretty revolutionary and was a huge success for them&&Without checking I'm pretty sure animal kingdom was installed during his time. But again, I'm going off memory and vague old-man timelines. But Eisner was CEO from maybe the late 80s to early 2000s and Animal Kingdom was opened in the early 2000s I think.&&California Adventure. Look how terrible the reviews for it when it opened.&&Eisner is pretty much the polar opposite of Iger in that regard, his tenure saw a lot more investment and care towards the parks while Iger cares more about the studio side of things. &&To be fair, Lucas wanted to sell SW. And he wanted to sell it to Disney specifically for some reason I can't remember. So he didn't have to do any magic for it to happen, George Lucas even sold much lower than he needed to. He basically gifted one of the most valuable IP out there for really cheap. Iger is good, it's hard to say he's one of the best of all time as a CEO. How many people would qualify for this? How do we even judge it? Some people are extremly succesful but not necessarily the best at their job. For example, I'm not willing to say Zuckerberg is one of the best CEO of all time but Facebook has been hugely succesful under him from a startup to one of the largest company in the world period. And it's what, 15 years old? Obviously, he launched facebook at the right time, under the right circumstances and leveraged his advantage. I don't think he's anywhere near the best CEO out there.

I'm not stupid. I know why people say Iger is good. He revived Disney and bought Lucasfilms, Marvel and now (pending the vote) FOX. But there are so many factors in play and it's hard to say how much is about him personally. His acquisitions is all timing. Heck, in many alternative realities FOX probably wouldn't be selling off the movie/tv production side of their business and maybe Lucas decides he doesn't want to sell to  Disney specifically and WB has SW. What then? Is Iger still one of the best CEOs of all time?

He's obviously good at his job but it's hard to really compare CEOs about anything else than result. Which isn't a particulary good way to measure how good someone is.&&Ha-ha! (Mickey high pitched laugh of Doom)&&I laughed so hard at the Oh Boy &&>I guess it's probably because it wasn't with full merch rights and everything

Disney already has that.

They got it when Sony was bumbling about trying to get ***The Amazing Spider-Man*** into production and were running out of time.

I forget who went to who, but Disney offered them an extension to meet the deadline (and not lose the rights due to not producing a Spider-Man film in X years) in exchange for Spider-Man's merchandise rights.&&Disney must have merch rights for spiderman because he's the only non MCU character that has merch in the disneystore. Even before homecoming &&You’d have to be to experiment with electricity. I don’t even like messing around with my car’s battery, even though I know what’s what.

I know the whole fine line between genius and insanity but there was a vested interest in smearing him. He turned out correct in the long run. &&Dude this same easily debunked story links back to an old Oatmeal comic where he trashed Edison and loved Tesla. When the artist was called out on his claims he was like “it’s just a comic bruh, Ofc I use hyperbole. But Edison also did this and this and this..”

&&Keep in mind there's probably not much reason to request stuff produced by Fox, ABC, NBC or Disney. I'm guessing it will stay on Hulu or eventually be on Hulu. Not sure where the Disney stuff will go once they start their streaming service, but it won't be Netflix. Any shows/movies from these companies that are currently on Netflix will be gone when the licensing for them expires. Netflix isn't interested in content produced by others anymore.

Nostalgia. &&This does put a smile on my face... &&It fucking sucks when you get Netflix cause it has all of your favorite shows so you shut off your cable tv services, because why pay over 100$ when you can pay 8$.  
  
So you cut it off. One day you log into Netflix to watch one of your favorite shows...its gone! Go to Google, find out show is now on Hulu...shit, so now I need that. Well, its cool, even paying another 8$ is still way less rhan the old cable bill.  
  
Log onto Netflix...another show gone. Log onto Hulu, shit, not there either. Google, okay its on...fucking Amazon? Okay Ill get that for 10$...still less than cable bill...wait, an email: Netflix is raising prices to 10$! Goddammit, but still thats cheaper.  
  
Log onto Netflix, show is gone. Log onto Hulu, not there. Log onto Amazon Prime, not there either. Google, okay, fuck me, now I gotta get HBONow for 15$ and hell Cinemax has a service too for 10$. Well..even with all that its still less than cable bill...wait ANOTHER email...Hulu AND Amazon are raising their prices. #FML. I could keep old Hulu, but there would be commercials. Thats not bad...except its the same commercial every 15 minutes...  
  
DING! ANOTHER email! To continue bringing you great programming (original content, not the shit you really want) the price is raising again. So now, if you keep ALL of your streaming youre still paying close to 60-70$+ +/- and even then you probably arent getting the fuckin shows you want.

Netflix *knows* what shows and films people like. That's not the issue, and never has been.

This YouTube channel called dvr night has uploaded EVERY episode of the USA and uk editions for hells kitchen, hotel hell,  kitchen nightmares and even one offs he did In prison 


There's a few others but he arranges it in playlists well and has all the seasons.


I binged them all and ramsay is just brilliant to watch &&Yes! I mostly get my Gordon Ramsay fix from YouTube, would be great to just have full episodes .&&Hulu for the last two&&Gordon Ramsay is a Hulu man. I’ve been binging kitchen nightmares &&I second this vote! &&It’s on Amazon prime. In the US, at least.&&losing any binge-y shows like psych, 30 rock, always sunny, parks and rec, friends is/would be a huge loss for netflix. i get that they’re pivoting toward their own programming but i find myself using hulu way more now, despite hulu’s user interface being top 5 worst in the known universe.&&This was like the first thing I put on my Plex server. It’s a good show!

&&You know that's right&&[Terrarium TV](https://i.imgur.com/hdKMPVH.jpg)

I try to pirate as little as possible. In the UK, the only major suppliers of VoD content are Netflix and Amazon. I subscribe to both. If a license holder decides not to make a deal with a mainstream platform to host their content, I will pirate it without a second thought.

If it's not easily available to me with a subscription, I will download illegally. It's so so easy to do, so if license holders say ""buy a DVD"", you better fucking believe I'm getting it without paying. &&thank you!&&You can try this:

https://www.netflix.com/viewingactivity

Select what you’ve watched that didn’t have subtitles and click ‘Report a Problem’. Then select ‘Problem with subtitles or captions’.

They may not do anything but it is worth a try. I reported that Sicario lacked English subtitles for the Spanish dialogue (which it is supposed to have as there are extended scenes entirely in Spanish). They fixed it.

They’ve also fixed aspect ratio problems when I’ve reported them.&&I just requested Big Poopy Pirates 4: Anal Adventures.&&Huh they took off snowpiercer? I remember watching it on there a couple years ago.&&We got There Will Be Blood!&&i requested mia khalifa, sasha grey, and cindy starfall&&All of those are on there....&&Can never get those damn “protein bars” out of my head from snowpiercer&&Luckily, There Will Be Blood is still on Canadian Netflix.&&All of which have been on Netflix at some point. So they'll probably be back eventually.&&They used to have Snowpiercer. And perhaps also Pan’s Labyrinth at some point or another?&&I know for a fact they’ve had all 3 of these&&Bring back Battlestar Galactica!&&SG1 used to be on there didn’t it?  Now I can only watch it on Hulu.&&I put stargate sg1 and farscape&&> Babylon 5.

Currently on Prime!&&I put in stargate universe s3&&It makes me sad I had to scroll down so far for the scifi. I came here to see how many people want BSG back, but I had to learn that when people say scifi doesn't sell they might be right. :( The only scifi above is like firefly, which is great and all but not the same, and Futurama, which is one of my favorite shows but it would be great without the scifi setting I'm sure.&&I requested SG-1 and Atlantis.&&ATLA is on German Netflix if you can get that to work with a DNS :)&&For real tho. But where's the nostalgia cartoons. Get me some catdog or dexter laboratory.
Seems like nick and cartoon network ain't trying to get on this train.&&[I’ve got you covered, ATLA and LoK](http://pixa.club/en/series/) &&ATLA is on Amazon Prime.&&Amazon Prime&&Why not just “everything studio ghibli has made” cause that’s what we all want.&&I'm pretty sure Studio Ghibli has refused to sell streaming rights for their work. You can always get them from Netflix's dvd library, although they are still missing a few titles. &&Good man.&&I don't think this will ever happen. I don't know the specifics but the rights on the films are kept tight &&Yup. Disney stuff will be gone from Netflix by the beginning of next year. MCU wise, Black Panther will probably make it on there for a month or two at the end of this year, but it looks like that's the cut off. No Infinity War.&&What about cancelled by networks listed above. Almost low hanging fruit, because cable tv is dying.&&I asked for both Spongebob Squarepants and The Spongebob Squarepants Movie, as well as Agent Carter.&&Amazon Prime &&Fox/FX shows (Archer, Always Sunny) moved to Hulu.&&Philadelphia?&&Hulu&&It’s always sunny is still on UK Netflix &&It’s on Amazon prime.

That elf from Guardians of the Galaxy can get his ass back in the pie shop and make some damn pies. &&I think old Top Gear is on Prime. All of the 'good' original ones. &&Hulu&&They took scrubs off damn I didn’t even know that&&KING. OF. THE. HILL. dammit, bobbeh. &&Yes most nights I just dont bother browsing as I find is very annoying.  At least have it mute auto-preview by default.&&It's still really expensive to buy rights so netflix will get a better gauge of their spending efficiency even if they don't listen to us.&&So it's treason then?&&They are constantly updating it though...it's just usually with removals of things people want.&&Yeah, I don't feel like notorious is even the right word for what they were trying to convey.&&***please***&&Amazon picked up the show (Bezos is a big fan of the books).&&And plenty of people probably didn’t know. &&Well <popular show> is still on Netflix in <Country that isn't the US>!&&To be fair, MOST of the shows I've seen people ask for are on Hulu. Seinfeld, Scrubs, Archer, Futurama, Always Sunny, all on Hulu. But yeah, that's how every one of these threads go.&&That boy IS right.&&I tell ya hwhat&&The only effect it could have is it could change that predicted viewership, if enough people ask for something. But yeah, I'm not expecting a lot to come out of this.&&It's not even predicted viewership, Fox and NBC just straight up won't sell the rights to Netflix anymore. They want to force people to Hulu, which they own a controlling share of.&&Also known as Fox is being an asshole. &&Maybe they can tell show owners that all these people want to watch their show, and maybe get better deals to put those shows on Netflix &&Also maybe the studio was asking too much for it or only had it for a certain window.  I imagine Netflix is getting a little tired of navigating Hollywood legal fuckery which is why they are spending so much on original content now that they are big enough.&&I tell ye hwat&&Yes but it's also we possibly maybe get Firefly&&You mean thousands of redditors asking for the Raimi Spiderman trilogy.&&> Go Fuck yourself Netflix.

Its not like Fox is going to negotiate over licensing in good faith with a direct competitor.

Losing Archer, Bob's Burgers *and* It's Always Sunny suuuuuuucked, but its not like Netflix was all ""fuck those shows and the people who like them"".&&Yeah, I’ve found a lot of their original new shows to be lackluster (and admittedly not meant for me) and even the ones I do like end up not following through with an entire good season. I just think a huge portion of their new shows aren’t targeted towards me as they seem to be focusing on the teen/ middle aged women demographic (not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just not something that interests me).&&They need to spend better.

How the FUCK does comedians in cars get that budget?

Death Note movie cost them how much?

I hear about them putting billions on content but it seems incredibly inefficient.

&&Yeah. I don’t care about Netflix original shows, I care about good quality shows&&Sad that we lost Archer? Well, WATCH PACIFIC HEAT INSTEAD!!!!&&Well the show you like is owned by a major network who want to launch their own streaming service someday and wont play ball so fuck off&&easy there. K-on is a damn treasure!&&> I do wonder if they actually pay attention to requests.

I would guess they do. But if you want a very successful show, or one owned by a company with a competitive streaming network... Good luck. Because it'll cost them a lot.

> Not to be that paranoid black lady

Is that prevalent enough where it's a thing? hahaha Because when I think paranoid, I do not jump to black lady.&&It was there years and years ago before streaming  really took off, then they removed it. Anddd now they’ve added it back .&&I heard about it a few months ago when SyFy was going to cancel the Expanse. On the show's Reddit page, there were links to this page, and the equivalent pages for Amazon Prime and Hulu. &&Did you get their email talking about how they’re getting rid of Reviews? Lol 


Edit:
[E-Mail they sent me. ](https://imgur.com/a/1jc5kFL) 

Edit 2: for those of you who can’t find the reviews. So I went to check, and you know how you click a show to read the over view. The reviews are under details and you can see user reviews there. 

[picture of where to find reviews](https://imgur.com/a/n41Ud2m) &&It's been there.. at least a year, I remember using it to request Sense8 season 3 after it got cancelled &&Just like how it takes away movies from their library right when a sequel is coming out and acts like they never had it.

Hello... Mmhmm... Yep... That *was* a great show... Mhhmmm... Okay I'll pass that on! &&Hitler: ☆☆☆☆★    
Orange juice after brushing: ☆☆☆★★&&No matter what refined and nuanced rating system you'd come up with, I would guess that Hitler and drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth would rate the same. &&Yeah that last one is way worse.&&With how bad the Netflix recommendation algorithm is, I wouldn't put it past them to list Hitler as a top pick for me.&&Serious question, do you consider it advertising when the service you pay for is showing you what is on the service, not selling you on something.

Edited to remove ""actually"" to not sound too offensive&&I don't totally agree with that. I've found several great shows that I would've glazed over for no other reason that I ended up liking the automatic trailer (Santa Clarita Diet, for one). 

There should be an *option* to remove autoplay, i can see how it would get annoying, but personally I wouldn't turn it off. &&Autoplay is one of the most offensive annoyances of the internetdom

""We'll tell you what you like""

-Some Netflix VP, probably&&I just want them to remove the auto-minimize of the window as soon as the first credit hits the screen at the end of a show.  It *really* pisses me off when I'm watching a drama or something and the last scene of the show has me on the verge of tears and then *BLAM* you get a full screen of Netflix bullshit instead of being able to take-in your emotions of what you have just seen.

Every time I've tried to complain to Netflix about it, I get the same bullshit response;  ""Well, you can just click on the small window after it minimizes, and it will put it full-screen again.""

They just don't understand that as soon as it minimizes, it ruins the moment.  Clicking on it to make it full-screen again doesn't do anything to mitigate that.

At the very least, they need to make it an option in settings somewhere to turn that crap off, but I won't hold my breathe.  It doesn't seem like anyone there thinks it's a problem.

The last time my subscription ran out, that was the reason I put for cancelling.  It might seem petty, but it's a huge deal for me.  I'll just stick with my Amazon Prime streaming.  At least they haven't started doing the auto-minimize thing...yet.&&Yep, we have it in Germany... And usually we have nothing.&&I’ve been thinking about using a VPN just to binge watch Fresh Prince but I’m too lazy to try and set it all up&&Germany?

Thanks. &&I think Hulu has the best content in terms of TV.  I mean, it's owned by the networks, right?  But the interface is only now starting to get better and it still has a crap-ton of commercials.

I don't know if this is still the case, but back when I had shitty internet, it would also pause all. of. the. time.&&Hulu isn’t available outside the US, and even with VPNs you need an American credit card to access it. The struggle is real.&&30 Rock, Brooklyn 99, Community... Hulu is dominating Netflix right now. &&Man, Hulu sucks! &&Do you not search for a show before complaining it’s not there? If you do, asking for it is redundant. Your wish is already registered.&&That's the opposite of what they want to say to show owners, otherwise they get a worse deal because ""Hey, look at how many people want to watch it, pay more for the license"". &&Nah, the reason they create their own content is because streaming is becoming more and more important, and all the big studios know this. Which is why they are steadily increasing their prices until they can create their own streaming services.

Soon enough it will simply be cheaper to create and host your own content than to license it from other studios.&&Honestly, I don’t want Firefly back. It’s too late, and the hype is too much. A new show would invariably be a disappointment in some way. &&You'll get your movies when you fix this damn door! &&Tobey Maguire Spider-Man is the only valid Spider-Man&&If they lose the Office it will be their final blow.

2. IT'S AUTOPLAY WITH SOUND.&&I’d like the option to disable it tbh, it makes my connection laggy when a trailer tries to load while the rest of Netflix loads. Or have a “play trailer” button or something.

I mostly just wish I could remove the auto play while credits are still rolling.

its been massively shrinking month over month in regards to quality projects.

I don't know if you noticed but they started padding their library with terrible bollywood and korean remakes, shows, and dramas.

To each his own I suppose . &&But the distributor/licensor of the content will just jack the price, possibly eventually leading to no one having it if the distributor thinks they can get more for it at some point down the line.

That's partly why Netflix has lost so much content, companies know their digital content has serious value now and Netflix couldn't afford to keep it all.

Never once has my account been banned. The worst that happens is they see you are using a known proxy IP and stop streaming to you until you turn it off. [Giving this error.](https://www.hideiptips.com/wp-content/uploads/Bypass-Netflix-Proxy-Error-VPN-Workaround-810x401.png?x48987)

So I don't know what you're on about. Nobody should be getting banned for just using a proxy or VPN, at most you just won't be successful in using them.

Edit: And yes, those years include times where the VPN was not blocked. As far as everything I have experienced shows their policy is just blocking every known Proxy IP from streaming (something they can find fairly easily) rather than banning paying customers.

Edit2: [Here is a screenshot of the page netflix themselves made about Proxies that supports my statement.](https://i.imgur.com/DsXgjWG.png)&&Heads up, anything “kisscartoon” is likely full of malware now. There used to be a whole “kiss” network that kept having to change locations and kept getting copy cat sites that showed up before the real one on google results. 

The “real” one is now kimcartoon.me though I’m still not sure if it’s ran by the original kisscartoon admins or is a really faithful continuation.

(AFAIK kissanime and kissmanga are still legit but I forget which specific ones are legit. .ru I think?)

r/kissanime &&You're a wonderful person. Thanks. &&It was on Netflix, but was removed several months ago. I really hope it comes back, since currently it is hard to find without buying a copy. &&Good lord, give 20 million to 10 different shows and I'll watch at least 3 of them. &&Sea lab 2021 is also part of this distinctional family. Maybe like a step brother from a previous marriage?&&And Moonbeam City was the Cousin that no one knew existed&&Actually, just checked. Still here in the Uk!&&I think it was a mode on the xbox 360 version of Netflix that let you watch it with your friends and their ""avatars"". &&This may or may not be what they’re talking about, but on Xbox 360, you were able to invite friends online to be in the theater with you. You could voice chat it would show your avatars watching the movie together. &&Never knew that was a thing but thought it was a good idea. &&On the 360 (PS3 as well?) you could invite your friends to watch movies with you. Everyone's avatar would file down a row, sit seats in front of a movie theater screen. You, your friends, and the avatars would watch movies and/or tv shows. They also gave you three or four distracting, yet oddly fun actions your avaters could do&&Oh wow ""due to declining usage""

Considering I never found it, yeah. &&Unless you are me and you accidentally start 3 seconds of  something you 200% don't want to watch and suddenly I'm 87-99.7% matching similar things for 3 months.&&King of the Hill is literally the only series I would consider buying on DVD. *And I don't even own a DVD player*.&&[removed]&&Ugh that's way too plausible be inaccurate. I haven't payed for cable for 8 years and your describing a future where I am paying for cable again. Ugh.&&Yeah, but missed out""poor quality stream for first 30 secs"". 

Netflix and  iplayer are fine, so it's not me. &&It's a bit of a hassle to navigate through Amazon prime video still. They did group up all the episodes under their respective seasons Amazon has grouped all the seasons under the show title too. You still need to watch it in chrome to get the best benefits like x-ray and higher resolutions. &&Mine does.  

*AND* if I have to pause something Im watching to take the dog out, a lot of times I come back into the house and it started playing again all by itself.  Occasionally it even moves right on to the next episode, which is frustrating.&&And be sure to watch Portlandia to help acclimate yourself to your new home.&&Come on he already lives here&&US Netflix doesn't have Scrubs either...&&Can we please focus on Rampart?&&That specific comment was about Community though, I'd say it was still relevant. &&It's still good info to have&&🤔&&It comes down to big data (which they have) and money to buy the content. I don't think they need us to submit anything with their nifty form.&&I swear I only ever see the same 5 damn shows displayed every time I hate myself enough to log in. &&Part 3 doesn’t come out till Sept&&Totally retcons 3. The turd burglers are back with no explanation. Virgin Barry can walk again. The Poop Ship Destroyer is just plain AWOL. But at least it's still ass eating season. &&Sometimes, they aren't even given the option to renew, e.g. It's Always Dunny in Philadelphia. &&Cant wait to pick up my $50 copy of ""Microwave Massacre"" :D&&The thinking man wants his Ella Knox&&Exactly. People for some reason are clamouring for streaming to get divided into a dozen different services when they so readily forget *thats the exact reason everyone hated cable TV*. Because you had to buy entire channel packages just to get one show on one channel. 

I wouldn’t mind two or three services but there’s literally Hulu, Netflix, Showbox, Prime, Crackle, HBO, and soon to be Disney. Plus others I can’t recall.  &&Exactly.&&Yoho&&I’m glad someone responded to that statement. I read the proxy/ban comment and was like “umm.... it is not hard to do that at all without getting banned or having any issues at all” lol&&It's [Kissanime.ru](https://Kissanime.ru) 

Use the KissAnime Essentials extension in Chrome and it blocks a lot of the ads and scripts. I use NanoDefender to get rid of anything else that Essentials won't get rid of.&&I hope you like ads and malware&&Heeeeey someone finally mentioned sea lab 2021 on reddit!! So many other shows are quoted/mentioned, but this show has been forgotten for the most part. I think it was even better than archer.

'Where'd you get those kickass pipes!!' &&I kind of liked that one. Its humor was nowhere in the same league as Archer, but its Nagel art made it really interesting to look at.&&It was amazing. It totally synced up perfectly and had voice chat. There are ways to do that now on computers but I've never seen anything work as well as it did on the 360.&&Like mystery science theater or something? Can you see your little avatars while you're watching the movie?&&Oh you can do that in VR these days (with a program called ""Bigscreen""). Basically sharing your screen with other people in various virtual environments, like a theater, upscale apartment, or floating in the middle of fucking space. That app alone made the investment in a Vive worthwhile. &&They got rid of that, the “snap” feature on xbone, and 1 vs. 100. They kill the best stuff ><&&The reviews aren't really helpful. The *meh* shows don't get many reviews and the polarizing shows just have butthurt people complaining about SJWs and stuff.&&Ever attempted the channel 4 one? Nightmare.&&More data points never *hurt*, that's all. It's not like there's any implication that submitted requests somehow *force* Netflix to do anything. It's not a change.org petition where people expect results for some reason. It's just feedback.&&Lol you just had to cherry pick one of the worst titles ever released by either one. And hey, at least that copy of Microwave Massacre was restored lovingly and has oodles Of supplemental features. &&What, no love for my Asians and Asa Akira?&&DC has one coming out soon&&Sixteen men on a dead man's chest&&opening theme i never skip, ever.&&I was in a long distance relationship for a long time and we'd just video chat on our phones then do a countdown and press play at the same time.&&Big Screen on VR is amazing, you feel like at the cinema, along with your friends. The downside is of course, that it works only for friends who have VR headset. It basically allows you to show what you have on your screen.&&Rabbit is really good. &&The website Rabbit does this, it's fantastic and as long as you have Chrome you can mirror your web browser and watch practically anything. Without Chrome you just have a more specific library to choose from but it's still multiple websites worth of material. &&There's also been several vr cinema apps that do it for a while now, but those are obviously not ideal for a lot of purposes and require expensive setups.&&Yeah you could, you could voice chat and throw pop corn. &&The one thing I like about them getting rid of snap is being able to listen to Spotify in the background. &&fair enough. free data is free (:&&My boyfriend and I do that to watch shows together since we’re long distance as well, it’s weirdly fun&&Aww I do that too with my long distance person.&&This feature sounds revolutionary&&Use rabb.it 
It's a website that allows you to stream Netflix, hulu, youtube, etc with other people. I use it a ton with my long distance relationship. Works wonderfully.&&[deleted]&&Me and my girlfriend do that the same way. We’ve been quickly burning through Parks and Rec ahaha&&That's what I used to do with my long distance partner, until we discovered https://rabb.it. It's a free service that allows one person to stream video from a website and have multiple people watch. I can't recommend it highly enough!&&My girlfriend and I use rabb.it, which is a website that let's one person share a browser tab to a room.

[Fanart] I relate to Heihei from Moana on a spiritual level so I painted him,66923,91dnuh,https://i.imgur.com/xxQTQvy.jpg,755,1532401148.0,,"This is great. I’d have this on my wall. &&Boat snack! &&We now have two chicken paintings on the front page&&Alan Tudyk is my spirit animal&&This is amazing!! He was my favorite character in the movie, I wish they gave him more screen time though. Made me chuckle numerous times. &&As the one voicing Maui in norwegian, this made my day. &&Believe it or not there IS depth to what is possibly the dumbest character ever created. To me Moana’s central theme is changing for the better.

Moana is supposed to be the daughter’s chief but she would rather go adventuring as the chosen one. With her I am Moana song, she gains the confidence to believe in herself as the true chosen one and becomes a better chief.

Maui is defined by his grand tales and hook (“without the hook I am nothing”) but with Moana’s encouragement and friendship he chooses to help her despite what could happen to his beloved magical item, in the end he chooses to be Maui hero of all.

Heihei is a dumb rooster that eats anything, even the heart of tefiti at one point and throughout the adventure is mostly unhelpful, but possibly due to Moana’s kindness he maybe actually understood Moana’s instructions to go around and protect the gem, hence why instead of eating it again he swiftly catches it before it falls overboard and gives it back. Changing into a true animal sidekick.....even if it was for a little bit ;)&&Wait that stupid chicken from all the gifs was from Moana?!?!?

Shoot, I should watch that.&&He's precious and perfect and you absolutely captured his essence. &&I never saw Moana, but just looking at it I'd totally put this on my wall. Nice job!&&Voiced by Alan Tudyk, BTW. Amazing work. Maybe his best. &&buk buk buuuk&&This is great, but also I just woke up and the top 2 posts on my front page were paintings of chickens and I thought my brain died.&&Are you going to add a background? &&If you can't relate at least a little bit to Heihei, are you really human?&&2 posts of poultry artwork at the top of my front page today.  And both really good work! What does it mean?!&&I dunno, there's come chicken competition on the front page&&Was this after a failed bob toss painting?&&Nice job, Ricky. &&Becky?&&I'm starting a religion worshiping Heihei as our God. Who wants to join?&&Can you explain a bit how you relate? Someone else told me Heihei was their spirit animal it didn't seem self-complimentary. It's completely brainless, eats whatever is put in front of it, and has zero agency throughout the movie.

We watch it everyday and Hei Hei is his favorite. He has three of them. One of them actually screams, it’s great....... 

The part when Moana discovers Hei Hei on the boat is his favorite. He starts laughing and stomping his feet. He has also started sleeping with his Hei Hei stuffed animal and his Moana.

I dig that chicken too!&&AWESOME&&I'll take one. &&I'd pay you to paint something if it's going to be that good. &&I never understood why there was a domesticated pig and a chicken in that film.

&&Yahhhhh&&nice&&Beautiful piece! What type of paint and canvas did you use?&&IMO you should take the staples out so you can take the wooden frame off and scan this and upload it here. I think it'd make a great background for phones and things.

EDIT: Unless I'm wrong and it's already on a flat piece of paper or whatever, which it looks like it may be, now that I've actually looked at the edges lol. Then you could just scan it in photoshop and stitch it together.

Typically these two animals (pig and chicken) are stored in wooden crates therefore usually survive shipwrecks (because the float). Thus a sailor tattoo tradition was born with the tattoo of a pig and roster on each leg/foot to help a sailor float.&&I might slightly amend the central theme to knowing who you are. That idea central to the songs on the soundtrack (and it’s the question Moana’s grandmother asks Moana on her deathbed).

Moana isn’t just the daughter of the village chief, she’s descended from voyagers and the one chosen by the sea. There’s a couple great parts in the soundtrack where Moana realizes or is reminded who she really is.

Maui isn’t defined by just his hook, he’s Maui with or without it.

(Spoilers) Te Ka isn’t really a fire demon, she is Te Fiti, as Moana reminds her at the end of the movie.

Tamatoa (crab) is the villain not just because he’s trying to kill Moana and Maui, but he also is subverting Moana finding out who she really is by inviting her to ignore her grandmother’s advice (in his song: “Did your granny say listen to your heart, be who you are on the inside ... your granny LIED! I’d rather be shinyyyyyy”)

And yes, Hei Hei isn’t just a dumb bird, he is kind of the animal guardian of the heart of Te Fiti (by pecking / swallowing it to protect it twice in the movie).

Great movie! &&It's a terrific movie. It's on Netflix.&&I went into Moana ready to be disappointed at the Rocks singing. I loved that movie, the only Disney movie I've seen more is Lilo and Stitch and maybe the Lion King.

&&I'm just going to keep it blue. The art that I do usually features one of two things and the rest is coloured negative space to make it pop. 

Plus I suck at landscapes.&&Don't do that :(&&Hei Hei does redeem himself, though.  In the [final battle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IzBDuK9HRI), Moana loses the jewel and Hei Hei immediately grabs it before it falls into the ocean.  Moana thinks Hei Hei is about to eat the jewel again, but instead he walks it back and gives it to her, for once showing that he actually understands the greater goal in play by those around him, and that he merely preferred to stay disengaged, ignore everyone and just follow his base instinct to eat whatever was in front of him.&&Nope, not missing anything..

#Subscribe bleaze&&By right time, you mean holidays and scheduled price slashing events?

Thank you for responding though. &&Well arted.&&Well, there are plenty of people who are naturally good at art, but you can absolutely get to an impressive point by just learning the techniques. &&A but over the top I'd say. Some people can naturally sing, while others sing horribly. That's what I call talent. Not to say not everyone can learn.&&I don't think we'd have much to life without an artist to capture what many see, but seldom acknowledge or appreciate in a ray of sunshine. I hope you and others do not stop painting those fluffy clouds and scarlette sunsets.  &&He had it all along&&My followers aren’t from my art. Which is something I’ve only recently started doing. 

My followers come form a combination of:

1.	Using proper hashtags on my posts (and a lot of the time I’m just shitposting)
2.	posting often
3.	I work a Monday to Friday job in IT but I moonlight as a bartender. And every bar I work at the management always leans on my marketing/sales background to help with their promotions. So I’ve made a lot of friend with the types of people that use Instagram

If you want to pick my brain on it more I’d be happy to help! Just DM me in a few days and I can walk you through how to increase your follower count. But just so you know it takes a lot of work, it’s not hard work but you have to be pretty consistent. &&Uni-posca Paint Marker Pen - Medium Point - Set of 15 (PC-5M15C) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ANVDMU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_j6RvBb1DMSJCQ&&[deleted]&&GENERAL MOANI!&&Heihein Solo&&It sounds like a straight to BluRay movie, but I'd probably watch it.&&Probably worth a Google. &&That was a great show &&Pua is my favorite part of that movie - honestly I burst into tears whenever he’s on screen. I’m so glad he wasn’t on the journey, because I could not handle that emotionally. 

Amazing work, yo&&Come to think of it, it would have been really difficult to make it work. There's a point where you are forcing something, and that'd probably be it. What Pua would be adding would already be mostly or entirely accomplished by Heihei or Granny. I could see little inspirational scenes where she is talking to herself and Pua is who she shares a screen with so that she has someone to talk at about her identity. She already has her big one with Granny at sea and Heihei wouldn't work there as he is a little too comic relief.

Moana and Maoi plus Heihei/Te Ka/Tamatoa/The Little Ship Guys already filled every ocean scene by themselves to capacity. You'd either be hiding him and pulling him out for jokes or something else to deal with him and it might just be too much.

But a Pua short for a future movie could be dope.

Also, if you check their website you can find some pretty awesome coupons too!&&Yeah. Definitely. Anyone can draw.  

I do think, to a degree, with creative arts, there is another aspect of talent related to innovation, critical thinking, world construction, and all that     that comes from creating art. Any art really. From painting to sculpting to writing to whatever.&&Also practice beats talent every day. If you take someone who is talented but barely applies themselves and someone who is not ""naturally talented"" but does diligently practice, the latter will far outstrip the former in ability. Talent can often be a handicap for people.&&Not anymore, sorry, I just intercepted the official request and denied it, faking your identity so I wouldn’t be the bad guy&&I've just started using Instagram. How important would you say consistency is?

In the ssense of showing yourself cooking a dinner can be just as good as the final picture of the food. Maybe better.   

You want to post daily. On IG I'd even say more than once daily. Shitposting is fine, if you're funny and/or great relating with people.    

As a general rule, I'd shoot for, and it's been a while since I've really used IG because it generally tends to, with consistency at a target audience, grow but the overall conversion/interaction rates moving people from IG to other mediums/websites or sales can be difficult. 

I'm going to say on average maybe 3-4 well thought out posts a day. The stuff might not  come naturally. You'll have to stage stuff and make it look pretty. Include basic photography rules like thirds and decent lighting to make pictures of and landscape or people received well.  

An added first step would be to identify who you want folowing  you and what your goal is. Interaction? Follower growth? Sales? Emails? etc.  

Let's says you're just looking for  a start, preferably followers who are into art and the goal is general follower growth.  

A decent 3-4 well thought out pictures a day. Curate that content.  Peoper hashtaggin is super important on IG. If you can, add a bit of story to things. If you're working on an interesting commissioned piece, say that even if it's small or not what you normally do. She the 'blood and guts' of painting after you're done if your hands are a lil messy or something. Get creative with telling your day and what might seem like 'normal' aspects of your day to day but they can be interesting insights for someone who is interested in the same things you are,     

I hope that maybe a starting off point to find some material? I don't know. Don 't always show the 'up' moments either. Make it a story or feel like a moment in a story as much as you can.                   &&Me fail English? That's unpossible. &&Heihei was better for comedy IMO. &&I'd make /r/OurLordHeihei in a hot second, but my knowledge of CSS is nonexistent. &&",2018-07-23 22:59:08

Shazam: Fuck Superman

Edit: Holy shit I typed this before I went to bed, thinking nothing of it. I wake up to see that it completely obliterated my previous top comment 😁&&Holy cow this looks great! It's sweet and charming and it's staying very true to the Geoff Johns rendition of the character (from the New 52). Man, it's also a perfect groundwork to go from in the next era of the DC slate. Keep it simple with some lighthearted nods to the expanded world.&&this is a setup for a lot of potential memes&&I can already tell the superpower test scene is gonna be fucking hilarious.&&Yeah, this is gonna be a hit.&&'Sup, I'm a superhero.&&Felt everything was alright up until Levi shows up, then it really started to win me over.

This really feels like the film DC needs, something charming and likeable. Hope the end-product lives up to it

What the fuck parallel universe did I stumble into?!&&DC has fooled me so many times, but I'm back in boys!&&[deleted]&&Well this trailer has definitely sold me, seems to be putting character created humour front and centre. I'm not the most knowledgeable in Shazam (know him from Young Justice and what have you) this trailer makes me want to see what looks to be a fun movie. &&If this becomes a hit and DC wants sequels, then how are they gonna keep the kid actor who plays Billy Batson when he will be a couple years older every movie?&&That looks really fun. &&Jack Dylan Grazer continues to be one of the funniest young actors around. Made me crack up in IT and now this.&&Fuck that looks good.&&Chuck Bartowski&&Some of the lines are a bit ehh, but ""Sup im a superhero"" was delivered so well. Im sold.&&I love it, but I couldn’t stop thinking that if Jimmy Fallon was a superhero, it would look like this &&I did not expect to see so many positive opinions on this in here. &&Say it!&&Is that Mark Strong?

Is... Is he playing Sivana?&&If you told me 8 years ago that Shazam would be the best looking DC Universe movie, I'd of called you a filthy liar. And yet here we are. &&Finally, I'm gonna be able to get a decent quality Shazam shirt next year. And nobody is gonna mistake it for The Flash... Again... Like always&&What the?

A DC live action movie wherein I dont have to increase my screen's brightness to 250% to see!?&&Im not well versed in the DC universe, only know from what i watched in shows and the animated Justice League movies, but isnt Shazam supposed to be like a group of kids who turn into one superhero?&&It’s like Big with super powers.&&Best moment of the trailer: ""You look at me and you're like, Why so dark?""&&Two in two months. &&Thats not confusing at all. Shazam is the true Captain Marvel!&&Well it is coming early 2019.
Godzilla is coming may 2019 so not too surprising.&&Yeah this is the latest release they'll show. Ww84 some rough cut footage was displayed but that's too far off. This however is finished filming a few months back &&After watching this trailer, he really nailed what Tom Hanks did in BIG.

It looks like BIG but with superheroes and that's in no way a complaint. Looking forward to a DC Movie that has some humor in it. &&thought it was jimmy fallon for a bit lmao&&So glad they embraced how cheesy the suit is&&The charger bit was nice and childish. 

Trying to do good, but having no idea how electricity really works.&&Charming is the perfect word. Really happy with the way Levi as Shazam has turned out.&&All credit to Levi. Great casting IMO&&Looks genuinely charming and not just fancy editing that makes the trailer look and feel totally different from the actual movie. &&This may actually be DC comic movie’s saving grace. 

They finally stopped taking their characters so damn seriously.&&I love how the dude wasn’t even freaking out, he just sounded super annoyed.&&your phones charged, your phones charged&&Yup they're keeping it simple and streamlined. They've learnt their lesson &&[deleted]&&It's like the Thor lightning transformation in Ragnarok. I love the quick change&&I've loved Zach since Chuck💔 I'm so proud&&Now I want a Plastic Man movie.&&It looks so charming. The humour doesn't feel like it's out of place. Totally natural.&&They removed the ""dc vibe"", I think this will do well. &&I’m so fucking ready&&Freddy Freeman: All superheroes fly

Batman: Fuck you&&I honestly knew this would becoming a thing.&&It's worth noting, Captain Marvel totally *could* fuck up Superman. His powers are magic-based, like Mxyzptlk, which Superman isn't immune to. In *Kingdom Come*, he basically stands there and shouts ""SHAZAM"" over and over again, just pounding Superman into the ground with magic lightning bolts.

edit: numerous people seem to be misinterpreting ""could fuck up Superman"" with ""could beat Superman"". Please, before you reply pointing out that Superman wins any fight against Marvel, realize that is not what I'm saying. Yes, Superman wins. But Marvel fucks him up while he does it.&&This looks so much better than that emo series.  Sheesh.  I thought DC learned it's lesson with DofJ.&&I can totally imagine Superman showing up in a post-credit scene to check out the new hero he's heard about and Shazam has a freakout fanboy moment.&&Well he did floss in the power test. &&Tell that to Black Adam's snapped neck.&&the meme dancing should already be Gif'd for everyone's pleasure.&&That was definitely the part of the trailer where I wanted to just keep watching the rest of the scene.&&I hope they test all of Shazam's powers, mostly because I'm not sure how they'd measure ""the wisdom of Solomon"".&&It’s gonna be a funny version of what Claire did in Heroes&&I was skeptical but even I can’t deny that this genuinely looks funny and charming in all the right ways. I can’t wait. Love Levi’s casting too&&Kids are gonna be screaming out shazam for weeks!&&Yep! If anything, it's colourful and not over filtered with sepia and teal. Love it.&&Absolutely. There's a fun, irreverent quality and self-awareness to it that's sorely been missing from the DC films. Zachary Levi is also just stellar casting.&&[deleted]&&First time I can remember a DC film making me laugh out loud&&What if Sinbad is the guy that give him his powers? We never see his face in the trailer.&&i originally thought they actually made the movie with sinbad as a joke&&exactly. I'm so glad they didn't go with a superhero movie. They went with a 12 year old gets super powers movie.&&Finally my username will be appreciated!&&Finally, a movie about me, the superhero movie audience.&&Best line of the trailer. &&This movie is gonna be so good&&Because it actually looks good this time.&&Weird how if you make a good trailer/movie people will like it&&In fairness, it’s Comic-Con. Trailers tend to be more expansive from the convention. &&The Superhero Formerly Known as Captain Marvel.&&Thank you! I feel like there is more to this than just a really hilarious coincidence...&&People forget Snyder directed 3 DC movies out of 5, and he has always been polarizing .


If WB keeps getting good talent behind the movies no reason DC won't rise  again.&&They are taking full advantage of Disney's absence.

If they nail the Aquaman trailer as well this comic con is gonna be a knock out success for them.&&One more still to go.&&It's the right kind of cartoony and cheesy &&They went full glowing lighting bolt and all. &&To me the stuffing in the suit to add muscle is really obvious, especially when he's moving. Hopefully I'm wrong and it looks better in the actual movie though.&&There is still hope for DC and its because of Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam. Who would of thought that this is what would bring the hype back.&&[deleted]&&fine i'll go alone. And i'm not sharing my candy with any of you

When I rewatched it with my mate who'd never seen it, his confusion on the first episode Shazam appears in (with the Brain and Beret-Gorilla) he was so confused. ""He seems.......way too happy."" Then the end when the reveal happened it was hilarious watching his face&&Yeah. He grows normally &&In one of DCs best stories ever, called Kingdom Come, Billy Batson is a grown man, and in the later new 52 comics he's around 20 years old, so I don't think it would be a problem if the actor grows up and is still Billy.&&Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire were both in their late 20's when they played Peter Parker for the first time (and IIRC both time the character was still in high school?). Asher growing up on-camera as Billy should be fine.&&Harry Potter did it well. &&That honestly felt like a jab at the previous tones of the DC films. Setting you up like ""oh no, another tragic backstory"" just to switch tones on a dime. I dig it. &&DC's gonna kill it next year with Shazam and Wonder Woman 1984  (and also this year with Aquaman). &&Chuck me&&They can really have their cake and eat it too with the writing. They can chalk up any bad lines to the main characters being kids.&&The involuntary snicker at, ""Shazam,"" is what tells me they finally got some decent writing.&&Probably because D.C. is making a fun super hero movie instead of some dark blue boring Zack Snyder mess&&And it’s not even blue gray.   Sweet dude.  &&that's the flashpoint version&&""Big meets Kick-Ass"" is how it felt to me. 

Which sounds awesome. &&They're allowed to call him the character Captain Marvel in the movie. DC and Marvel both own separate rights to do that. They just don't have the rights to call the movie itself Captain Marvel.&&What's confusing? Captain Marvel is the newest Captain Marvel. The original Captain Marvel was called Mar'Vell, but the real original Captain Marvel is now called Shazam. Then there's also eventual Ms. Marvel to come, who is the second established Ms. Marvel, the original of which is now Captain Marvel. What's so ^(difficult) about ^(that?)

There's also the other female Captain Marvel, Mary. Captain Marvel Jr. The other two Ms Marvels. The other other female Captain Marvel, Monica. Mar-Vell's son. The other other other Captain Marvel, Phyla-Vell, Mar-Vell's son's sister. Captain Marvel the Skrull. Then another damn Captain Marvel in Noh-Varr. Then there's Mahr Vehl who is also Mar-Vell but not. ""Billy"" Mar-Vell, the official combined Captain Marvel of both DC and Marvel... and Captain Marvel, the M. F. Enterprises comic book hero. Now was that unclear?

^(...Marvel.)&&Can i get an F for the Avengers 4 trailer real quick?&&Looks amazing. Finally a movie where the kids act like actual kids&&This whole movie is so BIG, it’s crazy. &&and then right back to "" hey, wassup, I'm a superhero"" with a mouthful of food. Just perfect&&Ya, that delivery was exactly how a kid would do it too. Just complete amazement followed by pure deadpan.&&I wonder how much he channeled The Tick for this&&Chuck is Chuck with real superpowers though.

I mean, a guy working at ~~Best~~ Buy More ending up with [Yvonne Strahovski (NSFW)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/35/fa/f2/35faf2c5a10fafe12b4a2144562ccf5e.gif) is the real superpower there.&&Idk man, you could certainly make a case that having the Intersect (both regular and 2.0) would consititute as a superpower.&&We may have found the Reynolds/Deadpool combo of the DCCU...&&Good thing Chuck is also a story about a regular guy randomly getting superpowers then.&&Yep.  I have the same problem with Adam Baldwin.  He’s Casey in everything I see him in, including Firefly.&&SHAZAAM, not to be confused with KAZAAM, starring Shaq, who on NBA on TNT regularly spars with Chuck...&&which means he is basically perfect for this role

I can't help but get excited, and I want this movie to be good so bad&&I thought someone fused together Jimmy Fallon and Ed Helms together.&&okay so i wasn't the only one&&I’m not exactly sold on the suit but if the movie is good I couldn’t care less lol&&I wish they would go with his [classic suit](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417QMmhjUjL.jpg). It's one of my favorites.&&[removed]&&[removed]&&I hope the rest of the movie has a similar tone. It really felt like the old animated Justice League version&&His gleeful energy in the role is pitch perfect.&&He's acting exactly like how a kid would if he became a full grown adult with super powers.&&I think ""Charm"" is the biggest thing missing in most of the DC movies so far and why a lot of Marvel movies are able to overcome their flaws while DC can't.  People will overlook a lot of story issues if they like the characters.&&Inb4 the second trailer is hella dark&&He lives in a world where Wonder Woman and Super Man are accepted as normal, “phone charger man” is probably one of the more believable things he’s experienced&&His fault for having a Galaxy Note 7&&I mean the source material it’s self is of a lighter tone. I don’t think they had a meeting and we’re like “Okay so let’s change the tone of our universe”&&This trailer is definitely one step forward, but the new Teen Titans trailer is a sprint in the other direction.&&Or they've just released another good trailer. Their trailers are always really good and then the movie sucks. I'm not gonna bite the hook just yet. &&Every time I see something like this I just imagine them as Sailor Moon characters and make a transformation scene in my head.&&DC gonna take it slow this time, hopefully. They fast tracked to get to Justice League and it didn't work out.&&Plastic Man, Booster Gold + Blue Beetle, and maybe an Animal Man movie would be my top choices for non ""A-List"" heroes to have a movie. &&I'm still waiting for Animal Man.

It felt like they went with the popular notion of Superman being unbeatable, despite Aquaman being able to shatter a continent, Diana being a literal goddess, and every magic hero and villain having an endless means of countering him.

~~Superman killing Deadman was just absurd.~~

EDIT: As people have correctly pointed out, I misremembered that issue, it was mxyzptlk posing as Spectre who killed Deadman, Superman was only present when it happened. . I maintain that Superman's power-level in Injustice is stupid. &&I JUST KNOCKED DOWN SUPERMAN&&Oh boy, I hope so. Cavill is a perfect Superman and I'd love to see what he can do with a lighter tone. &&Please god yes
&&I didnt realize that's what that dance is called and I was really confused.&&That's a sign of a good trailer IMO.  It shows parts of a scene, leaving you knowing there is more to that scene, and wanting more.

This trailer did a good job of not giving everything away.&&It will be an accident where all of a sudden Shazam answers a hard question, then cue the ""cheating"" on a test scene with the other kid.&&Keep asking deep mystical questions, like ""Why do hotdogs come in packets of 10 and buns come in packets of 8""?&&Yeah, cutting off her toe wasn't as fun&&He's so damn good.

Especially since he had the delivery of a kid with his man-voice still.&&2 and a half, really&&Snyder was always the wrong choice though. No idea how they looked at films like Watchmen and 300 and thought he’d be good for a Superman movie. However the director of this made some horror films before so I’m not sure. Nolan handpicked him I think because everyone else he wanted was either busy or didn’t want the job&&Pretty sure Warner Bros always knocks out Comic Con. &&WHERE MY AQUAMAN TRAILER &&agreed looks like what they sell to kids on Halloween&&People who realized you cant just support a universe on Batman and Superman alone. Heres hoping DC keeps the trend and we get more ""ancillary"" heroes. Booster Gold/Blue Beetle, Plasticman, Lanterns and if they want to give us more Bat Family give us Nightwing or Batgirl. Honestly, they just need to let Bats and Supes stay as cameos for a few films unless they want to tell stand alone stories with them while they fix the DCEU. &&I'm just waiting for the Kingdom Come movie. We can finally get all the ""perfect for X role, but too old"" actors in. &&Yeah, imagine how terrible it would have been in comparison if the kid took it super seriously.

""Say my name, Shazam!""

""Yes sir!!! SHAZAM!!!"" 

bleh&&When I am a multi-trillionaire the first thing I'm going to do is buy a license to the name ""Captain Marvel"" and give it to DC on the condition that they never use the word ""shazam"" again, except to transform Billy Batson in to Captain Marvel, as God intended.

And don't get me wrong, I have no beef with Marvel's Captain Marvel. There are a million guys named ""John Smith"" in this one universe; we can handle two Captains Marvel in two universes. &&And there were a few other marvel captain marvels, and the current Captain Marvel was once known as warbird and binary. It’s perfectly straightforward. (They really should have used warbird for Carol. It’s a cool name and a fantastic costume). &&[deleted]&&jokes on you, Avengers 3 was the trailer for Avenger 4&&F&&I was always been happy for the DC/WB/CW stuff to stay separate, but I'd fucking love to see this Shazam show up on Legends of Tomorrow&&Oh Miranda.&&Was hoping for something a bit more NSFW but I won’t complain&&[deleted]&&blessed be the fruit amirite &&Yeah, but *especially* 2.0.&&I hated when Morgan got the intersect. &&That’s a leap.

&&With no Snyder I really truly believe the DCEU is going to EXPLODE with new potential. This and Aquaman are a start, now if they could just get their ducks in line, focus on the heroes we have already (flash Batman cyborg for example) and stop announcing 63 different films, we could be just fine. 

- Flash can start with him realizing his potential after Justice League and starting to be more of a hero and household name, bring in  Eobard, go from there. Could set up a flashpoint for the future.

- Batman, holy shit where to pick from, Hush, Assault on Arkham Asylum, Under the Red Hood... so many good starting points 

- Cyborg.... uhhhh.... idk tbh. Replace with MM? Lol

- *Green.... Lantern.... Corps* ... nuff said. 

- Bring in a new Constantine too for a magic centered film.

Justice League 2 or Dark, boom we got some hits. &&Slow and Steady wins the race. But hopefully this is a new age of superheroes where Marvel legitimately has some competition to force changes in their movies.&&Booster would be awesome.&&I’d kill for a Blue Beetle film &&Anyone else grow up with Batman Brave and the Bold. Cause that shit has so many potential movies in it.&&Well, they're working on a Swamp Thing show, maybe there's going to be Animal Man down the line too? A full budget movie would be awesome though.&&I can't decide if I'd prefer a Jeff Lemire-era semi-horror movie directed by someone like James Wan (fingers crossed his Aquaman film is better than the posters make it look) or a Morrison-era headfuck directed by, I dunno, Edgar Wright or someone like that.&&[deleted]&&Seemed like the dude knocked it out of the park. This gives me faith for the DC universe, the Snyderverse was such wasted potential. &&Not giving him enough time to gain muscle mass was a bad choice though &&Foster home, not an orphanage.&&I rolled my eyes when he was talking about how horrible the Foster family was thinking ""oh yay, another overly dark superhero movie."" Then the kid laughed about it and I realized this movie will probably be alright.&&brian grazer's nephew is actually a good actor. he was good in IT.&&Even the Nolan movies had that vibe. Remember Bruce joking about he's going to pin all the crimes on Alfred. Dark doesn't mean depressing. A dark Superman movie can work, if he's the light that shines through it all... like how Wonder Woman was in her movie. Hell, even on the other side, a dark Spider-Man movie can work well with a depressed Peter Parker and all - just so long as the moment he puts on that costume it all sheds away.&&Yeah,  I *really* didn't want this made because that character is so great so I reluctantly watched and finally I can be a DC fan and be OK with it.  No more stepphenwolfe crap. Use the good characters and build from there&&Theoretically you couldn't even put the BvS vibe *in* BvS, but still... &&That's not the DC Vibe! Cisco's not in the picture at all! :P&&Yeah, they removed the Warner/Snyder vibe, not the DC one.&&Well now I’m going to need some context for that image.&&Sounds amazing already&&all bats can fly&&Just imagine if DC made a good, cohesive cinematic universe that concluded with Kingdom Come. &&*3D DC world&&I know, right? Superman killed Captain Marvel using heat vision in a nonchalant way? What the hell were the writers smoking when they came up with that?&&Isn’t deadman a literal ghost?&&Maybe it's a spoiler but...

How the fuck did he even *see* Deadman?

Isn't he invisible to everyone who is alive?&&> Aquaman being able to shatter a continent

Do what now? Last I recalled he was super powerful but more like kinda early Spider-Man strong, super hard to hurt, swim like thousands of miles an hour, and crazy fish powers. &&Also Superman killed a child and no one really ever addressed it.&&> I maintain that Superman's power-level in Injustice is stupid. 

I mean, I'd argue Superman's (wildly inconsistent) power levels are stupid in *most* stories he's in. Most writers make him so god-like that it never makes sense that he's challenged by anything from one scene to the next.

Grant Morrison in particular seemed to always have a huge boner for making Superman nigh omnipotent. (Like the time Superman instantly read the contents of a flash drive by looking at it. [No, seriously](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a9bf054f460f70074a2e6037dffe8f1e). Which was, I think, the same storyline where he [became a medical expert in 10 seconds](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-04339ebc237a0c3524f0a5da12bc4a67-c).)&&I feel Cavill with the right director and direction could be the best superhero out there &&I might be wrong, but I think the wisdom of Solomon keeps Captain Marvel honest.  (I hate that it’s legal reasons keeping them from using the character’s original name)&&I watched the entirety of 'Chuck', and I love Levi. He's plays the nerdy kid so well so this cast really is perfect for him. He has a lot of... *energy*&&Username checks out &&>  It should be BIG with super heroes.


And they nailed that tone, judging from this trailer.&&Okay, James Gunn.&&Poor Supes :( Cavill could be amazing if they could get the right tone for his movies. I think JL Superman was a a step in the right direction &&I'm pretty sure Matt Reeves can give us a great Batman movie too. Remains to have Flash, a Superman sequel and a Green Lantern good movie to put them on track and they're mostly good.&&I liked the ""oh, hey. I'm a super hero""

First thing I'd do when I was 14 and randomly turned into a jacked superhero would get some pussy&&And carrying out a six pack of beer.

Cause, I mean, what shop owner is going to card the guy who just saved his store?&&2 and 3/5, since he directed the Flash/Boomerang scene in Suicide Squad.&&Wait a second, Christopher Nolan is involved with the DC films at a level where he can pick the directors?&&> No idea how they looked at films like Watchmen and 300 and thought he’d be good for a Superman movie. 

They didn't look at those movies. They looked at the *Dark Knight* movies and wanted a successful Superman series in that tone because they assumed it would make tons of money.&&[deleted]&&The plot simplifies! &&All the Avengers 4 trailer needs to be is *insert any Avenger* talking to Rocket. And then Rocket just says ""this is for Groot""&&>Oh, and Nebula’s there too.

I realized recently she’s the only way he’s getting home!&&And it'd still make 3 billion in the opening weekend&&I would watch that trailer.

I would watch 2 minutes of Tony Stark's crippling depression caused by his inability to save those who trusted him.

I'd watch it, and, knowing Marvel's track record right now, I'd *like it*.&&U &&Team up with Beepo.&&We'll bang, okay? &&Miranda and Liara... I always go with them each playthrough. Just like I always end up team Yen...

&&Cerberus Cheerleader Bosh'tet&&She's got a scene in Manhattan Night you'd like.&&Her and the chick who played Britta on community were my top 2 choices.&&Guys... I know kung fu&&The last season(s?) Definitely ruined the fun for me &&I said “may have.” This is the first DC trailer thats actually made me want to see the movie. In theaters no less. &&Wonder Woman says hi...even if it's the only one so far.&&Someone hire Adam Baldwin to follow him around killing people and calling Shazam a moron the entire movie. &&I hope so. Chuck is one of my favorite all-time tv shows. It's still a huge bummer that we never got any real closure.&&Jake 2.0 is also a good show. Writers strike killed it I believe.&&If you watch behind the scenes stuff from Chuck, it's like the dude was always in character. Like when they were filming the last episode and everyone was very emotional having spent 5 years working closely with each other he just told everyone to quit whining and was the first one out the door when the final shot wrapped lol. &&I can always clearly hear his grunting&&*Why are you wearing a tux?*

It's after six...what am I, a farmer? &&    Lemon/lesbian Frankenstein called/she wants her shoes back&&I keep wondering when he’s going to put on his hat.&&Man, BL has a terrible suit. You can see him on the rooftops in pitch black!&&I find it funny how all the black guy super heroes have black in their name. Black panther, Black lightning, Black adam, etc.

Imagine the same for the white ones. Whiteman, Superwhite, Iron White, White America. Just a thought.&&I think it depends on the character. For people like Superman and Captain Marvel/Shazam his style works great because they're supposed to essentially be wearing clothes. When he does people like [Batman](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bc/3b/e9/bc3be91c532bb417da61010cde5faafa.jpg) it can sometimes look weird and like a Halloween costume.&&My ex girlfriend Tracy was a bitch, but I'd be a fucking liar if I tried to act like her getting me that Alex Ross DC comics coffee table book wasn't pretty much the most clutch Christmas present I've ever gotten besides Super Nintendo.

Thanks Tracy, seriously. &&So something lower than the Teen Titans show? &&What Flash film?&&Hopefully they do it right, I'm ready for some consistently good DC movies &&Shit, if anything it was much lighter than The Dark Knight Returns.&&I would think that the CW arm of DC would know most of all that the lighthearted stuff works better.&&https://youtu.be/-PPofXaJ4go
Don't watch with kids around.  Or anyone around for that matter.  Hell, I'd just say don't watch it.&&It’s a live action series for the DC streaming service. It’s called “Titans”. 

It includes lines such as Robin saying “fuck Batman” just so you know how dark and gritty it is. &&If you had a halfway decent storyboard, you could probably legit convince Hemsworth to voice it. &&Hi I'm a Marvel exec you're green-lighted&&Magical girl Thor? Fuck yea I'd watch that movie&&It's actually better with Iron Man holy shit lol&&Honestly if this, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman 84 are solid... could be a good soft reboot moment for the franchise.

Shit, just have Barry fuck the timeline a bit, the guy loves doing it.&&Batman Court of Owls would be awesome&&My mouth is watering already at the thought of Reverse Flash in the DCEU.&&He's my favorite DC character of all time behind Batman. I'm a huge fan of Legends Of Tomorrow and keep hoping some day I'll see ""Booster Gold to join Legends"". &&I fell in love with Jaime Reyes through Young Justice. He's a very relatable character, he splashes Spanish into regular conversation in a way that feels very genuine, and I love the shoulder-devil arguments he gets to have with the scarab.&&Lol basically him. He's always feels like a kid in an adult body, that is one of his charms. Just super nerdy and bright fella. &&the more cartoony look may help the humor and tone &&He did put on muscle for the movie though, but they just went for the look he has in this trailer since it fits the tone of the movie better I’d imagine.&&I laughed when he said ""You're a disabled foster kid. You've got it all"". Colour me excited.&&I seriously started to have some major concerns at that point too, curious if was an intentional jab at the overly dark previous entries.&&""You know what these are? They're Gazebos, they're bullshit!"" 

I was in tears after that line in IT&&Or how Joker made that pencil disappear. That was good. &&The best spider man comics I've read are ones that Peter is in his worst hours. Spider man is known to always make the heroic decision, even if that's the hard choice and hes at his best when those moments come through in his darkest times. Like when Doc Ock figures out in his dying hours that Peter is Spider man and is able to  hatch a plot to switch bodies. After failing to switch back into his own body, Peter is able to convince Doc Ock that he needs to continue being spider man for the greater good of New York. Doc Ock commits to being Spider man and swears he will be a better hero than Peter.

This starts the Superior Spider Man comics (which I think is the best spiderman arc of all time) where Doc Ock ends up with Peter kind of in the passenger seat of his own mind with Doc Ock in the drivers seat.&&I still say *Man Of Steel* was an awesome film, but I suspect I’m the only one. &&[deleted]&&I feel a lot of the problem with DC films is they are creating a universe outside of the tv shows, or doing single hero based movies beforehand. They are tossing out but storyline stuff and trying to the in character back stories at the same time. Suicide Squad is a good example, flashbacks for Harley had nothing to do with the story, other than Joker was rescuing her so to speak, and that shit could have been left out. Deadshot could have had a good action flick, ending with the apprehension scene that was used, setting up Batman. Just my feelings though.
&&Maybe we're on the wrong earth. Quick, which Wells do we have in this dimension?&&Snyder's vibe can work, but so many superheroes are supposed to be above that (especially Superman), but Snyder seems to enjoy making the heroes as crummy as the world around them which kind of goes against the reason why so many of them become heroes in the first place.&&It's a cover for the new Shazam comic book coming out in autumn. The other characters are Shazam/Captain Marvel's foster siblings and he can share his powers with them. There's also a tiger he can give share his powers with.&&Bats cant take off without having something to drop from &&That'd be lovely but it would require Warner Brothers to be competent.&&That was ridiculous.  And the fact everyone was like ""Yeah, hey, look at him burn a 12 year old's brains out, okay, cool beans."" 

Beyond the fact that Superman even being capable of it is just nuts. &&Yes. He is a dead man. 

Now he is a dead ghost. &&If i am correct it was Spectre who mortally wounded him&&In the latest New 52 run, Aquaman had inherited his powers from the *first* King of Atlantis.  So they were equally powerful.  And the reason that Atlantis sank was that the old king had just hit it (once) and split the continent in half.

When he faced off against Aquaman (who is *at least* his equal) Aquaman beat the shit out of him, swam him into an underwater volcano, stood on the old king while the guy was in lava and melted, then swam out of the lava and made out with his wife over the old king's smoldering corpse. 

So yeah.  Aquaman is a beast. &&Say what?  Wow.  Am I out of the loop.  &&He definitely has the look and I think he’s actually a pretty decent actor, I hope he gets his time to shine as Superman&&Idk man I think Cavill was an awesome cast for Superman but idk if anyone can ever beat RDJ as ironman&&You may be right. Honestly my Shazam knowledge is pretty slim &&Idk i like shazam more then CM as a name, but maybe that's my ass whos only known him as shazam talking&&I honestly think he’s a more charming version of John Krasinski, and I’m so glad he’s finally getting a chance to lead a major film. &&I agree with u/TheAquaman. He's smart and a very good king. &&Disney has cut ties with /u/nginparis.&&Don't worry, he'll be fired in 10 years.&&I feel a proper sequel would help him immensely. &&I have a lot of confidence in Reeves based on his Planet of the Apes films. I hope that he focuses more on Batman as a detective rather than a fighter. A villain like Viktor Zsasz would be perfect for that. &&First thing I’d do is break stuff until it stopped being fun. Like, go to a junk yard and just wreck shit. &&Rofl I love how barely a minute of the Suicide Squad counts to 1/5 of the film.&&IIRC WB offered Nolan the opportunity to helm the DCCU after the success of the Dark Knight Trilogy, Nolan turned it down and recommended Snyder as an alternative while helping write and produce Man of Steel. I would rather have Interstellar and Dunkirk, but imo its a real shame Nolan turned down the job.&&[removed]&&Captain Marvel aka Billy Batson was originally published by a company named Fawcett Comics in the Golden Age of Comics. He is the first Superman knockoff and not only preceded Superman in say flying but was actually the most popular superhero of the 40s. Elvis was a big fan and based a lot of his outfits off Captain Marvel Jr. (that's the kid with the crutch btw) the Big Red Cheese's superpowered sick kick who transformed by saying ""Captain Marvel"" for maximum hilarity. (There's also Mary Marvel, but she gets to say ""Shazam!"" only it spelled with goddesses so its different)

Anyways back to the story eventually DC Comics decided they didn't like this obvious IP infringement stealing all their thunder and sued Fawcett Comics. 

It ended sort of indecisively because the Golden Age of Comics ended with the bottom falling out of the market. IIRC Fawcett won a Pyrrhic victory in court but DC might have appealed and so they settled as Fawcett was closing down their superhero line. In the agreement was that they would never publish Captain Marvel again. 

Fast forward a few years to the Silver Age of Comics and suddenly superheroes are hot shit again. Fawcett still owns the property but can't publish it. But you know who *could*? DC comics of course! And so the characters were licensed to DC and became (sort of) the DC line. This would eventually evolve in the DC Multiverse to the main universe being Earth-1 and the Fawcettverse being Earth-S. Meanwhile Fawcett would go out of business entirely and their assets would be snapped up by DC fully. 

Where does Marvel Comics enter the picture? Well they'd been around since the 40s too as Timely Comics under which they created Namor, Captain America, the original *robot* Human Torch, and some others nobody cares about. Anyways sometime before Fantastic Four started they rebranded as Marvel comics. Said team unlike their movies were actually fantastic and launched Marvel as a major player in the Silver Age.

Now through all the legal shenanigans between Fawcett shutting down and I think some changes in the law itself maybe... their *trademark* to Captain Marvel had lapsed. Since Marvel Comics was shitting out characters right and left and well Captain **** is just sort of comics tradition... well why not increase their branding with a Captain Marvel. Specifically this is Captain Mar-Vell (geddit) of the Kree Imperial Militia, a friendly alien from Space Rome. He was never a big name (seriously his most siginficant story is when he got Space Cancer) but Marvel Comics has never allowed the trademark to lapse since. 

However since DC/Fawcett did but still have their original *copyright*, because the law has different types of intellectual property, they can still publish the character. They don't call any publication Captain Marvel not because there's any law that says they can't per se but because it would bring an immediate lawsuit from Marvel Comics for trademark violation. Not even necessarily because Marvel is a bunch of assholes but because one of the quirks of trademark vs copyright can be that if you don't defend a trademark (knowingly) then you can lose that protection.

So you had for some decades DC's Captain Marvel published under varying titles (mostly something something Shazam!) and Marvel's Captain Marvel occasionally published as Captain Marvel though so help me never for very long. 

Eventually though DC kinda-sorta gave up the ghost and renamed Captain Marvel Shazam for real, meanwhile Marvel decided that none of their Vell's had worked out and decided to aggresively rework Carol Danvers aka Warbird aka Ms Marvel.&&Ok, so DC's Captain Marvel used to be part of Fawcett comics(a company that went defunct in the 80s) in 1939. For a while he was more popular than Superman. So DC bought the rights to him, and then basically sat on the character. Eventually Marvel made their own Captain Marvel. DC tried to sue, but due to doing nothing with the rights for so long, they had no case. Also DC can't advertise Captain Marvel as Captain Marvel, but they can call him Captain Marvel in the pages of the comics. &&if Bucky knows it's the end, I want him to give Rocket his arm as he leaves. They gave us the fan service in Infinity War, now let's turn that into a tearjerker........&&[deleted]&&Avengers 4 trailer should just be Luis bringing everyone up to speed on everything that has happened in the first 10 years of the MCU.&&Yeah, that was something that kept bugging me in the comments on opening night. Everyone was like, ""Tony is stuck there all alone. How's he gonna get back?"" Guys, Nebula was there! C'mon!&&Yeah avengers 4 is definitely gonna be the highest grossing movie ever&&C&&How dare you sully the name of Beebo!&&I can't help but pick Triss.  I'm a blaspheming bastard, I know.  Oh, Miranda and Grunt was my favorite team.&&Really? I guess Ive had it stuck in my head that Brie Larson is Captain Marvel that I can’t imagine anyone else. Kinda like when I learned Dennis from IASIP was up for Starlord. &&Again&&The problem I found with the last season was that they were told it was the last one, so they crammed like 10 season-length storylines into one season. &&Wait for the next trailer. You'll see the exact moment wonder woman and doomsday show up.&&For me, it was Wonder Woman. Either way, /u/AC3x0FxSPADES called it above; if he can keep this kind of charm and wonder up through the movie, it'll do well just on the heart of it.

...and after seeing a first-look on Aquaman, it looks like some eye-candy, at the least.&&One of the man of steel trailers was soooo fricking good and had me hyped as hell back then :/&&I'm rewatching it right now and on season 5... It's just like rewatching Psych or Burn Notice... Once I got that last season I hate knowing it's about to be over.

Such a feel good show. Same thing with Stargate, Eureka, etc.

Chuck was a good one.&&He’s apparently just not a very nice guy. I once listened to a podcast episode where Rob Riggle complained about him for a solid 10 minutes, and I’ve read similar statements in other gossip-y articles. &&That's because his name was actually supposed to be Backlighting&&It's from the development of 1970s minority superheroes that were a weird mix of progressiveness pushing for more minorities mixed with ripping off urban blaxploitation movies.

They also don't necessarily have ""black"" in their name- Storm, Luke Cage, Blade, and Cyborg are good examples where they don't follow the ""Black"" superhero naming system. Some of them also follow  the urban blaxpoitation motif, but not all of them.

&&To be fair, that’s 70s Batman who was wearing little more than a Halloween costume even if Neal Adams art of him is one of my favorites.&&This [Batman](https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Batman-scars-Alex-Ross-featured.jpg) looks superb, in my opinion.&&Tepid Titans&&2020 release date.  Was suppose to be called _Flashpoint_ and be faithful retelling of the comic series.  Rumor is that has changed because of the animated movie and the TV show.   &&Yes if they were creating something for the CW which they are not. There's less restrictions now on their new DC streaming service. &&Even with your warning, I was still hopeful going into the trailer. 

That was a mistake. &&Oh shit, thats bad lol. So damm edgy&&>how to delete someone else's movie&&Good god, that screams ""trying too hard."" Hopefully for the sake of the actors involved, it's just a shitty trailer.&&What the fuck is that!?&&My favorite response in the comments was how all of the money that went into that mess could have, instead, been used to bring back the real Teen Titans show. &&Well, we're getting a S3 of Young Justice, so there's that.&&God damn it DC&&It's a cringefest.


[Here's the better version.](https://youtu.be/QWaWvQuIVMI)&&It is Norse mythology cannon that Thor went as a woman once. Heck, Loki turned into a female horse and gave birth. He also turned into a snake so Thor would pick him up and he could go ""Bleh! It's me!"" and stab him.&&Have you vetted his old tweets?&&https://i.imgur.com/E3Y3y_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium&&Let’s be honest, if you ask Barry to fuck the timeline *just a little bit,* do you really think he’s going to stop when you tell him to &&I want the long Halloween so bad :(&&Angry helicopter noises in Dolby 7.1.&&Thawne is effectively timeless. Although I love his end in The Button, he's effectively the perfect super villain. He has all of time, vengeance, and a weakness on his mind. What's not to love?

He's even timey-wimey, so his existence explains (in a rudimentary way) the way space-time works in that universe to the audience.

His timelessness makes him, inarguably, my favourite super villain of all time. He's perfect. At any point in time there are thousands of duplicates of him moving throughout the miltiverse; he can always come back, cause trouble, turn coat, etc.

I would buy ten tickets to an Eobard Thawne prequel movie. Not even lying.&&i always liked John Henry Irons and i would love just to have a Shaq cameo in a Flashpoint now.&&Yeah there’s definitely a sweet spot of “so comically musclebound that it’s charming” that they can find. Not saying there’s enough evidence here to say they pulled it off, but I can definitely see that working. &&It's been interesting seeing how well child casting has gone in recent years. A lot of films/tv have really charming child characters that act well.&&As a guy with disabilities, it was spot-on. Sometimes a dark sense of humor helps to deal with it.&&I still don't know how he managed it. He was so slick that guy fainted with amazement.&&Ta daaaa&&If you don't mind elaborating, how does he convince Doc Ock to continue being Spiderman?&&Spider-Man 2 nailed this so perfectly.

Peter Parker is having a severe existential crisis between being Spider-Man, his love for MJ, his schooling and the simple responsibilities of being in your early 20s with the anxiety over the future.

When Doc Ock threatens the world and those he loves he shines through which is what made that movie so good.  He didn't have to done the black suit and say ""fuck Batman"" (I'm sorry, I still think DC Titans overdid it).&&He's basically always a fish out of water and wayyyyyyy to powerful.  It makes it hilarious when he tries to interact with people.  It's the movie ""Big"" with a superhero. &&Billy Batson  is my favorite comic book character.

If you want a good introduction to the character, the episode ""Misplaced"" (Episode 19 Season 1) of Young Justice is amazing and Billy/Shazam is the main character.

There is an animated movie Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam that is also good but covers a lot of the same material that will be in the live action movie.

Justice League: Unlimited episode 20, ""Clash"", is cool if you want to see how he interacts with the rest of the Justice League.&&He is at least equal to Superman in powers but has the mind of a rebellious teenage boy.
&&That's why he said just imagine&&Ridiculousness of how he died aside, you could make the excuse that the Injustice elseworld Superman might have already been a little different even before he ripped out the Joker's heart since it was another universe after all 

I could be completely wrong though&&[deleted]&&Technically, wasn't it Mr. Myzplktic pretending to be Spectre? &&And people mock aqua man. What issues are those and is it in a volume book yet?&&It's the Injustice storyline, an alternate reality story in which Superman decides that he should rule the world.  Things quickly become violent.&&Injustice: Gods Among Us is a DC Elseworld where Joker's latest plot results in the death of Lois Lane, her and Superman's unborn daughter, and all of Metropolis. Because of this, Superman snaps, kills Joker, and decides they need to take over the world to fully stop crime. It has two video games and a series of very well done tie-in comic books, especially Years 1 and 2, that showcase where Superman is just trying to protect people but he's slowly going further and further down a dark path.&&From a spin-off where Superman goes evil. Not normal Superman.&&Spoilers for Injustice:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF3ZxeqoizU&&Cavill is an amazing actor, he just hasn't had as much chance to shine as Superman. After all, he was incredibly close to being cast as Bond until Martin Campbell saw Layer Cake and finally went with Daniel Craig.&&I wholeheartedly agree. I miss Chuck. &&/r/beetlejuicing &&If he ever gets a sequel :(&&Maybe doing two villains in it (a la Dark Knight with Dent and Joker) with one being Zsasz and the other being Deathstroke. Gives the perfect balance between action oriented and psychological horror. The Ape movies are fantastic, and I think Affleck is a very good Batman just with bad stuff to work with. Im excited&&It would be 1/10 but even then that's a bit too much, maybe OP left the movie 10 minutes in from disappointment &&I wonder why Timely publication would rename their company to be the same as a hero character in their competitor's comic.&&Is this like.. your job or something?&&IIUC this is not entirely true. So Fawcett published Captain Marvel, and DC got into a heated legal battle with Fawcet accusing them of copying Superman. It ended with Fawcett stopping publication of Captain Marvel. Marvel Comics then came in and trademarked the name Captain Marvel (IANAL but I believe they could do this since Fawcett essentially gave up the rights by halting publication). It seems that Marvel only had interest in trademarking the name because of the Marvel part and speculation that DC wanted to revive the series (which was true), because they didn't publish any Captain Marvel comics for a few years. The reason at the beginning the Captain Marvel title kept getting passed around between characters was because Marvel had to publish comics using the trademark otherwise they lose it. After Marvel acquired the trademark DC revived the series, however using the name Shazam (since Marvel owns the name Captain Marvel now). I believe they were still able to call the character Captain Marvel, but the comics themselves had to be called Shazam. However this caused a lot of confusion and so eventually DC came out and said he is no longer Captain Marvel and simply Shazam&&I don't understand how you want this to happen, it's literally impossible&&I'm interested to see them interact tbh. It's such an odd combo.&&Not gonna lie. I forgot that she was there. I only cared about Tony. &&It's gonna be really funny seeing him try to work the guardian's ship &&K&&No Garrus = No Clue&&Glenn Howerton would have played comic book Starlord really well but Pratt was good for the direction they took the character in the movies. &&What about SHAQ&&> Eureka

Suffered from some circular writing. It seemed like they didn't have a way to take the show anywhere in a real way because they never knew if they were doing the last season. Great show, but it could have been even better I think, (which is pretty much Sci-Fi originals in a nutshell.)&&[deleted]&&That last season of Burn Notice destroyed me. [When his mom died, especially after what happened with his brother](#spoiler) Fuck. I get teary-eyed just thinking about it. &&Phillips hue hue hue&&lmao&&Wow this needs to be in a comment pantheon. &&They've explained it's a very thin kevlar weave but yeah Batman is wearing bulletproof tights. &&Because you don't see him in the costume.&&Haha right. More like shitty super heroes given a huge budget with cameos from current stars (Godot, Affleck, Mamoa, etc.)&&The animated movie was pretty badass, I love most DC animated stuff.&&I'm pretty sure it's a show. But the point still stands&&>  Loki turned into a female horse and gave birth.

To Hel, a giant serpent that looped the earth, a wolf that ultimately would grow large enough to eat Odin whole, and an 8-legged horse that he gave to Odin. Dude had quadruplets.&&Loki once tied a rope around a Billy goat's beard and the other end around his junk to make a giantess laugh. Because the Gods killed her father because he was coming after Odin. Because Odin stole the mead that was made from his buddy from her Dad after he stole it from the dwarves who killed Odin's buddy and made him into mead because those dwarves killed that giant's (the giantess's father) father. 

Oh, and the giant the God's killed that lead to Loki's unfortunate game of strength was an eagle when they killed him. 

Nose mythology is the best kind of ludicrous.

&&""Her hero, how noble. Oh wait. You didn't stop JFK from getting assassinated or make sure Hitler stayed in art school. You saved your mommy. You missed her.

We need to see detective Batman on full display.&&TAA DAA&&I didn't realize he stuck it through his eye until years later. I thought he jammed it through his skull&&It’s... it’s gone! &&Shows him the memories and the sacrifices Peter has made. One of the big factors though is when Doc Ock came into Spider Man's strength he realized that Peter was going easy on him all these years, he realized how easily Peter could have killed him with his strength but he showed mercy every time&&If I remember correctly, he doesn't actually convince him, but instead Doc Ock sees all of Peter's memories after taking over his mind, and he learns from Peter's experiences and perspective that it is important to continue being Spider-Man.
&&[deleted]&&Loved him in young Justice because of that. He's a kid in adult body trying to be friends with teenagers who has no idea he's a kid. &&""I idolized you. I wanted to be you. Whenever I was out there, facing down the bad guys, I'd think, ""What would Superman do?"" Now I know.:""

Great episode. &&I blame magic&&The latter part of the New 52 run, it's definitely in book form. 

I love that you say that, too, because the first couple pages of the first issue was a bunch of robbers mocking Aquaman and then trying to run him over, only to obliterate when they hit him with their van.  And then the cops on the scene also mock him.  Literally everyone in that series mocks him, even as he basically makes the rest of the Justice League look like a bunch of pansies. &&It's vaguely reminiscent of Millar's *Superman: Red Son*.

If you haven't read that, first off: do. Second, it's an Elseworld where Superman lands in Russia rather than America and becomes a symbol for Communism. It's really well done.&&[deleted]&&Recently got my girlfriend into it. I was a bit worried because it’s targeted so much towards dorky guys that she might not like it very much, but she *loves* it. She’s already on board with Shazam based purely on Zach Levi’s casting. &&I don't think DC owned Captain Marvel at the time.  I forget which company owned him but they might not have been as big of a competitor as DC.  &&Hey man I know a billion useless things about Star Wars and Final Fantasy, he can know about comics history.&&Jesus, it's like an episode of Seinfeld. 
&&Right? It’s like the last pair-up I would have expected, and I love that. It’s hard to imagine what their interactions will be like - I could see them loving each other or hating each other

Really love the pair-up. Just very out of the box and exciting&&Forget about the ship. Tony is gonna rebuild Nebula to be a spaceship. &&That's Kazaam. He was already in the trailer in thst boombox in the background. &&Agreed. I rewatched it fairly recently, and it definitely shows that it *can* do unique stories/settings like when they went back in time to the 40s, but they rarely do. Whenever I think about the times that they made us think we were going to do something unique (to them at least) I'm reminded of that scene when Carter's excited that someone robbed. A bank. That is, I was let down, and really it's my fault anyway since I should have known better (though still one of my favorite episodes). &&Hell yeah! Do it!! I've got a huge list of TV shows and Movies so PM me if you wanna chat or need more recommendations! 

I rewatch psych once a year. Season 1-8... It just makes me happy. It's nostalgia for certain. It helps me feel less weighed down by life, school, my business, and I just smile.

Psych is a show I hope everyone sees at some point. It's nearly impossible to not just feel good watching it. It's ridiculous, fun, smart, and dramatic (at the right times).

Dulé Hill and James Roday legitimately seem like they've been lifelong best friends, as they're portrayed in the show.&&Like guardians of the galaxy but with the deuces from Wildcards. &&DC is the king of animated films imo&&The way you wrote that makes it seem like Hel is the serpent. Relax everyone, she's just a half dead girl that Odin said ""K, you can rule the people that are whole dead, but not quite cool enough for Valhalla""

And Sleipnir, the horse came from a separate incident where the Gods didn't want to owe a giant the sun and the moon and Freya's hand in marriage so Loki turned into a mare to seduce the giants badass stallion so he couldn't finish building their wall&&Now who's the villain?&&Man I’d fucking love to see the Flashpoint Paradox adapted to a live action film. &&That's very interesting. Thanks.&&He only sees Peter's memories after Peter shows them to him or something, it's been a while. I know Doc Ock didnt stumble into them himself. I remember after the memories were shown to him, Doc Ock was pleading with Peter to stay alive long enough to be able to switch bodies again&&It also made him perfect to be the last remaining example of a moral compass in the Injustice Universe Justice League.

Ya know, until IJ Superman melted his brainpan.&&I read the first few volumes, they thought so lowly of him. The authors knew they had to get it all out, 'he talks to fish' (I mean in some of his early comics he did), he couldn't possibly be strong (a king who can go fathoms below the sea without equipment has a tough body). I really hope they make Aqua man even more of a badass than they did in \*shutter* Justice League, so the jokes get retired.

I don't think the Sub mariner got that shit, so why does he?&&I agree.  I freaking loved Man of Steel.  Maybe it's just because I was less of a real DC fan back then so a lot of things didn't bother me as much as others.  I loved the action and the music specifically. &&I can still remember seeing it in theaters and the flight scene was so great.  I get that the movie isn't the best representation of comic Superman, but it had a nice Superman in it's own way.  The piano bit of Superman's theme is so great and again, the scene where he first flies is just so awesome.&&Fawcett Comics, and they had gone out of business by the time Marvel was created.&&Fawcett Comics&&Is FFXV worth playing?&&Like a Great Lakes Avengers movie. &&#WHO’S THE VILLAIN NOW, FLASH?&&WHAT DID YOU DO BARRY? WHAT DID YOU DO? &&The more I learn about Shazam, the more heartbreaking that moment is and the more I understand why AngryJoe was livid about it years ago.&&It's a drastic change for the series, and the story kinda falters in the end, but I did enjoy the general plot and the themes.&&I'm sorry.  Once we get to impactful statements from Reverse-Flash, I instantly go back to that meme.

Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky is working to bring back hand-drawn cartoons to big studio animated films,55546,8xshzz,http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-creator-of-samurai-jack-and-hotel-transylvania-wants-to-bring-back-old-school-animation,1739,1531251196.0,,"Didn't he spend like 5 years making a Popeye movie that Sony just casually cancelled right before release?

I'm 100&#37; down for more hand-drawn cartoons. 3D is good, but the stuff Studio Canal and Ghibli have been putting out in the last few years is much more visually-diverse and engaging.&&I hope he suceeds. While the uses for quality 3D animation are nearly endless traditional 2D animation does have a certain unique charm unmatched by it's 3D equivalent. &&I would do unspeakable things for an ending to Sym-Bionic Titan.&&Was really hoping Genndy would do an adaptation of the graphic novel Bone. &&i just miss Dexter's Lab :-(&&Japan’s doing it. Why not America?&&The only way I see this happening is if it's a Paperman style where it blends CGI and Traditional together. I believe this was attempted with Tangled and Moana but they found it too expensive to do the whole movie like that and so only choice sequences are a blend of traditional backgrounds and 3d models.&&Crud, you know what I'd love to see Tertakovsky do?

The *Boba Fett Movie*. You know, that *Star Wars* spin-off film Disney was talking about? While he understands animation (and deserves great credit there), he *also* seems to get the ideas of silence and atmosphere to a degree that I don't think a lot of modern directors look at. Take some of *Samurai Jack*'s scenes and make them live action, and you have something almost out of *The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly* or *Once Upon a Time in the West*.

Now make that *Star Wars* and about Boba Fett.&&It’s crazy how he made the 1812 Overture, Andrei Rublev, and Samurai Jack in his lifetime&&Hopefully he does more cartoons that creep into darker territory, like with S5 of Samurai Jack. I loved how they portrayed Jack's mental trauma as he argued with himself over what to do and how his ""shadow"" would question his real intentions. That combined with Jack actually showing real fear for his life (especially in the tomb scene) made it so much more relatable.&&Genndy is not the hero we deserve but the one we need.&&Oh dear, as much as I would **LOVE** to see a revival of 2D animation, companies will not go for it because it's too risky. I'm gonna update a previous comment of mine showing Disney's 2D animated movies since 2000 (top to bottom=newest release to oldest release).

According to this information, it's almost stupid *not* to make 3D movies.&&Samurai Jack season 5 last year took my breath away. As far as I could tell fans were hyped AF and lots of new ones came too. Glad he’s doing this!&&Good.

I miss 2D films.&&this is really up to the studios to decide, it makes financial sense you can bet they send it to the korean sweatshops and get it animated, it usually doesnt anymore though&&God that would be amazing. Tartakovsky is someone who seems to very much appreciate the older roots of animation. I'm still bummed we will never get to see his Popeye movie. &&I hope this takes off. 3D animation and 2D digitally rendered animation may be cleaner and crisper but they’re just missing something. All in all, I think hand-drawn animation is more aesthetically pleasing and just has that little extra attention to detail. &&Dexters lab movie.&&I'm so hyped for Gendy to bring back the glory of 2D animation but at the same time I'm just sad knowing that the movie will lose in the box office to some shite Illumination pump out :((&&I have a feeling 3D animation is going to end up looking dated soon. If Disney + others are looking for properties that last, 2D animation is the way to go. Steamboat Willie and other old-school cartoons still look fucking amazing today, I don't see 3D animation's staying as fresh for as long. Plus, many stories lend themselves to 2D animation and the beautiful story-book feel that comes with it. I'd also argue that there aren't many ways 3D animation can look while retaining its appeal, whereas 2D lends itself to all sorts of completely different art styles and visual directions and no one movie has to look like the next. 

I wish Mr. Tartakovsky success, but, let's be real, the studios are going to ALWAYS go with the less time-consuming, cheaper solution, and audiences seem perfectly happy devouring 3D animation every time. &&FUCK YES GENNDY&&Unlike some people I don't think handrawn is inherently better. To it depends on what type of atmosphere you want to build for the show. But certain animation could certainly benefit from it and others I feel like it wouldn't really contribute anything and would just waste time.

Btw if you're big hand drawn animation fan watch Redline if you haven't. &&This will end up just like the X Files. Everyone seems to be clamoring for it, but once it happens, everyone just realizes that they more enjoy the memory of it than the actual execution.&&I wish “hand drawn” and “cartoon “ weren’t always wrapped up together. I would absolutely love a western produced drawn animated movie geared towards pg13 or R rating. &&I would be fucking ecstatic if he could also get Sym-Bionic Titans brought back, maybe on Netflix. Shit was dope. &&Good 2D animation is still being made.&&While that is cool in theory, I also think he is one of the few mainstream Hollywood animation directors who has managed to bend and twist 3D animation to make the kind of visual gags that should only be possible in 2D. Honestly I think his 3D work is super impressive and groundbreaking.&&Disney tried this sometime ago and I’m not sure it was the success they wanted. The bottom line, whether 3-D or hand drawn is how good the story is. This was emphasized emphatically by Disney himself. While he wanted quality films, they would not work unless the story was engaging. Then you work on be physics and emotions during the drawing stages. &&I love his work. Hopefully someday he’ll get to make that cancelled Popeye movie.&&This man is one of the greats in my opinion and his work in the [Star Wars](https://youtu.be/ZXmdfbjhxqw) universe is criminaly underrated. Whenever I have a Star Wars marathon I always watch his animated series inbetween ep. 2 and 3&&Excellent! It sucks how everything is 3D now even though it’s great. There’s just no variety anymore. &&I would want nothing more than for this to succeed.&&One Genddy Legend of Zelda 2D hand-animated movie, please.&&I miss pen and ink disney movies.  They looked fucking beautiful.&&God i want to see symbiotic titan finished&&I... did not know Hotel Transylvania was done by him.

I might consider watching these now.
&&If you've never seen The Venture Brothers, I highly recommend it if you like traditional animation.

The series actually started when Mammoths still walked the icy plains but the show creators like taking their sweet ass time so technically they're coming out with season 7 next month.

I love this show so much. It's absurd but really well developed and they have great characters.

I grew up on cartoons. I'd get up at like 5:30 saturday morning to go plant myself in front of the TV. Back then, they'd play really old stuff until the new cartoons came on. The old Superman cartoons had great animation. Batman the animated series is based off the same deco noir style.

It seems like there is a really healthy market for proper animation but the studios don't like it because it's really expensive and takes a long time.

People who grew up on cartoons are adults now so there is a good way to cross market to different generations the same way Lego plays off nostalgia.&&To everyone interested, there is a hand drawn traditionally animated feature film coming out, it's called Klaus and it's done by SPA studios. There's a bunch of cool trailers of it online.&&so his animation style is gonna go back.. back to the past?&&I had amazing times in my childhood,
thanks to this dude. Hope he will have luck .&&so he makes Hotel Transylvania 3&&Where in the article does it say he's doing this? I read where he said 2d still has life and he wants to do a wide release but he doesn't mention drawing by hand, just 2d animation. Which to me means 2d computer animation and not old school pencil on paper drawings.&&I wish Mr. Tartakovsky  good luck on his goal. It's gonna be tough to bring 2D back.&&I really wish he had gotten to make his Dark Crystal flick&&Let's go Genndy!

Speaking of vets trying to revive hand drawn animation...whatever happened with Don Bluth and Dragon's Lair?&&Yes, yes, yes!&&I would love for him to be successful in his endeavors.  At this point 3d animation has no charm and lacks true talent.  There's a reason that there is no Don Bluth or Hayoa Miyazaki of 3d animation.  It's because anybody taught how to do it looks completely indistinguishable from another person also taught how to do it.  There isn't any artistry.  It's paint by numbers.  &&The lost art form...glad its still being talked about.&&As much as I'd love it, I don't see this being an easy battle. There's a reason why his new movie is in 3D, and Sony's next animated one is fake 2D.&&Will we finally get his Popeye movie? && Good for him, I love the look of hand-drawn animation. I like that anime hasn’t given up on it yet.

 Since the article mentions Hotel Transylvania 3, I have a question for anyone who might know the answer.  The kids have had me somewhat stunned, something about the animation looks AMAZING to me. Is there something new they’re doing? I think it’s that the lighting looks far better than I’m used to from animated movies but I’m not sure.  I don’t remember having this reaction to the previous films’ trailers. &&Please please do.&&MY MAN. Best news I've read this month. I have said for the longest time if I had money, one of the biggest things I'd like to do is fund a studio to bring back traditionally animated films. This pure CG look just doesn't compare at all.&&That image you used was horrifying &&We need some good 2D animated films in theaters. Hope it works out.&&Samurai Jack had some awesome animation that made for some badass scenes, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmkxsQnNujI). That scene and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhd8RfCqVg) from Secret of Kells is why I'll always prefer 2D animation.&&Hotel Transylvania 3 looks like fucking drivel, though.&&YESS!! 2D animated films are so timeless. Watched Hercules last week. Then saw a still from Shrek...&&There's a 2D animated film called Klaus that's in development.

Like Gendy, SPA studio is trying to bring 2D back to movie theatres, but I think their first flick is going to Netflix first.

Anyway, they're making a 2D animated film that looks like 3D CGI film, it's basically the opposite of the recent Peanuts movie that completely CG but sorta looked like 2D animated film.

[The results are amazing.](https://vimeo.com/thespastudios/klaus-teaser)&&Would love to see him take on a new star wars cartoon, loved his 2003 clone wars series. &&This conflicts me so much. I fucking love hand drawn 2D animation but doing my internship at an animation studio makes me not to want to do it on like my own projects. &&Apparently Adult Swim has unlocked every single episode of the show on their website. &&As a kid/young adult growing up I think my favorite cartoons were 2D.
I don't really understand how kids can't like them, as we grow up we draw with our hands in 2D. Hell, as babies we can't even identify in 3-dimensions lol

Lilo and Stitch, Lion King, Aladdin, Land before time, An American Tale, and others a like still hold up incredibly well.

Most cartoons are still 2-D, why don't they translate that to film?

On a side-note, I saw Incredibles 2 yesterday and the animation was so crisp. At one point I thought ""In a decade these films will look more real than reality""


&&This reminds me of when Disney tried to bring back hand drawn movies with The Princess and the Frog and after it failed tried to interpret it as people preferring 3D instead of the movie just not being that great.&&I love this idea in theory... I think it will flop big time. People want easy! It’s just easier to illustrate and design stuff via iPad or Tablet of your choice. &&Oh man. This guy is my hero. CGI is cool and all but nothing beats hand-drawn stuff in my book.&&To the guy that made Dexter’s Lab, Powerpuff Girls *and* Samurai Jack, please do whatever the hell you want to do.  You can do no wrong. &&That would be amazing. Traditional animation is an art of its own. &&I think they cancelled it in favor of The Emoji Movie iirc&&He made a short as a proof of concept, not an entire movie. &&check out the test footage for it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KatYTNRfHmY)&&I'm still salty of what happened to his Popeye movie. Especially since he was very passionate about the Popeye franchise and the Fleischers.&&Here's his Popeye animation test. Sorry if it's already been posted a bunch:

https://youtu.be/M1lzJuwJD9k&&Pretty sure they cancelled it for the Emoji Movie if I'm not mistaken....&&Genndy on Popeye sounds fucking badass. Sucks that it got cancelled.&&Thing is, it needs to be conceptually innovative and well written *also*. Studio Ghibli creates such interesting and creative worlds that are accentuated by the animation style. Samurai Jack also. 

I would love to see a resurgence in truly original, hand drawn animations, but if I've learned anything from the The Incredibles, (and I learned *everything* from the Incredibles), ""if everyone's special, then no one is"". &&For the record no, they just made that one test and it was shelved. It had been mostly written and boarded as I understand it, but it wasn't 5 years and it was never going to be released. And as bad as it sounds to have made that one teaser for nothing, studios make stuff like that all the time for stuff that doesn't come to fruition. This one just got leaked. &&I’m wondering if he actually means hand-drawn as opposed to 3D. Most cartoons are not completely hand-drawn these days. Original models and prototype test animation maybe, but 90% of it is done on computer nowadays.

See, when someone says “hand-drawn” cartoon, I think of like the original Snow White, where literally every single frame was done by hand. Not a handful of hand-drawn keyframes that get edited by software. To me it sounds like he wants to do things the *really* old school way. Which is rare these days and would certainly be awesome to see in a modern setting.

But then again, I can’t speak for the guy. Despite his relative obscurity as a cartoonist, Gennedy is a fucking awesome artist. He also did Powerpuff Girls, Cow and Chicken (pretty sure), and a host of other Cartoon Network shows from around the same time that we all remember fondly. He’s a gem for sure.&&bones too&&Tartakovsky's work is proof. 

The Hotel Transylvania movies are made with his 2D sensibilities, and at times it just looks weird in 3D. The quick jokes and actuons feel like overkill to me in CG ehen they're fine in 2D.&&I think one of the problems he will face is convincing executives that those animations will still produce the profits that 3D animated films are producing.  My 2 year old daughter loves Moana and Frozen, but she is bored stiff trying to watch hand drawn 2D animation. She actually gets upset if I put on a cartoon that isn’t incredibly rendered like Word Party or Secret Life of Pets have been rendered.  
She’s been spoiled and I don’t see her changing her mind until she’s old enough to start grasping story lines and dialog intricacies.&&I remember that when Tangled and The Princess and the Frog came out, Tangled outperformed TPATF, which is my guess for why Disney hasn’t bothered with 2D animation since&&Anime sometimes gets a bad rep, but you gotta hand it to Japan for sticking to the 2D. Your Name comes to mind as one of my more recent favorites, and is probably one of my all time favorite movies. I think Studio Ghibli is also a great example of that charm you’re talking about.&&One thing that I can't believe isn't being brought up more, 2D animation tends to take way longer to look dated. Like I can barely watch Toy Story and Monsters Inc anymore, even though they're great movies, just because they physically look so bad today. I mean not Butt-Ugly Martians bad, but they look laughable compared to Toy Story 3 and Monsters University. Compared to how Princess and the Frog looks besides Aladdin, with the age difference being about the same as between Toy Story and Toy Story 3.

Also traditional 2D movies don't seem to end with nearly as many superfluous dance parties as 3D animated movies do. IF YOUR MOVIE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MUSIC, IT DOESN'T NEED TO END WITH A DANCE PARTY. &&Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a hugely underrated film. It's absolutely fantastically animated with a great cast. Go watch it if you haven't yet&&3D animation is great but ages horribly. I can watch Snow White and still be blown away by the animation, while the original Incredibles looks dated already. &&3d also ages poorly because the quality of cgi constantly improves, whereas well done 2d animation is pretty timeless. Just look at any of those classic Disney or Ghibli films; they still look great.&&I think you will find that there are many people willing to make a similar pact.&&The worst part is knowing that the scripts for the next ten episodes are already complete. I NEED them.

God damn, I loved that show.&&That damn show quickly became my favorite show ever, what a punch to the gut that was.&&I'm still salty about that!&&Man, I would do unspeakable things just for a DVD release. 

Megas XLR, too, please. &&God that became my favorite show. It was so good then they just cut it... If you ever need a team to do those unspeakable things, I'm in. &&Sadly, that show is legally barred from coming back. Some tax thingy CN did.&&What sucks for me is that Lance from sym bionic titan went to my high school long before I ever went there, but my dad taught him. Heard he’s a pretty cool guy, but he hasn’t done anything nearly as high profile since it was cancelled &&Cartoon Movie Studios: ""Did you say TEEN TITANS GO!? OF COURSE WE'LL MAKE YOU A MOVIE FOR THAT!!""&&I love 2D shows, and everything Genndy has ever done.

 Nevertheless I admit the thing that gets the more ""FUCK YOU, DISNEY"" from me is the cancellation of the 3D show Tron Uprising right when the ""uprising"" actually began.

Seriously. &&[lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5ZJrPVEkkA)&&THIS. SO MUCH THIS. I NEED IT LIKE AN ALCOHOLIC NEEDS ALCOHOL. Much as I loved getting an ending to Samurai Jack after all the years since it's cancellation I would totally have traded it's continuation/conclusion for a Sym-Bio one. It's my favorite thing Genndy's ever done, it even beats out the Clone Wars miniseries for me.

With all the revivals of old shows that happen these days I feel like it shouldn't be an impossible feat to bring it back. I mean Genndy got the Samurai Jack revival, Netflix loves reviving cult classics, and I know several Genndy movies and shows have been/are on Netflix so he's gotta be able to at least get a foot in the door there right?

There were just so many things left unresolved, so many plotlines teased and foreshadowed that were never delved into in the depth that was clearly planned, so many world elements to explore in further depth, and so many more hilarious interactions for Octus to get into. 

&&Tell them to me baby 🤤&&As someone who never bothered touching it when it aired, are there any *legal* means of watching it online?&&SAME.&&Oh my god yes.&&Oh sweet lord, I only realized just now that this is all I ever wanted...&&Tighten up the last couple chapters so it actually builds to a climax instead of meandering around and we're golden.&&They tried doing that years ago, and Jeff Smith was clever enough to retain complete creative control (undoubtedly because, as an animator himself, he knew what was about to happen)

The rumour goes that he pulled the plug on his own movie when the studio wouldn't stop pestering him to add modern pop songs and musical numbers to the soundtrack&&There is actually an adaptation of Bone in the works at Warner Animation Group with Mark Osbourne attached as director. At least that's what they said in 2016. Mark Osbourne did Kung Fu Panda and The Little Prince.&&The old Dexters Lab&&Stahp stehpping On my booooouuuuhts. &&Dear sister. Will you please assist me. BY SHUTTING UP!&&Don't forget French animated films or any animated film from Europe.&&It also helps that countries like Japan and France have embraced animation as a type of general film making / story telling rather than just a singular genre for kids.&&[deleted]&&Best guess? Because 2D isn’t ‘cinematic’ enough for modern audiences to justify seeing in theaters. 3D does well with a sense of depth and scope, it *feels* bigger thus gets more of a have to see it in theaters effect.
    
Japan meanwhile I think is basically is parochial support of local works. And animation is one of their distinctive cultural works. So there is built in advantage like how Indian movies can thrive doing huge song and dance routines that are mostly dead in America.

Also money. Few anime films do big money (aka they aren’t all Your Name) compared to the American market so you budget accordingly If their market could sustain Hollywood budgets we might see a shift in style since they also looove our animated movies on occasion.&&Chinese are starting to do it. Check out 'kings avatar""&&Have you seen Treasure Planet? It's a ridiculously underrated Disney movie that flopped hard (even though it's excellent), and it used this technique quite a bit. &&>The only way I see this happening is if it's a Paperman style where it blends CGI and Traditional together.

there's a few projects out there that are doing this, mostly in japan - Blame!, Ajin, Godzilla; planet of monsters to name a few. in the states, we had the peanuts movie from a few years back(which was a REALLY good movie). 

and pretty much all animation has gone digital now. anime with a handful of exceptions is all digital now, as are american cartoons. though that's not quite what you're talking about, it's just digital version of traditional process. &&Explain if I'm wrong please, but if anime Studios can afford it I see no reason a big American production couldn't. Especially when it comes to features instead of TV shows, the animation is especially beautiful (ie most Makoto Shinkai films, Ufotable works, KyoAni).&&**Too expensive**

Man those companies really are frugal with their money. The amazing world of Gumball is a simple example where the sets are in 3D, the characters are hand drawn and they use vfx for color correction

And they are in their 6 season with 20+ episode per season. That’s literally more than 3 movies combine &&Sort of. With Moana they were going for a fluid, painterly look that ended up being unsuccessful - it was a progression from the Paperman style, but it wouldn’t have been the same thing. Tangled predates Paperman by years, so it wouldn’t have even been a consideration. However, it was originally intended to be a 2D animated film before switching to 3D. They kept legendary animator Glen Keane on from the failed 2D version (he was a key figure in its development) as the animation director. There’s documentary footage of his process for bringing hand-drawn appeal to 3D characters - he would basically draw over the 3D models and animation shots to help the modellers and animators improve their work. If you look at Disney’s 3D animation output, Tangled was a watershed moment and nothing’s been the same since. There are many reasons for this of course, but I think Glen made a small but significant contribution that helped keep that classic Disney magic alive in the characters.&&How the fuck do you pitch Terkakovsky for a *Star Wars* film without even mentioning he already has experience working on a *Star Wars* property? [This is basically what you want and this is why I want him to do something Jedi-focused only.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBKHB1Sffg) I want to see the Jedi's early Sith threats come to fruition via the mind and eyes of Genndy.&&To be fair, the slated director (before the apparent hiatus) was Mangold, who I think is also much better suited to this than most. Logan, Walk the Line, and 3:10 to Yuma all utilize principles of old Westerns quite well. I don't care about Boba Fett at all but his attachment had me excited.&&I loved his Clone Wars cartoon that led up to RotS. It was awesome though ridiculous, and I thought it did a better job portraying some characters than the movies themselves.&&I always wanted a hybrid of Star Wars with Lone Wolf and Cub....a wandering Jedi and child hiding on outer rim worlds post order 66. Gennedy would make such a great cartoon of live action series. &&Eh, Tomato, Tomahto, Tchaikovsky, Tartakovsky.&&Ah yes the scene where Jack rings the church bell for the first time right before the cannon crescendo - a true masterpiece. &&Don’t forget about Stalker and Solaris!&&I really wish he had the opportunity to do a full hour for the finale. It felt so rushed for something we were waiting over a decade for&&S5 of Samurai Jack gave me chills at times.&&He deserves more respect from other studios.&&He’s one of the few western animation auteurs, up there with eastern greats like Miyazaki and live-action greats like Kubrick and Kurosawa.

Disney etc would have spent much more per 3D movie than 2D on production (digital rendering costs way more, voice talents etc). Those 2D movies were made at the same time as many of those 3D movies, so the budget split wouldn't have been even.

Also, aren't those budgets just for production..? I dare say a big chunk of the ROI came from higher (unlisted) marketing costs too?&&If we get back legit cel-animation, the world would be just a little brighter to me.  Doesn’t have to be super widespread, I’d just want to see more animators and directors considering it as a legitimate technique to use and not as some outdated process.

Digital animation can be more efficient, cheaper, and allow for more density of imagery, but cel-animation, much like traditional film vs. digital film, has a grain and warmth that can’t be matched.  There’s a depth of color and organic quality that is sorely lacking in a lot of digital animation that I see today.  Besides, I’ve noticed that, instead of putting the money and time saved from digital back into the animation, it just gets pocketed usually, resulting in a cheaper-feeling product, anyway.  So, as with most things, cheaper and more efficient never necessarily equates to superior.

I’d love to see more champions of cel like there are champions of film like Nolan and Tarantino.&&Didn't they have a TV Movie as the originally series finale?&&Minion 3 coming 2022&&Something about 3D animation seems to have a tendency to kind of date itself. 

Like, watching, say, Snow White, or even something a bit later like Cinderella, you can tell the animation is older than, like, '90s Disney Renaissance stuff, but it doesn't seem as dated in comparison as Toy Story or even Shrek feels today in comparison to contemporary 3D animated movies.

The Incredibles is only 14 years old, and a lot of people were commenting on how radically different the animation looked, due to tech improvements, in the recently released sequel.

This is just, like, my opinion, man. And it could be generational, since I was like 6 when Toy Story came out and have kind of witnessed 3D animated feature films come into being and evolve during my lifetime.

But imo, Toy Story looks more dated in comparison to, say, Inside Out, than Sleeping Beauty looks in comparison to something from the '90s like Aladdin or Pocahontas.

Even though there were big tech improvements, and '90s animation has some computer animation involved and looks glossier in some ways, Shrek seems to look more dated to the modern eye than mid-20th century Disney stuff looked in the '90s and 2000s.

Again, this could be generational, since I grew up watching both old Disney movies and Disney Renaissance films from a young age, but was older when 3D animation started being a thing. Maybe little kids just don't notice or care if the animation looks ""old"" as long as the movie's good.&&3D animation looks dated faster because it's still a relatively new type of animation and as such the technology used to create it is advancing all the time. Whereas there isn't really much more you can do to 2D animation that hasn't already been done. &&Please check out any of the cartoons by Fleischer Studios. They deserve more love.&&I really respect the guy.&&Castlevania on Netflix. And a few of DC's direct to video movies like Justice League Dark.&&Hey, you still gotta pay the bills.&&Man's gotta eat.

And some people's gotta rule 34 Mavis.&&oh gosh now im even MORE mad&&This isn't quite true. If an old blind item is to be believed, they had no idea how to update Popeye to a modern audience and sensibility, so it was never actually greenlit. There's a concept video for the animation style but no script.&&Holy shit that's criminal.&&reason 87 for why i stopped supporting sony&&That’s fact, sadly.&&Yep

But no, fuck over everyone that slaved over it and everyone that would want to see it for corporate interest in a movie about fucking emojis&&Good god. Why??&&And it was amazing!&&The guy voicing Popeye is the same person who voices Spongebob I'm 96% sure.&&What the fuck is that yellow teleporting thing? I don't remember that from Popeye.&&The last popeye movie I saw was the live action one made in the 70's.  I'm not sure how you could translate that to current times.&&In an interview, he was saying that he wants to do animation with wacky motion like the old stuff, and Popeye would be perfect for that.&&If we wait any longer for a Popeye movie to come out, the one who's going to be really pissed is Popeye. Do you know what the spinach prices are like these days? (Price has increase 21.7&#37; in the past year alone according to [https://www.tridge.com/intelligences/spinach/hs-code](https://www.tridge.com/intelligences/spinach/hs-code) ) &&The first Hotel Transylvania had a really beautiful sequence about Dracula's past. &&Don't forget his Popeye project from years ago that never went anywhere.&&Yeah, actually, I feel like hand drawn animation has much more versatility to it.  In addition to the ultra-flat, highly stylistic work of Samurai Jack, you can also achieve super fluid, near 3D movement with works like Akira (which was actually accused of being rotoscope because everything is so on-model and smooth), and everything in-between.

Something as frenetic and dense as FLCL just would not work as well in 3D, not to mention the fact that it would be *far* more expensive.

I’m glad at least someone still seems to care about hand drawn animation, because (as much as I love movies like Up and How To Train Your Dragon) I’m just tired of only ever seeing CG animated films anymore.  Now if we can just revive cels as a viable technique instead of only ever seeing digital dominate the medium.&&How do you exist in real life? Do you walk around saying things like this to other people ? What is their reaction? &&That's pretty depressing to read, to be honest. I know mediums come and go, but the idea of a generation just completely not wanting 2D animation is upsetting as someone who grew up on those cartoons. 

And I'm not even that far removed from that generation! I'm 27. The idea that it could be lost within essentially 20 years of me growing up on it is worrying.

EDIT: This is by far the most amount of replies a comment of mine has gotten... &&Your kid is 2 and enjoys consistency in media forms. If you put on a 3D cartoon for her, that's what she likes. If you put on a 2D cartoon for her after that's something different and she isn't going to look at it the same as the 3D films you introduced her too. Obviously the kids grow out of this pretty quickly because they are trying to gather as much information as they can because that's what kids do. Preferences change and eventually they'll be interested in Ghibli as well as Pixar.&&My daughter loves peppa pig. And it doesn't get anymore cheaply drawn than that lol. &&Man, that's hard to grasp. 2D animated films can be so incredibly gorgeous, while a big chunk of 3D films all look boringly identical. Maybe its more about not wanting to try new things than how they actually look? I know I was like that as a kid.&&Well there is cuphead. Maybe the popularity of that game will make the convincing easier. Handdrawn animation that is well done can look beautiful. Not necessarily the Saturday morning cartoons though.&&Didn't Disney try bringing back 2D with Princess and the Frog but they didn't generate enough profit to continue other 2D films. I love Princess and the Frog, it had great character movement.&&Show her Tom and Jerry. &&I don't blame her. 3D animation is popular not only because it can be very pretty when done right, not just because it's cost effective, but because it's colorful and it ""pops"". Of course she prefers it instead of traditional animation. Most traditional animation uses darker colors and doesn't pop as well as say, Minions. That's why Minions are a huge money maker- because kids love them because they are colorful and silly, want their toys, and are relatively inoffensive, so soccer moms like it as well.&&If she doesn't like a Studio Ghibi film i'm afraid something might wrong with her and a psychiatrist could be needed.&&I used to be similar as a kid, except with 2D animation. My parents would ask if I wanted to watch a show and my first question was “is it a cartoon?” If they said no most of the time I would pass. I’m sure she’ll grow out of it&&Disney gave a final shot with a hand-drawn film called ""Winnie The Pooh"" in 2011 which flopped. After that, they switched to CGI. &&Honestly, as someone who wasnt paying attention to either movie at the time of release, I didnt even realize Princess and the Frog was a Disney movie. The marketing push just wasnt there. I thought it was a different studio making it, like Fox or something.&&Modern anime takes a lot of shortcuts though, and that includes using 3D animation, usually to animate vehicles. Or those stunning backgrounds in movies like 5 Centimeters Per Second and Your Name were traced from photos. (Though both are still very impressive movies).Then we got that abomination of Berserk 2016...

On the other hand movies like Akira still take my breath away on the level of purely hand drawn detail. &&It helps CGI and anime traditionally hasn't worked in the past without some really bad results around 90% of the time.&&I really love and miss the art style anime had back in the 80's.&&Dude the Disney from the early-mid 1900s still looks great. It's made me so depressed watching such an incredible medium with so much creative opportunity fade out in favour of the samey 3D shit that every big animation studio does these days.

At least Laika still exists to give us fantastic stop motion in big western films. I can't really think of anything else besides them.&&The first toy story is dated visually, the second is far far better. &&And Winnie The Pooh (2011) has a few laugh of loud moments.&&Like Me!&&I can barely remember that show but it seemed so neat that I was compelled to sit down and wait for the next episode.

Because that and Sym-Bionic Titan are *Never Ever Coming Back.* (Which is sad.)

When most shows get canceled, as they did, who ever has the rights still keeps them. They can be traded and sold etc, which puts them in this weird limbo of 'Reruns' 'could be brought back' and 'DVDs and Merch can be made'

But both Megas XLR and Sym-Bionic Titan were written-off for tax reasons. Which means Cartoon Network has relequished the rights and licences and there for cannot do anything with it even if they wanted to.

Someone may be able to pick up the rights at some point, but the investment is probably *way* to much.&&Your welcome. You will now live a sadder life like me.

France might be our next global source of quality animation (From a technical if not writing standpoint) I watch that Wakfu thing on netflix and while it was kinda inconsistent writing wise (first and second season can't seem to decide what age the audience is) the third season just goes balls out. Gorgeous animation, good writing, good sound design, lots of weight behind the motions, interesting plot and a dark, downer ending that is also a cliffhanger [Effectively the villain of that season was actually a future time-clone of the main character that was accidentally created and given his own separate sentience from the main character due to misuse of some magic artifacts from a previous season, felt neglected by his creator because he was doomed to wink out of existence because of all the timey-wimey fuckery, and went around recruiting a bunch of bastard offspring of the Gods in order to KILL EVERYONES GODS and replace them, but accidentally fucked it up and ended up condesning the universe down into a singularity while the main cast just barely escaped to what amounts to their version of Heaven](#spoiler) I mean Jesus Christ that's some heavy shit. And that's not including the [psycho green deadpool lady who tried to throw a pregnant woman and her son into a portal to Hell, or when the big bad accidentally aborted an entire building full of animal fetuses in his attempt to kill the main characters](#spoiler)&&Exactly. Honestly, I’d love a fully 2-D animated theatrical movie of Teen Titans. Or any Marvel/DC IP of that matter. Just imagine: a Marvel Cinematic Animated Universe targeted towards the same demographic as the MCU.&&During the 1970's, American and Canadian were in an experimental period with animation by making adult oriented animated films. Most were X-Rated while some were R. Helps that the Underground period was at it's peak during that era. &&Europe has something similar but not to the extent as Japan.&&I had a falling out with western animation in recent years, cause of things like every western animation especially for adults has to be a comedy for some stupid reason. Now don't get me wrong I love shows like Rick and Morty, South Park, and some of the classics like King of the hill and old school Simpsons. Now granted we do have stuff like Castlevania which is an adult cartoon that is action focus and I have heard things about Bojack Horsemen like it being more of a drama then comedy at least in recent seasons, so hopefully things might be getting better there.

But yeah with Anime since becoming a big fan of it back in late elementary, I feel like I have had seen a much larger variety like I have seen not just fantastic comedy anime's like Konosuba, but great romance series like Clannad, and action series like Hunter x Hunter. and just weird and straight up fucked up series like Devilman Crybaby whose last 3 episodes had me on the verge of tears. &&My Red Blood Cell can't be this cute XD&&What you're thinking of is Deep Canvas, which was used on Treasure Planet and Tarzan. I believe ItsADeparture is referring to Meander, which wasn't developed until 2010 and was used in the Paperman short.&&Don't forget DisneyToon Studio's Winnie The Pooh films made in the early to mid 2000's&&Not Disney, but didn't Titan A.E. do that too?  Genuinely good sci-fi, that movie.&&Disney killed Treasure Planet on purpose though.&&I heard that it was mostly due to bad marketing but I could be wrong here.

I want it to be a western-samurai mashup since Obi Wan is essentially a Ronan samurai at this point on a planet that's a desert full of bandits, dangerous locals, and a military that betrayed him. It has all of the elements to be great for both as he has to keep his true nature a secret, lest he reveal himself to the Empire, but keep Luke safe, stay alive, and probably try to help some of the locals since he's a good guy like that. But all with little to no use of his lightsaber.

Maybe even that scene where the reluctant hero has to put aside himself for the greater good and take up the weapon he never wanted to yield for one quick blade-draw-style lightsaber move

God *damn* I want that. &&Because that's animated, and pitching it like that is just going to make people think ""animation."" Yes, he's worked with *Star Wars* before, and done a great job. But I don't want a retread of what he's done before just with Boba Fett. I was speaking of live action but with Tartakovsky's sensibilities and approaches.

[Something more like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QML28YQBvyc), which Tartakovsky has already done in animation, but live action, set in the *Star Wars* universe.&&I KNEW this was Samurai Jack-like! &&That’s a good scene, but the Mace Windu epic destruction of the droid army scene is the best thing from that whole cartoon

<cries a little>
&&It’s not really an opinion though. 3D animation has objectively gotten better with technology (Toy Story v Toy Story 3) and older 2D stuff does basically look as good as 90s and onward 2D stuff (maybe just a little clearer/smoother in terms of lines and animation techniques). 

I think 3D animation from this decade won’t age that much since everything already looks as real as you can get... just look at The Good Dinosaur and Piper. &&I completely agree. Even old 2D animation with dated 3D animation incorporated into it can still look fantastic decades later. [The clock tower scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyJBTuAehBA) from Great Mouse Detective came out over 30 years ago and still looks fantastic. The same can't be said for a lot of your early 2000 3D Dreamwork films.&&> This is just, like, my opinion, man.

Especially considering what it was canned for.&&Im only 21 and I loved watching Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry growing up. I did like some of the 3D stuff like Jimmy Neutron back in the earlier days of 3D, but even cartoons like Spongebob or AATL were competing and winning over 3D just a few years ago. And its only been 10 years since the last AATL episode or maybe 7 or 8 before sponge bob started going to shit.&&I'm 28, and feel the same way. However, that person's kid is only two years old. Kids that age have limited screen time, perceptual systems that are still developing, more limited grasp of storytelling, and all that jazz.

Plus, it's not like 2D animation is totally, completely, 100&#37; dead. We see far fewer big-budget, well known 2D animated feature films these days.

But, they still do 2D animation for kids' TV shows. I know Adventure Time isn't super new anymore, and is close to ending after like 8 or 9 seasons, but I mean, my nieces (3 and 6) love it, the My Little Pony cartoon, and other 2D shows, just as much as they like the 3D ones.&&At least there will always be the anime ~~nerds~~ connoisseurs.

But seriously Japanese animation is a bastion for well-crafted 2D animation, and will probably continue to play that role for the foreseeable future. A big part of this is that a great deal of their animation are adapted directly from their comics (manga). So when your source material is already exclusively 2D, it makes more sense to make the adaptation in 2D as well in order to better align with the art style rather than complicate things and deal with imagining a 2D character's stylized facial proportions into a sensical 3D object.

Like look at [Violet Evergarden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CJeDetA45Q) that came out this year: this was a TV show, not even a movie. Ofc not every TV show has this quality of animation, but at the same time many do approach very high production values, and certainly have a lot of time and effort put into their aesthetics.

It's a shame that so much of western animation is dominated by Disney. They shoulder a lot of the responsibility for creating the paradigm that cartoons are for kids, as well as taking the axe to 2D animation because whatever Disney declares becomes the norm in big budget animation.&&I wouldn't worry. 2D is going to stick around on TV. It's simply too versatile compared to 3D. 

The whole reason 2D films failed in the US is because Pixar was on a 12 year winning streak while Disney was floundering. That's the only real reason. If Disney had kept up the quality, 2D would be fine. 

As an example, look at Japan. 2D is king there, and 3D films in Japan aren't even worth talking about 90% of the time. It's because Ghibli and other 2D studios kept up the quality and put out popular product. &&I really think the way to get 2D to come back at this point is for a studio to try their hand in 2D animating, and releasing, a quality film in theaters...and one that's also an R-rated film, or at least PG-13. 

I say this because the R-genre, especially with movies like *Deadpool*, *Django Unchained*, and *Logan*, has seen a resurgence lately. With the right story idea, and marketing towards an adult audience (rather than towards children or families), I think that a 2D animated film, if good quality, would do very well. We've also seen an interest in ""adult animation"" with shows like *Rick and Morty*, *South Park*, *Bojack Horseman*, *The Boondocks*, etc.

Genndy's last season of *Samurai Jack*, and the buzz surrounding it, after all, was primarily due to adult audiences, who had grown up watching the series as children, taking a large interest in it. With the right premise, an R-rated / PG-13-rated *Samurai Jack* stand-alone animated film could also potentially do well.

Once, back in the 70's, an animator by the name of [Ralph Bakshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bakshi) made a well-known, and X-rated, cartoon for adults titled *Fritz the Cat* (1972). It also addressed political, cultural, and social issues of the time, and was a huge financial success.

> The film stars Fritz (voiced by Skip Hinnant), an anthropomorphic cat in mid-1960s New York City, who explores the ideals of hedonism and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement, and left- and right-wing politics.

> The film had a troubled production history, and controversial release. Crumb, one of the creators, had disagreements with the filmmakers over the film's political content. 

> *Fritz the Cat* was controversial for its rating and content, which many viewers at the time found to be offensive. It was produced on a budget of $700,000 (~$4.2 million in 2018), and grossed over $90 million (~$536 million in 2018) worldwide. 

> Its success led to a slew of other X-rated animated films and a sequel, *The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat* (1974), made without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement. (Wikipedia)

Get Ralph Bakshi back in the planning and directing of an R-rated, 2D animated film, with a *good* premise, and I can guarantee the film will likely be a hit with adult audiences. Bakshi himself has been looking to get back into the animation industry since 2013, and successfully released a movie in 2015 funded entirely through Kickstarter (*[Last Days of Coney Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSPmqLQA3SA)*). 

Bakshi was able to make the 22-minute-film with about ~$175,000 of funding. If we extend that to, say, a 140-minute film, Bakshi could probably make it for about ~$1.3 million. If released in theaters, it could easily make back its budget and then some for whatever Hollywood studio wanted to finance, and distribute, the movie. 

As for potential premises? I could see the DCEU (which already produces quality animated films) potentially being salvaged this way on the big screen in the future, and reworked, to become a series of R-rated, darker, 2D animated films. This could also fill a nice niche, and provide a *very* different approach from, and opposite foil for, Marvel's live-action superhero films. 

I think that Batman, and maybe even Teen Titans or Nightwing, would probably be best served by this change, in the same vein of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Using Teen Titans in particular, in 2D animation, but adapted for an adult audience, I feel would also draw in a lot of old fans of the original TV series. Darker aspects of the *Teen Titans* comic book series could also be explored this way, as well as ""modernize"" the content to reflect the modern political atmosphere in the US.

With Bakshi at the helm, and at least* allowed a lot of creative control, we could get what Bakshi had originally planned for *Cool World* (1992), but with the Batman / DCEU universe. Bakshi is also very good at addressing political content in an artful way in his animated features, which I feel could also fit in quite well with the DCEU / Batman themes, lore, and comic book arcs.&&Regardless of my attachment to 2D animation, the idea that a kid is like “this 2d stuff doesn’t look as good” make me irrationally annoyed. No kid your taste is just shitty little kid taste if you think Sleeping Beauty isn’t a gorgeously animated movie &&The problem is that shit can be so bright and shiny and that’s what kids love. So when they are really young they only want to watch 3D animated movies. You put on an old hand drawn movie and it looks dull to them and they lose interest fast. &&My 3 year old doesn't care....

When you’re born with smart tablet graphics in your hands, they view some of our generations cartoons as just plain remedial. When I was growing up, Cartoon Network would still play cartoons from the 40s-70s on their late night program before they had adult swim and boomerang was its own entity.  Saturday morning, after the main line up, they would play the 80s cartoons like transformers and pup named Scooby-Doo and I noticed the upgrade in quality and appreciated yet. I try to watch cartoons with them today and I find that I gravitate towards the 2d stuff like Adventure Time versus the super rendered 3D toons or this new trend of just wonky looking shapes and characters with nonstop dumb lines.  I dont wanna be that guy saying “in my time” or “kids these days”, just wanna state my opinion here that in the few times I catch Cartoon Network with the little ones, its become this bells and whistles non stop strobe light channel and it seems like it’s catering for the new attention span that doesn’t last more than three seconds.....were we the same way?&&I think the problem is that 2D animation only shows up on TV while 3D animation is used exclusively in movies. It gives the impression that 2D is cheap stuff you watch for free or online and 3D is the spectacle you pay extra to see. &&Totoro is actually the only 2d animation she will watch and it’s cause she thinks he’s a big cat..

She calls him “T-row T-row” (This being said, I had to fast forward to the first time he appears in the movie to get her familiar with him even existing because he doesn’t appear for like 30 minutes into the movie.)&&It is all I can do to keep my 5 yo from ""jumping in muddy puddles"".&&I feel sorry for you, I really hate George's crying voice.&&[This is actually kinda funny though.](https://youtu.be/jil0WCh_UoQ)&&I'm glad the game made more people interested in Fleischer Studios.&&In this day and age?

Most of his work is average at best.&&This would be how they compete with mcu. They might not make as much at first but you can really go places with it. I think the American audience would have no problem with it. It is the out of touch studio executives that think it will fail.

They would have to ditch their classic art style ( you know, the kind that the fAmous Batman show from the 90s had). I can see why it might upset some, but I also know people put off by the art style. A complete character redisign (within the realm of how they are supposed to look of course) and have each movie build on the last. Maybe when it starts, Batman just has an outfit that is mostly a light weight material. Kind of like 60s Batman meets the style of modern times. Only when Batman is faced with a tougher opponent a few movies later do we see him begin to wear outfits with a bit more armor on them. Bad guys introduced need to be complete surprises, and the storylines need to be new. Just my take. Feel free to bash me.&&>I’d love a fully 2-D animated theatrical movie of Teen Titans

I'm with you: God *damn* I want that.&&So you want one of the most renowned animators in the world to direct a live-action film instead of an animated one?&&Ringing the church bell is from Andrei Rublev, a movie by Tarkovsky.

I’d love to see some high quality 2d animated films.&&I think he meant hand-drawn animation not 2D animated films using flash.&&Adventure Time is in no way an advertisement for 2D, and neither are most new TV shows. 

Yeah, they are 2D, but they are not hand drawn, so all the deficiencies of cheap computer animation are there. The whole thing is profoundly affected by the fact that it is computer animated, character designs, character movement, etc. 

Give it another two decades and it won't even be possible to do proper animation anymore as there will be nobody alive who knows how to draw...&&To be fair, you have to have a certain level of intelligence to understand 2D animation &&CG and 3D animation have been slowly creeping into the anime world as well. Particularly the 3D is in a lot of younger children's shows in Japan, and CG is frequently used in the more mature set as a way to cut costs, even though the end result is usually terrible (see: Berserk).

I'm worried that by the time I have children there won't be many contemporary shows that are using hand drawings anymore.
&&You mentioned Violet Evergarden only being a tv show. Good news! Violet Evergarden has a feature film being made and will be released simultaneously worldwide in 2020. &&It also doesn't help that when Disney *did* try doing another big budget 2D film (Princess and the Frog), critics and audiences shit all over it.  


While you're not wrong about the Pixar streak, audiences are also to blame for not giving Princess and the Frog more support at the Box Office and in reviews.&&I'm still sad that Winnie The Pooh 2011 is also their last hand-drawn animated film for a while.&&I think another reason might have been the competition from the other studios. If I can remember correctly, by the time Disney finished their 90s winning streak, the public was just getting kinda tired of their clean family friendly image and wanted something new and edgier(while still appealing to everyone). Once Shrek came out, then literally everyone wouldn’t shut up about it. The parents liked how they took all the cliches they knew and flipped them on their head, and the kids loved all the bright colors, references, and poop jokes. Because of this, other major studios took notice and decided to start their own CG animated studios that could make the same types of movies that Dreamworks was making, and turning each successful and positively received one into massive merchandising franchises.&&The problem isn't 3D vs 2D, it's CG vs hand drawn. 

Hand drawn will always be 2D, but not all 2D is hand drawn. And hand drawn is where the real high art of animation is. 

Almost all TV shows are 2D and CG. And absolutely horrible as a result. &&I wish we had more people in animation like Bakshi who takes risks on having animation taken more seriously and not just kids stuff.&&I'd be fine with a 2D-animated film aimed at an older audience if it was actually clever (like *Isle of Dogs*) and not just a fourteen year-old's idea of ""adult (like *Sausage Party*).&&Fun fact: Disney actually did approach Bakshi at one point in the late 70’s. Their animation department was desperate for a hit and, after getting the rights to *The Chronicles of Prydain* they asked if Bakshi would be interested in getting involved based on his success with *Wizards* and *Lord of the Rings* (contrary to popular belief, both films turned a decent profit).

Bakshi declined, saying their studio was too different from how he was used to working, and Disney went on make the series into *The Black Cauldron* (it has its fans, but is definitely the outcast among the Disney family)&&My dude, that ballroom scene blew my little kid mind when I saw that.&&I'm fairly certain Sleeping Beauty is what influenced my taste in animation. It didn't surprise me when I found out later that one of my favorite animators (Don Bluth) was heavily influenced by their work on that movie.&&r/KidsAreFuckingStupid&&Haha. Welcome to growing up.  I think adults have been experiencing this forever in whatever mediums exist. 

Kids just don’t have the mental tools yet to really distinguish between quality and crap.  

I remember loving watching ducktails, chip n dale, tiny toons, and animaniacs, just as much as the old TMNT cartoon, the Saturday morning Sonic the Hedgehog (the really bad one), and Jem. There is a HUGE range of quality in those looking back, but hell if I noticed as a kid.  

Nostalgia will get you to go back and rewatch some beloved kids show, but then your adult tastes will kick in and the cringe factor over the awful animation, cheesy voice acting, inconsistent coloring of the ninja turtles masks, and other random horrors take you out of it.  We all loved things as kids that our parents probably thought was absolute crap.  
And they weren’t always wrong.  &&>No kid your taste is just shitty little kid taste

You can think of Meander as the evolution of this technology, allowing hand drawn tweening on fully animated digital characters.

Titan A.E. was a great movie but also an infamous flop.

Many animators are freelancers, often getting paid by the frame.&&One of the biggest crimes of the CGI Clone Wars TV show was that they ignored the precedent of Greivous and replicated the movie version with little explanation. &&His version of Grievous is hands down the best.

If you (or anyone else reading this comment) haven’t seen it then I highly recommend it no matter what age you are. Great show although I wish there were more than 3 seasons to tie up some loose ends and whatnot but I like how it ended. The sequel Legend of Korra is great too, just not as good as ATLA imo because it’s targeted more towards teens so it has that romantic drama element and teen angst feel about the whole show, but it’s still very good. &&I remember hearing of Netflix doing a 2D animated film called ""Claus"" planned to premier on the site in 2019. Test footage has been available for a while now. &&There's a loooot of beautifully done 2D animation happening in the east, namely Japan, just not very much done in the west. There are of course exceptions but it's interesting that the majority of western shows and movies are 3D while it's the opposite over there.&&Except you can still ""hand-draw"" animation in Flash, it's just that there's very visually evident tools in flash animations like motion tweening that make it obvious it was done in Flash.   
&&Last major western cartoon to use hand drawn cells was Ed Edd n Eddy. But there's still been plenty of really great and beautiful 2D animation since then.&&> even though the end result is usually terrible

Actually, it's only terrible when done terribly. It's used in a shitload of shows, and especially for mecha styled shows, it's used to supplement very complex robotics and their movements, which is both incredibly expensive and time consuming (main reason for high cost) to keep quality in movement/transformation scenes. 

Most likely there is 3D in anime you love, and you never even noticed.

CG is as it always was, it's only noticed in either cases where it's pure CG or where bad CG is used (not mutually exclusive). Good CG you'll never even know was there. &&I could be way off.. but haven't pretty much all animated shows (western or Japanese) for a good ten to twenty years been done primarily on computer?

It blends 2D with 3DCG almost perfectly. Plus the story is 10/10.&&At least the Princess and the Frog is getting more positive reception since it's original release. But that's not saying much.&&I supported it : / I really liked the Princess and the Frog. &&Princess and the Frog was the victim of being released the week before James Cameron's Avatar, which dominated the box office for weeks after.&&I think part of the reason *The Princess and the Frog* wasn't a big hit like Disney wanted it to be is because they advertised it as a typical Disney princess film, as opposed to the slapstick comedies *Tangled* and *Frozen* were marketed as, and thus a lot of young boys weren't interested in seeing it because the Disney Princess franchise has always been marketed to little girls.

Similarly, I think part of the reason *Winnie the Pooh* flopped, as well as being released on the same weekend as the last *Harry Potter* film, was because Pooh has been marketed towards preschoolers for such a long time.

I feel like if Disney had made a 2D-animated film with a really epic and mature feel, something similar to *The Lion King*, *The Hunchback of Notre Dame*, and *Mulan*, it would have been more successful.&&This. Disney tried to keep 2D films chugging along, but when they pivoted back to it after releasing a few 3D films, audiences and critics apparently didn't want it. &&There’s nothing out there quite like the films he made in the 70’s. He was famous for not even using storyboards and just sort of “feeling” his way through the movie. Does this result in disjointed plots and sometimes nonsensical developments? Oh yes. But there’s also so much raw energy and passion in them; as if Denny Dent were the animator.&&There's a Japanese animated film made in 1978 (By Sanrio of all people) called [""Chirin No Suzu"" (Ringing Bell)](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/chirin_no_suzu_2758.jpg) despite the art style and appearing to be aimed at a family audience. Is surprisingly a mature film, since it's about a lamb seeking revenge against a wolf that killed his mother. And that's all I'm going to say since I'm not going to spoil the rest of the film.

It's a rare film that has a surprisingly mature story despite being aimed at children and the family audience. Check that film out when you get a chance. It deserves more word of mouth.


Also don't let the art style fool you. This isn't a typical children's film.&&That's pretty cool! And Bakshi typically does like to have a strong leadership and overseeing role on any animated projects he's involved in. After what happened with *Cool World*, and executives turning Bakshi's original vision into a terrible movie, I can see why.&&And the transformation scene in Pinocchio still gives me chills.&&Still does today. Never mind more recent stuff like Princess and the Frog, Secret of Kells, or any number of Japanese anime films.

The first one was charming because it had Genndy's touch all over it, the second one just feels like Genndy made himself comfortable, and the third one is where he went full on *Señor Burns* and decided to make it ridiculously stupid. &&Lucas was blowing like 2-3 mil per episode out of pocket. The dude genuinely loved that show. Also what a fantastic production team they had for The Clone Wars.&&Oh, you don’t have to tell me, I’m watching the shit out of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventures right now.&&The problem I have with anime being the last bastion of 2D animation is that 90% of anime is just garbage. Sure, interesting things (like JoJo) exist, but the corporate machine makes the majority of it absolute dreck. 

Take, for example, Gate. I tried watching it because the premise was super cool (a portal opens up from our modern day to a stereotypical fantasy world with elves, mages, and dragons. Culture/tech clash ensues), but it quickly devolved into harem fan-service awfulness. 

I heard that the majority of the money is made by selling merch, and sex sells, but if I wanted to watch porn I'd go watch porn. Besides, many people/companies have proven that genuinely good cartoons are profitable on their own, while the merch pretty much sells itself (see: DuckTales, Rick and Morty, etc.)&&Modern day Arthur exhibits the tweening you’re referring to. I loved the hand-drawn episodes as a kid. The newer episodes are done in flash and it is extremely jarring when they play old re-runs back to back against the new animation style. &&It's interesting how [good vs bad CG in film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bL6hp8BKB24) is so alike, yet so different to [the same debate in anime.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVQkwbhmuqQ)&&I'm assuming they use tools like tablets and the wacom cintiq. I think they still ""hand draw"" the stuff even if it's digitized. But I'm not an expert either so this is just my assumption.&&They use digital animation techniques to make their animation look 2D, but in reality there's layers upon layers of different animation types all combined digitally (at least in most shows). Some stuff is truly hand drawn, other stuff is drawn digitally some shows are fully 3D but hide it with a lot of clever tricks, some are 3D and just look bad.

So really, it depends, but I can't think of anything out now that is fully hand drawn animation (aside from maybe a couple movies). &&Yeah, old school cel animation died out in anime in the early 2000s. &&I enjoyed it as well. Dr. Facilier is easily one of the best Disney villains (and Friends on the Other Side is up there with Be Prepared and Poor Unfortunate Souls as one of the best Disney Villain songs, IMO).&&I feel the same way about the boner scene in The Little Mermaid.&&Your Name is beautiful. Same goes for Wolf Children and The Girl who Leapt Through Time.&&Alright im gonna go watch Redline again.&&I know it wasn't hand drawn, but the animation quality in Fate/Stay Night absolutely blows my fucking mind. 

I can't imagine what the budget was. &&Redline is literally the most well animated movie I have ever seen. Non stop action that is so incredible to behold!


I just finished Your Name today, and that was absolutely gorgeous as well. &&Redline. Now that's an insanely well animated film.&&literally anything satoshi kon touched&&They might just mean the characters. In the behind the scenes they seem to use the 3D room environment as a kind of background plate, and animated by hand a perspective grid that matched the middle of the floor as closely as possibly, and drew the characters off of that to maintain perspective since the ""camera"" moves around so much and can mess with their proportions relative to it.&&Hopefully well; I donated towards it a couple of years ago.

Even if it doesn't end up happening (Don Bluth is pretty damn old by all regards), at least I got a snazzy Secret of NIMH poster signed by Bluth and Gary Goldman for donating.&&He's currently starting up a university, so that may be why we haven't heard about it in a while.&&Hahaha.  I still hold ninja turtles dear to my heart.  But try rewatching any of the first season episodes today. Just try it.  I couldn’t make it through three episodes.  Hah.    I was hoping to show it to my kids (was one of those bargain bin dvds).  They thought mommy was crazy for claiming this was one of my fav cartoons growing up.  &&No offence but it might just be that the 2D stuff she's seen just wasn't very good and the 3D stuff she's watched is.

I mean back only a few years ago 3D animation was an indication of quality simply because PIXAR was the only ones doing 3D animation and everything else was stuff like 'Brother Bear' or 'Home on The Range'. *shudder*

Maybe get her to start watching the new Ducktales which is surprisingly good.

Pretend like you're the one that wants to watch it and she's just in the room and see her reaction when it's on.&&Well at least she can experience her first childhood trauma from an animated Disney film.&&She’s too young to grasp how sad some of those movies are. I remember being a little bummed over Bambi’s mom and mufasa but they fuck with me more now that I’m grown. &&The Tigger Movie was a very touching and emotional movie. It's a very underrated movie along with the other Pooh films made in the 2000's such as Piglet's Big Movie. Which was a huge love letter to Piglet and his original voice actor John Fiedler. Especially since it was one Fiedler's final vocal performances as Piglet along with Kingdom Hearts 2. &&This is an admittedly weird thing for me to pick at, but there were two theatrically released Winnie-the-Pooh movies released between The Tigger Movie and 2011’s Winnie the Pooh, and they both did well and had at least decent marketing. I believe the marketing was decent because they actually made a video game for Piglet’s Big Movie and I spent many, many hours playing it on my GBA in my early years.&&Well I guess it depends on what characters are being used. I don’t remember many kids going to see that Winnie the Pooh movie when it came out, yet just about everyone went to see the newer Spongebob movie when that was in theaters. I guess Spongebob just resonates with people more these days.&&that is some amazing animation. incredible art&&I watched 40 seconds and at first, all I could think was ""But this looks hand drawn"" and after a bit it was just ""Wooow"" and I had to stop because I need to see this movie&&
The problem is that it takes artists time to apply those tweaks.  It's adding additional review process and artist time to all tasks.  Problem is, that cost adds up.

Pixar used to spend a lot of money on their shorts.  Way more money was spent on Paperman per-second of animation than probably any animated feature released that year or since&&It's incredible, I remember when paperman came out, everybody was SO certain that it was hand drawn that when the news popped that it was CG, people straight up just denied jt&&You realize that the upper management saw some major shake-ups in that time, most notably the firing of Michael Eisner, right?&&You make a good point, I'm not sure why they tried with those two movies. Do you happen to know if there were any changes in the executives of the animation department in that time?&&As far as I'm aware the crippling happens right before Palpatine is kidnapped, leading into the third movie. Which sets the show before the event.

https://youtu.be/64-3talVkUA?t=740&&And what a plot it was. Astounding show; just picked up the Blu-ray box set and I'm gearing up for a rewatch for the next few months. &&You see, this is why you never fuck with time travel.

I always hoped for the “Jack kills future Aku, stays in future” ending, but they went with the worst kind of time travel.

Also, if they just put in one scene of an alternative future where everyone was happy, so many people would be satisfied. Hell, don’t even animate it, show a dozen still pictures as the credits roll.

But hey, if thats how he wants to end it, I’m all for it. Just glad we got an ending.&&Jack didn't disappear because he was back in his native timeline. He didn't age when he was in ""The Future That is Aku"" so he was essentially displaced from time. He's now back where he should be.

""The Future That Is Aku"" likely started disintegrating when Jack defeated Aku for good. It's possible that since it existed for so long(at least 50 years, maybe a few more depending on how much time Seasons 1-4 take place over) it took longer for it to fully disintegrate, and for dramatic timing it happened to finish during Ashi and Jack's wedding.

Alternatively, maybe when Ashi thought about how she wouldn't have existed without Aku, it caused her to disappear. &&You mean right around the time where they decided, ""lets not spend the second half of this miracle we got to wrap things up to, ya know, wrap things up, lets spend it developing a love interest, skip WAY too quickly through the things fans care about, just so we can try to pull the rug out from under them in the last episode?""&&I also hate you for it with love.&&Anime is basically an advertisement for the source material these days and so most often the show will run for 12-13 eps and if you want to know more you'll have to read the manga/light novel.

It's rare for an anime to make money itself and so it heavily relies on the DVDs/BD sales plus any merchandise it can pump out.&&90% of everything is garbage anyway, so that's not surprising. Anime is still a niche market, and 10% of Hollywood is way bigger than 10% of anime. Even then, we still get movies like ""In the corner of the world"" which shows the 10% still exists.&&I'm not used to seeing Arthur in flash. &&I think that film was also one of the last times we get to see a Disney Villain that's actually threatening and on the same level as other popular Disney villains before the ""Surprise villain"" idea that stuck since Frozen.&&And it was just fun and different. Also yea the music was on point, esp Facilier. &&The OG short of Little Witch Academia and it's sequel Magical Parade(backed it and have Blu-ray) are also very beautiful and well animated. Noteworthy series to mention is Rage of Bahamut and Gargantia. Both use CGI in places, but not overly so.&&7 YEARS&&Unlimited. Unlimited Budget Works.

Jokes aside, the animation quality mostly has to do with Ufotable outright refusing to outsource any part of it. Everything's done in house. Add to that an impressive mastery of the combination of 2D characters in 3D environments, outstanding texture work that makes those 3D environments look hand-painted, and one of the best special effects departments in any animation studio, and you get pure magic. &&Just watched this recently too (Crunchyroll had Unlimited Blade Works tho) and I was also blown away. One of the comments called it “Unlimited Budget Works” which doesn’t seem too far from the truth lol.&&It’s effects were animated amazingly but I don’t remember being impressed by actual animation. Cowboy beep bop is animated amazingly though.&&Plus there's the soundtrack, [which makes you want to juUNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GIkFdESKfk)&&Its actually one of the last non-computer drawn films.&&Tokyo Godfathers FTW!!!&&Hard to believe there was a brief period where Don Bluth actually did better than Disney before the 90's hit.&&Brother bear was amazing, I don't what your on about.&&I mean, you're not wrong about Home on the Range, but Brother Bear was good.&&That was like 15 years ago. The kids who watched Brother Bear are entering adulthood now. There was good 2D animation at the time too; it was just on television. Pointing to Brother Bear is a cheap shot against 2D animation of the time too; I could just as easily tell you to look at Chicken Little, which released a year later to a similarly lukewarm reception.

3D movies are also NOT associated with quality during this time period or in modernity by any stretch of the imagination. 3D movies are very cheap to produce compared to 2d animation, especially traditional 2d animation. As a result, many studios decided to take the approach of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. Sort animated movies by score on Metacritic and you'll find that a large portion of the low-rated ones are 3D. I also recommend taking a look at what is offered on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Hoopla - the market is absolutely flooded with low quality 3D animation and it just keeps rolling in.

If there was *ever* a time when 3D animation was associated with quality, it was in the mid to late 90s, and even that is questionable given the existence of VeggieTales, which was the only player in the market prior to Pixar, (and continues into modernity.) The perception of 3D animation being associated with quality was absolutely crushed with the release of Dinosaur in 2000, which was a monstrosity.

--------------

To be clear, I'm not saying that 3d animation is bad or that 2d animation is better. What I am saying however is that if we were get an average rating of all 3d animated movies in the past ten years and an average of 2d animated films and compare the two that 2d films would almost certainly have a higher score.&&As is tradition.&&That new live action one looks like it's shooting for the kind of good-natured humor that the Paddington movies nailed so well.&&Compared to a standard animated bug budget feature, the later Pooh films were not produced or animated by the US feature division with the exception of the 2011 feature. Being cheaper to produce and the material was easily digestible they carried minimal risk to Disney to make. &&Michael eisner was ceo when treasure planet got made, but he was thrown out the door by the time of princess and the frog. 

Im pretty sure it was related to treasure planet, chicken little, and home on the range being such trainwrecks while dreamworks was crushing it with shrek 1 and 2,  and shark tale (bad movie, tons of money). I remember people saying 2d was dead even back then.&&There was a fantastic ending rewrite by u/Atomsk88 on r/SamuraiJack, I’m on mobile so I’ll link the exact post later, but here’s his post:

“If you would rather read my proposed ending, scroll to the bottom where it says LEGENDS.

We've known for a long time the ending would be considered *bittersweet.* However, I found the second half of the episode suffered from the condensed pacing, thus we didn't actually receive a proper bittersweet ending.

Whatever the nature of a scene is, there needs to be time to allow the viewer's reaction and following emotion to take root. In this episode, the trouble starts when Ashi begins using Aku's powers. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, and it does make for great comeuppance for Aku's manipulating of Ashi. However, it's immediately realized that Ashi can send Jack back and they do so with haste.

While Aku's reaction is almost comical, that's the last we see of the future. I was personally fine with it at first, but later on I will explain how this ended up hurting the episode.

The battle with past Aku, from my personal opinion, is great. If you don't particularly find it satisfying, part of my thought process is that Jack must have thought for years what he would do once he got back to the past. What attacks he would use and how not to be tricked by Aku once more. Much like the last time portal, Jack did not hesitate and Aku was finished.

However, the resolution is where we begin to go downhill. Jack, unlike his father, is able to successfully destroy Aku. The world is saved and the future that is Aku is no more. Yet, Ashi remains and only serves to confirm that Aku is indeed destroyed. This is where she should have began vanishing. Time travel is always a complicated mess, but ultimately I feel many viewers would have preferred Ashi's *death* to occur alongside Aku's death.

In a poetic sense, both Aku's tower and Ashi would have fallen. One heralding the beginning of a new future, and the other the ending of a prior future.

The wedding scene was an emotional sucker punch. For those of us who have seen Gurren Lagann, we were apprehensive rather than capable of enjoying the beauty of the ceremony and the design of Ashi's dress. That Jack's mentors and friends of the past were there to celebrate, only for them to witness the loss of someone dear to Jack. Even from a writing standpoint, it's rather emotionally manipulative to allude that Ashi had survived for a long duration to where she would vanish at her own wedding.

Because of this tragedy, it mars the symbolism and hopeful nature of the final scene to the average viewer. Only a few minutes ago a character dies and it's expected the viewer will have the clarity to understand the symbolism behind the fog, forest, and ladybug.

Of course, it's one thing to criticize an episode and not offer an alternative. The problem I mentioned earlier about immediately going back to the past is, without realizing it, that's the last we have of the future and its characters. It's just gone and there's no recognition of it. So I present:

**LEGENDS**

As Aku's tower falls, Ashi falls alongside it. Jack holds her and asks what is wrong and what he can do. Ashi explains that she no longer has a father. Jack tries to comfort her, saying he loves her, but in reality he's the one needing to be comforted. Ashi quiets him and simply says, ""I love you.""

And she is gone.

Jack's homeland is restored, and there is to be a celebration. Jack's mentors and old friends have come far and wide. Jack's parents are greeting them, but Jack is not to be found. It transitions to Jack, outside the village under a tree. He should be happy; he is back to the home he, for a long time, only dreamed of. His people are saved, as is the whole world, but there are people only he knows that are no more.

Children of the village call out to him. Here we learn of Jack's true name! One asks, ""Is it true you were in the future?"" ""Yeah, what was it like,"" and ""Were the people really different from us?"" Jack is hesitant, mostly because it hurts to think about it.

Uh...have you ever read the credits to a Ufotable production? They do outsource.

Damn.&&The analysis of the problems with the ending are accurate but I have to disagree that this proposed alternative is any better. First the dialogue is corny. Ashi simply saying “I love you” before she disappears and Jack saying “They called me Jack” are both super lame. Also I’m glad we didn’t learn Jack’s real name. The show is called Samurai Jack. That’s his name as far as the viewer is concerned. And if there is one thing Jack is not it’s a storyteller. It doesn’t fit his character at all to “tell a tale” even if it’s his own tale he’s telling.&&That just gave me motherfucking goosebumps holy cow &&That would possibly factor in as well.

I had no idea that we would get to see a young Newt at school, that actor looks perfect for the part.&&Dumbledore wearing a suit feels wrong.  He just seems like the guy who would have always been wearing robes.&&I enjoy how Dumbledore goes from wearing Tom Ford to pajamas robes as he gets older. &&I literally thought that was still Eddie Redmayne holy shit. They look exactly alike&&Wish they would have 'kept collin as Grindelwald&&For some reason I always pictured Dumbledore as wearing sweater vests and cardigans but in like bright purple or with some gold trim. &&David Yates did a fantastic job making the world of Harry Potter feel casually adjacent to ours, but for me personally, it came at a cost of almost all the magic and charm.

I miss the lived-in shadowy fairy tale angle that Cuaron brought to the picture, and I'd give anything to have it back.

Jude Law is a good choice for Dumbledore but nothing about him in the trailers says he's magical and that bums me out.
&&Tommy Wiseau as young professor snape pls&&Hufflepuff represent!&&ok but could you even imagine how awesome it would be for those kids in the picture if they were life long harry potter fans and suddenly they are in the real robes and holding wands. like fuck i would be so happy. &&Huh, I figured they could get Eddie Redmyane to play schoolboy Eddie Redmayne (take a look at his pictures from Eton, he's barely changed!)&&Forget hairline, I’m disappointed that Dumbledore isn’t a redhead. The books make it clear he had long red hair in his younger years. &&Dumbledore apparently grew a full head of hair in old age! Hair transplant surgeons hate him!
&&Maybe we'll get to see the hufflepuff common room! &&HOLY CHILLS just the sight of those robes and that classroom makes me giggle.&&How many kids died at that fucking school or were turned into a lizard or some shit like that and parents kept sending their children there like parents fighting to get their boats enrolled in an Upper West side of school

One thing I took from the HP movies is just how great of a wizard he was. I'd say that he was, arguably, the best wizard in the universe (that I'm aware of). 

Fantastic Beasts could do with some serious Dumbledore action showing just his raw magical strength. &&I wonder why, at some point between Tom Riddle’s time at Hogwarts, and Harry’s third year, the school’s uniform designers decided to drop the colorful robe lining. Both designs are quite pleasing, though I do like the simplicity of the robes appearing in movies 1 and 2.&&That’s a weird looking Transfiguration lesson&&I still think it's a massively wasted opportunity that they didn't have Jared Harris play young Dumbledore. He could have pulled it off brilliantly, imo.&&Hairlinus Recedus!&&Stupid sexy Dumbledore!&&Regarding the hairline, [old Dumbledore](https://images.ctfassets.net/bxd3o8b291gf/1dmmUJzpRcWaUmMOCu8QwO/b9107c76889806699334ed54588e9ee2/AlbusDumbledore_WB_F6_DumbledoreSittingInChair_Promo_080615_Port.jpg?w=1200) *does* have a receding hairine, what's left is just really long and tends to cover up the balding. Not perfect, but not terrible.

Here's [Grampa Dumbledore](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/07/24/17/Albus-Dumbledore.jpg?w968h681) as well. &&This photo instantly brought a smile onto my face. So incredibly excited to see this film!&&Didn't dumbledore teach transfiguration?&&It will be cool to see hogwarts again&&Am I the only one that’s irritated that it’s not Fantastic Beasts *and* the Crimes it Grindelwald?

But you know, when he went and oicked up tom riddle at the orphanage, he dressed in a suit and trench coat, appropriate for the time.&&The entire series is guilty of this. The books made it very clear that Wizards dress like crazy people by our standards. Robes and hats of all kinds of colors due to their relative isolation from muggles and their norms. When they are out in public they tend to stand out. The movies started off portraying Wizards more like the books describe but as the series went on the clothing got more modern. Very stylized and professionally put together, but still way more normal. The Fantastic Beasts movie seems to have thrown the entire concept out the window and now everyone dresses like a J. Crew model. &&This makes perfect sense. Boarding school teachers often dress in the UK with regard to seniority. Lower teachers typically dress in smart attire, higher teachers dress in what are essentially robes of office: gowns, hats, whatever. It's an impressive sight sitting in the school chapel watching the teachers all decked out in their nattiest threads.

By the time Jude dude became headmaster of magic school he would be wearing whatever was the robes of office appropriate for wizards, which would probably make him look like some John Dee type.

Source: went to a UK boarding school.&&So at some point he just put on his robe and wizard hat??&&Dumbledore got old. He's younger here and cares about appearances more. By tine Harry comes around he's old and prefers comfort more than anything. It's why all our grandmas wear moo-moos. He's wearing wizard moo-moos.&&He got tenure. &&Have you ever seen old guys fashion?  They all go retro as they age.  It's either suspenders & fancy suits & flat hats or Hawaiian shirts & something their fathers would have worn to a bbq. &&To be fair Dumbledore is a muggle sympathizer, and in his earlier years it would have made sense for him to have been out and about in the muggle world sometimes, so he would know the fashion of the time.100+ year old Dumbledore shouldn't really be mingling with muggles though, no matter how he dresses he sticks out like a sore thumb. In between those two points, he was appointed the chief warlock of the wizengamot, and he would have worn traditional robes as part of his duties and likely just gotten accustomed to them. Robes are comfy as fuck, and when you're old and lose your shape they sure as hell hide it better than suits.&&Maybe that's standard uniform for headmasters?&&I would like to know which spell reverses male pattern balldness&&I always assumed Hogwarts has it’s own fashions, being an ancient institution and all.

Since Lupin's lesson was one of the few we saw in the films that was supposed to be portrayed as competent, I think mirroring the scene here is especially noteworthy, since obviously Dumbledore would have been competent.&&Yeah, I'm confused.. is this one a prequel to the other fantastic beasts movie?

so is warner brothers

they see disney making billions every movie with marvel and star wars, they are like junkies they need that harry potter fix again

HP and the dark knight trilogy were the only things that made them competitive with disney in the 2000s, and now things are even more lopsided

the only reason for these fantastic beasts movies to exist is that warner brothers knows they will make around a billion dollars with each one.   They're out of tolkein books to adapt and batman isn't selling tickets like he used to&&Well, the Harry Potter movies already established this as a possibility. [Here is Young Dumbledore with Grindelwald from Deathly Hallows showing Dumbledore with a vest. ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0f/Gellert_Grindelwald_and_Albus_Dumbledore.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20111209171450) Also, [here is a much older Dumbledore wearing a Purple suit going to visit a young Tom Riddle in Half Blood Prince.](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d7c0cac7d2fcc04879ed4a4f8fa59a6b) To me, it seems like a gradual shift as that Purple suit is not far off from his robes. And I think that in the 1920's, even in the Wizarding World, the fashion  was like that&&I don't know how much it's supported in canon, but I kind of like the idea that Dumbledore was ""all business"" at some point, but after Grindelwald maybe took a more aloof or whimsical approach to life. His attire could point to that.

Though in reality, I think it's just because the films are trying to paint a striking image, and whether or not him in a suit agrees with your head canon, it paints a striking picture.&&Also kind of weird that he has a receding hairline here but long hair when he’s older.

I suppose he could just conjure up more hair with some magic mumbo jumbo though. &&Ya the prevalence of muggle clothing in the latter Potter film's was something I really didn't like&&As you get older you start wearing for comfort. &&Eddie Redmayne with a hint of David Tennant&&It took this comment for me to realize that’s not Eddie Redmayne&&Eh. Uhh. *Google's Eddie redmayne*&&Personally I thought Mads Mikkelsen would be a fantastic Grindelwald. Better than Depp at least &&In the original HP movies, it was a big deal for Rowling that the cast be actual British actors. Then in Fantastic Beasts, they cast an Irish man (farrell) as a German or Eastern European or Norseman* or Russian (Grindlewald went to Durmstrang which is supposedly in Scandinavia) disguised as an American (so suppressing Farrell's accent) only to actually be an American actor playing an Eastern European! 

*Scandinavian &&Seriously, he wore a purple suit made of velvet a few years after this. I would have at least thought his bowtie would have tiny snitches on it. Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll show us some fabulous socks and quip that he's waiting for tenure before he pulls out the stops.&&I think that Cuaron was a big part of shifting the style of the movie franchise. Dropping robes for Hogwarts students being a big example&&Speaking of trailers, it's about high time they release another one. I've almost forgotten about this with all the talks about how packed December of this year is.&&Have had a hard time of putting into words why I don't like Yates and the direction he's taken the series and your explanation articulates my feelings perfectly. Thanks. &&Cuaron was by FAR my favorite director. I want his style back so badly.&&""young""&&I did not kill him it’s not true it’s bullshit I did not kill him, *I did naaaht*.

Oh hai Tom&&Snape wouldn’t have been born yet&&I still think Adam Driver would make a great ""younger"" Snape. &&They are *excellent* finders!&&We’re underrated & under-appreciated &&A Hogwarts movie with Gryffindor not being the protagonists? Blasphemy!&&+10 points to Hufflepuff! 💛🖤&&Kind of like how Donald Glover had a Star Wars shirt on in his high school yearbook and now he’s Lando&&Honestly, yeah. Slap a little CGI on him to soften features and there ya go. But it’s probably cheaper to just cast another younger actor. &&He's so cute that I couldn't believe it when I found out he's 36 haha. I thought he was a decade younger at least. Maybe it's the freckles. &&The UK used up its whole stock of appropriately aged redheaded actors on the Weasleys, sorry. They're now out of them. It's why they never cast Charlie. 

Edit: wait I thought jkr only cast UK actors...some of her Weasleys are from Dublin &&Forget hairline and the suit. I want piercing blue eyes&&Dang, it's almost like he's magic!&&Basically a hobbit hole with extra features?&&why.isn't.dumbledore.in.robes.david.yates?&&#thanks&&Why did you say this. I didn't know of Jared Harris before and now I'm SOOOO bummed they didn't get him to play Dumbledore. &&Yeah this was just a giant mistake. Jared Harris is a fantastic actor, and since he kinda sounds like his dad, it would've made it that much better. I like Jude Law, but I feel like sometimes they tend to shoehorn him into roles that don't fit him much. &&Kind of respect Jude Law for not doing whatever it is [every](http://celebhairtransplants.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-joel-mchale-2012-1.jpg) other [famous](http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Matthew.jpg) person [does](http://hairstylevill.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tom-Hanks-hair-transplant-1.jpg) when [they](http://cdn1-www.hoopsvibe.com/assets/uploads/2012/10/file_170053_0_LeBron_Hairline.jpg) start balding.&&Fun fact, when Michael Gambon was shotting for the role of dumbledore he always wore a pair of tracksuit bottoms under his robes with a pack of cigarettes tucked into his socks. This is really funny if your Irish (as is he) because the only people who dress like that are the Irish equivalent to white trash.hes from a very rough area in Dublin as well which makes it even better&&He is not the only one. Lord Voldemorts actor Ralph Fiennes wore garter belt and suspenders under his robes. There is even a funny behind the scenes picture of him showing them off: https://goo.gl/images/FNEQDP (View at your own risk, the image is a little disturbing, haha)

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/12088792/Voldemort-wore-garter-belt-and-suspenders-under-his-cloak-Harry-Potter-actor-says.html&&Yup, freeballing it in a tight three-piece Edwardian suit was probably far less comfortable. &&Except really nice socks.&&I put on my robe and wizard hat&&That's my plan.&&I’m 47 now and if I wouldn’t be surprised if I started rocking a wizard hat and robes soon. Once your hair goes and your pecs start to sag it’s like, why the fuck not? Nobody is paying attention to me anyway. Might as well have some fun with it. &&Yup - 'coz robes are super-comfy. Everybody should be wearing them as they get older. &&Well he was going to interact with muggles&&I don't know about the movies, but in the books he met Tom Riddle wearing a flamboyantly cut suit. I remember because I chuckle every time I read Harry's reaction: ""nice suit, sir.""

Dumbledore is a bad ass...&&In the book, he was wearing a purple suit with stars and planets on it.&&I mean, a purple suit... But still, yeah. &&Have y’all ever worn a cloak without underwear? Refreshing. The older I get the more it makes sense &&Well didn't he dress funny even then in the book? Or I might be thinking of the ministry dude who went to put a summons to the gaunts.&&The books also said there were wizards who were able to actually blend in well. For instance there was Barry Crouch, who was said to be well dressed enough to impress Vernon Dursley. Dumbledore would’ve also been one, what with his stylish purple suit, which I believe to be more of a conscious decision than him misunderstanding what would be acceptable dress. Besides, he always seemed to have a bit of a flair for the flamboyant. 

Plus, the books pretty much only talk about British wizards and how they interact with the world. We could extrapolate that to American wizards as well but that doesn’t have to be accurate. Nothing in the books tells us that American wizards also have to have difficulty dressing to blend properly. &&For the original movies, I think you could argue that Harry and Hermione might have been able to convince Ron to dress more like a muggle, since that’s how they were raised. Everyone else though... ehhh...... &&fFriend suggested to me that maybe in his younger days he interacted with the muggles more? If thats the case it would make sense.&&I mean the Wizard World probably have different fashions as well. I'd like to think it's evolving as well. Think how people used to dress different in the 80s compared to now.&&Theory: During the Quidditch World Cup wizards were coming from all over, including rural areas and wizard-heavy areas where they had very little interaction with muggles. 

FBaWtFT takes place in New York City, where wizards are heavily outnumbered by nomajs so they had to learn fast how to blend in.&&Yeah but fantastic beasts is set in the US where wizards are much more underground and probably assimilated more so with the muggles. &&iirc it was only on holidays and special holidays where they dress weird cuz the excitement. like the day voldemort was killed and harry arrived at the dursleys was the day when dursley saw a bunch of people in weird clothing going wild.

they try their best to blend in but sometimes forget to put on completely normal stuff, and on special days they don't give a fuck.&&No, the series doesn’t make that clear. 

Plus, JK Rowling has control over costuming and character design in the films. In all the films.

The clothing is described as being more modern in the books. Elements of modern clothing are being described as being worn with Wizarding elements. Dresses, trench-coats, vests, jackets, trousers and jeans, boots, heels, sneakers, hoodies, suits, bowlers, fedoras, trilby’s, sweaters, etc, are all described in the series. 

It’s mentioned and stated that the older and more “pure-blood” the Wizarding community gets, the more aristocratic they dress, and the more they wear “traditional robes”. But robes were pretty much taken as an average term for any type of Wizarding clothing in the book, including dresses, as well as any otherwise normal piece of clothing with added length. 

No, wizards and witches don’t “dress crazy”, and your chastising of the characters as dressing like J Crew models illustrates the issue with your misguided complaints: where does personality and style come in? Fashion is not a monolith, it’s complex, and the Wizarding World is not a vacuum of culture. It’s affected by trends in the non-magical community. In a community greatly affected by the non-magical one, there would be cultural overlap. And even aside from that, not everyone dresses the same. Why can’t we have some people look stylish? Not every character needs to look overly-dressed and cartoonish and silly. 

Wizards and witches were described as wearing clothing that was “artfully ripped and torn, form fitting, faded” and the like. Leather, tweed, tartan, flannel, etc, was mentioned. 

It was mentioned a number of times that certain, more elderly wizards and witches at the time in Great Britain who tried to dress like non-magical people would end up being inept at modern dressing customs. 

They AREN’T isolated from non-magical beings at all. They share huge population centers with them, and see them every day. 

The series is not there to describe the nuances of Wizarding fashion and how it looks, but judging from the occasional descriptions we do get of it in the series, it certainly isn’t made out to be some medieval wacko-land where all semblance of normal fashion is thrown out the window. 

Some people overly-fetishize the whimsical elements of the series that really aren’t significant in the long run. The series has tangibility and grit to it where other fantasy stories don’t. 

Furthermore, if you look at the background actors in the Ministry, in Diagon Alley throughout the films, at Hogwarts, in Hogsmeade, etc, you’ll notice that most of the extras are wearing some type of “robe-ish” clothing, some with full witches hat and cloak regalia. But not everyone dresses like that, and still there are just as many extras who wear modern clothing like jackets, skirts, hoodies, suits, trench-coats, vests, and dresses. 

Even if you want to argue there’s been a significant stylistic change (which there hasn’t been) I think it’s a far more evocative and original choice to style Wizarding fashion around the period it’s set in. Colleen Atwood talked about flapper dresses with an added sparkle, leather trench coats, and coats embroidered with bird emblems, cloche/witches hats, International Wizarding apparel, and clothing of the period given added length or severity to appear more magical and “out there”.

That’s much more original than pulling a Star Wars or a Lord of the Rings, neither of which this series is like, setting or design wise. &&You know it's because Jude Law's too hot to hide under a wizarding robe&&My principal dressed like that once, then some nice people came to take him away&&Looking forward to it! Still 40 years to go&&Uh how old is he in this?&&Apparently a hair potion is why Harry's family is rich, [his grandfather \(father's side\) made one](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-potter-family). I don't think it was to regrow hair so much as make hair more orderly, which is kind of ironic. &&Hermione uses potions that make her hair straight and shiny in HP and the Goblet of Fire so there should be potions that help with hair growth. &&Its described as auburn I believe&&Except Dumbledore taught Transfiguration not Defense Against the Dark Arts.&&Isnt that strange? I always thought it was weird that almost every class we saw had incompetent teachers. When their are competent teachers they leave or are killed or have memeories related to the dark lord or something&&It's gonna be a sequel to fantastic beasts with flashbacks to young Newt. At least that's what I read when the first teaser came out months ago.&&You're forgetting WB had their own superhero universe now and...well...never mind. Carry on.&&The Harry Potter movies basically threw everyone's robes out, though, except for the teachers.  From the third movie onwards, most of the kids are just walking around in jeans and sweaters.

It makes sense that Dumbledore would throw on a suit to go to a muggle orphanage, but I guess it's just jarring see Professor Dumbledore, in his Professor role, just rocking a suit.&&Man, Dumbledore aged significantly in those 11 years - going from Jude Law to Michael Gambon. Wonder what happened?&&In the books they all wear robes pretty much all the time, they note that Dumbledore gets weird looks in public because of how he dresses. &&Dumbledore in a purple suit was because he was dealing with Muggles in the Muggle world and needed to blend in some. 

I feel like while staying in the wizard world, he’d wear robes, especially at Hogwarts. &&Now that I think about it I feel as if the Muggles and wizards grew increasingly estranged from each other circa 1900-1920, because most Muggle technological advancements wizards seem to even be aware of end around that time period. They acknowledge the existence of steam trains, but possibly kind of stopped caring when Muggles started using electricity (since this is usually described as incompatible with magic). Also around that period Grindelwald rose to power, presumably coinciding with an increasing anti-Muggle sentiment. 

So maybe it does make sense that old-fashioned suits in the 20's were in fashion for wizards as well before they decided to stick to 'wizard attire' and stopped dressing like Muggles.&&People change what they wear as they age.  If young Dumbledore is Jude Law, we can be generous and say he's in his 30s in this film (Jude Law is 45).  That means he's at least 100 years old by the 90s when the main films take place.  Dude is old as shit with no fucks left and just wants to be comfortable.&&yea if you've got magic I'm betting the hair is all about personal taste or style &&I thought this Dumbledore looked like a fat balding tennant&&Are you face blind?&&they own the guy? &&Holy shit now I’m sad we’ll never see this. &&Yeah. When you really lay out the character like that, the casting seems horrible.

""Hey we need a dark wizard that everyone is terrified of...

...Johnny Depp is terrifying right?""&&I'd go with Nikolaj Coster-Waldau personally.&&Anyone is better than Depp. I've never heard a theater so audibly groan at something that was supposed to be a surprise than I did during that reveal.&&Oh yes, he would have been an amazing choice.&&Lars Mikkelsen, his brother, is scarier, IMO. He feels more disciplined and calculating. Always one step ahead.&&I'd love to see David Tennant as Grindelwald.

I know he already played Barty Crouch Jr. but still.&&Pretty sure Drumstrang is in eastern Europe somewhere. It has a strong eastern European vibe. 

And Norseman refer to vikings. Scandinavian is the correct one there.&&offtopic, but ""Norsemen"" refers to medieval Scandinavian people (Like Vikings).&&He didn't drop the robes though, I rewatched it recently and, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, they still wear there robes in class. It's when they are just hanging out that they are wearing regular clothing. That seems to make sense. I can see maybe disagreeing with bringing regular clothes in general into the mix, but he definitely didn't drop them.&&He dropped the robes, but he also infused a LOT of magic into the series (the scenes in the Leaky come to mind). I think the dropping the robes was his one mistake, not indicative of how he treated the magic in the franchise. &&Young like... 50 years before he was born young.&&James Franco as young Tommy Wiseau as young Professor Snape pls&&if a lot of wizards hate each other, the world would be a better place to live.&&*Snape Wiseau walks past the menacing, gargantuan three headed ""fluffy"" guarding the philosphers stone* 

Hai doggy&&Hahaha, what a story, Mark!&&I've seen a tumblr image once that was a picture of charmander, charmeleon and charizard, then underneath that an ""evolution"" that was Finn Wolfhard, Adam Driver and Alan Rickman. I can't say I disagree, but the main problem is that every time Adam Driver slims down he looks like fuckin Abe Lincoln.&&You're really not. You keep bragging about how nice and humble and victimised you supposedly are. Stop it.  

Sincerely, a Slytherin. &&Now Ravenclaws are that.. Not that it’s a competition lol&&It would feel like your in some weird alternate time line where you’ve gone wildly beyond your own dreams&&I prefer when they get a different actor.

Makes sense that he would dress more like them.


Edit: *Muggles Autocorrect strikes again. &&It was a “flamboyant purple suit” as well. &&I came here to point out that even though he wore a suit it was a purple one that by no means allowed him to blend in, so thank you for having my back.&&Don't American wizards have to boend in, because at that time they were being persecuted, secretly, by the US government&&American wizards 100% dress [like this](http://www.mensfashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mens-style-1980s-2.jpg)&&Maybe it was just cheaper to buy muggle clothing. Less wizards deemed it to be an acceptable profession considering they could do magic. So being a seamstress or tailor was below them?&&At the time of the events in this movie, Dumbledore barely got over - if he did at all - his idea to impose ""greater good"" upon muggles, that Grindelwald is currently trying to realize.&&The movies definitely just blatantly disregard the clothing cues from the books. Dumbledore is portrayed as visiting To Riddle in the 40s (slightly after this film but only slightly) and he wears a ridiculous getup that gets him lots of stares because even when he attempts to blend in he falls short. 

To be fair, that doesn't mean it's wrong. Wizards don't wear pants. Thats a *hard* thing to sell without it coming off cheesy and distracting. The film had to make a lot of decisions that things from the book needed to be changed to work better on film.

Take a look at Tom Felton wearing literally a suit despite the fact it's not cannon *and* goes against established characterization (the traditional people from old pureblood families are shown as not only *never* wearing muggle clothing,but not even understanding it conceptually.) The more out there, archetypal characters (Dumbleore,McGonnagal, Shape, Voldemort)  are allowed to wear the  clothing the characters are described in because their clothing is a large focus of initial characterizations. Shape is frequently compared to a bat,McGonnagals hat is a frequent discussion point,and you can't picture Dumbledore without picturing him in a flowing wizard gown. But pretty much  everyone else gets ""muggle-ized"".&&Oh no&&You're optimistic. I don't think I'll be alive next week.&&He was born in 1881

Fantastic 2 is 1926-45, so he's 45-64 in this.

So I imagine the photo is from 1926, so he'd be 45.&&So they named Harry after their success in the hair business?&&Ironic maybe, but it definitely makes sense that someone with Harry's genetics would spend their life creating a hair taming potion.&&I think one of the Potters was actually the creater of Skele-Gro as well.&&It wouldn’t necessarily be ironic.  Wouldn’t it make sense that Harry’s untidy hair was genetic and an ancestor made a potion to deal with it.&&Woa! Are there more articles like these? I didnt realize there was more content outside the books. 

BTW, after reading this I think its time she start writing a darn prequel or sequel. I miss reading her stuff (i miss reading in general)&&It’s not ironic, Grandpa Potter invented that hair smoothing potion *because* the family hair is so hard to control. What is ironic, or maybe just kinda funny, is how much Draco seems to love slathering his head with it. Harry should send him a note sometime like, “Thanks for the summer cottage!” Or, you know, whatever Harry and Co end up spending their money on.&&Huh. I never really questioned why Harry's parents were so rich. I guess I always assumed it was because they were such good wizards or something. Do we know what they did in between their time at Hogwarts and joining the resistance?&&We have potions like that irl. &&That potion, Sleekeazy's, is the same potion that the Potters invented and it made them wealthy .&&[deleted]&&It'd be a small change but I'd be bummed if JK Rowling changed it just because it makes a flashback more convenient. 

No doubt Dumbledore could have taught it and would have done a better job than any of Harry's DADA teachers (save Lupin) - which is why I always thought he stayed away from the subject because he didn't trust himself around dark arts after what happened with his sister and Grindelwald.

But hey, maybe he started out teaching DADA and then switched to Transfiguration after he faced Grindelwald, or something.&&He might have taught DAtDA at some point. I’m sure he’s qualified. Hell he could probably have taught any class at Hogwarts.&&What if he did teach transfiguration in the room that eventually became the DADA room?&&He taught that in the books, but is it possible that isn't canon for the movies? Perhaps in the movie-verse he'll be teaching DAtDA?&&Professors McGonagall, Sprout, Flitwick, Vector, and Sinistra would beg your pardon to disagree 😛&&Especially when there is literally one teaching job in each subject area in the entire British Isles. &&Who's the guy with the dark hair in the middle?&&yep... pretty much....

although wonder woman did quite well&&IIRC they were always wearing robes in class but wearing regular clothes when they were just hanging around or going to Hogsmeade (from Prisoner of Azkaban and going forward). Made sense to me although in the first two they always were in the robes.&&To be fair, when they are in class they are still shown wearing Robes as well as when Harry is teaching Dumbledore's Army. We just see them more and more outside of the Castle int eh later movies where they wouldn't have to wear the uniform.&&> From the third movie onwards, most of the kids are just walking around in jeans and sweaters.

alfonso cuaron was responsible for this, and it was the best decision that could have been made. Good books and good movies are different things. It made the world far more relatable and realistic and made for stronger connections with the characters &&Grindelwald happened&&Getting swept up in a symbolic-Nazi scheme of racial superiority and blood purity, only to come to your senses and realize that the only person you've ever felt romantic feelings for is proto-Hitler and you're the only one strong enough to stop him, *then* during the fight, your beloved Squib little sister runs out to stop you from fighting your lifelong best friend only to be caught in the crossfire and having her mind blown to smithereens.

It ages a guy.&&I agree.&&I believe that Dumbledore is supposed to be around 110 in the first book&&I believe Dumbledore was in his 60s in 1945 during his final battle with Grindelwald, so he would be about 110-120 in the 90s. &&Holy shit now I can’t unsee it&&More like we didn’t really look at his face because we assumed it was him&&Actually yes, on top of the fact that I have terrible eyesight and I’m currently wearing my mother’s contact lenses&&""I'm sad I'll never see Mads Mikkelsen as literally every villan EVER!""

Would anything have been lost if it just turned out that it *wasn't* someone else in disguise? It makes a much better point, IMO, about how the bad guys have actual followers who are (more or less) normal and accepted in society, and about how easy it is to be persuaded by Grindelwald's rhetoric.&&CAHLM BACK HERE, JESS- ^DUMBLEDOOOOORE. &&They could have him play a time traveling Harry Potter and I'd just nod my head and go ""this is the way it had to be.""&&>Pretty sure Durmstrang is in eastern Europe somewhere

That's what I figured, but I looked it up and found something on Pottermore and wikipedia. Pottermore says this:

>Although believed to be situated in the far north of Europe, Durmstrang is one of the most secretive of all schools about its whereabouts, so nobody can be quite certain. 

And wikipedia quotes some interview where Rowling suggests it's in Scandinavia, but Pottermore makes me think it just wants to keep it mysterious rather than naming a place. &&Thanks for that. I assume Scandinavian is preferred? Not that I have a good track record with assuming, but I was definitely trying to say Sweden-Norway-Denmark area.&&> I think the dropping the robes was his one mistake

Just curious, why do you think it was a mistake? Maybe for the first and second year extras it could have been used, but I think it made sense that the older students got the more casual they were about uniform, not worried as much about following the rules with them. That same logic goes for pretty much anything whether it be school, work or even relationships. As time goes on you get more casual or relaxed about certain things. To me that always helped make the characters feel more real and grounded and didn't really lose the magic. Like i'm trying to think of the more serious moments in the later films and placing robes on them and it just feels quite laughable.&&Tommy Wiseau as the ghost of future Snape please&&YOU'RE TEARING ME APART LILY!&&Oh hi Snivellus, I didn't know it was you.&&Listen here u &&How true.&&Pretty much.

Has no one here ever had a teacher fill in for another for a day or two whilst the other is busy doing something else? That could easily be the case here. I doubt it, but still. It's not unusual for teachers to take a class or two, especially in relation to something like magic where they'd all know the basics anyway.

edit: Or like another user mentioned, Snape fills in for Lupin in Prisoner of Azkaban.&&Substitute DADA teacher? Teachers have to cover classes for other teachers all the time if no subs are available&&I like the idea that DADA was introduced to protect against the new dangers Grindelwald presented, so Dumbledore took the classes until they got a permanent member of staff.&&> save Lupin

Moody was also really good, to be fair. Even if he did turn out to be a serial killer wearing Moody's face. But I'll concede Lupin was the only thoroughly good guy who was competent at the subject that Harry ever had. &&Nothing in that photo suggests he's teaching DADA. It could easily be Transfiguration involving living beings.&&I think Moody/Crouch Jr. Was an excellent DADA teacher even if he was a Deatheater in disguise. &&I know almost nothing about the HP universe other than what is in the movied and I only Watched up through 6. Is the stuff you're talking about in the books or in the previous Fantastic Beasts movie? It sounds really rad and dark.&&Not divination.&&Yeah, I suppose the two canons should be taken as separate. We've already seen the Patil twins debacle and the Burrow Inferno. And who is to say he didn't teach DADA before teaching Transfiguration to Tom Riddle in the 40's.&&I'd add in Snape as well. &&I think it's just a random student.&&[deleted]&&I'd always figured they'd always wear robes at school. It's their uniform, after all. I could imagine them wearing different clothings while they're in the common room, but other than that whenever someone mentioned clothing at hogwarts it was always robes (with occasional modifications like badges).&&The first movie already had that. They were in robes for much of it but during a lot of the after hours shots and the final gauntlet, they were in casual clothes. The difference is that Cuaron went even further with that by avoiding robes pretty much whenever he could.

And it's not particularly consistent within the universe. During Goblet of Fire, as Harry is walking around getting shunned as an egotistical attention whore, he's in casual clothes but almost everyone else is in robes. I'd think other 4th years and older wouldn't care about the robes either if it was a ""growing out of it"" kind of deal.&&Except for me it lost the sense of wonder. I always compare the scene of Harry and the kids entering the great Hall for the first time and then the scene in the 6th movie where kids are just walking around with backpacks like it's a regular school. Just had the movies lose the sense of wonder to me. &&Not really, they're basically just a school uniform. They looked just like a bog standard school uniform plus a sort of graduation-gown-looking thing.&&I disagree completely. The (movie) characters the world fell in love with in 1 and 2 all wore robes, and it added really gave layers to a separate world-within-a-world that the magical community are. It doesn't make logical sense, for continuity or canon, to have them in muggle clothing, and I don't think muggle clothing or stupid scenes like the Harry flirting scene in HBP added anything to the ability to relate or realism (why are we shooting for realism again?) in the films.&&Eh, I get that and it does work. But at the time I really didn't like it. Seeing everyone in normal clothes all of a sudden was a jarring change&&I totally disagree with you and regret Alfonso Cuaron ever becoming director. The third movie lost the charm of the first two. 

I don’t need muggle clothes to help me relate to a day in the life of a witch or wizard at Hogwarts. &&> It made the world far more relatable and realistic 

Because realism is what I want in Harry Potter. /s
&&Cuarons movie was the most well-made of the series but I'm not a fan of the direction it took the rest of the movies.

Just not terrifying in the way they want...&&I think it would have been far superior for him not to have been Grindlewald. Not only would it have shown that he has these supporters everywhere but that many of them are powerful. I mean imagine, you're watching fantastic beasts, see this powerful Grieves guy take on multiple members of MACUSA at once and actually seem like he's gonna win, Newt brings him down and you get the reveal that he's just a follower of Grindlewald. For me at least, that would make Grindlewald far more terrifying. If just one of his followers can fight so many trained wizards at once how powerful will Grindlewald himself be? &&And the character was so good on his own before the reveal. Maybe being grindlewald makes him scarier since he took on all of macusa single handedly but like I wish they did it differently &&They could've easily said that was his actual face and he was literally Confundus-ing everyone constantly without having to recast the spell in the normal way. Then everyone could've been like ""How the hell did he do that?""

Northern Europe is a large area but littearly nothing about the school is even vaguely Scandinavian. Kola Peninsula would be a much better location for it. &&You're correct with Scandinavian meaning Danish/Norwegian/Swedish. Typically these are the ones who used to be called Norsemen.
Nordic includes Iceland and Finland.&&I don't think your reasoning really fits within the canon. Wizards wear robes, period. It was established in the very first chapter of the first book, and it remains a prevalent idea (wizarding vs. muggle clothing) throughout the series. It's one of the ways we differentiate the wizarding world from the muggle, whereas Cuarón/Yates films differentiate wizards and muggles by one carries a stick that shoots lightening out of the end. Wizarding children do wear muggle clothing at some points (lounging around at home, traveling through London to get on the Hogwarts Express, etc), but it's quite canon that during more official/formal wizarding situations the proper attire is robes.

And I don't get how muggle clothing make characters feel more grounded. I just watched Lady Bird and Ronan is wearing ridiculous clothing throughout the movie, and I felt she was one of the most ""grounded"" and ""realistic"" characters in cinema this year. Were you laughing in the ""serious"" moments of the later films when Dumbledore was wearing robes? Snape? McGonagall? Were you laughing when Harry was facing Quirrell or the Basilisk whilst wearing robes? Because if you were, then maybe you just have a weird comedy-trigger with robes lol.

Ultimately these are wizards, not muggles, and I'm not a huge canon-stan and demand that everything in the movies fits the books, but I do think this is a big one, and is representative on the later directors muting the magical elements of the movie to become more ""relatable"", whatever that means. It'd be like Gandalf wearing what Aragorn wears, it just doesn't fit the character or the aesthetic. &&Hogwarts had the feel of a private school with the uniforms.  At private school you don't just get to be more casual as an upperclassman.

Like they can make inanimate objects fly like birds...And that skill is mainly utilized by a bunch of bureaucratic drones to send office memos to eachother.

The exemplary wizards are frequently depicted as the ones who don't take it all that seriously. &&Hair spell.&&Especially since potions was arguably his worst class until he found Snape's old book. &&Reddish brown&&Snape taught DADA when Lupin was out for the full moon.&&I had this thought too, but [there's a shot in the trailer where Dumbledore is in this same office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sEaYB4rLFQ#t=0m19s) as it appears men from the Ministry approach him years after this flashback, since Newt is out of school by then.&&Am teacher, have done this, usually they pair teachers up with classes that they have some content knowledge about that's not too far off (science/math, for example)&&And Prof. Grubbly Plank filled in for Hagrid in Order of the Pheonix, along with someone else filling in for the History of Magic Class when the original professor was taken ill (readers will know this).&&It's the room that was used for DADA. It could just be that the room used to be for transfiguration however. &&This was stuff that was brought up in movies 7 and 8, so you missed it by a hair, but it's the books that really get into it.

The short of it is Dumbledore was a talented and curious kid who was bored by school, so when his neighbor Grindelwald offered him a quest for power and immortality, Dumbledore couldn't resist. He felt the same temptations that Voldemort felt when he was a kid, but Dumbledore also fell in love with Grindelwald, who took advantage of those feelings. Together they made plans to dominate the Muggle world and let wizards live openly and in peace.

Dumbledore's brother Aberforth didn't like the path that Albus was going down, so he intervened and there was a dual between Albus, Aberforth, and Grindelwald which ended in the death of Dumbledore's younger sister.

They blamed her death on Grindelwald - who fled and was now a criminal in the eyes of the law - and Aberforth and Albus' relationship was broken. From then on, Albus tried to do the right thing, but was always afraid of Grindelwald  because he feared that he wouldn't be able to control his feelings or inner demons when he was around him.

There's more background to Dumbledore's family, his sister, and how it affected him in the Grindelwald + Voldemort eras, but it was a lot of background that basically served to say ""Dumbledore is not the nice old grandfather teacher he appeared to be.""

Considering they turned the Fantastic Beasts series from ""Newt's creature adventures"" to ""Dumbledore and Grindelwald,"" they should be touching on it a lot over the next four movies, but this will tell you why Dumbledore is so adamant about not facing Grindelwald directly and instead gets others (like Newt) to face him, kind of like a big chess game.&&If Trelawney could teach it, anyone could. &&This'd be even earlier, too.

I really enjoyed Fantastic Beasts a lot and am real excited for this one, but Depp is just such a disappointment... Hopefully he doesn't hold it back too much. Guess we'll see soon enough. &&Kind of took away from Depp being a scary dark wizard when they didn’t reveal his face until he’d already been captured. More like a Scooby Doo villain. &&Yeah, I was totally digging Colin Farrel then we get this cheesy looking weird depp. I can't even take this dude seriously anymore. &&I also just always wondered what’s even the benefit of making the wizards more “grounded” with muggle clothes? Like I’ve always felt this was a story about a separate magical world with magical people. There wasn’t any point growing up where I saw them in non robes and went ah yes I’m very pleased they were wearing clothes just like us muggles. Like the “repeatability” never added anything to the experience for me 

The fact that Harry and his buds were experiencing the ups and downs of adolescence was enough for me. The fact that these magical people in a whimsical world can still face these problems was cool enough for me. There wasn’t any need for them to be like ok let’s make them more relatable by giving them muggle like clothes lets make this point blatantly more and more obvious &&You naat gud you just a little mudblood *insert poor imitation of a muggle*&&That’s also for your pen!&&~~Lumos~~ Incendio minima *lights cigarette with lit end of wand*&&The sheriff is *gong*!

According to the dictionary.&&Found Papa Johns previous CEO. &&Like niggardly? It sounds like you know a lot of them. &&Yeah I'm used to hearing about niggling injuries, but I guess if you arent familiar with the word you'll just jump to a negative conclusion.&&A niggle is just something that is minorly annoying. &&Harry Potter and thenHalf Blood parents&&Like naggers then&&Idk id be upset if muggle is in a doctionary...that shit has no real world meaning. ""a normal human in a magical world""&&The second amendment was actually originally for protection against wizards.&&The magical world already took a stance they were the dominant species. They exerted unillateral control ovet the muggle qord amd only went into hiding because it was inconvenient dealing with muggles who were treated as nuisances. Having wizard only spaces was less about hiding from muggles to avoid war and more about not seeing the point in having to deal with the annoying little fucks anymore. 


 Voldemort wanted to replace the segregation based status quo and create an apartheid system for muggles and essentially enslave them while simultaneously committing genocide similarly to what had been gone to goblins, centaurs, house elves, and giants. The point of contention was never whether or not wizards were the superior beings, but how one should treat those beneath them. The bad wizards are the ones who felt that they should show active cruelty and violence towards their lessers. I can do whatever i wakt to anybody I want because who the fuck is gonna stop me. The good wizards don't respect or take muggles any more seriously,but they just feel violence and cruelty for the fun of doing evil deeds is reprehensible. 

A big theme in the book is Harry&co growing up and realizing the things that have been accepted as the status quo without a second thought are actually just as cruel and evil. We empathize with the muggles and mugglebormd because they're like us,but over time we realize that the magical ""creatures"" different from us also deserve decency and rights. That even the good guys are actually bigots capable of incredible cruelty. Emphasizing that racism isn't about being a good or bad person: it's a result of education and cultural norms. 

It's well established that muggles are never at any point considered a threat by wizards and that wizards could take over pretty fucking easily if they ever wanted to. They don't because they don't give enough of a fuck about muggles to bother. It's only when you get a handful of oddballs with a vendetta that it becomes an issue. And these oddballs are pretty much universally motivated by their experiences with muggles abusing *children*. There's this question ahout whether a group of people who clearly have no trouble committing atrocities when they have dominance deserve sympathy when a stronger and more capable prey comes along. 

Muggles are actually largely depicted really negatively. The only time muggles are depicted positively it's in character who are hardly depicted at all: Hermione's parents, andromedas husband.....pretty much it. Snapes father is depicted as abusive. The dursleys are depicted as abusive. Dumbledore's sister is so viciously attacked that she develops severe developmental problems. Voldemort is shown as being neglected even as an infant. It's actually pointed out a few times that Vernon Dursley is just basically opposite land pureblood bigot.

You don't sink down to their level. When they go low, we should aim to go high. Thats just reiterated a lot. The fact muggles are shitty and may objectively even 'deserve' a commupance does not forgive your actions when you sink to their level. Muggles could kill completely untrained wizards maybe. But even as young as 13 that basically flips and wizards are already way more capable than most muggles. There's no world in which muggles stand a chance. By the time muggles got their bearings enough to make an attemp, the wizards are gonna swoop in and obliviate and confundus whoever needs to be taken care of. It's like putting Nobel laurreates and military generals against a kindergarten class.&&Na its painfully obvious that robes and shit look way cooler than Brooks Brothers&&What&&Friend of Duke Dirtfarmer, the Last Laser Master? &&Weird, I didn’t seem to care. I enjoyed the ride. &&I think the irony was rather that Harry's hair was unruly, as if to reject his grandfathers life work.&&Kinda like electronics.

If anything, James to be the odd one out. &&There we go, even happened in the Wizarding World already. Hopefully this time with less turning to page 394.&&God catch, that is definitely the defense against the dark arts classroom. At least from what we know, and the way Hogwarts is with tradition I doubt they'd go changing classroom locations all willy nilly&&People give Trelawney a lot of shit, but she predicted a lot of stuff. And not just the prophecy about the Chosen One and the one about Pettigrew escaping. During the first Divination class, she predicted that Neville would break his first tea glass. She predicted that Lavender would lose her pet bunny in Easter, and that one student would leave her class forever. She said that when thirteen people dine together, the first to rise would be the first to die. When the Order rescued Harry from the Dursleys for the last time, they all sat down at the table in the Burrow. Thirteen people were at that table. IIRC, Lupin rose first, and he died first.

Now I don't know whether all that was just skill or guesswork, but I'd certainly give her the benefit of the doubt.&&Trelawney was an actual Seer. That’s why she taught it.&&you take that back&&Trelawney was actually gifted and very knowledgeable in divination. &&The Patil twins were in separate houses and the Burrow Inferno absolutely did not happen in the books. Both were done for convenience and cinematic reasons, respectively.&&The patil twins in the film are both in Gryffindor whilst in the books one is in Ravenclaw and the other is in Gryffindor. In a book where you learn about the twin cores in Voldemort and Harrys wands. Showing that though identical - you can still make your own choices. (The twins were also not identical in the film.) 
In HBP film the death eaters arrive at the Weasley Burrow and burn it down which doesn't happen at all in the books this was to give the film an action Centre piece as they removed most of the fight that happens in Hogwarts presumably to leave that as something to be seen in Deathly Hallows Part II.&&Galatea Merrythought! The name suggests a woman particularly skilled at the Patronus charm :)&&kinda depends on how you define competent. I mean he obviously was qualified to teach kids potions at a high level, but the extent to which he selectively bullied students and favored those of his house would make me give him a hard no if he ever applied to teach at my magic school. Being a competent teacher isn't just being good at the subject and being able to teach it to others, its also about interacting well with children, as well as having, you know, empathy, both of which Snape sorely lacks.&&One of my best teachers ever had a similar disposition to him. Hated the old miserable bastard, but I will forever retain a lot of useless geography information thanks to his teaching. &&Lestrange. Newt’s Hogwarts Flame’s brother, I’d assume. 

We know Newt fancied a girl with the last name Lestrange, we know there are Lestranges in the 90’s, so the name must live on... so I presume the boy in the middle to be something Lestrange. &&Sounds right. I went to a school with a uniform and shorts were mandatory even in winter. By the time I was 15 or 16 I started wearing trousers in winter so did some other boys.

Sirius. Lupin died in the Deathly Hallows.&&Don't forget that J.K. Rowling is actually writing these scripts for a change. Unlike the movies and Cursed Child, if there's a contradiction it's because it's a deliberate choice on her part. I haven't seen any so far, and Pottermore writing seems to indicate she views it all as canon. &&You're not wrong, but I look at it as a ""brilliant jerk"" sorta thing. There's some experts so highly qualified and skilled at their subject that their other qualifications become irrelevant, at best, and unnecessary to explore further. Snape is a pretty garbage *teacher* if the metric is being a mentor and shaper of young minds, but time and time again we see he's a truly brilliant potions master- dude whips up veritaserum with relative ease and was clearly gifted as a student too, given the HBP book that basically reinvents potions creation.

The students became pretty competent too due to Snape's skill and unorthodox teaching style: Hermione is one of the more impressive potions students ever, Harry and Ron become pretty solid too, as do all the rest of the kids.

Admittedly you're right, I wouldn't hire Snape either, but I work with some people kinda like this: true geniuses in their field that are integral to the process but I'd never want to spend time with if I didn't have to. &&I always thought of them being like canvas messenger bags, myself.&&That's exactly what a tote is...&&Yeah I thought of them as a bandana tied to a stick that forms a little pouch. Both of us are wrong, of course.&&To be fair, isn't the whole YOU'RE AT A MAGICAL SCHOOL thing played up a bit for the first year students?  Some of which have never cast a spell in their life?&&I get it. But I think its intentional.

Think of it like this.

You're born to a pure blood wizarding family.

Mum rocks your crib from across the room with her wand.  You use the floo network when you want to go to the store.  Your house elf washes your hair for you.

By the time youre 16, this shit IS mundane.  Especially by the time you've been doing it for 2-3 years yourself.

Like, I'm never blown away at the engineering of the motor vehicle every time I run to the store for a gallon of milk.  Its mundane.  Despite the fact that the motor vehicle is an absolute marvel of engineering, and I understand it as such.

So by the third story, magic school is Eh, not that magical.  Now, underneath the Ministy of Magic, that shit is still magic.  Azkaban, still pretty out there and magical.  Deathly Hallows, super magical.

You see?  Its like a drug.  After you have it, Your tolerance goes up.  Wearing robes isnt magical, so its not necesaary.  What is magical is wizard tournaments and shapeshifting.  

TL;DRThe goal posts moved so the things (like robes) that made Hogwarts ""magical"" in Philosophers stone wasnt cutting it by Prisoner of Azkaban.

I went in expecting it to be bad, and it wasn't. It was a pretty fun ride.&&71% of critics and 64% of audience members liked Solo on rotten tomatoes. You must accept that you are normies.&&I think the people who saw Solo enjoyed it.  I really wish we could have seen the Lord/Miller cut.

Let this movie be its own beast&&Wasn't Scabbers with Ron at the table though before that? &&I always figured them as leather messenger bags. Seemed to fit the ""we still have torches and slaves"" mode of the world. &&They’re wizards, not hipsters!&&It wouldn't have made a ton of sense continuity wise but it be nice if at least the first and second years kept their robes to show some kind of distinction.&&Yeah I think it works great. The first two films (and books) in particular play up the idea of this magical place with so much to explore but then from the third onward we get a much more grounded, adult look at things like needing parental/guardian permission to go on a school trip or students being more casual about the uniform now that they've been there long enough.

Mad Max: Fury Road voted greatest Australian film this century by critics,53322,91ghue,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/24/mad-max-fury-road-voted-greatest-australian-film-this-century-by-critics,2847,1532431099.0,,"I'm sorry but they've clearly never seen kangaroo Jack.&&What's the competition like? &&Oh, THIS century? Sure. If you mean past 18 years.&&Don't they mean greatest Australian Documentary? &&I actually grew up with one of the main storyboard artists; Peter Pound. We are family friends with him and his wife and two kids... Since I was tiny we’d go into his studio at his house and look at all his crazy drawings. In fury road he story boarded most of the movie and all the cars are his designs. He’s inspired me as an artist throughout my entire life.

Absolutely top bloke, one of the most down to earth guys I know.&&This film has great world building. The story itself is easy to follow (though excellent) but every time you watch it you'll pick up on details you missed during previous viewings and these details flesh out the world which in turn makes the story itself more enjoyable. It really lends itself well to repeat viewings.   


I wish all action films had as much thought put into the world and the motivations behind the characters. &&I remember watching it in theaters. It was right before I moved cities for a job and I felt like I really needed a theater experience before moving because the theater near my college was an amazing atmosphere and part of a lot of cherished memories for me.  
I saw this on the billing and thought, ""I mean it's George ~~Romero~~ Miller, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy... It can't be *bad* right?""  
The first act had me at the edge of my seat. By the second act I felt like I was experiencing the cinematic equivalent of Bernard Hopkins beating Kelly Pavlik against impossible odds when he was in his mid 40's.  
By the climax, I hadn't taken a sip of my soda and I wondered if that was what it was like for people who watched Goodfellas when it was released.  
To this day I haven't seen a film since that moved me except Logan and even Logan, for being my favorite comic movie, didn't move me like Fury Road did. The cinematography was just nothing like I've ever seen before. &&I mean... there is a whole lot of century left to go. But if you want to call it now...&&nobody saw **Candy** (2006) but it was utterly devastating&&of the century... we’re in 2018...
somebody’s a bit overzealous.
(dont get me wrong, i loved that movie to bits)&&When I think of the best big budget films of the last decade, this is always near the top of that list. It blows stuff like Star Wars out of the water.&&The Castle was a great film.

Sorry, that was last century.&&My vote goes to The Proposition.&&It’s lucky it wasn’t up against *Young Einstein*.&&It’s a shame they can’t make a sequel to this. Get your shit together warner bros and pay miller.&&It's also the perfect modern day representation of Australia as far as I can tell.&&My vote would be for Two Hands. Heath Ledger, Rose Byrne and Bryan Brown in a bloody entertaining Sydney crime drama.&&I really, really liked Red Hill, too. But I saw Fury Road 4 times in theaters and its one of the few BDs I own. &&Fury Road was without a doubt the crowning jewel of 2015 cinema for me. Watched it in the cinema, and I was absolutely blown away by the sheer power of many of the scenes.

From sweeping shots of the warbands to my absolute favourite - that motherfucking storm. I had a tear in my eyes AND chicken skin from that scene. The score, the scenery, the action, Goddamn.&&I would have put Animal Kingdom at #1&&And judging by the top story in r/worldnews soon to become a documentary.&&To those stating it's not an Aussie film. Is every American film not shot in the USA not an American film? Is every American film with foreign financing not an American film?&&So is it true that they will make another Mad Max film? I’d even be happy with a Furiosa movie. &&But what even happens though? Watched a couple hours of insane visuals with barely any story and wondered why the movie was loved so much? For the viewing factor? Definitely can't be for the story...&&I feel like one of a few people who really disliked the film&&It was a fun watch and the practical effects were really cool, but am I the only one who thinks this movie is a tad overrated?

Edit: Gah downvote city. Please don't hate me people. 

Edit #2: No longer downvote city. Think it turned into my most replied to comment actually.

I like how most everyone is sharing their varying opinions politely and respectfully.
You're awesome reddit.&&As long as ""The Road Warrior"" is greatest Australian Film for the last century.&&and with **ONLY 82 YEARS TO GO **&&WITNESSED! &&The movie was pretty terrible though.&&Am I the only one who really didn’t think this movie was all that great? The plot is literally drive one way, turn around, drive back, with a lot of explosions and sped-up action scenes along the way. &&I know I am in the minority, but I thought it was BORING.  All style and no substance. &&Australia has a lot of really good movies.&&Heard it was a great Documentary for them&&It's 2018, aren't they little early on this?&&Yeah, this was something else. The pacing, the production design, the cinematography. The whole mood Miller and crew managed to establish. Just a gorgeous film, just gorgeous. Anyone saw the black and white edition?&&they could had said in this millennium too though &&I think this was a great movie. Honestly, probably one of they best of the decade. I thought it would disappoint. The exact opposite, on the edge of your seat the whole time, and mostly all original ideas. Just refreshing to see&&Oh god....&&Or Simple Jack&&Whats the best Aus film of all time? 

Crocodile Dundee? Not joking.

Edit: thanks everyone. These should keep me going!

Edit 2: almost forgot to mention...one of my favourite Aus documentaries is *Lions Raw 2013*. Sublime :-)&&[Yep](https://youtu.be/wgVN33-ykiM)&&_Mastahpiece!_&&Pfft clearly nobody saw The Wog Boy which was the greatest insight to Australian culture ever.&&Is that you dunkey?&&Or the epic ""Australia"" movie&&You mean that movie that purposely made all the commercials look like the movie was about a talking kangaroo? It was a huge let down when I finally saw that movie and found out the kangaroo didn't talk or rap, besides that dream sequence that made up %90 of the commercials.&&Wolf Creek, The Rover... Kill Me Three Times...&&The Babadook, The Rover, Hacksaw Ridge, Lion, Animal Kingdom, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Moulin Rouge, Chopper, Charlie’s Country, Samson and Delilah, etc.

There aren't a lot, but there are still some good ones since 2000. &&Home and Away: Alf Stewart's Revenge&&Edit: to be clear this is the official list. I have no opinion on any of this.

There's going to be some great emotional feel good epic and some old film guy will run in ""no, we can't, we already picked Mad Max"". Like ""no The Matrix isn't the ultimate technological thriller of the century, it's 'The Great Train Robbery' from 1914"" &&""Greatest movie of the year!!!"" <article written January 3>&&They announce best movie of the century at the start of the century. They do things the other way around.&&Well if you want the one from the last century, it's probably the original Mad Max. Either way, still a win for Hugh Keays-Byrne.

It's either that or Crocodile Dundee.&&Not even 18, if you don’t include 2000, technically part of the 20th century, and this year is not over. &&Isn’t it a little early to decide what the greatest movie of the century is when you’ve only seen like roughly 17.5% of films (that’s assuming you’ve seen EVERY Australian film)?&&Have you not seen Kenny?&&Shhhh. We're trying to encourage tourism.&&>Peter Pound

Dibs on porn name&&>bloke

Australian confirmed.&&It's a good sign when a movie has things in it that make me think, ""I wonder what the story behind THAT is?""&&The pacing is also impeccable: just as things are too much, it tapers off, and just as you're itching for more adrenaline, it gives it to you&&My friend was convinced the stilt-people were part of a cut scene, and I kept telling him that’s just how the film does things. They put them in there just to make you wonder WTF?&&To add to that, this movie is a triumph of practical effects. All the cars and (most) of the action sequences were real, with real people performing them. 

That scene with Max pole-vaulting through the air as Gas Town’s tanker explodes in the background (with dozens of other vehicles in the vicinity) is the greatest spectacle ever captured on film.&&The world building is one of the reasons I liked John Wick so much. The added mystique of the hotel and the various people in it is fascinating, and the movie does a great job of not dumbing it down and explaining everything.&&I liked it more on subsequent viewings but that had more to do with adjusting my expectations. The first time I watched I wasn't expecting a 2 hour car chase movie with nearly no dialogue and I wasn't very into it.&&I thought the film suffered with the lack of realism regarding Max's vulnerability and how much ammo there was. While in previous films, he constantly got injured and barely anyone was using guns.&&One of the best purchase decisions I've made on a movie vs renting. I don't know how many times I have watched it but it's great every time. The world they created leaves you with a lot more questions than answers but in this case it's a good thing. The score is amazing, this movie should be played loud. Perfectly cast. &&George Miller, not Romero.&&Yep, first time seeing it in theaters I was completely transfixed with my mouth open literally the whole movie. One of my favorite movies overall, but absolutely my favorite movie seen in theaters.&&That was me when I saw The Dark Knight in theaters on its midnight release. I'll never forget that experience&&Mate you just nailed my first feelings for fury road, what a film&&I felt that way about Blade Runner 2049. I know it's not a movie for everyone, but my mouth was wide open the whole runtime.&&After I saw Fury Road it became that thing I'd get everyone else I knew to do. Oh, you haven't seen Fury Road yet? Well guess what, we're going to the movies tonight. I ended up seeing it 4 or 5 times in theaters because of this. &&It's actually George Miller that directed the series&&Agreed. The cinematography in this movie blew me away 






To this day I still feel like this is one of the best movies to watch in a cinema. It’s an experience.&&The first time I saw it in theaters, I was drinking a strongly caffeinated coffee beer. The coffee+booze+soundtrack+that movie was a rush I am still chasing to this day. I saw it at least twice more in theaters.&&I remember having a few beers before this movie with my brothers and when it started I kept saying I'll go take a leak when the action dies down. Almost ended up peeing my pants. &&I saw it 4 times in theaters. 4 TIMES!!! &&Yeah. I kept realizing I was gripping the seat, and stopped. And did it again.  Then the second time I watched it I knew what was coming but I kept realizing I was gripping the seat again. Man.&&Requiem for an Aussie Dream&&Heath ledger’s acting in this is on par with his Joker character. The come down scene is so intense you would swear he got addicted to heroin just so he could perfect it. &&Shit that was 2006? Feels like a lifetime ago. You're right about it though: absolutely fantastic and nobody saw it.&&Oh man, it’s intense. 

Book is harrowing. The chapter on crabs is so bleak.&&It's actually kind of weird to think that the century is nearly one fifth over&&You’re allowed not like Mad Max. &&Every greatest thing is the *blank* of the century, until the next greater thing.&&Yeah  honestly the new Star Wars stuff is just fun. I still enjoy them, because they're what I expect(comical, fun, action/sci-fi romps), but they're not amazing films. That being said, we saw what happens when George puts the original trilogy on a pedestal and tries to make Star Wars movies, so it's probably for the best.

That being said, there have been a lot of really great films in the last 10 years. Especially in the sci-fi market. &&S'alright, we got the vibe of it. &&Straight to the pool room with that kino!&&Nick Cave wrote it.&&Such a fantastic movie. Guy Pearce is brilliant in it. &&I try and recommend this to anyone who is interested in a western. I feel like it's not talked about enough. &&Goddamn, I love that movie so much. &&However on the other hand if they never make a sequel they at least go out on top. &&Its bs. The amount they have to gain is more than 7 million to pay him&&They really need to pay him.  They’re probably just waiting for him to die since he’s in his 70’s. &&Not enough spiders or ground harnesses&&Wasn't that 1999?

If you're doing 90's it would be hard to pass up ""The Castle"" for cultural impact in Australia. ;)&&This life, well, it's slipping right through my hands.&&Yeah, shotties are good mate. &&Pando, your pawn's in deep shit mate..&&One of my favorite movies. It's a nearly perfect modern crime family movie IMO. &&That movie is an excruciating slow burn. &&It was actually shot in Namibia. Though the director and the production crew are Australian.&&Director & studio currently [whining over $7mil](https://www.moviefone.com/2018/04/16/ugly-fury-road-court-battle-is-ruining-plans-for-next-mad-max-movies/).

They then free it from their greedy cruel overlord and claim it for good.&&Glad to find someone who shares the same sentiments as me. I was so underwhelmed. &&I didn't NOT like it, because it's kind of my genre of film I enjoy, but if one goes in thinking they are going to be seeing The Road Warrior again, they will be disappointed.

I know it's not cool to shit on things lately, so I'll just say I didn't like this movie and I'll accept your downvotes &&Yeah, I thought it was pretty meh. It's nowhere close to The Road Warrior in my opinion. I think I prefer Beyond Thunderdome to it, as well.

Not a fan of the story, not a fan of the color palette, not a fan of the characters.&&The plot is literally ""drive all the way to X, then turn around and go back to where you came"".

I dunno, man... it wasn't a terrible movie, but I can't believe people are putting it up on a pedestal like this.&&I think the hype is manufactured to a certain degree. The movie is one long car chase with shallow characters and a story line that makes comics look like high art. No you're not the only one it's just that the circle jerk is strong.&&I get you. I think the Nolan Batman movies are boring and not very good. But i love mad max. Each to their own its only a movie anyways. &&Overrated? Depends.

I didn't like it nearly as much as others, it was somewhat dull and boring and I didn't really feel connection to any of the characters in the movie, nor did I feel sad about anyone dying.

MM1 & 2 are far better movies in my opinion, but oh well (Talking in general, not in context of this vote)&&I think the movie is a mess to say the least&&Not the only one. I found the overuse of speeding up the film to give it a more drugged, manic feel to be unimaginative. I didn't enjoy the movie at all which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it&&I'm sure I'll get downvoted to oblivion, but I think it was worse than overrated. I thought it was nonsensical and boring as hell. The cinematography was nice, but the plot was super contrived, and after a half hour of explody chase, I was numb to the action. 

And my biggest problem was probably the part that so many people liked. They spend all this time, money and effort to build a giant drum, speaker and flaming guitar car for a battle (yeah, that's necessary), but they can't build a damn pipeline?&&yeah it is overrated, dont know why you're getting downvoted... Also cmon critics the movie really is a roadtrip to and from a desert.&&It's crazy overrated. It's a fun watch, but the repetition gets old on the journey back. The action just gets exhausting because it's the same action for nearly 90 minutes.

I suppose that [separating aborigines children permanently from their parents, so that you could ""civilize"" them, turn them into maids/slaves, beat them, and rape them](#spoiler) is not as sexy for Australian critics as a juvenile power fantasy in a post-apocalyptic World where some similar things are going on. &&There hasn't been many years of quality cinema to begin with. The Australian film industry, much like most of the land mass, it is a desert.

Source: am in the Australian film industry.

Edit: to the many quality films listed below, I completely agree! The key word in my comment is 'years.' In the American film industry in a single year you'll get a lot of turds, but there'll be an any number of gems.

Here no one funds much to begin with so the well runs dry pretty quick. And why should they? Films that don't have brand recognition fail to get viewers in seats to begin with, let alone Australian films. Very, very often they don't make their money back.

It's not through lack of effort or talent either - some recent favourites of mine include The Dressmaker and Brother's Nest. But with Brother's Nest there was 12 years between that and Clayton Jacobson's last film, Kenny, in which no one would fund anything he made. I hung out with him after a Q&A recently and called the Australian industry an enthusiastic hobby more than anything else.

Also in terms of producing great actor's, I'll agree. But I wish they'd stop bloody running off to America. I have an appreciation for Hugo Weaving because he's condemned the same thing and does a lot of Australian film (or as much as one can do in the climate). Maybe that's pedantic of me, but the list of famous Australian actors that haven't done the majority of their work in the US is a short one.

Oh, and don't even get me started on TV. While you lot in America had a golden age of television, we've had a few great comedies and a few decent dramas, and for each one of those we've had 20 reality shows about renovating houses. And in all that nothing that comes close to a Breaking Bad. I'm sure we're capable of such a thing but it's impossible to break through the mould.

In spite of all that I try to remain optimistic, and hope each big Australian-American film breathes a little more life into the industry (ala your Fury Roads and Ragnaroks). The more success stories we have, the more we'll get films with funding.&&**SHINY AND CHROME!**&&so you could've released a really shitty movie on Jan 1st of 2000 and be crowned the best movie of the century... for like a week until a new release comes out&&I think the heavy use of Practical Effects will sit in Mad Max: Fury Roads favor.  I dont think it will ever be boring movie to really watch unless people figure out a good way to replicate it to the point of redundancy, which is insanely hard because the movie was made with thousands of story boards instead of a screenplay with decades of work. Its production is very unique and was decades in the making with a both seasoned director who could still tap into a fresh energy which makes George Miller a Unicorn in the film industry.

Now that said, I think its too early to declare something like that. Time is the test needed to see if it will stand up.&&I don't think there's a need to backslide?


On the one hand - this vote will be forgotten about by the end of the week/today. (These kinds of things are complexity meaningless/worthless as anything other than a minor distraction anyway)

Creepy, not really explained, you're given just the BAREST hints of dialogue to guess what their deal is.&&Both of you are right. The screenplay has a scene that explores them more in-depth - they're called Crow Fishers for a reason. But in the finished film they're a piece of the world and a mystery.&&It was a triumph of how to combine practical and visual effects. A lot of those shots were layered. Also the scene with the big stone Arch, that Arch doesn't exist in real life. I don't know a ton about vfx, but I feel like I can usually spot the fake stuff. Watching the behind the scenes videos I was surprised at what all was just computerized.&&It's why people love Westworld, but there are limits (Lost). It's great to have things left unexplained, or show odd stuff, but it shouldn't be all you do. Giving explanations behind everything removes a lot of the mystique of a story. It's also why book to movie translations can flop so hard. Everyone had a different idea of what a character looks or sounds like, and a bad adaptation ruins the book as you can't unite the two.&&Too bad they killed the mystique in the second one and made everyone on Earth an assassin.&&And then the second movie completely jumps the shark. Yay...&&I agree and also think that all the additional explanations occurring in the 2nd film only hurts the mystique.  &&I had the opposite experience, I went into it knowing pretty much nothing about it and was completely blown away.&&That's what I loved about it. It is a movie that knows what it is and why you're there to see it start to finish. At least it was for me.&&I ended up buying this movie just because I watched my pirated 4K copy so much. I watch it a lot. I just watched it today to test my new speakers and it’s amazing. The music is also amazing so many great parts.

I would argue that the original trilogy has three amazing films, and I’d argue to be better than a LOT of sci-fi, fantasy, or other speculative fiction because of the storytelling.

Even the prequels (objectively bad films, though I still love them and can talk about the positives all day) are riskier films than the vast majority of movies in terms of portraying the protagonists moral ambiguity, and allowing for the story to breath.

I REALLY don’t like the new Star Wars films as they’re really falling into modern day blockbuster tropes and really has strayed from the franchise’s spirit.

Fury Road is a simple movie, and that works in its favor. The lack of characterization of Max and his lack of agency in the film until the third act is frustrating especially when he serves as the film’s anchor point emotionally. &&Watching The Last Jedi I was actually longing for Phantom Menace. Lucas might have made a LOT of fuck ups, but he still knows how a story works, and how to keep it simple. &&I was pleasantly surprised to find a Proposition reference in Deadpool 2.&&What about Welcome to Woop Woop? Though, seriously, The Castle was great, went straight to the pool room for me. &&You mean an intense and gripping build up?&&A lot of the production work happened in Australia. My brother worked on the movie and he moved to Australia for 6 months just for this movie.&&Why isn't any film ever just *rated*?&&I understand and respect that you didn't like it for whatever reason. I don't agree with the method of critiquing it though.

A great movie can be about anything. I mean 99% of 10 Cloverfield Lane takes place in 4 rooms that doesn't mean it's boring. The movie 300 is like one giant battle scene, or Reservoir dogs is just a bunch of criminals talking about and experiencing the different stages of a heist. 

None of these simplistic descriptions hint at the quality of the movie in any way. So you don't like it, but you haven't really portrayed *what it is* about the movie that you didn't like. That's why you'll get people biting your head off, for stating your opinion this way. &&> It's one giant car chase.

And Apocalypto is just a foot chase....&&You can make anything simple and lame sounding by just saying things like “it’s one giant car chase”. &&>can't be overrated if MOST people rate it high.

That's literally the only way it *can* be overrated. Something that is rated poorly can't be overrated (unless it's really bad).
&&What previous mad max movies did you watch and like&&Pipelines can be blown up (see also: Basra) and/or tapped (see also: Kurdistan).&&""It's got such great worldbuilding!""

The cinematography... Everything it was just great.&&I don't think I've ever been swept away so effectively by a movie that features almost nothing but nonstop action. I've said it before about this movie, but I'll say it again. Some movies are style over substance - for Mad Max, the style *was* the substance.&&I hope they realize what Mad Max is though. Charlize Theron's character was great but no need to continue her. Mad Max has always been parts of his life. Character move in and out. &&I absolutely loved Mad Max Fury Road, but BR2049 came at the perfect time for me. The story affected me so personally, and the film itself came out around my 18th birthday (a time when I was really doubting myself and my dream of becoming a filmmaker). The film inspired me on a spiritual level, and continues to reassure me of the future. During my lowest moments, rewatching it reminds me that I have a future as a filmmaker to focus on. So yeah, I may be just a *little* biased.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3916  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/00713)&&Yep, also there are so many phenomenal sci fi flicks that have come out in the last 10 years that they're overshadowed by that as well. So, instead of trying to be serious sci fi flicks and competing with the likes of Her, Blade Runner 2049, Fury Road, Predestination, and Ex Machina(the list goes on and on) they make comical action flicks. They're absolutely enjoyable, but as you say, they keep it safe and don't really try anything new.&&THIS!I feel like a sci-fi movie should be used to invent new techniques for story-telling on film. That's why Avatar is a better sci-fi movie than the new SW movies. I like the story much more in SW, but they're playing really safe. Like, I'd say A Scanner Darkly is more of a sci-fi movie than the prequels because of the new effect for visual story-telling it was showing off. Lower budget science fiction movies should be like the kids dancing on the block, lending their moves to higher budget science fiction movies who can show off their moonwalk.&&The OG trilogy was made by a bunch of passionate artists and it was a big risk because it was so weird. The new movies are shaped by a massive corporation and marketing researchers and they are just so soulless.&&I think it depends on your age group - For older people even including the prequals there was a lot to like/invest in with the star wars movies... The newer ones not so much.

Kids grew up in a completly different media landscape where Star Wars is just another franchise rather than THE franchise.&&I would argue the originals are a little more nuanced and mature/serious than what we have been getting recently. 

Also the originals have the added benefit of creating the universe, all the new ones have to do is live in it. I've found the new films quite disappointing.&&[deleted]&&> Star Wars was never more than ""just fun"". Apart from the massive EU for us nerds to sperg out over, it's just a load of cool pewpew and laser sword fights wrapped around a simple plot. Nothing much has changed in that regard.

I would argue against this. The original trilogy was a simple conflict, but we got to fall in love with and grow with the characters, including the final film where Luke's decision to try and sacrifice himself to redeem his father is one of the most powerful moments in cinema I've ever seen. The prequels had a lot of faults, but what I do love about them is that they really showcase how the faults of a government can lead to total collapse. I love the ambiguity of the prequels in terms of who's really responsible for the fall of the Republic - Palpatine as the organizer, the Senate for giving him power, the Jedi for not seeing what was happening and relying too much on dogma, Anakin's attachments, etc. Not to mention the prequels made Anakin morally ambiguous. How many other films do we have the protagonist in a rage over the torture and death of his mother that he believed he could have prevented kill an entire village (for both those that allowed her to die and those who were innocent)? 

I don't like these new Star Wars films, and I thought ""The Last Jedi"" was easily one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. &&You can probably simplify most movies into a statement like this...but saying this movie is a giant car chase is less of a simplification than most, I feel like.
Although there is a ton of praise for it in this thread so clearly I need to give it another shot with a more open mind.

Some of the better marvel films are a much more entertaining blend of comedy and action than the new star wars movies.

If they didn't have the starwars branding and nostalgia I think they'd just be seen as middle of the road sci fi action movies which don't do anything particularly well.&&I know you said the list goes on and on, but to add to that list, Inception, Arrival, Interstellar (I know some people dislike it, but it’s a better sci-fi film than the new Star Wars movies), and The Martian are definitely some good science fiction movies from the past decade.&&At the beginning it’s almost like the outback is the villain.

It had a Star Trek label, but if you swapped the names out of the script, it would just be a generic action film. Not bad, but missing the point of the original. Hilariously, the Star Trek Beyond trailer scaled this up to 11 with motorcycle chases, sitcom jokes, and rock music.

The girls also talks about the ""green place"", I would say the contrast between the desert and the green of the citadel and the absent of green in the green place is a pretty big visual point that's completely absent from the B&W.  

No saying the B&W doesn't have it's place but like you I think the couloured version is the superior version.&&Have to agree with this. As an Australian who has spent a lot of time in and around the outback, the red tones in the original edition are pretty significant.

I just don't see the appeal.&&Basically the same thing &&It's certainly the least epic in scale, but it felt the most like original Trek, the thing they are supposed to be remaking. I got vibes like JJ was trying to prove his capability to direct Star Wars with 2009 and Into Darkness. As a result, they feel like action adventure films with a strange Star Trek label. Not to say 2009 is bad, but Beyond is much more 'Trek'. Everyone was relatively in-character  (Spock stopped getting pissed all the time) and they killed off the stupid romance plot. The fact that they spend the whole movie around one planet really gives it a ""Star Trek: Insurrection"" vibe, but obviously with a bit more action. Sure, the first two felt more 'epic', but Beyond felt way more restrained. That restraint made it all the more epic when they finally let loose and destroyed the drone swarm with the power of the Beastie Boys.&&Fruity legs spreda&&Loved it, such a good film.&&Well that wasn't too bad...&&I can't see anything thats happening,its very dark&&[deleted]&&Little box of happiness &&Sounds like he was snapping off a turd not a head. &&It's really more about the atmosphere of the movie.

Phase 1 Unbreakable 

Phase 2 Split

Phase 3 Glass

Phase 4 Avatar Sequel&&It’s 2018 and one of my most anticipated upcoming movies is from M Night Shyamalan. Who woulda thought?&&I love how they’re taking the ‘grounded superhero movie’ trope to the next level here. This actually looks to be really good.&&I love that Shyamalan has created his own little 'comic book' universe over these three films, using the typical tropes like alliterative names (David Dunn, Casey Cooke) and colour imagery (Green for good, purple for the villain etc) to say the least. Really excited to see this one and have it all rounded off after the two origin stories. &&“Oof my bones” - Mr.Glass&&The hype for this is going to be insane. A secret trilogy 19 years in the making.&&""It's a growing field...""

So, this may be a trilogy with Glass, Dunn and Crumb but it sounds like if this movie does well, there could be other stories featuring other Supers. If this movie sticks the landing and makes bank and they do expand out, I will go to every single of them like the way I do with Marvel. &&So I’m guessing I really need to watch split?? I have seen unbreakable which was phenomenal. &&I thought it was kinda weird when Bruce Willis said ""fuck batman"". &&if this guy on twitter happens to be right about a certain character it has to be the fastest solve in the history of film

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UpYktD8.png)&&As soon as Elijah said ""that sounds like the bad guys are teaming up"" I fucking shat myself.

Holy shit the hype is REAL.&&Unbreakable was a superhero movie that we didn’t know was a superhero movie.


Split was a sequel that we didn’t know was a sequel.


What kind of movie don’t we know that Glass is?&&REEEJOOICEEE&&Please don’t suck Please don’t suck Please don’t suck &&FUCK YES FINALLY&&I think I need to rewatch Unbreakable…&&John Wick 3 & Glass.

Two insanely great trilogies ending a few months apart in 2019. I can't wait. &&I thought Bruce was Gregg Popovich for a second.

But this trailer got me hyped. I’m hoping for this to be pretty good. I never thought I would be so hyped to watch a Shyamalan movie again.&&Hopefully they don't spend the majority of the movie in the psychiatric facility. Looks like they won't, thankfully, but I really want to see these characters out in the world!&&༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE GLASS ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE GLASS ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE GLASS ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ 
&&Post-credits scene, Mr. Glass is in prison. He gets a visit from David Dunn. They have a brief exchange about good and evil, morality, yada yada. As David turns to leave, Mr. Glass says ""You remind me of my brother.""

Cut to New York. A man gets out of an SUV. He's also played by Samuel L. Jackson. It's Mr. Glass's *twin* brother. Suddenly, he starts to disappear. But he manages to send out an emergency alert on a pager at the last second.

The Captain Marvel symbol flashes on the pager.

Cut to black. The words ""David Dunn will return in Avengers 4"" appear on the screen.

This wasn't just a stealth Unbreakable trilogy. It was a stealth addition to the MCU.&&Fucking loved the end of Unbreakable.

(spoiler)

>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.&&One thing I noticed about color: each character has a respective color. Glass is purple, Dunn is green, and Crumb is yellow. Purple and yellow are complementary colors, and Glass and The Beast are teaming up. So I was wondering about Dunn and who he might team up with, and remembered Casey. And look what color she's wearing in all of her appearances: red. Complementary to green.&&Surprise twist:  This paves the way for a universe in which Joaquin Phoenix's character in Signs becomes the Joker and ends up being the one to take out Mr. Glass with the same bat.  Not because he's trying to stop the bad guy, he just likes the sound of his bones breaking.&&Hope Anya has a large part!&&I literally just finished watching Split for the first time, not knowing it had any connection to unbreakable until the end scene. Then I immediately googled to find out if there was going to be a sequel, watched the first teaser trailer and now I stumble across this.

That's some baader-meinhoff shit for sure.&&It's especially rare that I've been hyped for a January movie, yet this is promising.&&Raincoat **F** **L** **A** **P** **P** **I** **N**&&A few thoughts: 

Unbreakable was such an underrated movie and completely before it's time. 

I'm still surprised James McAvoy didn't get an award for his performance in Split.

I'm so pumped let's go baby I can't wait for GLASS! &&Surprise twist. Haley Joel Osment is a groundskeeper at the graveyard. Alias: Medium&&Wow, the showcase of their abilities was so unexpected but fucking awesome I was hyped before but now I'm completely sold.&&The ending of Split was genuinely one of the only jaw dropping experiences I've ever had. I have a lot of hype and hope for this movie looks great can't wait.&&Well come on, we can all admit that this looks pretty fucking cool.&&Oh man did this live up to the hype.&&[deleted]&&I’m going to scream like Howard Dean. I’m so excited for this!&&*Please be good, Please be good, Please be good.*&&This might just become a perfect trilogy guys.

By M. Night.

Is this real life?&&I am very happy to have been wrong about M Night. I was one of those people, who was just ready to write this dude off forever. Then I heard good things about SPLIT. And the idea of a return to form had me intrigued. 

SPLIT was way too competently made for me to have written him off and he finally managed a twist that both made the movie better, and made it a sequel/side-quel to Unbreakable (personal favorite of his work).

I think he's learned what his strengths and his weaknesses are, and I for one am absolutely thrilled to be wrong because the auter who showed so much promise back in the early 2000s is back. He's not the same guy who starred in a faux-doc implying he had superpowers. &&I can't fucking wait. Hope to god people start to appreciate Shyamalan again. 

M Night gets more undeserved hate than any director because we want to know what to expect from our directors, and from him, we've come to expect twists and surprises- mostly because of one phenomenal movie and him trying to partially replicate that. 

But that's not what makes him great. What makes an M. Night movie isn't the twist, it's the subtext. A lot of movies have a loose kind of subtext- a collection of metaphors that try to carry meaning and enrich the storyline and how the characters are feeling, etc.

Shyamalan movies don't have a subtext hidden below the main plot. They *live* in their subtext and have a plot grown over that- **it's half the goddamn movie and nobody ever pays attention to it because they're looking for the big reveal**. 

It's why, when they work, his movies just leave you feeling wrung out and exhausted- everything you see is colored by that subtext. People and their motivations can be so fucking rich in a Shyamalan movie that you barely understand it. Here's what I mean:

Sixth Sense is about a kid who sees ghosts, and it's also about a kid figuring out how to make a place in a world without his father. Dad's recent death or sudden disappearance is NEVER mentioned in the movie, but it's obvious that it happened... kid goes around with dad's old watch for god's sake. The fact that it is completely ignored by the kid and his mom tells us more than them talking about it ever could- it is fresh and a source of real, constant, intolerable pain for them. They're in some kind of shared pathological denial about it. 

That's why they always seem at the verge of tears- because they really are barely keeping it together. Dad is gone and their world has been destroyed. 

The boy's learning to deal with it is told in reflections- mostly how he relates with his ""therapist"", who is both a surrogate father who can never replace his real dad, [and a literal ghost who can never be a real person, even though for a while... boy it really seems like it](#spoiler).  It's also told in how he reacts to friends, his teacher, and the challenges in his normal life. 

In the end, when he tells his mother. He's telling his mother he sees ghosts, but he's also confessing something much deeper- he's opening up about something the two of them have been suffering in silent denial  about- everywhere he looks he sees someone that should be there but is not. 

Why does the mom just break down and cry right away in that scene? She's right there with him- she's dealing with the same thing. 

I swear to god, ALL Shyamalan's movies are like this...pay attention and there's something more in all of them. &&McAvoy is shredded!&&Holy shit this looks so fucking good&&I don’t think SamJack would’ve come back unless the script was legit. The man doesn’t do anything nowadays that isn’t legit. &&Shyamalan has had his ups and (waaay) downs, but Unbreakable has always been my favorite of his, Split was good, and this trailer looks fantastic.&&Omg this is why I love the film industry and these awesome people who make shit like this possible. I always wanted more and never expected it. This just became an awesome day.&&I guess it’s time to see Unbreakable and Split, huh?&&No better feeling than seeing Split without knowing it was a sequel until the end. Best reveal I can remember in a film that really surprised me.&&FUCK.

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!


&&I was really hoping he would end with ""They call me Mr. Glass""&&Woman! Where is my super villain suit?!?!&&This reads less as a typical M. Night Shyamalan film and more like his version of an action movie compared to his legacy films, but I like it. 

And this premise makes me want to see greater inclusion of his past projects. Which is possible given that nearly everything but The Last Airbender takes place in Pennsylvania, if not Philadelphia proper. 

I mean, a grown up Cole Sear (The Sixth Sense) could definitely be one of Dr. Staple's patients. Maybe Morgan Hess (Signs) developed abilities from his encounter with extraterrestrials. Heck, maybe Staple managed to find her way out of Covington (The Village), which is why she's fascinated by and studies minds with a warped and delusional perception of reality.

It's all connected!&&Unbreakable split glass... Can't wait for the box set. &&This has an x-men 2000 feel i like it&&I'd love to hear some predictions for the twist in the end.&&Shyamalan's Ultimate twist is the one where hopefully Bruce Willis gives a good performance again.

Movie looks great though&&The trailer rocks, and has my attention. The characters feel threatening yet vulnerable thanks to the tone, and its in a good way.

The way James switches personalities is just great and awesome&&Holy shit, that’s a GOOD god damn trailer right there. &&SP: ""I specialize in people who believe they are superheros.""

Patricia: ""Good for you.""

SHADE&&I'm really looking forward to see Hedwig again! loll He's so unsettling yet funny. James McAvoy gives the character such great presence on screen. &&One of those personalities sounded like a perfect imitation of Logan Paul.&&It's goddamn amazing that when you see him you know the personality before he even speaks.  The personalities themselves are separate characters.  They are all The Horde played by one actor as one main character but they are each their own character in the film as well.  Each one significantly different and driving the story in their own specific way.

The very beginning shot of the trailer with all them sitting in the pink room.  You can see The Horde with his arms crossed looking pissed off.  That's Dennis.  Then when it cuts you see him sitting with his legs crossed and proper.  He gives a little clap and speaks.  That's Patricia.&&can we give him his fucking oscar this time  

No nomination even for Split is one of the most egregious snubs in like the last decade and I don't even think i'm exaggerating. He is Lecter level in that film. &&I worked on the set of this movie and McAvoy was AMAZING. All of the characters are phenomenal but J. McAvoy is next level &&Can't wait to see him play more of the personalities.&&""Sun's getting real low, sun's going down...""&&They’re practically the same because they were both “broken”  (Kevin being abused by his mother; Casey being sexually abused by her uncle) to the point were the Beast saw them as pure and/or “more evolved”. 

So, either Casey might have the ability to (no pun intended) tame the Beast inside Kevin, OR, maybe Kevin can coax something of a “Beast” out of Casey. 

&&I don't care if she's here to calm him. I wanted her in this movie to see that fucker of her uncle be pulverized. 

Nothing happening to him made me dislike Split until you know Dunn shows up. &&She was scary as hell in The Witch. &&Last time he cared was....*Moonrise Kingdom* probably?&&When’s the last time he actually tried? I remember really liking him in Looper and Moonrise Kingdom and that was back in 2012?&&Fun fact: Die Hard had it's general release 30 years ago today.&&And Samuel Jackson with hair!&&I'll send you to Billy's&&Has a preview of everything but not enough to ruin it.

Loved seeing the Beast run like a beast.&&> That was a wonderful ~~trailer~~ Sarah Paulson.&&Also an original superhero franchise that was 19 years secretly in the making, that was bridged with a thriller horror movie &&About time.&&So much this. I mean I love the Marvel universe, and some DC movies and shows, but an all original Comic Book movie feels so, so long overdo with today's effects and big budgets behind films.

Let's be real- M Night has done some terrible movies, but he is also very capable of making a fantastic film that sticks with you for a very long time. 

Unbreakable was terrific all around, and I at first scoffed at Split, but Mcavoy puts so much effort into the role that it's wildly entertaining every moment he's on screen. 

Seeing all of this come together in an original film with a big budget is incredible. I hope it's as good as the hype will lead it up to be. &&The twist is the Lady In The Water shows up at the end.&&What a twist!

Edit: This twist is also a twist. It was all a dream that we’ve been having while in a coma caused by The Last Airbender.&&The Shyamalanaissance has begun&&And The Cubs won The World Series, then Donald Trump was elected president.

I remember like 15 years ago reading on AICN that Unbreakable was a planned trilogy and being incredibly sad we’d never get to see it. &&Next thing you know we're gonna see a fantastic DCEU movie trailer and get hyped for that too

*eyes Aquaman hopefully*&&Time is a flat circle.&&So grounded they were imprisoned. &&I’m not too sure about the purple for the villain color imagery. If you’re referring to Mr. Glass wearing purple, I believe Samuel L. Jackson requested Shyamalan to incorporate purple into the character. I think it’s his favorite color and he just wants a bit of purple in his characters, like how Mace Windu from the Star Wars prequels had a purple lightsaber.&&I watch superhero movies but I don't read the comics. You just blew my mind. Peter Parker! Red it good!&&Ever since I first saw Unbreakable I've loved it and Shyamalan for what it represents. There's just something so cool to me about creating a new and realistic comic book universe. All the comic book movies releases in the last decade or so are all fun, but they're *very* ""comic book-y"", if that makes sense. Shyamalan takes all the cliches and tropes of superheroes and turns them into realistic characteristics. I'm sure there are other movies and directors/writers who have done this as well, but back in 2000 it was a pretty novel concept on the screen.

I loved the first two and I'm absolutely psyched for this one. &&Bonehurting juice&&He need some milk&&thank mr skeletal&&""the world will tremble bef- AHHH, MY BONES.... my only regret is that I have.... Boneitus...."" &&>going to be

Unbreakable is one of my top 5 favorite movies. I've been hyped since the ending of split. Can't wait!&&Without spoiling the movie, does split involve any aspect of unbreakable?&&# #Shyamalanaissance&&betting that Sarah Paulson becomes either a hero or a villain in this because she finally realizes that they are superhuman and it shatters her view of the world, triggering some sort of latent power.

But like others have said, if Haley Joel Osment's sixth sense character was incorporated as an adult at the very end, I think theater crowds would explode. &&They could bring back Haley Joel Osment. Have ghost Bruce Willis be Unbreakable's twin. Throw the Lady in the Water in there as well. Now you have a super team.&&We saw in *Unbreakable* that Elijah had caused a great deal more tragedies than just the train wreck. With the hints and inferences that the Horde has a tie to the Eastrail incident it opens room for many other people to have been affected. The only reason we don't know about them is Glass was single-mindedly focused on finding his counterpart.&&That's a yes. Very interesting flick and well worth a watch. James McAvoy does a stellar job.&&Split is amazing and James McAvoy should have got an Oscar&&Definitely required viewing.&&She looks for people claiming to be Supers and cures them?
She a power eater. That's her power, she's amassing power from others. Boom. And she's taken power from 4 other supers already so, if she takes these 3 as well, at the end she will have a Seventh Sense.&&Wait, why would that be significant?&&M. Knight uses the color red to show that there's danger or evil nearby.  Note her hair color.&&Yeah I hope they make that “reveal” early on in the movie. She’s either Rogue or Xavier of questionable disposition. &&in that knowing way. with a sam jackson wink to the camera kind of way. could have sounded cheesy as hell but really reiterates that this is a world where comics and superheroes both exist.&&""ARE YOU SAYING THIS IS SOME

&&Given the nature of how suprising these Revelations are, we won't know it's a sports anime. &&Lady in the Water prequel&&You are different from the rest! Your heart is pure!&&The beast is coming!&&The trailer and other marketing looks great. I have high hopes.&&...now we wait for 6 months.&&I think i need to finally watch unbreakable haven't seen it&&Is it confirmed that either of those movies are the last one? Who knows, maybe they make tons of money and gets another sequel&&To be fair Pop does go out at night to beat up criminals&&""He got me,” Fans said of Shyamalan returning to form over them. ""That f***ing Shyamalan boomed me.""

Fans added, “He’s so twisty,” repeating it four times.

Fans then said they wanted to add Shyamalan to the list of directors they jack off to this winter.&&Dude Pop is a super hero whether he gets his own movie or not&&That trailer seemed like it could barely contain the amount of plot and individual scenes. It'll be interesting to see how it all comes together since both Unbreakable and Split were fairly slow, long scene, few settings type of movies.&&I know what you mean, but I wouldn't mind say the majority of the first act being there, would allow for some great character interactions in a confined environment.&&༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE MISTER ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE MISTER ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ GIVE MISTER ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ&&We are all blessed on this day.&&[deleted]&&Hilarious, but I think David Dunn would be seriously underpowered in the MCU.&&We also need to establish that their father was Frozone &&The fucking chills I get from that scene! Jackson is a really good actor, he should take roles like this more often (he was also really good in Kingsman)&&I think [this comic](http://montages.no/files/2014/06/comic-book-1.jpg) from Unbreakable will be the major theme of the movie. The green hero (Dunn) versus the yellow villain (Crumb), with the background being purple, as Elijah is the one who is the backdrop for their conflict.&&When the Unbreakable music cues up, I lost my fucking MIND.&&Bones **S N A P P I N**&&BYAAHHHH&&thats the twist&&>I am very happy to have been wrong about M Night. 

No director that can make even that first scene of ""Unbreakable"" can be that bad. You need some smarts and conviction to pull that of. &&...What about that Mark Wahlberg one with the suicide plants?&&My dislike was him trying to live up to the ""what a twist!"" hype and trying to apply weak twists to his movies.  &&That's possible I guess but the mom was also constantly on the verge of tears and cried at the end because her son was frequently having these terrible episodes and screaming and shaking for apparently no reason and she didn't know what was wrong with him or how to help him.

She's cries at the end because she's relieved to finally understand and because he literally just told her something about her dead mother he couldn't possibly know &&It’s a comment like this that makes me know to stay clear of any  comment threads regarding this movie until premiere.&&...and then, Aang woke up.&&They go after Willis' characters son cause its a classic comic book trope, but its revealed he has powers too&&There’s a scene where the psychiatrist grabs what seems to be David Dunn’s hand to help him out of the water.

I’m guessing that’s the first time the touch in the whole movie, and he’ll know all the awful things she’s done. It’s gonna be gnarly, and I’m going to love it.&&The sass levels off the charts!&&Trailer was good but how is this a real area for any psychiatrist to specialize? There are apparently 3 people who believe they’re superheroes in the entire world lol &&I thought Patricia was a fantastic character in Split. When she was on screen I was absorbed into it to the point I both forgot it was McAvoy, and unquestioningly perceived her as a “she”. All despite the fact that it is clearly McAvoy in a dress.&&Et-thetera&&""We almost got you bro!"" 

Sounds like a precursor to ""It was only a prank bro!!"" &&Yeah I reckon that one's gonna be some comic relief too

Maybe we'll see him bully Hedwig :(&&Split really only focused on a couple of his personalities,  i hope we get to see all 23 of them in this movie. &&Professor Xs always miss out on nominations they deserve.&&I was cracking up hysterically when Thor tried to use that in the arena in Ragnarok. That cheesey smile he gives before the Hulk starts tossing him like a rag doll was perfect&&Yeah, the expression on Casey's face from the moment the Beast spares her until the last shot of her in the film is...ambiguous. It's hard to gauge what her feelings about him actually are, and it may or may not be significant that we cut directly from that shot of her in the police car to a shot of a statue of two lions - one male, one female.&&Seems like it, although it’s hard to tell because his character in it had stopped caring about life and work.&&Or Looper&&Never saw moonrise kingdom... but sixteen blocks he knocked it out of the park&&It’s whenever he has hair in a film when he gives an invested performance.&&Saw it in the theater.

Blew my hair right the fuck back. Hadn't ever seen a movie like it before.&&Bruce Willis said this week that Die Hard isn't a Christmas movie.

.....He's too far gone now.&&Never forget Nakatomi Plaza&&Now that’s a reference I haven’t heard in a long time...&&Reminded me of Sabertooth from Wolverine&&Her name is Sarah Paulson. &&I think Marvel is really missing out on connecting their franchise without using a horror flick. Like Action is dope, Comedy is great but damn a horror super hero flick from one of the big names would be fucking great. Just adds to the complex tone of that franchise.&&19 years secretly in the making is very deceptive. It sounds like he's been working for 19 years to get this together. It's much more on the lines of 1. Planning on expanding the unbreakable universe 2. Having the idea to include a reference to unbreakable in split and 3. Thank God the popularity of split allows you to make glass.&&In the end, it's a movie by a Director who has always given us a twist at the end... 

They are nothing but crazy psychopaths... mindplay.&&It's legitimately part of why I'm excited for this. &&There really isn’t much else, is there? It’s a bummer. Super wasn’t exactly hero as much as terrifying and dark; KickAss was a while back and probably a comic book...

Edit I’m getting a lot of responses but none are franchises&&I have to say, I have a lot of respect for the man. It seems like his main priority is not making ""meh"" movies, and so failing spectacularly must not bear too heavily on him, as it's basically the cost of being ambitious. As someone who goes to the movies maybe 4 times a year max, I appreciate this a lot. I'd rather see something crash and burn than doing donuts in a parking lot. &&All his movies are connected

Lady in the Water is a superhero

Some weird dude was controlling the plants in The Happening this whole time, Swamp Thing style

Edit: Typo&&wait what if...&&That is really fun to say out loud.&&The Rational World ended in 2012.&&**slams 3 shots of vodka**

Alright, it all started with this fucking guerilla....&&In April of 2016, a weasel gnawed through a power cable of the Large Hadron Collider, forcing an emergency shut down. Now, I'm not saying that this caused our time continuum to be disrupted,  creating a new temporal event sequence that resulted in an alternate reality......but I'm not gonna rule it out either. 
&&I swear, David Bowie was holding the fabric of reality together.&&[Her screaming session during the Ellen show was everything tbh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Jfjpkbh8Q)&&*I'm not American, I'm not used to all this carnage!*&&Speaking of Avatar, someone should reboot the last air bender and focus on making a good film &&It's okay, those Avatar sequels are never happening anyways.&&2Signs2Furious&&I'd see another signs.

In any other context this would look like a disaster waiting to happen.&&No Mark Wahlberg, we're okay.&&Y'all can give the M Night shit for his 2000s, but he does bring something fresh to the table. Split was amazing and in line with Get Out New perspective on the genre of horror. 

(Although I still feel abused after the Last Air Bender)&&Is that from Robot Chicken?&&https://i.imgur.com/7DjqbKP.gifv&&It's funny you say that, because way back then a buddy of mine were spitballing ideas of how an Unbreakable sequel would even work.  All revolved around Glass recruiting a goon-like enforcer type in the mental asylum to escape with the help of a doctor he dupes.  &&The DC trailers have actually been pretty good. The movies not so much &&""He is too dangerous to be kept ~~alive~~ free"".&&It actually looks like he's intentionally going for a triadic colour scheme with Glass, Crumb, and Dunn being purple, orange, and green respectively. I don't think Sam Jackson's purple is an arbitrary decision.&&I don't think he means that purple means villain, just that the colors where chosen purposely to give each character a palette. Whether that is purple, red or blue is not as important as the fact that within the movie, you associate a palette of colors with each primary character.&&Bonehurting everything. &&My girlfriend hadn’t seen Unbreakable at the time we watched Split. She was confused when I jumped up and yelled “No fucking way!” &&I'll forever be mad at getting the ending spoiled on reddit a few hours before I went to watch it in theaters.&&A very small but very specific aspect, yes &&Awe man you are so lucky. Enjoy it. &&There’s a scene in the trailer where she grabs what seems to be David Dunn’s hands as he’s drowning in the water.


Speculation; this is the first time they touch in the film. He’s gonna see some daaaaaark shiiiiit.&&Sarah Paulsons character ends up as the villain and seemingly escapes justice and harm to go on about her life as the psychiatrist and she asks the next person sitting in her chair “and what is it you do?” And all we hear is “I see dead people”.&&> Haley Joel Osment's sixth sense character

Upthread they were saying that in Split there is a scene (which I don't remember) in which the Beast is at the train station where his father died, and that's the train accident in which Bruce Willis's character found his powers.  If the Beast has formed due to some vast sense of loss of his father, I would find it heartbreaking and wonderful if Haley Joel Osment's character was the only one able to tame the Beast, by simply using HIS superpower: allowing the dead father to possess him and talk to the Beast one last time.&&Please bring back the wind as a reformed villain. &&The after credits scene will be all of the Beast's victims reaching out to an adult Haley Joel Osment.&&Mark Wahlberg&&And Joaquin Phoenix too, to fight the alien invaders of course &&I'm legit a pussy; how scary is it?&&All for One.&&But the seventh sense gives her gills so she has to live as a Lady in the Water&&I want to believe your theory. It's a good one.&&If M.Knight is truly aware, this will end with UNITED STATES OF SMASH&&well if she isnt what she says she is maybe shes trying to orchestrate things much like Glass did in Unbreakable or Zemo in Civil War. Night likes to hide things in plain sight, her secretly being active and not passive might make sense.  &&also, he uses wheelchairs as a sign of not being able to walk, which is why mr glass can’t walk&&And Mr. Glass' single most defining character trait is almost psychotic worship of comic books.&&""Three Brothers: --""... ""Three Brothers."" It's just called, ""Three Bro-""^haha&&Rejoice!!! The broken are more evolved!&&I think there's too much at stake for Shyamalan to mess this up&&Is the most realistic origin story of all the comic book movie thing. It is slow, but very well filmed. Because it is realistic, every little thing can have grave consequences (kitchen, gun, child). &&It is not an action movie.  It is slow and even meandering at times, just so you don't go in with the wrong expectations&&The year is 2043, *John Wick 28* & *Fast & Furious 32* are crossover films.&&The creator of John Wick stated that he always intended to make a trilogy.

M. Night also refers his 3 movies as a trilogy.&&For ""*Glass?*"" Yes.

M. Night refers to *Unbreakable, Split* and *Glass* as the ""Eastrail 177 Trilogy."" &&Night said Unbreakable was basically the first act of one movie. Going by that logic Split is the second act and Glass would be the third. 

And the third act is where the action usually happens in a movie. &&Isn't he basically Luke Cage? &&And it’s a strong man fighting a beast...&&Dennis' description of The Beast is note for note the same description used to describe Juggaro in the comic: Sharp nails, long mane of hair, super strong.....&&Seeing this is theatres as a 22 year old who didn't get to experience the darth vader twist, or the sixth sense, or anything like that, this was by far the most mind-blowing twist I ever saw in a movie. Unbreakable is one of my favourites&&Not very subtle, but humans are killing the earth. Earth fights back. Marky mark and Zooey Deschanel relationship killed, they fight back to reestablish it. Boom.&&Still really disappointed McAvoy didn't get any recognition for a best actor award. Dude was incredible. And he only played like 15 of the 30 personalities!&&I love Patricia. You just know he based her off someone he knows irl.&&[deleted]&&Sarah Paulson's character clearly says ""it's a growing field"" meaning more and more people are either deluded into believing they're superheros, or there's more ""superhumans"" out there. 

We don't know her intentions yet - maybe she's the one pulling the strings.&&Well she calls it a growing field and WAIT, she’s a villain too. &&> ""It was only a prank bro!!"" 

You murdered 87 people!&&No you leave my precious baby alone. &&I'm curious what will happen when Kevin shows up again. From Split, it seemed like Kevin didn't have the power to take over after a certain point (Patricia saying something like ""Kevin's not here right now"")... but I bet he can do it&&Huge Jackedman deserved one for Logan with good old Patty Stew as well. Awards mean jack shit tbh&&Then you hear it again in Deadpool. I'd very much like to see this become an ongoing trope across all movies. lol&&Thats a good movie detail, I never noticed that.&&[deleted]&&That's probably why he played that role so well&&Honestly that scene near the end of Moonrise Kingdom with him and the kid was some of the best acting he’s ever done. &&I think that was the point. Wes Anderson gave him the classical role of a police officer, which we've often identified Bruce Willis with, but turned it upside down. Instead of being violently direct, he is shy and avoid conflict. He's introverted. He doesn't live with a hot actress in a great apartment, but alone in a boat. He's nice, careful and emotional. Wes Anderson reversed the entire action hero-type.&&I'll never forget, the weekend that released Dredd 3D was also coming out. Saw them both on the same day. One of my favorite movie days ever. Especially since I had no expectations for Dredd and it blew me away.&&I liked Looper but it was rumoured that in addition to taking the highest salary, he absolutely refused to alter his performance in any way to match Joseph Gordon-Levitt. &&I really enjoyed Looper. Underappreciated sci-fi film.&&Definitely worth a watch&&'16 Blocks' would've been a great addition to the 'Die Hard' canon. It was an almost natural evolution for John McClane. Alas...&&Is it dumb that it's a not insignificant part of why I don't like Die Hard 4/5 (besides* the former being mediocre and the latter being terrible?)

John McClane never struck me as someone who would care enough to shave his head due to his balding.  &&This is also true of samuel l jackson.  Or more accurately, when his character has hair he is not just playing himself.  Usually...&&So you looked like Bruce Willis after?&&Anytime there is a Christmas party in a movie it's a Christmas movie.

If they could sort out the rights issues with Sony (they can’t, Sony is a shit show and they won’t let go of Spider-man and by extension Morbius) and the fox deal goes through (Ghost Rider) there could be a “Midnight Sons” sub-universe similar to the way The Defenders is in the MCU but not “of” the MCU...although I’d like a Doctor Strange slot in Midnight Sons, even if it’s more as a consultant of the occult and not directly in the “team”.&&Venom was a missed opportunity.&&I think that's the direction they're moving next with New Mutants.  It looks like it's going for that horror vibe.  Should be interesting.&&I mean technically its still right&&What if he pulls a Nolan and we get like a secret villan wolf or ape made of spikey grass?&&[deleted]&&It's been a while since Willis hasn't phoned in a performance, so that's got it going for me. Can't wait for January.&&Chronicle anyone ?&&Gotta respect a man who's willing to *swing away*.

...I'll see myself out.&&I agree. Not all of his works are hits, but at least the guy is relentless about doing this his way and not backing out. I have a similar appreciation for Tommy Wiseau. Dude made a legendarily bad movie, but he also has more passion for film than I've seen in a lot of directors.

So, good on them for taking risks.&&I've enjoy the majority of his movies. I didn't really like The Village but then again I didn't (and still don't) understand what is happening in it&&I'm annoyed that i like that idea as much as I do.&&I... I would watch the shit out of this. &&Dear God...&&The Lady in the Water and Signs both involve water to a significant degree...and water is David Dunn's biggest weakness.&&You know.... That would be so crazy and I might love that.&&I would love for the wind to return as a reformed villain. &&Add Village please&&Will Smith and Jaden Smith time travels to the main timeline to offer help in their scientology ship. &&The League of Shamalayanary Gentlemen&&Lady uses water.

2012 was real, it just didn't end like we expected. It was a *timeline shift*&&That's what the Mayans predicted! &&Everything changed once Bin Laden was killed. The US suddenly didn’t have a common enemy to rally around so the divide between liberals and conservatives suddenly grew larger.

Last time that happened is Looper i think. &&What?! Nooooo.&&Hey, we got the privilege of watching Mark Wahlberg talk to a plant!&&What if its actually the Trees that are giving people superpowers to weaponize them against humanity? What if a school teacher holds the key to defeating these superhumans?&&Would be cool if Knight included a quick 10 seconds ""meta-acknowledgement-of that-movie"" scene where in the asylum you see briefly in a room through the window in the door:

Mark Wahlberg's character sitting on a cot, maybe doing some trimming of a bonsai plant or just watering a plant.&&Perhaps I am in the minority here but I thought The Visit was pretty decent and signaled a return to form for him.&&I'm not convinced Glass is a villain. He accepted that role in order to find David, but he accomplished his goal. By his own logic, he can do anything, now.&&They're usually the best part of a DCEU movie. And you know what's funny,  the Wonder Woman trailer at the time seemed totally generic and just slightly ok and it turned out to be their best movie. Funny how that works.&&Yeah. It might have started out as just an actor request but at this point, it's definitely a creative choice.&&This was my fiancé and I. We rented it, and I just assumed there would be a twist due to M.Night. When it came, I start freaking out and she was confused. Turned out she had not seen Unbreakable. &&Mine too. She was like “yeah so Bruce Willis made a cameo, calm down*&&I've been spoiled by a ""friend"" on The Sixt Sense, think about that...&&But even aside from that, there are numerous hints throughout the movie that both characters may be connected to the same train accident from Unbreakable.&&I don't know. That would be great, but I think you've already got 2 villains, and she's trying to save him in that scene; it seems more like she would be a hero and team up with David Dunn so that she can take down the beast since his power stems from a psychological manifestation. That or Casey from Split ends up teaming up with him, maybe all 3. &&Holy shit.  At first I read this thinking “that’s a little cheesy, isn’t it?”  But then I thought, Split literally ended with Bruce Willis having one line, so why not have what is arguably one of the most iconic lines in cinema history?&&But Bruce Willis played two different characters in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.

""Eat this""&&PlUs UlTrA!!!~~~~&&I’m actually watching that show as I read this thread. &&Her last name is Staple, so like the staples in a comic book she brings everything together.&&She's going to say key words to McAvoy character to unleash the Beast.&&holy shit I didn't even think of that&&Oh nice yeah just need to know more about those characters before Glass also because i love James mcavoy's work &&Man, a John Wick/FandF crossover could be really neat fun. Have John pick off all of the FF crew one by one until a hand to hand showdown with Tyrese in the last minute.&&This universe could be very easy to expand upon if they really wanted to. This ‘Eastrail trilogy’ could be completed but other movies carry out the universe.&&Potentially? The only thing we really see in Unbreakable is that he's unrealistically strong. If you go back and watch his weightlifting scenes, though, he struggles a lot to lift that much weight. His real ""super-power"" is mostly being able to sense someone's crimes by touching them and being insanely hard to kill. However, his Kryptonite, so to speak, is something that is insanely abundant and common on our planet. It wouldn't be hard at all for supervillains like we've already seen in the MCU to get a tank of water, or a bucket of water, or something like that, and defeat him easily. It takes him too long to fight back, and it's too easy to introduce his weakness into any scenario.

When he kills the criminal at the end of Unbreakable, he didn't exactly overpower the dude. He just held on to the guy's throat long enough to make him exhausted, then snapped his neck. He takes too long to really reach his potential of strength. He would leave so many windows for MCU villains to get an advantage and defeat him. He would be incredibly outscaled in the MCU, at least from what we've seen.&&Holy shit. &&I feel bad for the people that won't get to experience the movies like this. &&He basically got to go ham. It worked out great, don’t get wrong. But he went full ham. The academy typically looks for more nuanced performances because it’s “character study” etc. blah blah blah. I’m not saying McAvoy didn’t crush it. I’m saying his characters role wasn’t something the academy typically rewards because it was over the top. &&Yeah but for a 90 minute run time you only have so much screen time for the personalities that are significant to the story. Showing all 23 personalities would just be madness. Unironically.

M. Night said he also wrote and filmed a subplot with Dr. Fletcher involving a love interest, but he cut it out because he didn't want to stray away from the action. So including a scene or scenes with every single personality would be a chore to the run time as well as the story.&&Oh man, can you imagine the shit storm if it got out who it was. &&>more and more people are either deluded into believing they're superheros

thanks ~~Obama~~ marvels&&JUST A PRANK!!!&&> You murdered 87 people!

""Yeah but the camera is right over there!""&&I fucking lost it when Deadpool said it. It was hilarious and unexpected as fuck. Deadpool 2 truly shined. &&He cared so little that it created a shift in space-time that brought him back to caring.&&It's like Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire; the desperate self-deceiver giving a front of confidence to sell something.

Some roles are just so perfectly casted. And then there's Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker’s Dracula.&&Agree, Dredd was a lot better than expected. Saw it at the local ""cheap theater"" (shows films a week or two after they leave other theaters at a discounted price) thinking it would be a generic action movie, but I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.&&Dredd is one of the few movies where I was watching it at home and was kicking myself for not watching it in theater...made sure I went for more movies later. Arrival and mad max made up for it. &&Dredd was amazing, rented it and still loved it&&I did the same! I know not everyone can afford the time but I highly recommend that more people fashion their own double-features. There's something about a day at the movies that's just rad.

I was consistently taken out of my screening of Looper because someone sitting in the same aisle was basically flopping around like a fish (ala fake Youtube reactioners) over every little plot development but I still loved it. Dredd took me a little longer to appreciate but it stuck with me and I really love what they managed to pull off.&&The thing about Dredd that stood out to me the most was the homeless guy in the beginning ish of the movie. Everyone always says Dredd was a hardass that didn't care at all. In this instance you see Dredd tell the dude to get the fuck out of there or he's going to be judged, then when Dredd shows back up does he say to get up to the homeless guy to go to jail. Really helped humanize Dredd instead of being a no nonsense asshole.&&Not just his performance. He was supposed to wear makeup and prosthetics to make him look more like JGL, the way that JGL wore them to make him look more like Willis. But Willis refused.&&Looper is fantastic &&[Yeah but Timecop was better.](https://youtu.be/07vNw7zc-ac)&&> Underappreciated sci-fi film.

Not on fucking /r/movies it isn't.&&I actually thought Behind Enemy Lines was a good movie, but the director John Moore is now also responsible for a PG-13 Max Payne and making John ""Oh God, please don't let me die..."" McClane invincible. &&Die Hard 4 is solid fun, if not just because Timothy Olyphant was a great villain. PG-13 rating kinda sucked though.&&Ghostrider isn't with Fox.  He's in Agents of Shield, so Disney definitely has him. && I am honestly surprised that we do not have a new Blade trilogy already, I figured as soon as Wesley Snipes got out of jail he'd be popping those things out like Saturday morning specials.&&The best of all the rights &&Seriously. Maybe Looper tho? But regardless, Unbreakable was so good, and he was great in it. &&Honestly it sounds like the shittiest idea I’ve ever heard....

like how he didn't know how much weight he was really lifting cuz his kid kept adding more. If that's the case then his potential could be Limitless&&> he struggles a lot to lift that much weight

He does, but he's kind of struggling from the beginning. Like at first he struggles to lift 200 lbs or whatever, then goes up to like 350 or something and struggles there, too. So it's kind of hard to say how it works. But yeah his power seems to be more his senses and probably his actually ""unbreakable-ness,"" rather than strength.&&> However, his Kryptonite, so to speak, is something that is insanely abundant and common on our planet.

This is more or less me expressing how annoyed I was at the academy not recognizing the talent and skill it takes to be able to play that many characters in the run of a day. To be able to switch between so many characters at the drop of a dime is nothing to bat an eye at especially with how well he maintained them all throughout the film. It bothers me how little recognition the horror/thriller genre gets as well as comedy. I feel as if the academy turns there nose up at these genres as ‘something for lesser talented actors/actresses.&&""Never go full retard"", essentially.&&I have often thought that the '23 personalities' part was just a red herring and a pointer to the fact that he was supposed to be human (23 pairs of chromosomes & all).

But, it just doesn't feel like Die Hard to me. 

I get the desire to update the whole thing to 'John McClane in the 21st Century' with hackers and stuff, but, it just made the whole thing feel too slick for me. 

I'm not sure if it's just that the original three are so distinctly late 80's/early 90's that it's impossible to recapture properly, or if it's just some of the more .. outrageous moments (McClane on a fighter jet just feels off in a way that even absurd stunts in the earlier films don't). 

I just wish that for another Die Hard, which from what I gather they're still making, that they'd just put a bow on the whole thing; give Willis the hair piece, have it McClane's retirement day (go full cliche), and have it once again back in an isolated location. And hell, kill him at the end (.. ""Die Hard"" y'know). Get the actress who played his wife back in there, maybe .. Al? The police officer from Die Hard 1/2.

Disney Severs Ties With ‘Guardians Of The Galaxy’ Director James Gunn Over Old Offensive Tweets,50070,90ixfp,https://deadline.com/2018/07/james-gunn-fired-guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-offensive-tweets-1202430392/amp/,15121,1532114514.0,,"[James Gunn has responded.](https://www.thewrap.com/james-gunn-understand-accept-disneys-move-drop-guardians-galaxy/)

[Dave Bautista defends Gunn](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/guardians-galaxy-is-not-ok-james-gunns-firing-1128977?utm_source=twitter&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral)&&[deleted]&&Baskin Robbins always finds out...&&Gunn is scheduled to do a panel for a new movie he’s worked on at SDCC later tonight. I wonder if he’s gonna show up. &&The biggest news to come out of Comic Con&&>  James Gunn has been removed as director of the Guardians Of The Galaxy series after a batch of old social media dispatches were unearthed that touched on areas like pedophilia and rape.


Edit: Some of the tweets per [The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/james-gunn-apologizes-offensive-old-tweets-rape-pedophilia/)


> “Expendables is so manly I f—ed the s— out of the p-ssy boy next to me,”


> “The best thing about being raped is when you’re done being raped and it’s like ‘whew this feels great, not being raped!'” 


> “I remember my first NAMBLA meeting. It was the first time I felt ok being who I am,”


> “I’m doing a big Hollywood film adaptation of The Giving Tree with a happy ending — the tree grows back and gives the kid a b—job.”&&If I ever get famous, I am gonna scrub my Twitter first of all.&&Okay, now just 3,999 more layoffs and they’re good. &&So THAT was the Easter Egg&&This is why the golden rule is: never tweet&&He directed Super which shows a lot of the same humor and shock factor  and Disney was ok with having that director.&&Tip: When you get famous or get the sense that fame is incoming, scrub your old tweets. Hell, delete your account, and start a new one. 
&&I genuinely am glad there was no ""real"" internet when I was younger...&&James Gunn posted some messed up stuff, but did anyone not expect that from the dude whose debut was *Tromeo and Juliet*?&&Gunn said he meant it when he said he was sorry for the offensive tweets.

“I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies,” Gunn wrote. “For the record, when I made these shocking jokes, I wasn’t living them out.”

Gunn concluded his thread by saying, “I used to make a lot of offensive jokes. I don’t anymore. I don’t blame my past self for this, but I like myself more and feel like a more full human being and creator today. Love you to you all.”&&Does anyone else find it suspect that Gunn is fired immediately for these offensive tweets, while John Lasseter went on sabbatical for six months and is currently still with Disney/PIXAR as a temporary consultant?

It makes total sense for Disney to react to Gunn's tweets as they did (if nothing else, he should have deleted them once he was handed a family friendly franchise), but the two responses don't seem proportionate to me.

Edit: saying ""it makes total sense"" came off as more defensive of Disney than I intended. Their reaction was overzealous, and arguably hypocritical when you consider the precedents people mentioned in replies.

Gunn was fired. Lasseter ""decided [it was] the right time to begin focusing on new creative challenges"".&&They just noticed? I thought the mouse knew everything &&Just as Star Wars goes full Marvel with interconnected storytelling, Marvel goes full Star Wars with firing directors&&Why is Disney okay with firing Gunn but keeping Lasseter on as a consultant and Depp as an actor? For goodness sake Disney, quit trying to look like you have a moral compass&&What were the tweets?&&Famous people really shouldn't use twitter, nothing good can come of it.&&What did it cost?&&Taika Waititi to direct the next guardians?

Edit: Name correction

Edit 2: I should've made this comment on my main account. &&Twitter is garbage - a force of destruction only. Delete it.&&[Wait, he apologized in 2012 for these comments. These aren’t new and Disney is either bullshitting or ignorant of one of the directors of a big franchise apologizing to GLAAD.](https://www.glaad.org/blog/director-james-gunn-apologizes-anti-gay-and-sexist-comments-blog-post)&&Well, fuck.  

I just finished rewatching GotG Vol 2 last night, admiring just how powerful the emotional payoff is at the end. Was so looking forward to Vol 3. 

At least it will be his script. 

Man is it going to be awkward to be Sean Gunn on the first day of shooting. Everyone is going to give him that awkward slap on the back he gives Nebula....&&Social media is and will continue to be the cause of our downfall.  &&I mean, Disney knew what they were getting into when they brought him on in the first place. He came outta the Troma system, where you've basically got a rape / pedophilic quota you've gotta put in your movie. &&Update: Disney's dug into past comments by Walt Disney is now severing ties with itself. The company will dissolve by the end of the month.&&Question who the hell had time to search dudes potentially lengthy post history for these tweets? Dude should have known better than to tweet this kinda shit.&&just never ever use Twitter. like ever. its not worth the memes. &&yikes. mr. gunn I don't feel so good&&WHAAAAAA? For real? This is nuts.&&I didn't read his old tweets, so I don't know the full context.

Having said that, I don't love this recent trend of pulling up people's years old social media posts.  Its happening a lot with athletes, pulling up stuff they said at 15.  People change and grow up.

Its one thing if you pull up a huge example of hypocrisy or a politician doing a complete 180 on an issue.  A total separate thing to just dig it up for no reason

Edit:  I just read them. They are pretty bad.  But the fact that people dug them up ""To knock him down a peg"" is still problematic to me&&They actually did it. Holy fuck disney.&&Poor Gunn. If only he had done something more innocuous in the eyes of Disney, like beat the shit out of his wife. The he could be a pirate!&&You mean the guy who wrote Tromeo and Juliet and all manner of weird shit has tweeted some weird shit in the past? 

Shocker. 


Seriously though I’m really surprised it’s taken this long to come to light. What the fuck is going to happen with Guardians 3?&&Guess Disney needs to fire the writers of Family Guy now that they're buying Fox since they're always writing jokes about Quagmire and Herbert wanting to fuck children.&&Everyone keep quiet about RDJ's past. &&Firing someone over an offensive joke from 2009 is excessive.&&They are all like rejected Daniel Tosh jokes..&&I read some of the tweets and while you can tell they’re all jokes they’re still really weird and the the average person can see them as offensive. That and the jokes aren’t that funny.&&This is stunning. Very curious to see who they get to direct Vol 3 instead.

I'd be a little more worried about the director change if the Russos didn't emulate Gunn's style so flawlessly.&&I certainly have a warped and weird sense of humor, but why in the hell would people even want to joke about raping kids and shit? I mean, there's no context in the world where that can be considered even edgy humor. I've always liked the guy but fuck him. &&James Gunn is the heart and soul of the GOTG films. It won't be the same without his style/aesthetic. This is such a fucking bummer...&&So, I guess they’re cancelling guardians 3? I genuinely can’t see it being any good without his involvement. &&>My words of nearly a decade ago were, at the time, totally failed and unfortunate efforts to be provocative

Should I not watch disney movies anymore because a lot of their old cartoons were racist? Is that how this works, we just retroactively apply things that aren't relevant anymore.
&&I read articles like these and I hope that they just make the announcement and firing 'public' but really James Gunn or who ever is the current social media fuck up of the week gets to work behind closed doors and maybe just uses a fake name on the credits for a while. I don't see GotG working without Gunn. I don't think these sort of offensive tweets we find are indicative necessarily that the person is a piece of shit by default, just I think we probably should have never created a platform where you can type every thought, joke or what have you and it is available for the public eye. 

I don't think we can handle it. We all have shitty thoughts, don't lie to yourself. We've all had a thought, or created a joke, or something similar and we won't always realize that the thought is fucked up, or that the joke is terrible etc. It's almost like, what did we really expect would happen when we suddenly had a place to catalogue all these random thoughts and house them? &&Fuck Twitter.&&Sigh....

Sigh........

Suddenly everyone has forgotten James Gunn's career. 

I've met this dude literally the night before the meeting to bring him on for GotG at my job.  This was his humor at the time. These people lost their shit for no reason. 

It's James Gunn! You know, Tromeo & Juliette James Gunn. Slither James Gunn. PG Porn James Gunn. Super James Gunn.  Dawn of the Dead James Gunn. 

Tromaville Cafe James Gunn! For me, this is the face of Troma after Lloyd Kaufman.

The awesome James Gunn that no one gave a damn about until GotG, save us few fans. This was dark humor, nothing more. And frankly, I'm offended by the people who took offense to this and for Disney firing him.&&Oh shiiiiiiit.

Man that's bummer news. They must've been serious tweets or someone must have wanted him out ASAP (he's called out a lot of high profile people and Jared Leto a pedo iirc) and this was used as an excuse. You simply do not PRfuck with the Mouse

This is why ABC canceled Roseanne so quickly. The mouse has the best lawyers, marketing, and public relations that money can buy.&&Disney dithers on a lot of things, but they drop like a ton of bricks if they think their brand is threatened.  

Sometimes that gets them in more trouble, like when they tried to have the LA Times blacklisted for publishing an investigation about Disney's relationship with the Anaheim city council.  A bunch of major papers said they would stop reviewing their movies in protest, and they caved.&&Baskin Robbins don’t play&&no the article is updated now it says he's not going&&What’s the movie? *Bloodborne* speculation still? &&I thought Marvel Studios didn't have any Comic Con announcements this year?&&[deleted]&&It's actually the 2nd biggest, they announced The Clone Wars coming back&&He went back and deleted over 10,000 tweets.

I understand it's not appropriate especially in this day and age but these were 8-10 years ago. Crazy it led to him being let go. 

Edit: You know honestly after taking some time to think about it I think this is a shitty rash decision by Disney. The company that still employs someone like Johnny Depp. A guy that actually physically hurt people (his wife.) Also they can't act like this is some new news that they didn't know about. Hell there is [this article](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/guardians-galaxy-director-james-gunn-395796) from 2012 about a controversial thing he had done that he had wrote and thought was funny. &&""The internet's not written in pencil Mark, it's written in ink.""&&Honestly I scrub my Twitter every year or so not because I think anything is offensive but times change and so do my opinions. &&I'm kinda surprised it took so long for someone to point out the tweets.&&Get off social media now, don't wait until you're someone important.&&Delete Facebook, twitter, reddit

Such snowflakes&&The best joke in this thread.&&...I don't get it&&Dread it. Run from it. Disney still arrives.&&Serious question, if Disney now outputs 40% of what we'll now see in theaters, does this mean that Gunn is essentially blacklisted?&&Can someone explain this to all us idiots?&&son&&I genuinely don't understand how some people can have like 100k tweets. Even if you've had your account for 10 years, that's an average of almost 30 tweets per day. I mean, seriously, you can't possibly have that much interesting stuff to say.&&Don't Twit. &&Never tweet... 

... dozens if not hundreds of tweets about being a pedophile and raping(especially raping adolescents). 


Ugghhh. So many rules in life. Who can keep track? /s&&He also did that PG Porn series with Sasha Grey, so whoever was doing the background checks at Disney must've missed a lot.&&Disney was ok with it until everyone else wasn’t.&&Does anyone remember Lollipop Chainsaw?&&First, having worked in movies - Disney employs many, many executives who would be impossible to discern from actual, factual demonically possessed hellspawn. Their talent is hardly the source of evil at The Mouse.

Second - Peter Jackson made Meet the Feebles after he made Bad Taste and no one gave a shit.&&That movie had a scene where a girl rapes a guy. But twitter jokes are crossing the line apparently.&&The actual tip is to never post anything online you don't want your name and face to, even on Reddit.&&*digs up this dude's geocities&&If there's one thing for which I am forever grateful it's that I came of age before the invention of youtube.&&The only people surprised by this are the ones that didn't know who he was. I thought it was weird, but awesome, that Disney hired him for Guardians originally. &&There is literally a joke about Peter Quill masturbating/having sex and jizzing all over his spaceship that everyone else walks around in throughout all the movies.  That is a joke in one of the highest grossing Disney/Marvel movie...none of this bullshit makes any sense anymore.&&He doesn't blame anybody else. He doesn't blame people for being offended. He owns that what he said was offensive. He says he's changed and it seems like the last couple years of evidence makes that clear.

If he lays low for a few months and we still hear no complaints from the 100s of people he's worked with in the last 5 years, I think this is massive overkill on Disney's part.
&&Remember when jokes were jokes and bad jokes just meant you sucked at telling jokes but didn't mean you'd lose your job?&&[deleted]&&I’m sure there’s two decades of legal paperwork that made it very difficult to fire Lassiter, though &&According to some people I know who work at Pixar, John Lasseter isn't actually welcome back at Pixar, period.&&I wonder how much Gunn was going to get paid or the third movie? He delivered two blockbusters. I am willing to bet the third movie was going to give him a nice chunk of money. Now with him gone, Disney can hire another director at a fraction of the price. They seem to be banking that the third movie is going to make as much as the last two but with a cheaper director, they are looking at a higher profit. &&[deleted]&&I don't think it makes sense at all.

It's a website that somehow is more hellish than this one.&&But where else will I tell queens to slay and scream YAS?&&Everything &&Throw Thor into Guardians 3 with Taika directing and we're back, baby.&&Just posted this.  Its the best and most obvious solution to assure everyone GotG 3 won't be a mess.&&I dig it&&Thor ~~Ragnorak~~ Ragnarok was pretty epic and similar in tone to GotG. I wouldn't hate this move.

Edit: I got scolded for misspelling the word. Fixed. &&I second this motion!&&To be completely fair most all social media’s are garbage and forces of destruction reddit being a terrible offender of it as well. Twitter just seems to be the worst of them&&It's what we call outrage culture, it doesn't matter how many times you've apologized, or changed, or matured, your worst moment online defines you for the rest of your life. And defending those people makes you sympathetic to the labels of Pedo, Rapist, Nazi, etc.  And I don't think this is a Left v Right issue, seems clear as day both radical sides have no problem doing this. 

Heck I hate posting this because I feel like it appears I am defending what he said, which I don't want to do. I just think we should assume people can be better tomorrow than they were today and that you shouldn't be tried in the court of public opinion every year for something that was resolved 20 years ago. &&Reading the article...that was a separate incident? - A Blog post. It doesn't even touch on the subject matter that he mentions in his Tweets. Neither do the quoted source articles.&&I hope they don't re-cast Sean's part, would suck if he takes any fallout from this.&&Do you think they would keep his script and still have to credit him? I bet it gets redone &&This includes reddit.&&So, they've done studies on this and the most apt comparison to social media's affect on humanity was the printing press's affect on humanity in the 15th century.

Pretty much, the printing press allowed the average man/peasant to be able to read and therefore communicate with each other and obtain vasts amount of more knowledge. This is very similar to social media as all of a sudden people can communicate with everyone and hear all differing opinions of others.




So, what happened to society due to the printing press? Well, the immediate consequence was horrible. Turns out when people can hear MORE opinions, they actually become more factionalized and radical at first. This led to arguably the most violent time in the Dark Ages- the 16th and early 17th century.




HOWEVER, increased communication also eventually led to the enlightenment, spread of humanism, and the European revolutions of the 18th+ 19th century that has shaped mankind for the better(democracy, inalienable rights, fall of the monarchy, religous freedom etc.). 


So, essentially, the internet and social media will have immediately bad consequences that will probably last for our life time. In the long run however(we're talking over generations) it will be for the best. A good modern example of this is the Arab Spring: it gave the average people a voice to connect and start a movement. It also led to mob mentality that led to a power vacuum that has put some of those countries in apocalyptic situations....&&Very sad indeed. Alexa play Despacito. &&That [Lloyd Kaufman](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/810ass/i_am_lloyd_kaufman_president_of_troma/duzkrkg/) brand of dark disturbing humor is a Troma staple&&Everyone was surprised by the bold choice to hire Gunn in the first place. James Gunn under the Disney umbrella... huh? But now to fire him... This is... stupid. And if it has anything to do with the acquisition of FOX (Fox News is pushing the story)...




I can't believe this headline. To feign *SHOCK* that they didn't know he wrote offensive material... This is dumb. It's a dumb decision. Dumb deal. Would love to see some big names stand up for him. Doubt they will though. And to be clear: I'm not defending anything he wrote. It's one thing to for Joe Schmoe on the couch to judge what this guy wrote 10 years ago. But for a corporation to fire him when they hired him in the first place because of his voice... This is dumb.

Edit: Who'd a' thunk that [This guy would have written offensive shit on Twitter?](https://youtu.be/dPqIqXftaxE?t=116) (NSFW)&&What happened was an actor named Mark Duplass tweeted out that if you wanted to follow a conservative voice for alternative view point Ben Shapiro is a good follow since he is fairly objective. 

Gunn tweeted at Ben calling him an asshole and no one should follow Ben, even his own mother. And then some people started digging up old tweets. &&Remember when Bone asked the questions at the Presidental debate and it took barely a  few days to comb his stuff and find the weird posts? It surprises me it took this long for people to find these tbh.&&I believe he is an outspoken critic of the GOP, so I’m sure there was no shortage of people out there looking to harm Gunn.

Let this be a lesson to everyone out there who aspires to be in the spotlight some day, don’t say terrible things, whether you mean them or are “joking”.&&MAGA Twitter.&&He was doing the same thing to Ben Shapiro first(using 10 year old tweets when Shapiro was 19 to criticize him today), and then the Twitter mob did it to him. 

Shapiro actually did the right thing and said even though Gunn's tweets are terrible that this is a bad precedent to set and he probably shouldn't have been fired.&&I'm more outraged that the jokes aren't funny. If you're gunna use edgy material it has to have a killer punch line. In fairness rape and pedophile jokes were a lot less stale in 2008.&&Most of them are just baffling, like the RT of a random guy reminiscing about his NAMBLA buddies&&> This is stunning. Very curious to see who they get to direct Vol 3 instead.

Ron Howard&&They consulted Gunn heavily on the Guardians’ parts in the film. &&Taika. 100% would bet on it. &&> So, I guess they’re cancelling guardians 3?

Gunn wrote the script for Part 3 but I don't know what happens to that. Does Disney already own that script or they'll go with someone else.&&Taika Waititi would be a good replacement. &&I can't see that happening, they will probably find another director&&Script is already written, right? &&Exactly. The jokes are offensive but Marvel hired a director who had gotten his start in Troma films&&Which is alarming, disgusting and telling of how this society operates. Gunn goes down admittedly for really shitty, unfunny jokes but actual pedos, molesters and abusers can roam free or be allowed to still work in the same industries....
&&And serial harassers like Lasseter &&Dan Schneider was protected a VERY long time.

Does Twitter have a way of mass deleting or do you have to go through and delete each one manually? 

He must've had some really bad Tweets back then. 

&&Honestly, that’s a smart thing to do which any job you are on the cusp of getting.&&How the fuck do you have 10,000 tweets you have to erase? I don't even know if I've made half that many tweets my whole time being on Twitter&&Honestly surprised he didnt just delete his entire Twitter profile in one go. &&He should do what PewdiePie does. He has a bot that deletes tweets older than 30 days.&&Lol it's like the type of shit I thought was funny when i was in middle school. Also... he seems to have a thing about young boys...&&Who says shit like this? &&Well I guess Disney didn't until now based on this series of events.&&[deleted]&&They did. It just doesn't matter until someone makes a fuss about it. Then they can fire the person and make it seem like they're the good guys. He helped build a massive franchise, now they can hire someone cheaper to continue it. &&You're *crazy* if you don't think they knew about this.  Of course they did.  

They just didn't care until enough people randomly started reporting him and claiming they were offended.  A concentrated effort by the conservatives he has been routinely criticizing and lampooning on twitter.  

Disney is just covering their ass here.  They already got their successful movie franchise, so they probably assume they can do it without him now.  &&He works for Disney, is it really that crazy?

It's like she's talking to Reddit itself. &&I forget this part of The Room&&[deleted]&&Disney doesn't actually give a shit until it gets noticed and hurts their brand.

They *must've* been aware of his edgy humour/history when they hired him and it's not like he ever hid these tweets - he was quite clearly all about that when he entered the industry. This is the same guy that wrote Tromeo and Juliet and directed Super and the PG Porn series after all.&&I thought the same thing. It's not like they didn't exist when making Guradians 1. Ironic because Mike Cernovich dug them up and that dude has said some problematic things, putting it lightly. &&[deleted]&&He was doing the same thing to Shapiro before it happened to him.

He deleted over 10,000 tweets from his profile. &&Sometimes I'll remember Craig Robinson saying ""*HELPFUL BUS!*"" for no real reason and laugh to myself.&&He was hired by Marvel precisely because he made fucked uo movies with fucked up humor. That wss his whole thing. People knew about these tweets, and he'd apologized snd owned up to similar internet posts when they came to light years before Guardians 1 came out.

\* a handful of douchebags weren't
&&Exactly. Disney is super aggressive with their image quality. As soon as the accusations started flying, I figured he was done. Disney doesn't play around with things like that.&&Was James Gunn involved with that? I guess it would make sense if he were&&Jessica Nigri does&&Thing is though, a LOT of humor that used to be genuinely funny is seen as offensive now. Stuff that you may have been OK with standing by in the past, are things that could potentially get you fired today. It's exactly for this reason that I will never EVER run for politics. If my name ever got connected to my online handle that I used 20 years ago, my career would be pretty much over. I never called for violence or anything, it was just all tasteless humor. But it's clear today that the mob is never satisfied with a mea culpa style ""yeah, I said it. It was funny then but it doesn't reflect who I am now"" kind of thing. Today, you must not only lose your source of income, but also your ability to find a job in the future. &&""STILL Under Construction? You're fired!""&&Same here. I was thinking ""Really? James Gunn?""&&Were talking about a guy who had Ellen Paige rape Dwight Schrute in a super hero movie about a guy who assaults people in the head with a wrench...&&Same, I remember when he was hired being really surprised. One thing I was not surprised about was the tweets/posts he made. Anyone who has seen Tromeo and Juliet would expect the person who wrote that to make off-key jokes about pedophilia. And to be clear, they were jokes. These jokes didn't harm anyone and were almost a decade old. 

It's truly unfortunate. James Gunn is one of the only talented directors they had working for them. Guardians won't feel the same without him.&&> I think this is massive overkill on Disney's part.

Agreed. Those tweets are awful, and I could understand Disney's reaction if he posted them yesterday, but they were posted 10 years ago.&&I definitely agree. It's YEARS ago on Twitter, he's not actively saying these things nor acting on them. Hell I wouldn't know about them if they didn't bring them to light. Why not just Purge the Twitter and be done with it?&&My biggest issue is that he makes awesome movies. The Guardians of the Galaxy movies are great, and people love them. At the end of the day the fans are really losing out on great material. We have actors and musicians who are fucking idiots in their personal life, and we abide it for the good art/performance they create. It is a shame to see the franchise loose such a good creative mind over hurt feelings&&Someone commented on the article the mid posted about RDJ. Great example. That dude messed up and he’s better now. I’m sick of everyone getting axed prematurely because the companies are afraid of what will happen. Now that being said many people definitely deserve it. Maybe James Gunn does too, but I don’t know. Seems more like they’re covering their own ass than caring about one of their most successful directors. Clearly they didn’t care about it before.&&And every future job as well.&&At disney?

[They've never been okay with adult humor](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harlan-ellison/)&&I think more importantly- shock humor literally WAS Gunn's job back then. That was the kind of shit he was hired to make, not family-friendly Disney movies. So of course his public persona matched all of the exploitative content of his creative output.&&Honestly. Sure, I'm convinced there are huge pedophile rings full of rich people that don't know each other. I'm solidly convinced that lots and lots of children are raped by people who have the power to get away with it.

I'm *not* convinced that Twitter use from years ago is a good indicator of who is raping kids. &&He did joke about having a video posted to his Facebook in 2010 by someone who pled guilty to possessing child pornography just last month. I think that qualifies as a reason he would want to state that he's not a pedophile.&&While I totally agree have you read the tweets? Some of them are clearly jokes but some of them do not read as jokes at all.

> I remember my first NAMBLA meeting. It was the first time I felt ok being who I am

 He may have meant that as a joke but it does not read that way. It makes it hard to stand by him when that is the case.

&&I doubt it, but he's an insider and probably has some dirt on a lot of others.&&The point is, Disney tried really hard to make it work.  Lasseter was given 6 months leave while they figured out what to do.  They held a ""listening session"" to test the waters about him returning.  It wasn't the first time, either:

>When Pixar had such a listening event several years ago, sources say, employee complaints were aired about Lasseter's behavior generally. When Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull delivered that feedback to Lasseter, one animator says, Lasseter was so angry that he didn't speak to Catmull for more than a week.

I'm sure a lot of this was known when Disney acquired Pixar.  They could have cut him out or minimized his role right there, but instead he ran both studios, much of the parks, and expanded his responsibilities.  I'm kind of surprised Disney didn't seem to catch much flack how it played out.&&Lol damn.  Well he definitely had a fixation for awhile.&&[deleted]&&Honestly looks like a neural network trying to replicate internet/dark humor&&Honestly, I'm more bothered by how unfunny they are. Rape jokes, pedophilia jokes, and plenty of others can be pretty damn funny. Just screaming, ""lol kids get raped,"" just doesn't reach that standard, and I don't think it did even when the bar was much lower. For me, anyway--I like to think my standards for offensive humor have risen a little bit.&&It's basically the youtube and Facebook comment section but for everything&&Last night I saw some people arguing about socialism. I offered my opinion (having lived for years in a county with a leftist/socialist-sympathizing government). I was civil. Just disagreed.

This world ain't for apologies.&&People aren’t allowed to make mistakes, apparently. Obviously, I’m not approving it either. My point is that a lot of the people that criticize him have made stupid, inconsiderate jokes. Difference is they weren’t caught and didn’t do it on Twitter.

My point is the outrage culture is kind of over the top sometimes, at the end of the day, people shouldn’t throw stones in glass houses.&&Outside of him walking of his own accord, any attempt to relieve Sean of his role will be met with pitchforks.&&He’s his brother!

&&So what you’re saying is someone was gunning  for Gunn?

... I’ll show myself out&&The only reason he was fired is because of the constant rape and pedophilia scandals going on right now. If this came out 2-3 years ago I doubt he’d have been fired.&&This time around Phil Lord and Chris Miller WOULD be appropriate for the gig unlike Solo&&I guess now they can consult Sean Gunn instead of James&&I assume Gunn’s script fits into Feige’s grand plan. His draft will probably be passed to the new writer/director, redone heaps but keeping the same story beats.&&Work for hire. They own it. He’ll get a producer or “story by” credit.&&Agreed.

Anyone else and my interest in the film goes down to 0.&&Taika would crush it&&The only man for the job at this point.&&Not that I'm not pumped about TCW though 👌&&There are scripts you can use to do it for you. &&Reddit account would be the only one I’d ever really worry about.&&Honestly the best thing to do is not have Twitter. I don’t have a single friend in my social circle who uses it, I don’t understand how it’s so popular still.&&Scorched earth policy, he had no choice since he already caught attention.

What's best us to delete and prune as you go for anything on social media you might think hasn't aged well: a bad pic, a lil Wayne lyric about drinking lean, something abut fucking the government&&[deleted]&&He did now. He's not active anymore.&&>Lol it's like the type of shit I thought was funny when i was in middle school.

Yeah, this is the sort of shit you'd expect to see on the social media profile of an edgy 14-year-old, not one belonging to a 40-something writer and director.&&Yeah i thought it was gonna be some stupid edgy jokes but wow these are so stupid lmao&&Disney knew; the thing with these corporate scandals is 99% of the time the company already knew. They just don’t want to can the person making big money for them until the public gets upset about it.

Edit: to all the people asking why Disney didn’t just have him delete the tweets earlier, obviously I don’t work there so I don’t know but I imagine they feared that itself would call attention to it. Obviously there were a lot of these tweets, I saw somewhere that he deleted thousands (which I haven’t checked the accuracy of so don’t quote me on that (edit #3: see /u/mathmage’s comment below)) but point is it was a lot. Purging such a massive quantity like that doesn’t go unnoticed, especially on the account of someone so famous. I imagine Disney was stuck between a rock and a hard place and just chose inaction over action until their hand was more or less forced.

Further edit: I’m not saying Disney shouldn’t have fired Gunn, nor am I saying they should have fired him sooner, or anything like that. This is just meant to be an objective comment on the general nature of PR scandals.&&If they didn't they probably do now. &&He in fact already apologized for it before Guardians came out. https://www.glaad.org/blog/director-james-gunn-apologizes-anti-gay-and-sexist-comments-blog-post&&Disney should know what they are getting into hiring a Troma director.&&A bit honestly. He has writing and directing credits in troma projects.

You know how much changes in a persons mind in that time? 

And with Gunn it shows that even as an adult a lot can change. 

Especially with the social media format encouraging you to constantly post. You’re gonna have stuff you look back on and regret. &&Meanwhile, Disney [continued to work with Victor Salva after he was convicted of child abuse](https://twitter.com/FreddyInSpace/status/1020398915018022912). Also, [John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter) is being allowed to leave on his own terms despite multiple accusations of sexual harassment!&&Gunn was also 40 when he wrote this stuff. &&[deleted]&&If you guys said [half the shit he did](https://imgur.com/a/rvbDryr), you need to delete your Twitters now and stay inside.&&We wouldn't want to keep unlucky people, would we?&&They announced they're going to layoff of about 4,000 employees because of the Fox acquisition.It will probably end ip being more in the long run though.&&He's welcome to watch their films though.&&He proved himself very capable director. I can see WB shelling out good money to have Gunn make sense of their movies. Really, any of these shit-tier ""universes"" would be so lucky to have Gunn at the helm. Imagine The Mummy with his sensibilities. That would have paired perfectly. &&Does this mean we'll get a new Toxic Avenger movie?&&[deleted]&&Wasn’t it found a few months ago? The alien coordinates for Morag (or maybe knowhere I can’t recall) our through some Cipher was the date that Peter was abducted &&WHAT IS IT??&&So 10,000 tweets are all about pedos and rapes or did he just delete the entire history and called it a day?&&The Havana Bob face continues to crack me up.&&Yeah.

Idk about how many movies I've watched of his but guardians of the Galaxy's slight dark humor was fantastic. Like that one prosethtic leg scene was slightly dark but brilliant.

I hope they hire a capable director because honestly the first 2 were masterpieces imo&&Yup. That was pretty much his game. &&Like twitter pre 2015 was literally 4chan with more black people.  &&It was the best thing they could have done. Firing him will likely kill the franchise. &&Right? *Super* is what got him hired for GotG.

Super also featured tentacle sex cartoons, child prositution, and a fuckton of violence. &&The weirdest shit I've seen today is people saying that the jokes weren't jokes and ""you don't joke around about those things."" 

James Gunn launched his entire career writing jokes like that.

See: Super, Tromeo and Juliet, etc
&&Yeah those movies were great and that franchise owes a ton of success to Gunn. Mainstream audiences didn't know jack about the Guardians otherwise. I get that it's Disney and they have a reputation to protect, but they could have asked him to delete them, make an apology, and move on.&&Yeah, how long is the sentence for telling offensive jokes on the internet.

There's more than enough context over the many years I've been on reddit to link this account to real life me, and I'm sure I've said lots of things that I wouldn't want to be publicly linked to me. Not even stuff I'd regret sharing now but the stuff you don't want linked to your name when you're willing to talk about it semi-anonymously. &&I'd completely scrub my Reddit account and delete it.&&Having it is fine, posting to it I agree. It's handy for following your favorite sports teams or news feeds.&&and in my social circle twitter is the popular one and FaceBook is barely used&&Maybe it depends on your age group? I'm mid-30s and don't know anyone with Twitter.&&lots of funny shit on there. just treat it like reddit, don’t put ur personal info on it. there’s no way i can be tied to my account based off what’s on there&&I've honestly never quite understood Twitter if you're a non-celeb or ""influencer"". Facebook I get because you can share photos and random observations with your friends. Instagram's easy because it's photos and videos and everyone likes those. But sharing random 1-2 sentence thoughts with the world? I don't get it.&&If I knew how to have sex with the government maybe i wouldnt be on such a long dry spell. &&Should have deleted the old one and started a new one when he became more famous&&I guarantee when Gunn was hired for Guardians they sat him down with a PR person and told him how to behave and act online. They knew who they hired they just didn't expect people to go through and drag up old tweets.&&>They just don’t want to can the person making big money for them until the public gets upset about it.

But was the public *really* upset over it, or is this once again a group of coordinated pearl clutchers using their mob army to get the blood price?&&Or they needed an excuse to fire him. &&Seriously.  The same year these Tweets were made he released a film where Ellen Page rapes Rainn Wilson, for laughs, and it was probably what led him to getting GOTG.  At least Rosanne was fired for what she said NOW, not what she said ten years ago (or a year ago, even).  &&Oh hai&&So how's your work life&&You’re my favourite customer.&&Try being a teenager on the internet in the early 2000s.

There was practially no one online.. and almost nothing you said or did mattered.

I went back and checked my LiveJournal and Myspace one day.. and was fucking appalled at the dumbass shit I'd posted.

Deleted both accounts ASAP.&&The kind of comments that in the 90's would have been considered funny and lighthearted are considered racist and sexist today. You might not have a racist or sexist bone in your body, but you may have joined in on the jokes because they were accepted by virtually everyone as something that is socially normal.

It's terrifying to think what I might have said when I was 13 if twitter was a thing then.&&Well no one's bringing it up on social media so Disney don't give a damn sadly&&>  John Lasseter is being allowed to leave on his own terms

He's really not at all. The man hasn't been with the company and is working inside a carefully controlled bubble. He remains on as a legal matter, not an endorsement. Someone at the C-Suite level is harder to drop than a hired contractor.&&Ben Shapiro, a conservative columnist and editor of The Daily Wire.&&I guess Seth MacFarlane better start looking for a new job once Disney buys Fox because that's half the jokes on Family Guy.&&Oh okay so that's why they did that. We can all go home guys! &&Well damn, I dunno how he got away with that for so long.&&Jesus fucking christ... I mean, some of them aren't really bad on their own like some of the obvious foul jokes like the R Kelly one. Also, by itself, the ""shower so weak it's like a three year old peeing on my head,"" is actually a humorous description of a weak shower and people who have kids, watch kids, etc know what it's like to have a kid pee on you. But in context with those other tweets? Fuck...


I am totally ok with dark humor and I think rape jokes and child abuse jokes are fine (as long as it isn't directed at someone to hurt them), but a lot of his tweets are basically ""I'm a pedophile and I also really want to rape men, women, boys, and girls.""&&Why isn't this higher, this entire thread should be this link followed by another comment saying ""oh ok""&&Oh, shit. That's a *lot* more egregious than I was expecting it to be. &&...ok. Now I can actually see why this was a Venice's worth of bridges too far for Disney, even though it's just 'tasteless jokes'.&&Hey I saw that thread&&He's gotta pay the Gunn tax though&&I could see Slither and Super being in a shared universe. Maybe he could get together with Whedon and put Cabin in the Woods in the same universe while they're at it. &&James Gunn taking over the DCEU, or at the very least Suicide Squad, could be the silver lining to this&&Don't forget about how pretty much every American company decided to make everybody's corporate-promised retirement pension disappear if they could do it without legal ramifications.

A *fuckton* of those mergers was to swallow up billions in money put aside for pensions and disperse it to corporate execs and shareholders.&&[deleted]&&a rape joke&&James Gunn is the heart of what makes those films good, so yes this will undoubtedly kill the franchise.&&Yeah im not interested in seeing a gotg that isnt directed by gunn. Not saying what he did was cool, but im no longer interested in the guardians movies, i felt like he was what made them special.&&By their logic every single comedian in existence should be branded a pedophile, racist, or sexist. Their is nothing wrong with joking about offensive or sensitive topics. If anything it should be encouraged. To be able to find humour in horrible things is what makes comedy so enjoyable and the human experience worth living. 

James Gunn did nothing wrong and I am disgusted with how Disney handled things. &&https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/john-lasseter-sexual-misconduct-pixar-fairies/&&I believe he was accused of inappropriate and unwanted contact with female employees at Pixar.&&Nailed it.&&And that's how we meet Beta Ray Bill?&&Tessa Thompson was built to replace Gamora&&That would actually be great. I want more Thor in the MCU, but I don't want them to do a fourth Thor movie because trilogies are the way to go. If they did a new Guardians movie trilogy with Thor in it, it would be perfect.&&Mantis is like minions in Despicable Me. Very good addition to main cast as but (probably) unbearable in the foreground. Pom Klementieff is cute tho&&He doesn't really seem like the money-grabbing type to me, I dunno. As he said himself:

> I always want to do something different when I make something. I really like the idea of doing something really big. My films have always been a lot smaller. I like the kind of films I make but [Thor: Ragnarok] was an opportunity that presented itself that wouldn't come around often, so I thought I would just pursue. Also, I know Chris [Hemsworth] and wanted to work with him at some point. Again, it seemed like a good opportunity.

Obviously no one says ""I did it because the pay is awesome, dollar dollar bills y'all"" but I do genuinely believe he did it to test himself. His reasons seemed to be ""do something new, also work with Chris Hemsworth"". Neither of those apply here. And taking over someone else's script? Eh. I'd love to be wrong though, I think he's fantastic.&&Twitter was a mistake &&This is exactly it. It's an easy thing to say and realize, but the depths and damage caused by it are far more extreme than I know I was giving it credit for. They're basically fucking cults led by the online publication world. 

The blue check mark hands too much influence to people who don't deserve it. Rando website content creator should not have the same curb credibility as a staff Times writer. 

Of all the terrible shit, it's thing that I think is driving me off of social media (and more into the arms of getting all my content from stand up comedians, who make their living chipping away at extreme culture, which has its own drawbacks...but I laugh a lot more, so I've got that going for me.). &&Pretty much. Gunn will get writing credit unless they ditch his entire script and get an entirely new script team.&&> Brian Singer can no longer film in America because of this

I thought he was still working in America?&&A 13 year old is a child.&&Those are children, ya dope.&&It’s the proof. The bad jokes are there on twitter for the world to see... Actual pedophiles continue to deny their actions until enough evidence builds up and someone actually does something about it. Big difference, yet understandably frustrating.&&Pedos try to keep their shit under wraps so it’s hard to prove.

These comments were just out there- Gunn should have deleted that shit long ago, but someone stil might have dug it up.&&I hope they rehire you.&&They'd sue the fuck outta him and make his life miserable. Probably won't ever work in Hollywood again if he did that.&&To be fair, Edgar Wright sat on the Ant-man project because he wanted to make the film his way without any ties to the MCU and tried to run out the clock before they had to find somebody new.&&He also sat on that project for years before they finally took it away from him.&&It happened with Taika, maybe Feige's learning to let go more&&Just Google ""Tweet delete script"" and pick one tbh. If you know some fairly basic programming you can make one yourself using the reddit api.

Edit: example to show how simple it can be:
https://gist.github.com/davej/113241

Edit 2: I totally didn't notice when writing my comment but I switched from Twitter to reddit somehow. I definitely meant ""using the Twitter api"" but I'll leave it to showcase my shame :(&&No, that's the Lord's work.&&[deleted]&&No one fires a hero&&Shout out to Ken Bone who did an AMA from his own reddit account, giving no fucks about people going through his post history. &&""Hey guys I'm two time Oscar winner BigDogEatMyAss, I'll be answering your questions. Edit: oh shit""&&Have ya fucking upvote ya twat &&In other words you post a lot in /r/crusaderkings? &&This is the best thing I've read all day...and I've read three things today. &&I'd suggest deleting this comment saying that too just in case &&even if you've never explicitly stated any personal information...if you use reddit regularly and have multiple years worth of comments it can be reliably pieced together. There are firms that employ people to just sift through something like a reddit comment history for HOURS taking notes and putting little details together. &&Probably archived somewhere anyway&&Posting to it is fine. Just don't be fucking stupid about it. &&[deleted]&&Its heyday was *long* before Instagram. Back in 2008ish, Twitter was *the* way to keep tabs on your favourite people. I doubt many (if anyone) got famous strictly off the site, but it was a lighter version of Facebook, lots of people disliked Facebook at the time after MySpace’s slow descent, and it was just a far more streamlined experience. The 140-character limit was originally a bug—but it forced you to be concise and basically cut the bullshit. That was a great feature.

The term “social media” was still in its infancy, and there was lots to love about it. For nostalgia reasons, I’m still fond of it. 

But *today?*
No clue, pal. &&You'd think they'd include a ""scrub your shit"" clause&&I heard absolutely nothing of the tweets until I saw he was fired&&> made he released a film where Ellen Page rapes Rainn Wilson

I didn't like that scene either and I laughed when he hit a guy over the head with a pipe wrench. It was shot incredibly dark. It didn't make me dislike the movie but it's why I was shocked Disney gave him GOTG. &&I certainly don't remember that scene being 'for laughs'. I thought it supposed to be dark, like the rest of the movie.&&Also Roseanne’s tweet was directed at a specific person which makes a difference I think.&&[removed]&&I can’t tell you that, it’s confidential!&&[removed]&&[deleted]&&I was able to find old newsgroup posts I had in my 20s. Nothing offensive, but the language and topics were a bit cringe worthy. I am sure in 20 years, I will feel the same about my reddit history. &&[Standup is a weird job because what we feel is acceptable as a society changes so rapidly. No accountant is ever like “well I looked at some tax returns I did back in 2013 and uh turns out they were super racist.”](https://twitter.com/samlymatters/status/1019365060962127872?s=21)&&Remember when The Simpsons made a light hearted joke about Family Guy being a knockoff, so Seth made a cutaway where Quaqmire raped and murdered the Simpsons? Then acted like he was the victim when people called him out?

Yeah, not looking good for him.&&Just from simple lack of checking. Nobody paid attention to Twitter then.&&Yeah, I like dark humour, so I was prepared for that to be the bulk of these tweets...which some were...but then some were.....beyond dark...like voting on which American Idol contestant to rape? Jesus christ.&&> Also, by itself, the ""shower so weak it's like a three year old peeing on my head,"" 

I've always expressed it as being an old man peeing on my head.  But either way, I don't think one needs to experience actual urination on one's head to use the metaphor.  &&The joke about wanting to go Big game hunting, but knowing it is wrong, so he's going big game raping instead, was pretty solid.  But yeah, the amount of joking about being a pedophile and wanting to rape children is definitely a lot more than I was expecting when reading the story.&&Yeah a lot of them aren’t even funny just creepy. If rape or pedophilia are recurring themes in your tweets then you might have an underlying problem &&I skimmed it and was like "" why are people so upset it's obviously a joke"", than I went back and read the ones I skipped, yeahhhhh that's not ok at all. Some are forgivable, others are disgusting and not even slightly funny in any context, I understand Disney's move completely.&&> Gunn tax

I should watch that again. &&The Cabin in the Woods would kinda be ruined by explicitly saying its in the same universe as any one or group of other horror movie/s. The point is that it shares a universe with and explains all horror movies. I don't think genre deconstruction works well in a shared universe. &&Gonna be a bit difficult to have cabin in the woods be part of a larger universe considering how it ended.&&I never thought of it, but a James Gunn helmed Suicide Squad could be dope.&&I found it but I can't tell you because it's a secret&&....yesSSSSSSSSSSS&&And Mantis exists.&&It's time for the Twitter to end.&&Man, remember the chinese prom dress thing?

Especially since Disney is now about 40% of the industry. &&I wouldn't be surprised if he signed NDAs about it all&&I wanted to delete a load of reddit comments on an old account so I googled for a script because fuck going through deleting them one by one. The only thing I could find was a script to overwrite them and clearly reddit didn't like it because I got a shitload of really snotty automod messages telling me off for spamming. One sub even automatically banned me.  Seems stupid to me, if overwrite scripts aren't allowed then they should ask the admins for an option to select multiple comments to delete (or just a ""delete all"" button) so people wouldn't have to look for a script in the first place. &&This made me laugh.&&Instant promotion.&&That's ""The Party at Kitty and Studs"" my friend.

""Hey my name is Aquaman and I'm here to say

We will get to learn about him, his struggles, his powers, his motivations and then in a few years when they do the eventual Justice League movie, we will actually feel for these characters which will increase the impact of what's happening on screen!

Ugh...why?&&It's fucking hideous.&&We want Vinny Chase&&Why is his face lit? Is there a second sun underwater? Why do the sharks look like they were ripped from a PS2 game? Why isn't his hair wet? It looks like he is posing in front of an aquarium, except he's clearly supposed to be underwater because there's no separation between Aquaman and what's behind him. But he can't be underwater because he's not wet.

It's refreshing to know that DC is skipping the fun marketing this time and letting everyone know up front what a lazy clusterfuck this  will be.&&Looks kinda cheesy with all the whales and sharks. It’s a bit too much &&Irrelevant to this movie specifically, but more to do with posters in general: Do you guys think we’ll ever see a wide return of Struzan style handmade poster art?

It looks stupid to me. It makes it seem like the premise of the movie is he sends two of each animal to fight a war for him. &&In the bottom left section there are a ton of orcas and it honestly looks like they just copied and pasted about five of them and switched the lighting. This is such a poor rendition of a potentially awesome poster. &&When I first saw it I thought it was a joke or fake. It looks like a terrible 90's poster. How is anyone going to take this serious. I love DC and want them to succeed, but they really nees to look at who making this stuff someone is out of touch at Warner bros.&&I also feel like the scale is way off on a lot of those animals&&What are vanishing points and where are they on this poster?&&> mid tier

So par for the course with DC? I love the DC universe so much, but the movies... Honestly I don't want any more DC movies at this point. I *lived* for the animated Justice League when I was a kid, so when the movie came out I was stoked. Then utterly disappointed. Same with Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, BvS...I was super into DC as a kid, never really got into Marvel; but now it's entirely the opposite :/&&It looks so bad &&It's also same fucking Orca. Look at the patterns, he used same 3d model for all of them.&&Ok, I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this looks bad. Besides the quality...what's up with the pose?

That doesn't really make sense if he's supposed to be underwater, but I guess he's not? It's just weird.&&It looks like a photo I have in front of a green screen at an aquarium.&&I was a TA in college, teaching Photoshop stuff. And yeah. It does.

This looks like a fake movie you'd see in Entourage but worse. &&this would have looked 100 times better if he actually was in front of a real aquarium too, at least the marine life would be realistic and diverse&&I think you’ll see it now and then. But sadly I don’t think it will ever be the norm again. &&I've read his book, ""The Art of Drew Struzen"". It's a fascinating read, but in it, he talks about how the industry slowly changed when it came to poster design and how things slowly turned to more digital work with ""photo's"" rather than paintings. With the Original Star Wars, Lucas was such a fan of his work that he basically just let him do whatever he wanted and Lucas was fine with it all - Speilberg was the same. 

By the time they got to the Prequels, Struzen wasn't even able to talk to Lucas, there were so many producers and the like between him and George that they hardly spoke and suddenly there were a 1001 notes on how the poster should look, eventually resulting in some of his finished work being taken and altered digitally after the fact.

One example he gives is the Revenge of the Sith Poster. [This](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ZDSUH2iiL._SY679_.jpg) is the poster we all saw in theatres.

[This](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/d3/47/82d347b5380782e6670fb994080f9a69.jpg) is what he actually painted. Notice how Vaders head is smaller in the original with the overall picture being more balanced and centred... now look at the altered one, everything's slightly off-centre... but hey, at least Vader's head is bigger, that's more important right?

There's also the fact that he did the main poster for the first Harry Potter film... there was an indication at the time that they'd get him in to do the posters for all of the films, which he was game for, but when he did the second film, they rejected his poster and went with a generic ""photo"" poster.

Just a small note though, [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51k86VjB-hL.jpg) was the final poster for Chamber of Secrets - [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/42/a6/50/42a6503c84137ebded2df6421594deac.jpg) is what Struzen came up with, what they rejected.

The last posters he has done (he's basically retired now) were for Guillermo Del Toro for his two Hellboy Films plus for Pans Labyrinth... all 3 times the studio never went with Struzen's work, opting instead to do more modern posters to sell the films, so Del Toro paid for Struzen's work and sold them as limited prints for fans. The original art is hung up in Del Toro's home.

Eventually they would just crush your knee caps or shins to get to the precious, hypothetical lettuce. Literally they can shatter bones like nothing due to their size and shell.

Definition of tour de force

plural tours de force play \ˌtu̇r-də-ˈfȯrs\

: a feat or display of strength, skill, or ingenuity 

the movie is a comic tour de force

&&This is definitely true, but I still think the superhero genre benefits from stand alone back stories to set up team ups because of the sometimes convoluted nature of the characters.  We can all relate to and like the characters in Oceans 11 because they are based in reality, while sometimes a superhero needs extra time for us to relate to them.  Without a Thor movie for instance, just having him show up would be hard to just explain away.&&But comic book movies aren't just ensemble films; they're crossovers. The appeal of a crossover -- all the way back to the old Universal monsters -- was seeing previously independent worlds collide. *Ocean's Eleven* was conceived, written, and created to be entirely self-contained. (As was *Guardians of the Galaxy*, which would've been a more pertinent example.) But something like the Avengers or the Justice League draws its appeal from taking heretofore unrelated characters and seeing how they fit together.&&Super heroes have a harder job, I think. For the record, I think Ocean's 11 (the Soderbergh remake) is an amazing movie. But at the end of the day you have to answer 2 questions to set up the heist: What is the character's specialty and why should they join the heist?

You only have to have 2-3 characters on the heist side that have a character arc (Clooney and Pitt) plus a love interest and villain. Everyone else boils down to casting the right actor and writing some quippy dialogue while they do their part of the heist.

Superheroes usually have more than 1 power, compared to 1 specialty. Each hero usually gets an arc or at least some motivation beyond 'I want money.' They need a reason to fight, backstory on how they got their powers and a resolution to their arc. With more to do, more can go wrong.&&Even the first avengers had a lot of prep working going in. Can't assume a viewer has seen every MCU up to it, or remembers it.&&While that may be true,nobody wants to see the origins of grown human men in the real world with no powers ,in a movie about a heist.That'd be out of place and to no relevance.A superhero movie on the other hand needs that careful craftsmanship to help them connect with the audience . And that requires time. Going for an early teamup was disastrous for them because not only do they have to set up 3-4 new characters and juggle their backstories at the same time ,while simlutaneously ALSO giving their character development from how you saw them just an hour ago,they also need to lay out the plot as well.If only they'd have distributed the work and focused a on single character at a time they could distribute that load off from on single teamup movie.Use them to expand the lore bit by bit ,while introducing and developing characters at the same time,then they don't have to give a shit about that in the teamup and have and open field to do whatever they want in the teamup.&&These are characters who have set backgrounds tho so people have preconcieved notions. Firing out ensemble films without giving them your own spin first gets people confused and upset. 

Eg if they'd done a batman standalone they could have given him their own spin. Instead they threw him against superman and had him act like a murdering maniac straight off the bat. &&*snap* Yes!&&Wow this would make for a DCEU movie I actually want to see!&&Ouch. What's his channel?&&If I pour a Ditto into that water how long until I get a shiny Aquaman with perfect stats?&&Honestly, they could have at least taken a shot of him posing inside a pool, and used that for the poster.

Right now, I don’t believe that he’s actually *in* the water.&&That would still be one of DCEU's highest scoring films.&&Ctrl-sea&&Probably will be.&&Yeah...the actual poster is really bad....It reminded me so much of the finding nemo poster i had to try. The colors were almost an exact match, layout, etc. Don't even get me started on the scale of the animals in the actual poster! &&Joshua tree tripping episode and Gary Busey beach party are my favorites. Just started rewatching haha &&it really wasn't. that was probably my favourite episode though, where they go to the high school party in the valley&&They didn't even bother aligning [this thing](https://i.imgur.com/VEnFAbJ.jpg). It's an A. It's symmetrical. Do they really just not give a shit?&&His hair really bugs me. It's clearly not any water anywhere near him. Or his hair. Ugh. &&And he's wearing blue jeans...&&This feels like the most DC thing I've seen in a while&&[deleted]&&It doesn't help that the main great white is full of scars and scratches and then you look at the shark directly to the right of it and it looks like it just came fresh out of a toy store. &&Arent‘t that also all the same Orca?! You know, just copied and pasted - maybe with slightly different angles&&Maybe God told him to place two of each animal on a giant submarine because the world is going to dry out. &&Same with the great whites at the bottom half of the poster. They’re all the same.. they couldn’t have used another type of shark?.. or maybe just a different render?&&
I don't know, with the current track record of DC movies, I'd rather them fail and just start over and do it right
&&True, but a portion of the Marvel posters looked awful as well. Remember this badly photoshopped black panther poster they released? https://i.imgur.com/MqfM9qm.jpg &&Looking for this comment! It is definitely fucked up.

I'm with you here, I thought this was fake. I thought it was just a fan photoshopping some on set pic of Momoa in front of a background that was a screenshot from some CGI movie. I don't have any strong feeling about this movie but... damn this poster looks bad if you stare at it for more than 3 secs.

Blue Raja, at your service&&Exactly this with cyborg. Way to complex of a character to just the like “here’s robot man!!” DC never once makes you care about any of the characters outside of WW. &&While true, I would counter that Marvel *needed* to run solo films first to get the names out there. Iron Man was a B Lister before RDJ, Thor was widely unknown before the films, and Cap had the luxury if brand recognition but I distinctly remember people never thinking they could pull off the star spangled boy scout in live action. As comic fans, we all knew the great potential but the general audience didn't. 

The Justice League characters are more widely known on some level. Cyborg would be the outlier. But then when you figure in the JL animated series and Teen Titans, there's more brand recognition there. 

I think DC could have absolutely made this work had they gone a different route. I would bet George Miller's movie would have gone off without a hitch had it been green lit and Batman Begins was already released. It can be done. They just showed their own insecurities in the film and essentially sabotaged it. In my opinion anyway.  &&Guardians did this well.&&Ensemble films - even with super powers - can be done properly without prior set up, it just takes the right creative team. That’s why The Incredibles works without needing a Mr Incredible / Elastigirl / Frozone prequel. What’s important is WHO they are as a a character, not what their powers are. We learn what their powers are and what they can/can’t do as the film progresses.

Or for a live action example, Guardians of the Galaxy. Just as many team members, but they all fall into the team naturally and fluidly as the story goes along and you learn about each character as you go. The only problem with DC and Justice League is they have the wrong people writing/making their movies.
&&Yup. It's not mandatory but the stand alone movies really help double down on the audience investment. A well written movie with a good actor can convey the basics of a character and their motivations. But having that extra layer that comes from a full movie before hand helps.

For example, the first Avengers movie. Whedon was very clever in giving every character introduction a few moments to give you an idea of what they're about as well as establishing basic character dynamics. Sure, it was probably just enough for folks who didn't see the 5 movies leading up. 

But for those that did watch those movies it added an extra layer. Like Captain's behavior means more when you know he's a man out of time trying to acclimate. Or that Bruce has already been fleeing the military and trying to suppress his monster. Or how Stark is more immediately suspicious of SHIELD keeping secrets and appropriating tech since the previous movies dealt with the government trying to acquire the Iron Man suit and SHIELD baby sitting him.

And that shit helps during the lulls in a movie since that extra depth cushions them.&&Exactly this.  The Justice League is supposed to be the worlds greatest superheroes uniting for a common purpose.  Not a bunch of people we don’t know showing up to the same place by coincidence.  I didn’t even come out of the film thinking that this was a real team, much less one that would unite to keep the world safe because that’s what they do.&&*half the DCU disappears* &&Looking good&&Needs more [Isabella Rosellini](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/11/21/22/2430107/5/920x920.jpg)&&Are we ever truly IN the water?&&So will most the CGI...I watched Justice league recently then watched The Avengers...and damn does Marvel put DC to shame when it comes to CGI&&“Need Jo-Jo the dogfaced bitch boy call Josh Weinfuck, the lightweight pen stealing fuck face”

That's a stretch. I doubt Aquaman can talk to *humans*.&&We'll here's Wikipedia to the rescue!

>[ Aquaman's most widely recognized power is the telepathic ability to communicate with marine life, which he can summon from great distances. Although this power is most often and most easily used on beings that live in the sea, Aquaman has at times demonstrated the ability to affect any being that lives upon the sea \(e.g., sea eagles\), or even any being evolved from marine life \(e.g., humans and some aliens\). Per the 2011 DC continuity reboot, Aquaman's telepathy has been greatly downplayed: acknowledging that most marine life doesn't possess enough intelligence to carry a meaningful telepathic communication, Aquaman is now stated to simply add compulsions and needs in the mindset of aquatic life, compelling them to do his bidding by a subtle altering of their cerebellum.\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaman#Powers_and_abilities)&&*Vince Vaughn sits in silence*&&Your dead to me boy...your more dead to me than your dead mother &&GODS I WAS WET THEN&&Your mother was a humpback whale with a fat arse!!&&> gal

The movie UP told a better love story in 5 minutes where some movies can't do that in 5 movies. But that assumes the director has the skills to weave in character moments to humanize them.

BUT Zack Snyder was never good at humanizing characters. He always favors allegory and symbollism over humanizing. It's why Superman was unrelatable.

I would have loved more of Bryan Cranston instead of American Soldier #3 (no offence to ATJ but the character was bland) but I just admire the way Edwards conveys scale and in any case I loved everything to do with Monarch and Watanabe's character.

*Gojira* (The 1954 original. Surprisingly dark. If you're looking for more *fun* Godzilla, this ain't the place to find it. But if you want something a little more thought-provoking, it's better.) 

*Shin Godzilla* (The latest. Very good, IMO. Some fantastic scenes with the big guy, but a few too many 'just talking' scenes. But when it gets it right, God *damn* it gets it right.)

*Godzilla, Mothra, and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack*. (Often shortened to GMK. This is often called one of the best G-films and it will introduce you to Mothra and Ghidorah.) 

*Godzilla VS Destroyah, Godzilla 2000, Godzilla VS Biollante* (Just genuinely good G-films.) 

*Godzilla* (1998) (*If you dare.* This is mostly just to show how far American Godzilla has come, but I actually believe it holds up relatively well as a popcorn flick if you view it as another Kaiju's solo movie. I know I do.)

*Destroy All Monsters, Godzilla: Final Wars.* (The former has some more Mothra and Ghidorah, and some Rodan too, as well as many other kaiju. The latter is one of my favourite Godzilla films, as it’s just a ton of fun. Almost every monster is in it.) 

Mothra and Rodan have their own solo films too. They're worth checking out if you're interested in those two. And if you want some Ghidorah, *Godzilla VS King Ghidorah* is pretty crazy. 

There are a lot of others too. Just look through the G-films and see if any catch your eye.  Go, new G-fan! 

Just one thing... Like Godzilla 2014, don't expect the movie to be all Godzilla. For Shin and the original especially, his screentime is comparable to G2014. 

^And... ^*never* ^watch ^Godzilla’s ^Revenge.&&Yes it is. &&Not sure if it's simply a synonym they use or perhaps an old dialect they deciphered in the movie, but he has always been referred to as The King Of Monsters. He is the balance to the equation. Mankind going out of control? Boom. Godzilla. Monsters going nuts? Boom. Godzilla. &&Probably because the original Godzilla was titled Godzilla King of the Monsters when it was released in the US in 1956&&I don't think they are called Titans. Just how the lady is describing them also the Titans came before the Gods.&&Maybe Titans are a class of monsters? Kinda like the villain rating in OPM&&Cause king of the monsters is a classic reference. The movie title exists outside of the movie's universe &&I’m still having trouble working out what its actually meant to be..??&&Cranston&&One of the reasons I didn't like the '14 Godzilla was because it was marketed as a Cranston movie and he was only in it for the first 20 mins or so.&&... Kongs&&Then in a fit of rage she orders a Mecha King Ghidorah head off Amazon with 1-day shipping..&&what exactly are her plans if i may ask?&&Or in this case, all 3 faces &&I’m adding to this thought. In the trailer they exclusively refer to the creatures as “Titans” while it seems that the only a thing called a monster is the corporate lady. King Ghidorah may be the King of the Titans, but Godzilla is the King of the Monsters (cue the trailer shot of Godzilla roaring with fighter jets backing him).

edit: grammar&&Would explain why Mothra is painted as rather benevolent and bonding with the main character (who's eeevul mother freed the other titans to save the earth and kickstarted the apocalypse by doing so)&&The clip where Godzilla is shooting into the air.

2. Godzilla deals with Ghidorah while Mothra deals with Rodan

Read it somewhere but cannot find source.&&I take it you havent seen the newest king kong.

They state specifically that he is still growing. That movie was set in 1973. He won't face Godzilla till 2020. That's a lot of time to grow.

On top of that, King Kong has demonstrated being able to take on multiple enemies at once, while Godzilla was practically beaten by just two M.U.T.O.s

Also, King Kong isn't really phased by bullets. It's mainly fire that ducks with him.

Additionally, Kong has demonstrated higher intelligence than Godzilla ever has. He ripped the branches off of trees to use as clubs, he used a propeller attached to a chain as a long distance weapon.

Kong is also far more agile and quick than Godzia is. Godzilla has to be able to keep up with him if he wants to hurt him, and he can't.&&Even if they give him lightning powers like the original movie Kong still won't be as cool as Ghidorah.&&That roar was beautiful, more than half the theater jumped out of their seats for that and the ""Let them fight"" line.&&[It’s about a 5 second road but feels like 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/xbB9GBykZAA)&& Just to add, my two favorite kaiju moments of all time.

As a person who had never watch Godzilla before, it made me so invested straight away. I will now be watching every subsequent movie.

Here's my second favorite Godzilla introduction ever: https://youtu.be/gpyBvmrdmmY&&That scene definitely made me the *most* angry, if it's the one I'm remembering... Where it cuts off and starts focusing on Elizabeth Olson for no God damn reason? I audibly shouted in my seat at it - but I was already upset. There was WAY too little Godzilla in that movie.&&Because it was about ATJ's boring character. 

I've said it before,  make the movie Cranston and Gozilla and it would have been a worldstar. &&They confirmed *Shin Godzilla* was a one-off. No sequels.&&Can't imagine how much money Clark spends on fruit only to have to drop and discard them when a situation arises. &&""save"" &&It really is!  They learned from their mistakes with Godzilla 2014 and channeled a more action-adventure vibe for Kong: Skull Island.  It embraces the genre a bit more and it pays off in my point of view.

He’s called *King* Ghidorah for a reason; he is Godzilla’s arch-nemesis.&&That's a big drone that can deliver that bad boy. Probably Jet-Jaguar&&As a kid I always assumed Rodan was good, but I guess it’s more like Godzilla, a neutral force of destruction.&&What about Biollante, she just wanted to be fancy&&Gamera is the friend of all children&&You can see Mothra's stubby little legs, so yeah that's most likely her larval form.&&That’s my bet, yeah.

King Ghidorah would have already been awakened and stomped Godzilla, prompting her to be like “you know what this situation could use? MORE giant monsters!” And she helps awaken the other two to aid Godzilla in fighting King Ghidorah, who is probably going to be revealed as an extra-terrestrial threat that was sealed away years ago in ice, but has reawakened to finish the job of destroying the Earth.&&Perfectly balanced, you say? &&https://archive.4plebs.org/tv/thread/97629163/&&**D O N K E Y    K O N G**&&Godzilla may be king, but he's not the leader of the bunch.&&First time I’ve ever choked on my drink laughing.&&Haha, holy fucking hell.

Maybe that bug looking thing from the Oppenheimer teaser for the 2014 Godzilla.&&King Kong is public domain in the US but Toho utilized him multiple times so he counts as a member of the toho kaiju despite being western in origin.

Edit: I was incorrect about King Kong being public domain. &&> cannot find source.

I think the source is basically common sense. The film showed skeletons of his parents, much larger than him. Its been many years (decades?) since the Kong film was set. The monster hes going to be fighting is much bigger than he was in Kong.   

It still shocks me when people say Kong will be small, its like they paid no attention to really obvious details &&The source is the movie itself, when John C. Reilly's character explains that Kong is afraid of the big Skullcrawler because it kills his parents and he's not big enough to fight it yet, but that he still has a lot of growing to do. Hence why Kong was pissed about the bombs waking the Skullcrawlers up, because he wasn't prepared to deal with them yet.&&If fire is Kong's weakness, you might want to consider that Godzilla can shoot nuclear fire out of his face. In addition, Kong's agility is due to his smaller size. If he grows to a scale that is comparable to Godzilla, he will be considerably slower. He may have a marginal speed increase, but I doubt it will be enough to handle the firepower and defenses Godzilla is packing. Only way I can see Kong standing a chance is if the movie is right off the heels of the new film when Godizlla battered from his victory over King Ghidora. Only way Kong was able to take Godzilla in the original film was by giving him some BS electricity powers that Godzilla was somehow weak to. My money is on Godzilla every single time.&&After watching the latest Kong movie, I quickly came to the conclusion that Kong could wreck Goji's shit if he was careful enough. Anybody questioning that should watch Skull Island. &&Err I’m not sure what skull island you watched, but Kong was getting his ass beat by the mother skull crawler too. It was only the little ones he beat easily, that were a tenth of his size. It took a distraction from the boat plus flare gun to stop the skull crawler killing Kong. 

Godzilla had to contend with two MUTOs that were almost his size and one could fly, which is a world of difference from what Kong fought. 

Then factor in Godzilla has atomic breath, is beefier and will still be larger, Kong realistically doesn’t stand a chance. They’ll find some way to bullshit it so he does, but Kong simply scaled up doesn’t hold a candle to Godzilla. &&That and godzilla mama birding the MUTO some atomic radiation. I was practically doing karate moves of excitement in my seat. &&Love the whale-like noise at the end.&&God, I forgot about that scene from Pacific Rim. So damn good. &&Its not that some of can't it's just that some of us won't. Other obligations :(

That being said though I guarantee you can find Godzilla in a Walmart bin if you search hard enough. Which I will pick up because it's just an awesome movie.

Rodan/Namek Vegeta: may be on your side if a greater enemy shows up, but they won't hesitate to hit you or kill you if you get in their way and/or annoy them too much.

And from a realistic POV, a giant mech is an impractical weapon. It won’t be as agile or as fast as any other Kaiju (or I guess Titans in this movie) and it would require literally hundreds of millions of dollars to the low billions just to maintain and keep it in proper fighting condition.

Rather, the movie was a remake of a movie with the same title made in 1933 by RKO General. The 1976 remake came with its own round of litigation, with many parties claiming to have at least partial rights over the name, characters, and plot of the movie. Universal, however, argued that no one did, and that the characters and plot were in the public domain. In the subsequent litigation with Nintendo, the court noted this inconsistency, using it as part of the basis for finding that Nintendo’s Donkey Kong game did not infringe upon Universal’s rights (if any) over King Kong. Nintendo prevailed, and, when Universal appealed, the next court admonished Universal for its inconsistent legal logic.

[The Article](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/02/historical-hypocrisy-donkey-kong-king-kong-the-public-domain/)

There is more detail in the Article, but it basically talks about the legal battle between Nintendo and Universal about the status of King Kong as being in public domain or not and how Universal tried to argue that it was when they remade the original 1936 movie, then they tried to argue that it wasn't in order to sue Nintendo.

I did some more googling, and it does look like it is owned by someone and it might be Universal, but my google-fu is sucks and I haven't found a clear answer.&&Read up to confirm and you're correct. I misunderstood the legal situation with RKO, Universal and Cooper entirely.&&People give the movie flack for cockteasing Godzilla (which, I guess they kind of did at times, even if not intentionally), but godDAMN, that moment was worth the wait to see the big guy do his thing.&&Best theater experience of my life.

It actually was a tale of two Rodans, male and female, that were tearing up Japan because they were hungry, and because they could.

YSK: Disney doesn't play nice with small town theaters. The require theaters to run their movies for a set period of time - as long as 4 weeks straight - even if they only have one screen.,44439,8zo6wh,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/disney-the-last-jedi-rules-movies-1.4455305,1984,1531855322.0,,"Wow that explains why my local single screen didn't have Star Wars, mystery solved&&The local cinema in my small town have been mulling over if it's even worth having movies with some of these requirements.  For one of the more recent Star Wars movies, Disney was demanding a four-week run, with two shows per night, on the biggest screen.  This place has one large screen, and a couple of smaller ones that do like 25 people each.  That's a really tough pill for them to swallow when they have to decide between getting good turnout for a week, but losing out for three afterwards, or losing the audience for a big film to the next city over.&&there is a theater in my town that is feeling this, they chose not to show the last star wars because of it &&This is only going to get worse.&&I live in a town of about 4500 people and I spoke to our theater owner about this a couple years ago when The Force Awakens came out and he told me he had to have it for four weeks if he wanted it on the opening weekend, and it wasn't the only one requiring this. The audience fall-off is significant after a week in a market like ours, no matter how good the movie is. We've been getting fewer and fewer movies right on their opening dates cause it doesn't make the theater any money. This doesn't bother me so much these days as I've learned not to worry about it, but in my teens and 20s that would have really annoyed me.&&Can theater owners just put it on a TV in the lobby? Would that count?&&that's what you get when huge corporations are a monopoly or get too comfortable with their power.

it will be really interesting for future historians to study modern cases. how a company can churn so many lovey-dovey cute love-preaching flicks while fucking everybody in the process.&&This is almost like the pre Paramount decision when block booking was allowed.&&The catch 22 on this is amazing. They want people to go to the theater but then make it expensive to theaters to even host the movie, forcing them to raise prices, keeping people away, which then causes them to raise prices. 

This is why people pirate movies. &&Worked in a small theater for about 9 months.

This is 100% accurate. Also couldn't use our discounts for the movie until about 2 weeks after it's been released.&&Honestly, why would a 1-screen theater even show a Star Wars movie if that was the case? It doesn't seem like a smart business decision for Disney to tell small theaters that they'd be better off showing Jumanji 3 instead of Star Wars IX.&&Feel like this is a issue with every studio though. Universal does it, same with WB and Fox.  Only difference is even though Disney releases fewer movie than the other studios their movies are all BIG. If I owned a 1 Screen theatre I would give the movie I was contracted to screen, the showtime that usually makes me the least amount of money.&&Only one screen and it fits half the town.  &&Is a cinema with one screen even a sustainable business concept..? 
We have a cinema in a 20k inhabitant town which has like 6 screening rooms. Having a cinema in a place that attracts only enough people for one screening room does not seem like a smart idea to begin with. 
However I dont get why you would require a cinema to show your movie a certain amount of time.. if they just want it for one screening then sure why not, if they pay the required amount. &&This is being made to be a much bigger deal than it is, overblowing the problem. Disney is in fact working on making this easier for theaters by planning to eventually own every single film company and distribution firm ever made for the perpetuity of existence&&Is it a requirement that nothing else is played on that screen during the run? If we're talking about digital projectors and the movies are shipped on a hard drive, what would it take to switch between different shows throughout the day?&&Even in larger cities, it's not great. I live within walking distance to three movies theaters and I've had a hard time seeing some medium and smaller release films where I live without traveling to surrounding cities. When there are two big releases out, there are very few showings of other films at any of the three theaters near me.&&Outdated info.  That was TLJ.  Black Panther, Infinity War, Solo, and Ant-Man and The Wasp all played (or are about to play for the last one) for one or two weeks at our small, local theater.  The Incredibles 2 is playing 2 weeks right now.&&My family used to volunteer at a small community run theater.  1 screen, 1 showing a night, Saturday Sunday and Mondays.  The studios were so difficult to work with.  They would frequently send ""plants"" to the theater and then threaten retaliation.  Usually for stuff like ""not receiving tickets and no ticket takers at the door""...even though it was a 1 screen theater with a single showing, and the ticket stand was about 6 feet from the door.


It's literally impossible for a theater in a smallish city to turn a profit.&&Disney and similar: ""we want to combat piracy."" 

Also Disney and similar: ""we will keep doing annoying  and inconvenient anti-consumer practices from the 19th century.""

Hmm I wonder why people pirate things.&&Man I can't even imagine how bad, things are going to get in the future.&&We’ve got a 1 screen that plays everything for 1 week at a time. Including Disney movies. They’re usually about 3 weeks after they’re in theatres but they play every night at 7:30 and have the best popcorn I’ve ever eaten. &&This is how every major release from every studio works. Either that or you don’t get their content. WB did it with lord of the rings too. It’s not just single screen theaters, every run of every standard release is a minimum 2 week release. 

Generally the longer a theater runs a film the more of the box office take they get. So week one it’s 90/10 week 2 80/20. The problem is single screen theaters have no leverage against major studios if they have a nice slate. So Disney can force you to run something, or even keep something on a screen, or they can deny you future films. If you’re a single screen theater you want the top earner for every week so right now Disney is King. And why monopolies are bad. 

Large chains like AMC have move leverage. This is why day-and-date (I’d rather pay $50 and watch it at home opening weekend that go to a theater) isn’t happening for major releases. Every time a studio tries AMC and Regal say “we won’t show that movie in any theater if you do day and date”. And the circle jerk goes on. 

The other way it goes is this, A studio has an absolute bomb coming, everyone knows it because all the distributors see the movies in advance and the tracking data is almost always on point. The studio will ask a theater to leave a bomb on the screen for some future incentive. Like 80/20 opening weekend of a highly anticipated film instead of 90/10. Or they will agree to not send a film to a rival theater across town. There’s also a lot of rules that studios follow in terms of distance a film can play from itself. So let’s say you got a 3plex and a 2 plex in town and they are 1/2 a mile apart. 2 plex will keep some horrible movie going to prevent the 3 plex from getting the summer action blockbuster.

So when Solo was tracking bad and the single screen wants to dump it, or put Deadpool 2 back on for the midnight show, Disney can tell them no. Now they can always tell Disney to fuck off, and some theaters do indeed do that. 

The other burn to small theaters recently was that they were effectively forced to lease super expensive digital projectors because film prints don’t really exist anymore, especially major releases. The cost of printing 3500 runs of Solo vs a projector downloading it is has made film prints all but obsolete. Shipping drives is also easier than making prints so that is the alternative for theaters that can’t get a fiber optic line. But traditionally a 90 min film was 4 cans of film that had to be spliced together by a projectionist. Now you have a drive you plug in. It rarely breaks, never melts in the middle of a showing, and you can’t lost 1 of four cans or get stuck because of bad weather. So you used to have a 35mm projector that would work for 20 years just fine.  Now you have a digital projector that, like any other computer, will be obsolete every 5-7 years and so you just continue to lease new projectors endlessly. 

So there you go. 
&&This is 80% of the reason behind these newer movies record box office numbers. 


It’s easy to break records when you don’t allow any competition 
&&How would Disney know if the theater just quietly put the reels to the side for a couple of weeks and started showing something else? There's no way they have people driving to every small town in America to check on theaters.&&What theater only has one screen?&&I live in a small town with a non profit theater and we still get Disney movies for one weekend. Does it work different for non-profit theatres? Or is it something else?&&Disney is known in legal circles to be the worst company on the face of the planet to negotiate with. &&I work at a smaller independent theatre, and I can fully say that this is true.

Then run some other movie the rest of the day. Malicious compliance for the win!&&Different perspective: if a theater doesn't like their crazy rules, don't play Disney films. It's not like Disney is forcing them to play in their theaters. **There are many other great studios to support that may not be big names like D**, so if a theater really wants to succeed and get on the community's side, maybe focus on a less popular studio to show you're supporting besides the money-hungry companies.&&and people think disney owning 40% of the market is a good thing.&&I remember it as if it happened yesterday, when Disney released the first Star Wars movie close to Christmas and they demanded the cinemas who wanted to show the movie to run it for 4 weeks.

>On December 16, 2015, Tarantino appeared on The Howard Stern Show to promote The Hateful Eight. During his interview, Tarantino stated that Disney was preventing his film from being screened at the Los Angeles Cinerama Dome because they wanted to reserve the space for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, for which Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures holds distribution rights.

It wasn't the govt that turned out to be evil - it was the megacorporations.  Disney is big brother on steroids.  &&Movie theatre workers in bigger cinemas (10+ screens?) - how packed are the Disney movies by the last two weeks?&&Here is the thing, I can not really bag on Disney for wanting to keep a movie in a theater for as long as possible to maximize ticket sales. And honestly I am pretty sure I read about the same kind of policies that Lucas Film did when the prequels came out. And I get it, this means nothing when you have 14 screen mega plexes in town but when you are in a small town or a small theater, (there are one screen theaters even in cities like LA and San Fransico etc.) it kind of leaves you out. But it seems like there is a way around it.

If I was running one of these small theaters I would just eat the payroll for a single employee to be working at times that were not needed or profitable. Maybe 2 just for safety. But you figure if you planned ahead, and got the movie and figured for 2 weeks you are gonna run it strait, then after that you want to run whatever new is coming out, the only restriction is it has to run every day, 4 times a day. So open you theater at like 6am, run it 2 times before your normal day even begins. Then pay another employee to stay late and run it one more time as like a midnight showing (which in a small town is probably also a waste) and then maybe run it one time in a real time slot during the day as an early showing. There is 4 times. Sure it cost you a bit of money I guess for a couple weeks, but  I would imagine that even with TLJ the ticket sales for those first 2 weeks would probably have more then covered the extra bit of payroll you used.

I can understand the reasoning on both sides of the deal, each wants to make money. And eventually one side or the other will figure out if they lose money sticking to their guns and will cave in.
&&The more I learn about Disney the more I hate them.&&I work at one of these family owned, single screen theaters. Not only does Disney force us to play their movies for at least 3 weeks, but they take 70% of total ticket revenue. 

To give an example, we earned $13,000 during the opening week of Incredibles 2, which is an enormous take for us. Disney pocketed $9100 of that. 

It’s not like we can do anything about it either. Right now Disney makes the most movies that make our theater money. That $3900 we get to keep is still more than we would make playing any other movie that was out at the same time. &&Is there limit how big screen needs to be? How about if you show it on tv in one corner of theatre for 4 weeks? &&What no one is mentioning is that this is standard practice for Star Wars. I was a projectionist when the Prequels were released, the deal then was the first film print had to run on the largest auditorium for *12 weeks*, second print had to run for 8 weeks, third prints had a 4 week minimum. This tied up the largest room for the entire summer, although the others could move. 

This was lessened after *The Phantom Menace*, as theater owners flat out told them ""no, we aren't doing that this time"" and Fox/Lucasfilm realized they actually needed the theaters to make back the money they'd spent on this thing.

There's no lack of movies to run at the times Disney releases Stars Wars and MCU films, si theaters could easily tell them to take a hike or, for larger ones, only run a single screen to get some of the business while still being flexible. After a couple releases like this, Disney would feel the pain and either change their ways or just bitch about theater owners (probably the latter). &&I come from a really small town. The closest theater which is 45 minutes away over a mountain is slightly less small than my town and they only have two screens. They switch their movies every Thursday. The latest Star wars didn't get switched for like four weeks and it apparently tanked their business pretty heavily.

No surprise.&&So like don't show that movie.&&Yeah, my local one-screen theater has been very open about why they never played Solo or The Last Jedi. 

They did play Infinity War, but not the new Ant-Man (yet).&&Yup. My local theater had to cancel Incredibles 2 (which they were already getting two weeks late) because they couldn’t show it for two weeks based on their schedule. &&I live in a town of less than 1,200. We have a very dedicated 1 screen theater with $5 tickets, $3 large popcorn, and $2.50 large pop, nice digital projectors, very clean, always packed. Only downside is we only get 2nd run movies, which dont have to abide by the stupid rules Disney and other studios puts on their releases. It kinda sucks not getting a movie until 4-5 weeks after its mainstream premiere but its also kickass to see it for CHEAP in a small theater with my friends.&&piggybacking top comment..

not only is Disney absurdly demanding when it comes to showing their films, they typically charge 52%+ in film hire, for example if your movie ticket costs $1, then 52c of that $1 goes straight to Disney no questions asked. 

Makes it even **more** impossible for small screen cinema's to survive. &&To me it is more crazy that you ha e a single screen theater that isn’t just some specialty we are a bar that shows old movies kind of thing. The smallest theater here has 16 screens. &&They also demanded a record high percentage from ticket revenue for Last Jedi.

It’s a Church now.&&I'm surprised this is such an issue with the market share Disney controls now-at this point they're competing with themselves for some of the largest movies. Single-screen theaters would have had to choose between playing Infinity War or Solo on opening weekend, for example, since they came out within two weeks of each other. And then there was not quite enough time to finish a 4-week run of both of those movies before the Incredibles 2 came out, which was followed by Ant Man and the Wasp three weeks later. I'm sure small town theater's aren't taking in tons of money, even combined, but you would think Disney would want to pack every penny they could into opening weekends. If you constantly make people choose between a long drive or waiting to see a movie, eventually you'll end up training people to just skip the theater entirely.&&Hmm why not just ""play"" the movies at terrible times like 3am? &&And it's only going to get worse with the upcoming Fox/Disney merger.

But they've all gone out of business.&&Whenever I go to the theaters, even for marvel movies, I get popcorn and a soda, even if I don't finish it bc I know that's where the actual money is made and wanna support them.

It also gives me an excuse to eat an insane amount of popcorn &&Adapt or die&&The most recent Star Wars was possibly the biggest crash in history for all the IP advantages which the franchise has compared to other bombs (e.g. people already know the franchise, the characters from Han to Lando to Chewie, the iconic elements such as the Falcon, with a huge pre-built fanbase over multiple generations, it's not something which needs to draw people in blind like most bombs), on top of Disney paying 4 billion for the franchise and maybe billions on their theme parks, and maybe gotten 600-1.2 billion back so far after production costs, cinema cuts, advertising, taxes, etc.

So they may not be able to negotiate like that with the franchise again any time soon. Outside of the US, the situation was incredibly dire, audiences just didn't show up in any of Star Wars' traditional markets, it was only in the US that the film even got some audiences, and even there it bombed.&&You didn't miss much&&Theaters are going to see rough times within the next generation no matter what.  My daughter and her friends for example, who were born in the mid 2000's digital age are not very interested in the ritual of going to the theaters.  They watch movies a lot less than kids when I was their age.

In today's world of mass digital content distribution and the barrage of competing methods of entertainment, going to the movies is something that will be less appealing to each subsequent generation, and as those people enter into adulthood, the business is going to have to change.  Small local places will have even less customers.

I consider myself a huge movie buff and avid collector, I love going to the movies, but I still have a hard time finding the time to see everything I want to see, there's just too much other stuff to do and I can wait to see movies at home more and more.  &&Yeah, it's pretty depressing.

&&>The audience fall-off is significant after a week in a market like ours, no matter how good the movie is.

That's true in all markets, and it's the reason why film companies (not just Disney, they all do it) require a film to be shown for X number of weeks - the theaters make bank opening weekend, but the film producers want the ticket sales from the next several weeks too, even if only 25% of the seats are sold.&&Good point about the decrease in sales after a week. That could literally sink a smaller theater. Theaters aren't exactly in their peaks as it is. Only going to get worse. Disney is a real piece of shit company. The worse part is they also have rights to a TON of movies. What would they do if they had 2 movies within 2 weeks of each other? Just not be able to show the 2nd movie?&&Disney generally ask for the best screen, for precisely this reason.&&Could the owner simply run it after midnight when the theater is empty? Just pay 1 employee to be there operating the projector&&We don’t get Blu-Ray, movies are sent in a special encrypted format called DCP that can only be played on secure digital cinema projectors - starting at around $40K for a very small one.

You nailed Disney's hypocrisy. 

EDIT: ONE of Disney's many hypocrisies. &&Time to vote for people who will use the full force of the law against these bastards.  Yes, I'm talking about Zombie Teddy Roosevelt!&&This isn't new. Lets not forget how they extended the premise of copyright to an absurd length&&This really all goes back to Paramount. Back in 1989 when they released Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade they forced theaters to pay a minimum charge per ticket and play X amount of showings per day.

Prior to that, each theater was able to set their own prices and show times. I was running a theater in a small town where we were only charging $3.50 and playing 4 shows a day. We jumped to $5.50 over that summer because Paramount wanted a minimum of $5/ticket.&&""I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now! Ha-ha! And do you know why?

-Mickey Mouse &&This has been a thing since before it was a huge corporation doing it.  Disney inherited the practice from Lucas.&&What are you referring to here? Sorry i dont know.&&Used to work projection at a 17 screen theater. This was back in the last years of 35mm prints, but theaters also had to pay for each print of a movie they exhibited, and the per-print price could get between $15k to $20k for big movies like Star Wars. This was not a security deposit, the theater didn't get any of this money back.

Then they also had to give the studio big cuts of the ticket sales. Your theater likely only makes a few bucks per ticket sold. This scales back as the weeks go by, but not by much.

This is why I tell people movie theaters are just glorified popcorn vendors. They make shit on the movies.&&They have a streaming service coming. I don't wanna put on a tin foil hat but....&&Disney and the other studios have a hand in raising prices too...they're the ones who set the cost of renting the film in the first place, obviously. The contracts also typically state that 100% of the ticket sales go back to the studio for the first week or two. Theaters get really screwed all around, unless you buy their expensive concessions.&&There are 3, 20+ screen theaters within 10 miles of me, and all three do this.&&The only movies Disney has restricted for passes at my theatre has been Force Awakens and Last Jedi&&Because people want to see big new releases. The theater would lose out on more money by not playing the big movie if it’s running relatively unopposed. &&Depends on the market.&&Because it's not just Star Wars.  It's every single movie under the Disney umbrella, which is an insane amount of the most profitable blockbusters of the last decade.

You tell them to fuck off with their day/date Star Wars, they tell you to fuck off when you want day/date on the next Marvel movie, or the next Disney Princess movie, or the next Pixar Studios movie, or the next Avatar movie...it's a brutal lose-lose situations for small theaters and is only getting worse and worse as Disney gobbles up more and more properties.&&The reason why Disney is singled out because they have constantly done this far more often than any major studio in the world. Now that Comcast/NBCUniversal deciding to back out of the Fox bid, local cinemas are gonna get ready for the inevitable, as Fox shareholders will approve the Disney/Fox deal, and Disney will use Fox to leverage its already unethical ways.&&I have family in a small town and those tiny theaters are definitely more passion-projects than anything else. I’d bet they have some other form of income separate from the theater. &&Well according to comments in this very post, there are plenty of small theaters that don't have to show Disney movies forever&&the town in the article is about 3500 people.and the theatre is run by the municipality... its a way to keep people sane in an isolated place that has 7 month winters.  &&Nothing. But. Each theater gets specific instructions based on it's volume and average showtimes. Disney will only allow other movies to be shown on the ""big screen"" in larger multiplexes when the film in question is a kids movie (like Moana) and the theater regularly stays open for 10pm or later showtimes. That time slot can go to something else (usually assuming Moana gets a late show in one of the smaller houses)&&Were movies and movie theaters a thing in the 19th century?&&This has been going on for years. Disney didn’t start this and it’s extremely old news.&&For rural folk? Real bad.&&Made up statistics are fun. Disney (generally) creates a quality product that appeals to 3 or 4 quadrants. A business can't take chances on movies that may not have an audience (indie/unknown). Higher ticket prices and global releases are the reason for newer movies breaking records.

He'll be so happy!&&We have a single screen theater here in Syracuse, NY that's $3 on weekends, $2 Mon-Thursday. Only open Fri-Sun during the winter though. Same thing with only showing 2nd run movies. The theater was originally built in the early 1900's, but they are all digital and do 3D showings, real butter popcorn, and now all seats are the lazy-boy style with reclining backs and leg/foot rests. We go to lots of movies that we would never go to a more modern theater just because it's so cheap.&&as you get older, you realize the hype around launch events is for suckers -- the movie is still good 30, 60, 90 days afterwards if it was good in the first place.

same applies to video games, and in the old days music releases. &&So you have an AMC?&&> they typically charge 52%+ in film hire, for example if your movie ticket costs $1, then 52c of that $1 goes straight to Disney no questions asked.

Actually as of SW: TLJ it's 65% for the entire run.

Edit: a letter, and wrong movie title.&&Disney needs to be broken up Mama Bell style (so do several companies but, hey, let's stick to the one making movies). 

I love the movies Disney makes and in a way I realize the high-budget nature of the MCU might not be possible without Disney's payroll, but OTOH... they're simply too big and its negatively effecting the industry. &&Disney is one of the worst offenders, but 48% is the norm in Europe for the first 2 weeks. That’s why theaters are constantly closing down, by the way: if you add labor, utilities and taxes, those numbers are barely sustainable for independents.&&Ok but the theater is charging $5 for a soda and more for popcorn so let's hold the tears for a bit huh?&&My town only has one theatre and it is a one screen.  It is a pretty small town haha.&&my brother has to drive over an hour to get to his nearest theater with only one screen. Some places are pretty remote!&&I mostly watch movies at a one screen theater, Cinerama in Seattle. There are a few theaters in walking distance with tons of screens, but I much prefer the place with 1 big ass screen.&&Ive seen two 1 screen theaters in my life. Up in the mountains around here there is a small town called [Idyllwild](https://www.rustictheatre.com/). I go there twice a year and if there is a movie I am wanting to watch I will typically wait and go here. Its neat.

The second one was in my recent trip to [Hawaii](http://honokaapeople.com/). I did not get to watch a movie but I did take a look inside. It was also neat.&&We have multiple small theaters here.

There are about 50 towns within 45 min of each other. Each with only a few thousand people seperated by roughly 5 miles of farm lands.

It just make more sense to have a small theatre (as many double with stages and acting companies) rather than a giant auditorium or multiplex.

Our theatres here are roughly the size of a big house.&&There is an abandoned single screen theatre about a mile from my house. Inside it’s left the exact way it was the day it closed. &&I have three 24 screen theaters within like 10 minutes of me lol&&We have one with like 10 screens but our single screen is rad. 7 dollar movies, beer, love seats, and bomb pizza.&&My town (pop. 3000) has a two screen theater and all movies are 99 cents.  They have a container of pennies sitting by the door for change.!  They show new releases, and It’s owned  by community members and supported by donations and concessions (but a large popcorn is 3.75 so not a bad deal).   They used to have one screen but added a second smaller one a couple years ago; probably something to do with this Disney crap! &&My city of 170,000 has one 10 screen theatre.&&Our local theatre has TWO screens. Pretty exciting!&&In my town we are 50k people. and our cinema has 3 screens. The biggest cinema i have seen had like 5 maybe ?&&You live in a bigger area probably. There is 4 12 plus screen theaters within reasonable driving distance and one small one screen that is very hipstery&&I'm not sure I have many more than 16 screens on my whole island... let me check.

* Kahului - 2 theaters total of 18 screens
* Kihei - 1 theater, which might be closed for 4 screens
* Lahaina - 1 theater with 3 screens

That brings us to 21 to 25 screens max without taking a plane to another island. Granted, Maui may not be your typical experience, but much of small town America has pretty limited options without 1+ hour drive.&&I grew up in South mpls and my closest movie theater was a single screen renovated show theater. Even big cities have them.&&I found this, is this yours?

v&&There is a single screen theater near me that you’ve probably never heard of, it’s called the Alamo Draft House. You can order food and alcohol during the movie and if someone talks or uses their phone an usher will hit them in the knee with a metal pipe&&All of the multi-screen theaters in the nearby towns usually have maybe 10 ppl in the showing. My single screen drive-in in town will show the same movie to hundreds a night.

They also let all kids under 13 in free, adults are only 6 bucks, and you can bring a cooler full of shit. It's no wonder theater goers are dropping. Hmm 12 bucks for me and family versus 40 bucks.. and that's just on tickets.&&For real. My ex lived in a small town of about 3000 and the theatre there still had multiple screens. My city had a theatre with a single screen, but it’s a classy bar *and* a theatre located in a repurposed 1000 year old church. And the theatre seems to only play old french movies &&Yeah, mine shows new movies 90% of the time. Usually every Friday they switch to a new release.&&We had one in my home town that lasted 1 year. They had 3 screens. It’s now a dollarama and a liquor store. &&this is happening at a rapid rate now more than ever. what is happening is small independant cinemas are being forced out of the industry, while larger cinema chains can negotiate better deals with Disney due to their scale.   


Disney is now integrating vertically, with a streaming service, movie production studio and before long their own cinema chain..&&Ours is a very historic building and beautil. And now sits abandoned with a sign ""help us turn this into a concert venue!""&&Damn, i would have prefered one movie per month instead of weekly reruns of the same 2000 year old story you get everywhere else. &&Time requirements have been around for quite a while now. Most distributing studios require their film to be played for at least 2 weeks before being removed as part of their contract. This can become a huge factor when local theater owners are choosing which films to show

They also sometimes monitor showtimes and which screen the movie is playing on. The owner of my local theater was forced to keep Star Wars Episode 1 for 8 weeks in their main auditorium when it came out&&Same thing happened to my small town. We had a small theater downtown that had two screens. It eventually went under and became a church. For years, I made fun of the fact that the church made use of the movie marquee.&&>It’s a Church now.

Their fried chicken is pretty good.  I hope we're talking fried chicken here. &&It got leveled and turned into a parking garage here.&&Churches are more profitable anyways. Glad they got into that business. Saves a bunch of time on taxes too, since they don't pay them. &&In this in Campbell River, BC? Or do theatres turn into churches more often than I think? Lol. &&That happened to me. We would drive to the city every weekend to see a movie. 

Eventually a small 3 screen one opened in our home town... we would go every weekend sometimes on Tuesdays when it was cheap... then the dreaded 4 week rule. We stopped going as much. Then we just stopped going all together because they didn’t take care of the theatre it was falling apart fast. The movies were no good. The seats were ripped. The people were rude. So we just stayed home instead of going to the city. 
&&>Single-screen theaters would have had to choose between playing Infinity War or Solo on opening weekend, for example, since they came out within two weeks of each other

Disney couldn't give 2 shits about single-screen theaters.  That's not where the big box office numbers come from.&&Solo and Infinity War came out a month apart. Infinity War came out April 27th and Solo came out May 25th. But yes, essentially they are competing with themselves very frequently. &&I guarantee there are time window stipulations too.&&You'd have a whole extra shift's worth of payroll and various other overhead at that point. &&There are generally time stipulations by distributors. I imagine in these scenarios they want a show time between 6 and 8 PM. Also, as fun as it would be to try and spite the mouse, if you want your theatre to succeed you want to schedule shows that people will actually come to. And that’s in addition to what someone else said about the additional payroll and associated costs of operating. &&im not talking about the Han movie. i was referring to TLJ&&When I think about renting movies before streaming it seems completely insane. I had to drive to a physical store, hope they had the movie (both in their collection and in stock), give them money, then drive back *again* within a few days to return it. Looking back from where we are now, it makes me wonder why we ever put up with that.

I wonder if that's how going to the theater will seem in a few years. I love going to the movies, but it's not hard to imagine a not-too-distant-future where it seems nuts that you had to go to a theater at a time of the theater's choosing, sit with a bunch of random strangers (and either buying or showing up well in advanced if you wanted a good seat) and spend an amount of money that could almost let you purchase the movie.&&TL;DR: business models that don't adapt to changing consumer trends tend to struggle. Water is wet.&&> ritual of going to the theaters. 

Why would they when movie tickets are approaching $20 in some places? That's two months of Netflix, a lot of people are content to just wait it out. &&I’m 39 and don’t care. I love movies, and action movies aren’t appreciably better or worse than they were in times past. People are nostalgia blind. There’s a shortage of good dramas and comedies in theaters because they just don’t pull the crowds like action blockbusters do, but streaming TV is making up for the cinema drama drought, even if comedy isn’t keeping up. 

I had a curmudgeon phase from 32-36 or so but when I realized it was more about me than creative types I rekindled my love for the movies. &&Pirate Disney Movies - it's for a good cause!&&Yep people are pulling out their pitchforks but this has been going on for years and Disney is definitely not the first or the only that does this. It makes total sense for them to do this.&&What if it is the best screen&&Trying to loophole the Mouse is not a good idea.&&One of them. My personal favorite is ""We mine classic stories that have gone out of copyright, but lobby for copyright on whatever we make to extend until the heat death of the universe.""&&This is precisely why I dislike the disney situation so much right now: sure they make watchable movies, but they do it at the expense of their own employees and theater owners, which will eventually screw over consumers too. It's quite cunning really, any other company doing this would get crucified, but because they make everyone's childhood movies and they apparently can do no wrong, everyone turns a blind eye; can we all for a moment imagine the immense backlash that would happen if say the Fantastic Beasts franchise was the most popular movie series and WB pulled the tactics disney is using right now? Even with comcast bidding for fox against disney, people *kept* saying ""Well, I'd rather have disney get it rather than Comcast, because Comcast is *evil*."" If that isn't hypocrisy, I don't know what is.&&The question is since the 22nd amendment was passed after him would he be allowed 2 terms or just limited to 1?&&Also tried to copyright “Día De Los Muertos” when Coco came out. The Hispanic community was rightly very upset about it and they ended up backing off &&Studios used to make cinemas buy a bunch of films at the same time. Some of the films would be good, some absolute garbage. Regulation ultimately stopped that practice.

Regulation is probably needed here too.&&It's no surprise concessions are so much. Maybe they should give tickets away with a tub of popcorn... &&Yeah I remember when I worked at my theater that they didn't get much from tickets and concessions is what paid for us + any profits they make (which wasn't much). So I understand why it costs so much and doesn't bug me like it does a lot of people.&&Wouldn't it work to have theaters buy prints that they own and could screen at their convenience?

It would be so cool to have a theater do theme weeks, or bring back popular movies and such. Not just ""whatever is new this month"" &&I hope no one uses it.


But people will use it.&&No way. They want you to buy both. Making it harder to see Marvel movies in theaters isn't really going to benefit the streaming service much if it all. And a movie's success is measured mostly by ticket sales. They're not gonna fall on that sword just for a streaming service.&&Isn't that what I said?&&The ticket restrictions for staff are another demand from the movie studios. The size of the theater has nothing to do with it.&&If it's going to be running relatively unopposed for an entire month then they would have almost no reason to question it. That doesn't really happen though. One key factor was also left out: Disney also demands a larger cut than most other companies. Especially in the opening week when demand is at its highest.  

In reality, there's plenty of movies and only so many seats they can fill regardless. There's a limit to how much money they can make, higher demand doesn't always mean they can fit in more showings. If you fill 100% of your theater for a week, and 50% the second week, 10% the third and fourth. You're way better off doing separate movies that fill the theater 75% week over week.

Most small theaters refused to show Star Wars. Can't fault them for that as it was the economically sound choice. It's a stupid business move on Disney's part. They can't treat all theaters as equal. Sooner or later they are going to own so many franchises that they will only be locking themselves out anyways. They are blinded by their own greed. &&But they only want to see them opening weekend?&&While that’s true, the Jumanji movies give those theaters an alternative to Star Wars, which could make this backfire for Disney.&&Sure, but didn't the last Jedi come out in December 2017? Because I remember seeing a post about Disney fucking theaters during that time too.&&Yeah the made up stats thing is fun. 

But no I’ve seen at least three reports from credible news folks talking about the Disney bully tactics. 
You have the screen guarantee, the percentage of sales which set records starting with the last jedi, and the stipulations and penalties are ridiculous.    

You can defend a mega corp playing hard ball with local theater owners and you can talk about “quality product” but to me it’s big business bullshit. And I don’t dick ride anybody who plays like that. 

And no if I knew a film would be showing on 95% of the screens by contract then I wouldn’t release a film... that’s like saying “if you knew best buy would only stock one copy of your game and 40 copies of a big name game why would you release your game?” You wouldn’t, you’d wait. But not because your product is inferior, because a big name company bought all the shelf space and their shit is CRAMMED down consumers throats. &&True, and now that I think about it, ticket receipts. Oh, well.&&Then what if Pepsi does a clause where they have to have more space than coke, does the store have to choose what one to stock? (Also Pepsi is so much better than Coke )&&Yeah but that's because They just mostly have the franchises big enough to do it. When WB had Harry Potter series, they were doing it a lot. &&So is mine, but that's because I'm in the UK.&&I just wanted to say this somewhere, my local cinema (4 screens) is getting The Incredibles at the _very end of August_&&Fuck, I only just realized with your comment that I missed this movie... didn’t even realize it was in theatres :/&&Yeah I though it looked like a fine action movie, but there are plenty of those. I just wasn’t interested to see young Han Solo, and I bet that applies to a lot of people. &&Too bad too, it was actually really good. Too bad Disney released it on the absolute worst week in the year for the box office.&&I quite liked it. A heck of a lot more than Rogue One.&&Syracuse has multiple good cheap ones right? I assume you're talking about the Palace, but I remember the Hollywood being decent too. &&Is that second run theater in Mattydale still around?&&You're not talking about the Hollywood? Cause they're open 7 days a week. &&It feels so weird to hear about a theater that closes on the weekend *except* in winter. Having grown up in Los Angeles, going to the movies on the weekend was our main way to beat the heat! Guess you guys don't get much heat up there?&&It's about the energy for me. The reaction to the Antman and The Wasp post credit scene was fun. I'd pay extra for that. I love when a movie is a community experience.&&Spoilers are the problem though, I couldn't care less about watching a movie when it's released, but I want to watch it without getting spoilers &&Yeah Disney is the worst, they set the rate super high and say take it or leave it. As i said just before a lot of cinemas lose money on tickets when film hire is this high&&Lucas tried to get a piece of the concession when the prequals were released... That didn't go well, pretty much the entire industry said nope.&&Personally, I'd be willing to pay a higher ticket price for certain films. Let me take the heat for 65% more. If theaters did this, many people would boycott and Disney would change over time. Maybe.... haha.&&I agree. Split the company, say, in half. Without preference to any specific franchise. Perfectly balanced&&Yeah, well if the rest of the industry is that concerned, they can create an alliance and force theaters to choose them or Disney. But realistically if that occurred they would began the same thing or worse.

The only successful option (which will never happen) is if theater-chains formed an alliance and agreed that they would ALL accept or deny movies based on the studios' demands. This would never happen because there will always be major-chain scans that would be happy to be out of the theater alliance im exchange for all that mega-studio dough.&&But Disney is radically different than the Bell System.

While Disney an enormous company that definitely abuses its clout, it is not a monopoly; not even close.  There are other organizations that have the resources and stature to compete with Disney.  The Bell System certainly was one, and as companies go, it just as pervasive and insidious if not more so.

The Bell System consisted of over two dozen subsidiaries, or ""associated companies,"" as AT&T liked to call them, in order downplay the fact that they were a monopoly.   Nearly all of these companies were wholly- or majority-owned by AT&T.  First among these was ""Long Lines,"" which was the sole provider of long distance service for every telephone subscriber in the US.  Other entitles, such as Southern Bell, Pacific Bell, and so on, were the sole providers of local phone service to over 75% of the country, their collective territory included most major cities and state capitals.  The two largest independents, GTE (now part of Verizon) and United Telecom (now part of Sprint), served much of the rest of the country.  Some really far-flung rural areas were served by various co-ops and small ""hometown"" operations.

It did even end there.  Your local phone company, whether Bell or independent, owned your telephone.  Every phone in your home or business was rented.  It was not possible to go to an electronics store and purchase one.  You had to call the phone company and arrange for an installer to come to your house and hard-wire the thing onto your wall.  It was also illegal to modify or tamper with your phone in any way.  That phone, I might add, was probably made by AT&T's manufacturing arm, Western Electric.  Even if it wasn't, it was almost certainly designed by their R&D arm, Bell Laboratories, which also invented a whole bunch of other stuff.  Seriously, do a google search for ""list of Bell Labs inventions.""

The reason I mention this is that anti-trust actions don't happen overnight; the government can't compel the break-up of an alleged monopoly by fiat.  Someone (usually the US Justice Department) has to file a lawsuit, and win.  Anti-trust trials tend to be drawn-out, acrimonious affairs, and very expensive to boot. The DoJ filed its suit in late 1974, and the final settlement wasn't reached until mid-1982.  It would be another 20 or so months until the breakup officially came into force.

The government broke up AT&T because they felt it was in the public's interest.  The implicit acceptance of AT&T's monopoly position starting in the early 1920s was a product of its time.  The arrangement brought harmonization and standardization to what was then an unwieldy patchwork of sometimes incompatible systems that did not fully interconnect.  The furtherance of technology and changing public desires made this long-time arrangement obsolete.  AT&T had long promised to provide lifeline service at a reasonable cost, and in return, the government turned a blind eye to anti-competitive practices.  When AT&T starting providing crappy service and overcharging its customers, they promised to improve.  After years of broken promises, something had to be done.

Mickey Mouse is not a lifeline.&&I mean saying they're negatively affecting the industry because of an article about a pretty specific problem (small theatres) is a bit dramatic. I get there are probably other effects but I certainly haven't felt them. And they do have plenty of competition from streaming services like Netflix and even Amazon&&So naturally, they're about to buy another one of the largest studios!&&I was about to say...

Movie tickets cost me 20 dollars in Winnipeg. I took my brother to Ant-Man and the food cost 30. I'm not going to cry for the theaters when 2 drinks, popcorn and a candy cost 30 bucks extra.&&That's part of the reason. The movies aren't that profitable and are a huge risk.&&I used to live in a town that had one cinema, with one screen, showing one film at 7.30pm, you want to see star wars? It's on 7.30pm on thursday, maybe friday too if there's not much else coming out at the same time.&&Username checks out&&Yorkton Swift current or moose jaw?&&Well my town only has half a theater and there’s no screen at all.  &&My podunk-ass town has one theatre, a huge single screen drive-in theatre, they do flea markets on weekends, it's a fuckin time warp. &&That's pretty crazy. I grew up in a pretty small town (\~12,000 people) and the nearest city that was any larger was about a 3-hour drive, but even in the 80's it had a 3-screen theater. I think it still just has a 3-screen theater, but still.

Edit: Yes, there are smaller towns, I get it.  I lived in an unincorporated community 5-6 miles from my own, and have driven through and stopped in plenty smaller, but ""that's not a small town! this is a small town!"" is the one of the weirder reverse-Crocodile Dundee arguments I've seen.&&The Egyptian is a single screen too!&&Cinerama also has that chocolate popcorn. Best place to see new movies imo&&Cinerama is too good, love it!&&Neat!&&Had a two screen theater in my home town. Of course, the second screen was crammed into a room about the size of a oversized two car garage.  Place was originally a proper theater for plays that was converted from the 50's.&&Idyllwild is such a great town. Their mayor is a [dog] (https://mayormax.com)!!&&[The one I grew up with is now a gym](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/21101)&&Our local 3 screen was in a great location for movies. So it got bought out by another theater company who leveled it and built a full scale Regal on top of it. I feel like thats the best possible option out of all of it&&That is really sad when you think about it.&&Not unless laws change. Production houses can't run theaters.&&No. They do we’ve food at the local homeless shelter a couple times a week though.&&Is that a thing most places, discounted movie tickets on Tuesdays? &&True but then why not just make an exception for 4> screen theaters or something. They would make a fraction more money off of those and then the people in those areas would be more hyped for the digital and home releases.&&Pretty much, I use to run the projectors for my local cinema and the one in the next town over. We never bothered with Day & Date movies here because it was a single screen but we would occasionally get them for the Twin screen, when you book the movie they would say somthing like 3 in 1 meaning show it 3 times a day then stipulate whether they have to be shown as morning or afternoon sessions. The manager at the twin cinema ended up creating a ""ghost screen"" in the scheduling software and would be like ""oh, no one came to that session, what a shame""&&There are. I've not made the schedule myself at my theater, but we get requirements sent down to us from the film buyers at our corporate office. We are a 14 screen theater. For something like Avengers we'll get requirements like ""22 shows between 10 AM and 11 PM, at least 4 of which starting between 6:30PM and 8:00PM, 1 of those being 3D. 4 large screens showing Avengers. You need to have 1 screen dedicated to 3D and 1 screen split half 3D and half 2D."" Most of those are requirements set by the studio. It really sucks because the number of shows we have to squeeze into the time frame has been steadily going up. Which means that we are busier for longer and I'd be fine with that except I get paid the same if we have 3500 people show up in a day versus 350 people in a day. &&Of course, but there's no way TLJ wasn't part of why Solo was a flop&&Heh fair enough, and that points out how hard the franchise has been hit imo, people don't even remember the most expensive Star Wars movie ever which was just released and cost as much as Infinity War, with many of the main characters.&&SW 7 & Rogue One was so weak that everybody I knew didn't even bat an eye at the fact TLJ was even released when I brought it up. I went and saw it with my brother, expected a forgetable movie and I got it. But since Solo was released, barely anyone I know even *went* to watch it. Idfk what Di$ney's even thinking anymore. Shitshow in the gaming community AND in the film industry. Amazing.

Edit: Di$ney&&Lots of people didn't like that either, and it's likely to affect revenue. Theater owners keep an eye on media buzz, they know what's hot and what people are getting tired of. More theaters are likely to tell Disney ""no"" next time, including lqrge chains (they'll still run the films, but cut down dramatically on how many screens they run it on). Disney will feel it. &&Don't worry, you guys didn't miss anything good.&&It's funny how quickly we get spoiled.

When renting movies first became a thing regular people could do, it was a revelation. You could watch the movie you wanted, when you wanted to. Growing up, I no control over anything on TV. If I wanted to watch something, I had to watch what was on. That's it.

Of course, it was shit.

VHS was a terrible technology. The video quality was poor and you were watching it on a crappy, NTSC, tube TV.

Then DVDs came out and that was great. Much better quality and better pricing if you wanted own your own movies. 

Then streaming came along and DVDs became kind of a pain. You mean I have to get up, look through my collection and physically put the disc in the machine? Plus, DVDs take up a lot of space.&&> makes me wonder why we ever put up with that.

?? Wtf was the other options? &&>I had to drive to a physical store, hope they had the movie (both in their collection and in stock), give them money, then drive back again within a few days to return it. 

Was it that often that people actually looked for a particular movie though? The ritual when I was a kid was more or less ""find something you might like to watch"". Probably was just because the new releases were dearer though.

Returning didn't seem like \*that\* huge of a hassle though, just drop it off on the way to work? Mileage may vary though, I guess.&&In 20-30 years theaters will be a niche and most people will be getting movies through digital pay per views.  The theater goers will pay a premium to experience something as a niche interest. It won’t be mainstream.&&I don't think so, and that's because I, as someone in their 20s, compare cinema-going to traditional theatre-going, or attending any sort of live performance. With cinema originally being an adaptation of stage performing, it seems baked into the medium's history that the majority of popular films will have a cinema presence, and people will attend. A lot of people really enjoy cinema-going for the whole atmosphere of it all, myself included, but of course, I'll still stream at home given the right circumstances.

The process of renting a movie for home viewing, by comparison, is largely intended to be one of convenience, and video stores were simply the most convenient method 20 years ago. People would pick up a movie or two on the way home from work, and return their previous rentals at the same time. Video stores have existed that would post you your rented film for return in a self-addressed envelope, too. Pretty convenient given lack of widespread Internet, and abhorrent download speeds by today's standards.

Compare it to physical vs. digital album purchases: the majority of music listeners will buy albums digitally, because they just want the music, and care not for what medium it comes in. As such, digital is king of convenience. Plenty of people like to appreciate physical media, though, and so it'll continue to exist since it has a market, even if that market has a half-life.&&I find it sad that I have a hard time picking something to watch when I have almost anything ever made available to watch 10 minutes after I download it.
 The nostalgia of going to a video store and finding something new to watch or picking Army of Darkness again, hopefully getting to pick out a new game too, made my whole weekend. 
I believe I really appreciated a film more when it took half my day and allowance to watch it. Easy come easy go.&&Almost?  

The tickets for my wife and I are over 25 bucks total.  Then we easily spend 15-25 on food and drinks.  

Even if we sneak food in, we still have to share the theater with people playing with their phones or talking, plus you can't pause the movie if you have to do your poopsnpees.  &&If you look into foreign cinema, both European and Asian, there is a large amount of great dramas being made.&&You sound just like me.  I'm 39 as well, and I have the same feelings.  Also, good drama is usually at the indie theaters.  My last four movies I've seen in the Theater (MoviePass for the win) were:

Hearts Beat Loud

Skyscraper

Hotel Translvaynia 3

Leave No Trace

Of those, Hearts Beat Loud and Leave No Trace were by far the better movies.  

&&/u/boumtjeboo is talking about Disney's growing monopoly, not the end of some golden age or anything like that.&&Ya I’m just a few younger than you, but I found my horizons broadened a lot in my mid 20s when I started watching foreign films. I thought that was a stuffy thing to do and mostly filled with dramas but I’ve found some seriously amazing action films from South Korean directors, some mind benders from Russian film makers, and unique concepts from japan. Imo comedies and space epics/operas haven’t kept up (the latter seems to focus more heavily on expensive tech rather than first focusing on a compelling story and characters). I think we get a pretty fun boom of creativity every 10 years or so when speaking about films&&I'm older as well and I very rarely go see movies in theaters other than the occasional Dunkirk or Fury Road or latest Tarantino flick. 

Everything today is a franchise. And they're all directed by committee, there's nothing shocking or original or creative that happens.  
&&> action movies aren’t appreciably better or worse than they were in times past.

I disagree, but I don't think the issue is universal to *all* movies.  I think the issue is the overuse of CGI, and the fact that graphics capabilities have sort of reached uncanny valley.  20 or so years ago, action movies were mostly practical effects enhanced with CGI.  For example, the lobby scene from The Matrix was mostly a practical effect.  The granite on the pillars was rigged to explode, the actors are all doing real stunts, the only CGI is when they touch things up.  Even though computer graphics back then were less powerful, those films feel more real than a lot of today's blockbusters just because of the way it was used.  I've noticed that the more a film uses CGI, the less real it feels to me.  

I think we've hit that point where CGI has gotten good enough to almost look real that it's replacing large parts of films, but it's not quite good enough to actually feel real to a lot of viewers.  &&There's a new Pirates of the Caribbean coming out? &&It's been going on for years folks, no need to get mad now.  
Disney needs more money, and hopefully they can sink a few small movie houses while they're at it.  
It makes total sense for them to do this.  
   
I think Disney has enough PR without you shilling for them.

&&I agree, it makes sense... for large theaters. How many more tickets would be sold if it also premiered in small cinemas, instead of never being aired there at all? 

Yeah, Disney isn't the only offender, but just because one person does something wrong, doesn't excuse someone else from it. Though, I would agree it is extremely foolish to only focus on Disney (If that is what you meant).

What would make the most sense is if they added a stipulation that this rule only applies to theaters over a certain number of screens.&&Alas for engineers and smart-asses all over the world, judges are not computers; they are capable of parsing out what a sentence is intended to mean. This is not meant as an insult, but general word of caution. These clever word play schemes generally don't work out because, well, judges understand what the contract was meant to do, and have no problems ruling against the literal wording.

Disney's contracts will have more verbiage spelling out what the ""best"" screen refers to, but you can essentially assume that Disney's lawyers understand these legal games better than you do.&&The mouse sounds like a royal dickhead &&God Disney is such an awful company with such a golden reputation somehow. When will people open their eyes?&&>""Well, I'd rather have disney get it rather than Comcast, because Comcast is evil.""

To a similar extent, I recall someone mentioning in one of the Comcast vs Disney Fox threads that they prefer Disney over Comcast because both are evil but at least Disney pretends to be your friend.

Me, I'm thinking ""If I have to choose between two evils, I'd prefer to choose the one that's *not* trying to try to trick me into forgetting that it's evil.""&&Also at the expense of the people of Anaheim &&I love marvel, but I have never swayed on my distaste for Disney. So long as they are under the mouse, I know what it really is. 

Whats funny is how many folks hate ""corporations"" but do a 180 when it's a Corp they like. Just toss out a name like Disney, Apple, Amazon, Tesla, etc, and watch the sparks fly.&&Article 1 of the US Constitution prohibits ex-post facto laws. Since the first term was prior to the amendment it does not count for purposes of the amendment's limit and he can serve 2 new terms. It's also arguable that Zombie Teddy Roosevelt is a different person, legally speaking, than Living Teddy Roosevelt was and therefore Living Teddy Roosevelt's terms were not served by Zombie Teddy so Zombie Teddy can serve 2 terms of their own.

Usually they run them in conjunction with some other company, like Fathom. Other times they'll actually pull in a print from the studio, 35mm or digital depending on how the theater is set up anymore.

But no, that's the other half of the whole matter: those prints have to be returned to the studio at some point. Sometimes they'll go from first run to second run theaters, for however many of those are still around, but when a theater is done with the movie, it's boxed/canned back up and sent back to where it came from.&&When it becomes the only way to stream Marvel, Star Wars, and Pixar? You better believe people are gonna use it. I'm betting the pricing is going to be absolutely heinous too.&&I would much rather pay $10 to watch the movie in my house than go to the movie theatre for the same price. 

&&More or less. My point is that it's less that studio behaviour is forcing ticket prices to rise when the studios are likely setting the prices of the tickets more or less directly in the first place. And then screwing everyone from every other side.&&Star Wars is an interesting example. I doubt the hype will be as extreme as TLJ, so I bet Disney won’t have such demanding conditions to play it, esp with more competition around Christmas. 

But if you look at something like Avengers 4, there’s no goddamn way in hell a small theater is gonna miss out on the #1 movie possibly of all time to play whatever else is being released at the time. &&And it was the same before Disney even owned Star Wars. Lucas films or whoever was responsible at the time of the prequels had the same requirements. That is why my small city of 12000 residents didn't get to watch them on the big screen. This is common for any large budget film, not just from Disney studios.&&Yep this same story was all over reddit before.

I found out it was coming out because *people were arguing about Lando being pansexual*, so go figure.&&It's not bad.  It *does* get a bit predictable in some ways (basically the screenplay could be summarized as a checklist of 'things we know about Han Solo, and how they came to be'.  Seriously.  His blaster, his name, his ship, Chewie, Lando, shooting first, you name it, they make a point of how it started).

All that said - Woody, notwithstanding Rampart - was actually pretty great in it, and it was a fun ride.  Not missing much by missing it, but check it out once it's on streaming or whatever.&&Which is too bad, I went in expecting a bad movie and actually got a really solid one with what might be my favorite Star Wars scene ever.&&Thats the Hollywood I was talking about.

Palace doesn't do regulay scheduled movie showings. They don't even do Brew and View anymore. Still gets rented for an indie every so often, and they do the Horrorfest every year still and Rocky Horror night the week of Halloween. I saw a screening of Mohawk a few months back. https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mohawk_2018/

The Capital out in Rome has put 4 small screens in next door to the actual theater and has a full schedule of indie, art, and classic movies playing now. And they do midnight showings of indie/art movies with pizza included. But of a hike but not bad.

The new ampitheater on the lake is doing double features for free every Monday during the summer which is nice. And the Fulton drive-in got wrecked in a storm few summers ago but they rebuilt it.&&That's the one. The Hollywood. I just lump it all in as Syracuse unless talking to someone local. They only upgraded the seats in the last year or two but they do good business. Consessions are even reasonable.

The Paris theater (The adult one on Erie Blvd) is still around as well.&&In the winter many weeks they don't open Monday-Thursday unless it's a holiday week. This past winter they period they were closed was shorter than it had been, but it's been thing with them for awhile.&&Nah bro, Cuse is hot and muggy AF in the summer&&They're open on the weekends in the summer. Must not have been clear. In the winter they close Mon-Thursday unless it's a holiday week when kids are off school. From late spring to early fall they are open 7 days a week.

We have modern theaters, including one with alcohol and full meals delivered to your seat. And at the main mall we have Imax and RPX screens, but this one is owned by a guy who owns some small cineplexes in smaller towns around the state but he keeps this one open for 2nd run movies.&&When you're an old fart the annoying energy of people talking and shining their phones far outweighs the positive energy. &&I mean, don't they have that right?

The Egyptian and Chinese are historical cinemas, and the Cinerama's are both historical and specialized in being able to show Cinera films in the original 3-strip format. 

For example The New Beverly is one-screen, but it is pretty specialized to showing older and more obscure films than say, the only cinema in a town of 1000 with the next biggest city being more than 50 miles away, eg a location that can't financially sustain a larger cinema, you can't really compare such cinemas.

Also, the Egyptian really needs better seating, my back was killing me last time I saw a movie there.&&[My old local is a furniture store.](https://imgur.com/a/PUJR7XN) Been like this for almost 20 years.

I like the idea of something that's clearly not in the contract but still technically is, like using an office projector on the wall out back, technically now the biggest screen, for your ghost screen. That way if Disney checks you aren't just lying, you're trolling them and might maybe (probably not) not get sued.&&None of my friends wanted to see it because they felt Solo was just unnecessary. We don't need origin stories for characters who've been beloved for 30+ years. It makes no sense and just feels like a cash grab.&&I was in awe when I got my first TiVo back in the early 00s. You mean to tell me I don’t have to fiddle with the VCR and make sure I have enough blank tapes to tape anything I’d like to see again? You mean I can record two shows at the same time and watch them whenever I wanted without quality decay like a tape?

Looking back on my time with my former VHS collection, I do not miss VHS tapes at all. More specifically the VCRs. In the years I owned DVD players and Blu-Ray players, none off them developed a taste for discs. Also DVDs don’t need to be rewound if the tape pops out. 


Convenience plays a heavy part in all this, however as I see it, we’re in slow transition. Depending on how things go, it can either transition to a front where only the niche market exists for physical releases of movies and media while digital is standard.  Or, alternatively, it gets to the point where digital is only good for certain markets because of limitations. 

As I’m aware the desire for convenience will continue to influence this, I’m retaining my purveyor of physical media. I can’t jump on board for all digital and streaming just yet. 

&&Yeah that's a stupid sentence. At the time it was the best option I presume. People must have found it convenient enough or they wouldn't have done it.&&> Was it that often that people actually looked for a particular movie though?

I'd say it was a split. There were definitely cases where I went for a specific movie (generally a new release, which is of course the most likely thing to be out of stock). But outside of those you're right, probably more just looking to see what was there. But still, you're at the mercy of their stock.

> Returning didn't seem like *that* huge of a hassle though

Yeah, I mean nothing in the process was like completely unbearable or anything, it's just that in comparison to where we are now it's night and day.&&> n 20-30 years theaters will be a niche and most people will be getting movies through digital pay per views.

I remember people saying that when VHS came out. When PPVs came out. Etc.

Every kid I know born in the mid 2000s love the theater. It's been around since the 20s with little updating relatively speaking and yet no ""theater killing tech"" has ever killed it.

It's a special, unique place. It may make less money but it's definitely not falling out of the mainstream. &&> Today, theaters occupy a niche and most people get movies through digital pay per views.

People get to know them by their products, not by their practices. They fall in love with what they produce, not what they're doing behind the scenes.

Then it comes time to face up to the fact that they're supporting a predatory piece of shit and it's fucking *hard* because that predatory piece of shit produces content that has been your emotional bulwark for decades. Sometimes it's content that has shaped your whole fucking path in life, it's gotten into your head and made you a different person. And you're supposed to just throw it in the garbage.

What's been happening with celebrities and the metoo movement is a perfect example of this at work.

Like imagine that your whole identity in life was shaped by Bill Cosby and then you find out he's a serial rapist. And there's that part of you that's going, ""What kind of fucking person am I?"" Or you choose the denial path, which some people do in those situations, trying to defend the guy because ultimately, they're defending their own identity at that point. Because if he's a piece of shit, they have to ask if they are too.

We've got generations of people now who have been hooked in by this type of shit. And there's no easy way out of it once you're in that place. You have to deny, ignore, or painfully face up to the fact that you have to either reject some segment of your life and identity and put it behind you, or (if you're lucky) find some way to re-assimilate it that doesn't make you a callous asshole who is helping to enable shitty behavior.&&People like their products better than any others. Until the new Star Wars movies they were untouchable on average quality. FOX was ass at making Marvel movies, WB is seen as ass at making DC comics movies, etc etc. Iger made them the best option.

As you say, one can like the product while being aware of the fact that these companies (all of them, not just Disney, they are just the biggest right now when it comes to films) will do whatever it takes to maximize their profit.

The rumor I heard is a Rainbow Cinema coming to town.&&you'll have to bring a projector and a generator...&&The town adjacent to my city is the most populous town in the US with 200,000+ people. 1500 is tiny.&&Usually, a town has to have over 20K people to be considered large. A population of 1000 is considered the lower limit to be defined as such, so at 1500 your town would be rather small. &&My highschool was 3500...&&It is on the west coast, though.&&I feel like they could have a good side business if they rented out the mattresses and showed some NSFW videos.&&Sweet, that means of the furniture store goes out of business they have a well preserved theater to restore.&&Remember those anti-piracy ads with the dusty cinemas? The movie companies are causing it themselves.&&Can’t find the link, but I remember that in the 20’s and the 30’s studios like MGM would own theatres, and only play their movies, so the law changed to prevent that again. &&It was an [anti trust case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.) that ended the old studio system under which the studios were vertically integrated and owned the theaters. However this was also the era when Bell was broken up, and has since reformed into ATT with no signs of any serious trust breaking. There's no evidence that in our current political climate there would be any trust busting.&&Sherman Anti-Trust Act, US Code&&It's because they want consolodation of theatres under their influence. It's much easier to manage your relationship with a single corporation than with 500 independent theatres.

Boards are insensitive and often ruthless, but rarely stupid.&&Haha im sure there was no chance of getting away with it if anybody did decide to check it out but this was in outback australia, im sure nobody would bother looking, atleast I had never heard of any sort of inspections for our cinemas, that was 15+ years ago too so things have probably changed since then.&&I think the main change you're seeing is that theaters are instead becoming about more than just seeing the movie, they want to provide an experience.  The rise of Alamo theaters and other places in a similar vein I think reflects that.&&People will probably still go but it will be treated as a special event. Something you do every few months if that. Heck, for a lot of people it's already like that.&&Nothing has put the last nail in the coffin yet, but theater attendance is massively down from its heyday.  Many years ago literally everyone went to the movies at least once a week.  30 years ago it was the teenage hangout on Friday night.  When I was a kid in the 80's you had to get there early to make sure your movie wasn't sold out.  I haven't seen a movie sell out in years, and all the theaters I've been to in the last 5 years have removed half their seats for bigger reclining seats.  So many fewer people at the theaters nowadays.&&Streaming tech and the internet are changing the game. Along with bigger and badder HDTVs and plus home theater options. Yeah its future is pretty much cast in doubt. We kept hearing Blockbuster could withstand Netflix back then too. Look at it now.&&As long as studios only release new movies to theatres they will stay relevent. That could change with netflix and other subscription services directly releasing content to consumers but so far a lot of netflix movies have been bad&&I recommend watching some french dramas. I loved Le Havre and ~~the~~ Intouchables. I also really recommend you take a look at Korean cinema. They're really good at making dark drama movies with amazing imagery.&&Watch ""A man called Ove"" before the remake with Tom Hanks comes. &&Disney is buying Fox. They are 40% of the industry as a whole.&&We can call out one particular company at a time. Nothing wrong with that&&You don't see people talking about how Comcast decisions make sense lol&&With their big ears and long whiskers it's quite easy to spot the Disney people &&I guarantee a stunt like that would go viral on social media. Disney is sure to get wind of it then.&&Which they do!&&If we're assuming they're not, why bother showing it on the small tv screen at all? &&They don’t have to do that. Each movie is tie to a unique physical machine, for a limited period of time.

The format for cinema movie is called DCP. The keys are KDM. 

Om mobile so I cant expand much, but basically, each events in the theater is logged very precisely. ( the ads too, the people paying for the ads want to be sure that the ads are showed when and where they payed the ads to be show. )&&I wished that Marvel never sold the film rights for the X-Men.&&The 22nd amendment [didn't apply to Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Affected_individuals). &&You need a VPN.&&And this is a major cause of piracy. It's simple logic. If you not only offer a price tag but an inferior experience, you'd have to be an idiot to not expect people pirating your content. You're not only competing with your own product but for free, but now you're also offering a worse way to get it. People have always been willing to pay for a good experience. It's why things like Netflix/HBO Now are successful. Because even with piracy they offer a legitimate service that is equal to and in a lot of cases even better then what you can get for free.&&*Avengers 4* is the one we don’t have yet&&What about Dec? &&They thought that the overlap between football fans and Marvel fans was too high in the UK, so delayed it so they could get more money. Of course, anyone who was actually interested in the film is pissed, since it's *really* simple to plan around other events and since it means an extra month of trying to avoid spoilers.&&As much as some people hate to admit it, TLJ was a significant part of the reason it did so poorly; Both because of how close they were released, and because oh how many people disliked or outright hated the movie.&&I for one believe that the solution is to add more comedy and attempt to appeal to kids. Maybe add a funny character, I don't know, maybe someone like Jar Jar Binks? And don't forget some political scenes, everyone comes to Star Wars for the politicians. Now ask yourself, why did The Last Jedi become so divisive? It's because A) not enough focus on the politics behind the First Order, & B) Finn & Rose lacked a goofy animal-human hybrid companion.

*Obviously sarcastic. Although legitimately, I do believe Darth Jar Jar could save the current trilogy. No one would see it coming.*&&Keep in mind they released it between Infinity War and Deadpool though. That couldn’t have helped. &&Honestly I liked it a lot but I am a Star Wars nerd and often like big dumb fun action movies anyway. The heist was great and the casting was superb and I liked it a lot but I can understand how and why not everyone would though.&&yeah, how to refund if you paid with sucks???&&[deleted]&&I’m with you. Going to the movies is an investment of time, and for it to be cancelled at the last minute, I’d be pissed. &&And therefore you’d never go to the cinema again because there would have been literally no other option. &&Last time I was there the moose still had balls&&Nah they're gonna go be completely self-sustaining and act out the latest movies.&&That's a moderately sized city. I think towns top out around 100k at most. &&How does America determine what is a city and what is a town? In the UK it is simply determined by the presence of a cathedral. &&It was a supreme court ruling, and they determined that it was a violation of anti-trust. Check out the case of United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc..&&that makes sense, they have the money and power to control the whole chain so it did strike me as surprising they hadnt made this move yet. &&> There's no evidence that in our current political climate there would be any trust busting.

euphemism for corruption. the current government is more corrupt&&I heard a radio interview about this recently. The theatre owner said projectors are hooked to the internet so Disney serves the decryption key and knows when the film is playing and where.&&I agree with you. I briefly lived in Norman, Oklahoma and just down the road in Moore was the Warren Theater. It is still the best movie theater I've ever been to and I went there at least 2 or 3 times a month. It's actually one of 3 or 4 in a chain that builds these extravagant buildings in smaller towns. They pay less in taxes and the locals have a lot less to do in their spare time so it works out really well. They usually have a great diner and they let you bring the food inside so you can drink your milkshake and watch your movie. Its all beautifully designed in Art Deco style, and there is usually an upstairs for 21 + where you can have cocktails from the bar and enjoy your movie without any children running around. 
Every weekend that place was packed.&&For me and my brother, it’s only for big Marvel movies, Star Wars, and Pixar. (Just realized that all three were owned by Disney, oh well).  &&I used to be that way, only go out for what are now the Disney owned movies. 

But my theater upgraded their seating, and has cheep tickets on mornings, so I've made something of a ritual out of seeing movies on Saturday mornings (chairs are super comfy, it's AC'd, and Salty popcorn is what my hungover body wants.)

Not saying that you're wrong, or that I'm indicative of everyone, but if theaters who can, put in the effort to make the experience slightly more desirable than waiting to see something at home, I don't think that it will go the way you say.

Also if more places kept the arcade games going, I used to go like 30 minutes early just to play some light gun games.&&MoviePass subscription model will be how theaters keep thriving, we'll see if MoviePass is around long enough to be part of it.&&>  I haven't seen a movie sell out in years,

Nor have I, but (at least in my area) I think a part of that is due to studios releasing the ""midnight"" showings at 7 PM the evening before, relieving that massive burst of congestion that inevitably caused the sold out shows. The super fans get at least two chances to see the movie in that time frame, allowing more room for those wiling to wait for Friday.

Granted, studio rules like Disney's mean that the popular film that weekend will be shown on nearly every screen of a multiplex (the big ones all have 25 screens in my area) which means they're able to keep a revolving door of show's ending and beginning so seats are more available.&&I had to try several times to see Jurassic World a second time. It sold out many times over the first week at the theater near me.&&Have you seen The Third Murder? I saw it on a flight to Japan a couple weeks ago and I liked it.&&Just *Intouchables*&&Agreed&&If the only way to access the content in your country is to use a VPN to pretend to be a citizen of another country... He needs a VPN for a very different reason. Time to sail those seas.&&What he needs is to become a pirate.

Yar har matey! Welcome to the Canadian Pirate society eh&&He's on the ball&&He's getting shot in the face with a paintball gun&&Waiting for him outside of rehab and hoping he won't go to jail.&&He got snapped. Perfectly balanced. &&They also only just released Incredibles 2 now, which was also delayed because of the World Cup. They're not going to release two Disney movies at the same time to compete off each other so Ant-Man and the Wasp had to get delayed even further. &&And anyone who was interested and doesn't care about the bloody football is double pissed, as they can't even go see Antman to get to avoid the football for a couple of hours.&&I always told the Star Wars nerds at work how much I loved jar jar so they would stop talking to me about Star Wars. Secretly, I’m a Star Wars nerd too, but they’d rant about things and rave about things and get all their story points incorrect. I think maybe I actually started to like Jar Jar because of my dumb tactic. &&At its barest bones that's all star wars is- a hero movie with a heart- classic good vs evil space opera. I think solo struck the balance well of using the existing universe while not being too derivative, and leaving it richer than it found it.&&:(((&&Maybe they give you a blow?&&My small town had a theater that was built on a swamp and the first few rows sometimes had swamp water in them and frogs and other wildlife.  Mosquitos too.  &&That funny soda was probably because the lines that run the syrup, the ice maker, and the entire interior of the soda machine were covered in mold btw&&Sounds like the $2 theater. We have a theater that only shows movies that are inbetween the public release and theater release dates. Used to be a $1 theater, too many people started coming. Had to cut it down to those deserving.&&I only know about this town from the movie Slap Shot. &&Poor moose&&In some states there are different legal definitions of ""town,"" ""city"" and even things like ""village"" or ""township""&&In my state for a town to become a city they have to have a population of at least 3500 and the town council has to draft and pass a city charter by majority vote.

Cities in my state have a bit more power than towns, but the 200,000 population town wants to remain a town for the novelty. However that might be changing soon as my city is now entirely boxed in and cannot freely expand in any direction, but because it is a city they have the power to incorporate parts of the adjacent town into the city. So the town might vote to finally become a city to prevent that.&&This is discussed on Crash Course Film History on You Tube. The whole series is great, good one to check out.&&Thanks!&&I'd say that about sums it up.&&Wow. That's terrifying. Also someone that can spoof those keys could make a lot of money. Just saying lol&&Yeah I had a weird realization that with maybe one or two exceptions in the last 5 years I've only gone to the theater to see Star Wars, Marvel, and Disney / Pixar movies&&MFW you realize thats 6 movies since December&&I hate popcorn.

Do the main characters, like...*defeat* the sharknado somehow in every movie?  Or do they just kinda survive?&&I worked on 3 of the 6 Sharknado movies, twice as a costume designer.  They are seriously brutal to film.  The schedules are insane, the script changes are unreal, and the parade of actors is mind boggling.  That being said...the crew is one of the hardest working I've ever come across and while it's good to let this franchise die, I will miss working with a lot of these people on a semi regular basis.&&The movies in this franchise are the movie equivalent of a shitpost that hits the top of the front page lol&&* Sharknado
* Time travel
* Dinosaurs
* Medieval setting
* Western setting
* Chainsaw

This movie might have everything&&Like as in Time Travel? lol&&Rotten Potato: 100% even before the premier&&Christ I thought that was Michael fassbender on the front there for a second.&&I swear.. these movies look like they belong in the trailer roll at the start of Tropic Thunder.&&""History's biggest disaster comes to an end"" 😂😂&&It's time for the Sharknado...to end&&Books always better than the movie.&&For a split second I thought the T-Rex had a brontosaurus head for a tail, and I thought “well now THAT’S just ridiculous.” 

Then I saw it was a different dinosaur, and I was like “oh, whew.”&&""Histories biggest disaster finally comes to an end""

The self awareness is strong here.&&You know what I find to be the least probable thing in these movies? Why doesn’t the tornado pull up other sea life?  Like sea urchins, blowfish, maybe even a hunk of coral or something. &&I've never seen any of the previous Sharknado films. I might watch this one with no context, a fifth of bourbon, and maybe some coke. Fuck it.&&You know what I always wanted to happen with this franchise? It was so successful and made such an insane amount of money, that I was hoping one day they'd buckle down and just pour money into making a really well made, special effects driven film that holds itself up to modern Blockbuster standards, but keeps the same stupid dialogue and premise.

But looks like this one won't be that, looks incredibly stupid anyway in the best way.&&Why are they ending the series so soon? I need 30 movies in Sharknado Cinematic Universe.&&T-Rexnado would be more impressive &&Damn they really know how to market a terrible/awesome film brilliantly. I can't wait.&&Sign me the fuck up baby &&Does anyone know the cost to revenue ratio for these movies? They clearly have to be making some money &&[deleted]&&I'm unironically going to watch this movie since I watched the others religiously &&Jesus what a cliff for Tara Reid's career to fall from&&Jumping the shark:electric boogaloo&&It's basically like the Iron Sky franchise, only these guys actually get to release their films.&&Maybe I’m just an asshole but...This franchise stopped being funny when it started seeming more self aware &&I have to admit, Sharknado knows what its audience wants.&&That these movies continue to be made astounds me but also makes me smile. &&Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 is gonna be in this one! Definitely watching it for her hahaha&&Beyond ready for this&&So many fucks to what. &&It's not the last one. We all know it's not the last one. It's as much the last one as the past 4 Saw movies.&&good thing you get rid of The Expanse SyFy, so you can make other gems like this one /s &&I can't wait for ""The Last Sharknado 2""&&Let's be honest. in 2 years there gonna be a reboot. Sharknado: The Next Generation. Its gonna take place on the Enterprise, it's gonna star Patrick Stewart. And yes, its gonna have Sharks that shoot friggin laser beams.&&Next time you're afraid to share ideas remember someone once said in a meeting ""Let's make a film with a tornado full of sharks""&& My 5 year old son is so excited about this, he loves Sharknado, never seen him laugh so much&&Man I need to binge watch all of these movies&&•Sharknado goes back in time to the time of dinosaurs
•Sharknado picks up Megalodon
•Sharknado returns to the present
•Cut to the intro of The Meg

Sharknado and The Meg have a shared universe.&&Our civilization has reached Peak Irony.  
  
We need to conserve this precious resource or we'll run out.
&&I hope they focus on the Lavalantula series now. &&Despite what people think about these movies they've been one thing my entire family looks forward to every year and we all bond over it.  Even my dad who is tough as nails to read.  And for that alone I'm happy that these movies exist.&&The Last Sharknado II: One Last Last Time&&I adore that the subtitle and the slogan on the right side could easily be referring to the franchise itself. God bless these movies and the people that make them&&Still looks better than Aquaman poster&&Who ever came up with that tag line deserves a raise.&&One of them has David Hasslehoff traveling to space to fire an orbital laser into the eye of the giant sharkicane that had formed from all the little sharknados to save the world. So... &&The first one ends with them stopping the tornado with some sort of explosives, but the girl in the helicopter falls out and gets eaten by s great white. The tornado ends and the great white flies toward the hero who dives into its mouth with a chainsaw, then he cuts his way out with the girl in tact. &&Little bit of both lol&&Yes, there is a whole thing about bombing the sharknados and reversing the wind direction to stop them. These movies are awesome&&Yes&&It's so shitty that I love it. How over the top it is, how cliché it is, how shitty the CGI is, how it's so predictable and much more. I watched every single part and I loved it. 


Can't wait!! &&I have no idea but my 5 year old loves them. &&> I've been really entertained by the fact that these movies exist, but I've never actually seen one.

Don't forget about the spinoffs: Lavalantula and 2 Lava 2 Lantula!&&The hard work actually shows.  I love these movies so much. Each one my friends gather to watch the entire series. We are actually sad they are ending.

I did film studies in college and there are very popular movies I hate because of technical details. But these.... I love everything on the screen.  Thank you for the hard work of costume design and all the other vital tasks you've done!&&And apparently they [dont lose any money](https://www.gq.com/story/sharknado-atlantic-rim-pacific-rim-asylum-movie-spoof)&&There are 6 movies????

I thought there was just one. &&I did about 10 features for Asylum. We probably did a few together. You’re right, the hardest working crew I’ve been a part of.&&Thank you for your service. You have helped contribute to the long and storied art form known as cinema. You are a hero, and a national treasure.

God Bless!&&Username would check out if there would be a slash between 3 and 6. &&SyFy has been doing amazing shit posts for years, sharknado was just the first to hit the top of /r/all

Dinocroc #neverforget&&So normal r/movies posts?&&I'd love to be a fly on the wall when the plot of these movies are pitched to the production companies. Like, money is invested in them, so it's serious business. There would be people in suits around a conference table discussing the details of sharks raining down from the sky.&&Future anthropologists are going to be so goddamn confused by our civilization.&&Can't wait for the porn parody.&&I'm still getting over the fact the first one had sharks *and* a tornado&&Just needs MTVs Dan Cortese &&This just needs Stefon to narrate the trailer.

""New York's hottest club is... Sharknado""&&Was I supposed to read this in Stefons voice? &&How can a poster that includes all of this *still* manage to look boring?&&And it won't have the budget to actually do any of that convincingly.&&I'm predicting a chainsaw using dino teeth.

Can not wait!&&But aliens... where are the aliens?&&OMG I JUST GOT IT ""its about time"" not just meaning ""finally it's the last one"", but also that the movie is literally about time/time travel.&&It's a fucking great title. Because it could be (and looks like it is) about time travel, but also be about people's distaste in how many have been made. In other words: 

""It's about damn time they end this series!""

Can't wait to see it though.&&Back to the Sharknado&&I’d say of course time travel. Did you somehow miss that 1/3 of the poster is dinosaurs?&&[deleted]&&Did you actually look at the poster?&&Can someone give us all a quick synopsis of what's happened so far in the sharknado universe?&&Just his brother, Michael Assbender.&&How amazing would that be if Hollywood just went all in?! If Michael Fassbender, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence were in it, and Steven Spielberg directed it?!&&He sort of reminds me of that guy who was on 90210 in the 90's. And the girl looks like a Z list version of Tara Reid&&I thought it was Andrew Lincoln. &&I thought it was Bill Burr&&His career really took a toll after The Snowman and Assassin’s Creed /s&&[deleted]&&In a world frozen over on fire and then lava volcanos come in and happen with mountains and you have 2 kids and boooom Scorcher 7.


Reminds me of the 2 brothers spiel from inter dimensional cable.&&Came here to point this out. I love how self-aware it is.&&My coworker let me get away with using sharknado coloring sheets to go with our natural disasters lesson a few years ago. I still crack up every time I think about it.&&This Sharknado isn't going to go the way you think&&I feel threatened&&I really find their interpretations of biblical passages quite nuanced and introspective despite lacking the whimsical charm &&Oh yes because that would be the ridiculous thing about this movie. &&It's not too late, 

Make it happen Sci Fi&&Because it's a Sharknado, not a all-life-in-the-sea-nado. DUH!&&the sharks ate them obviously&&I swear to god an octopus hits a window once&&Frutti di Maredo.&&Because its called a SHARKnado. Duh&&The movies explain why....just watch them&&Count me in I'll bring the pizza.&&You’ll have no idea what’s going on if you don’t watch the one before this first. Hell even the one before *that* one since the last two end on cliffhangers iirc&&Little c, or big C?&&Is Pepsi OK?&&Well look no further...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsLk0NPRFAc&&I always wanted to be a billionaire just to do this. Bankroll some quality films that are having a hard time getting funded, but also completely ridiculous shit just for the lulz. Quality though, like Sharknado by way of Austin Powers.&&The Lavalantula series is set in the same universe. &&Yes I expect at least 10 movies about the shark god &&Would not be even a LITTLE surprised if that happens in this one.&&I would see it&&Is that really a spoiler though?&&Definitely gonna be the next series I marathon (again) after mission impossible &&Is it though? We're talking about a Sharknado movie here!&&Nah bro you can't jump a shark if it's already flying&&So.... since the beginning?&&It was always self aware.  They started making these when they realized there was a market for ‘so bad it’s good’ films.  They were always basically low effort exploitation films. &&It was always self aware&&The first was completely dumb, but fun.They set out to make another terrible idea disaster movie and it really all came together. 

The second was immediately self aware, loaded with cameos...and it dropped very quickly from there. &&[deleted]&&I'm with you but unfortunately the shit that gets made is the shit that panders to the lowest common denominator, and that target demographic probably doesn't see the difference between ""so bad it's good"" and ""trying so hard to be 'so bad it's good' that it's just bad""&&A good B-movie is one where the people making it think they are actually making a good movie.

Most recent example, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom. (as I'm about 90% sure they didn't set out to make a so stupid it's hilarious movie)&&Never seen one.  Big if true.&&And the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay...&&Oh jesus.

Apparently I need to watch more than just the first one.  That sounds like pure, unfiltered entertainment.&&Which one? I'm fucking hysterical right now. I need to see this.&&God I wish we could send this comic back 15 years.  People would have thought you were batshit crazy.&&Tell me more about this Sharkicane &&Yeah, science bitch!&&4/20 would watch the fuck outta this&&The cast of the Today Show and Good Morning America have also slowly been devoured over the course of the series.&&Ta-da!&&...&&[Scene if anyone want to see it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb60e-VNAto)&&Sounds like an Indian movie with some crazy action with no physics laws.&&Well, it's not about wind direction, it's about balancing temperature differentials. First one involves firebombs, second one involves some sort of Freon contraption on top of the empire state building. That's about all I remember.&&Thank you!  They were a lot of fun and like I said... so many good people.&&Well you don't usually make a series that loses money.  Almost every movie can be sold at a profit if you can make it cheap enough.&&Thanks for the read!&&I thought there was 3. &&Who would name it “The last“ if it was just one movie.&&Who are you?? I'm sure our paths have crossed!&&I'm a big fan of the ridiculous vs movies like Dino=croc VS Mega Shark&&Shartopus 1 

Sharktopus vs Pteracuda

Sharktopus vs Whalewolf 

Sharktopus vs Mermantula 

Including the spin-off: Piranhaconda&&“ATLANTIC RIM”&&Dinocroc vs Supergator is a great B movie. It is really fun to watch and it has David Carradine who died of autoerotic asphyxiation.&&Cocknado&&I'm thinking the porn parody will somehow be in the movie itself. Like the porn parody of the movie we're currently watching will be on one of the character's television in the background. That would be truly epic. This movie already deserves an Oscar. &&Which could also star Tara Reid&&Squirtnado&&I know, a fucking sharknado.  How many words have you tried to combine in your life? Hundreds I bet, none anywhere near as cool as Sharknado.&&I wanted the sequel to Sharknado to be Sharcano. With lava sharks erupting out of a volcano.&&> I'm still getting over the fact the first one had sharks ~~and~~ IN a tornado

&&And Roman J. Israel Esquire&&Yes yes yes yes yes. New York’s hottest club is *... Kevin?* And this club has everything. &&He's a male bimbo....he's a mimbo!

""Step off George!""&&It has everything

* Waitresses dressed up like Richard Dreyfus
* Hammerhead bouncers
* Helen Hunt as a resident DJ
* A Shark fin soup Tournament

&&Probably because it's still stock characters in stock poses. Doing the equivalent of ""holds up spork"" can only carry for so long.&&I'm not saying it looks good, but it doesn't look much worse than that Aquaman poster that came out a few weeks ago.&&Speak for yourself this looks awesome.&&they forgot to put laser blasters on the T-rex&&Has any movie ever had that kind of budget?&&Or the other way.

Of course it’s time travel his son that time travelled picked him up and said they needed to go into the past in the last one&&2 Shark 2 Nado&&And the other 2/3s are a medieval castle and Old Western buildings&&Honestly, there is so much going on the last two movies I didn't know what to expect anymore. &&I never thought I’d use this sentence, but you just made me want to watch the sharknado series. &&I haven’t seen the fifth one yet but my dad and I make a point to watch all of them. Basically, Ian zering keeps finding himself in the middle of these disasters. He’s seen as a national hero and it implied that he can tell when a sharknado is about to come because he’s aware of the signs. A company ends up figuring a way out to prevent and end sharknados but (surprise) it ends up making things worse. Ian Zerings dad ended up on the moon at the end of the third one. His wife is a cyborg. There’s been lots of cutting people out of sharks after they’ve already been eaten. There was even a baby born inside of a shark. Four resulted in widespread damage because they evolved from sharknados to lava Nados, lightning nados, Boulder nados, and even nuclear nados. The lattter resulted in niagra falls being reversed. It’s also implied that the sudden increase of sharknados is part of a something bigger. There’s clearly something causing these disasters. This might have been answered in 5. 


These are the best movies to hate watch &&SHARKNADO SPOILERS WITHIN.

A sharknado happens. Fin, the protagonist, Nova, his pet waitress who wants to bang him, and an alcoholic and an Australian go to rescue his kids and wife. The alcoholic dies but he saves a dog. They find April, his wife, and his shitty daughter. The wife's new toiboi dies. They go find their son. At some point the Australian dies. Some bad stock footage menaces them. Nova explains her hatred of sharks. They make homemade bombs and throw them into the tornado. They explode. Nova is thrown out of a helicopter and is eaten by a shark. Fin jumps inside the shark, cuts through it with a chainsaw and saves her. Nova now wants to bang Fin's son. 


**Sharknado 2 - The Second One!:**

Fin and April are married again and also celebrities. They are on a plane. It is sharnadoed. April's hand gets bitten off. Fin warns everyone that they are about to get another big sharknado. A black lady is in love with Fin this time, but he is true to his wife, April, who is played by Tara Reid who is definitely probably an alien who steals people's souls. Everyone fights their way through the city. Fin patches old wounds with his once-best friend who is fucking his little sister. Because they got married. They detonate a thing of Freon on top of the empire state building. The black lady dies. Fin rides a shark using a chainsaw, and impales it on a building, pulling April's severed had from his mouth (she now has a buzzsaw hand). He uses the handgun she had on the plane to kill some sharks. Then takes the wedding ring and re-proposes to her. Also Andy Dick is in it. So is Billy Ray Cyrus. And Kurt Angle, and Judd Hirsch

**Sharknado 3 - Oh Hell No!!:**

Finn is in the white house, because he is very famous now. The vice president is Anne Coulter. The white house chief of staff is Bill Engvall. He and the president fight off a sharknado. Their family is in Florida including a very pregnant April, and Finn goes there to save them! Except he's driving for some reason. He runs into Nova. She kinda turned into a spooky ""don't drink the coolaid"" shark killer. Her partner is Frankie Muniz. He dies. Fin realizes that a lot of storms will converge and destroy the east coast. The media calls it the ""Feast Coast"". His dad is David Hasselhoff. He decides to sacrifice himself in a space shuttle to save the day by blowing up the sharknado. Fin and April are along, and get back to the ground inside of giant sharks. While riding inside the sharktovater, April gave birth. She apparently was crushed by the space shuttle debris. There are a lot more celebrities in this.

**Sharknado: The 4th Awakens**

Fin now lives on a farm in Kansas. It's been 5 years since all that other shit happened, and Kansas is not attached to the ocean. He named the farm April Acres in honor of his dead alien lizard pet of a wife, Tara Reid. Fin's father is alive, and is working for Sharknado world Elon Musk. He works with April's father, who is inexplicably Gary Busey. He has rebuilt April as a cyborg and keeps her locked in his lab. A sharknado destroys the hoover dam, then picks up rocks and becomes a bouldernado. Fin buys the car from Stephen King's book Christine. The bouldernado, which now has cows and is now a shark-cow-rocknado kills some people. Fin abides. His house is picked up and flies all the way to Chicago and kills the Chicago mayor. Fake Elon Musk wants to destroy the sharknados. He starts to deploy technology. But the Sharknado was tricky and decided to power up by absorbing a nuclear plant and irradiating it's sharks. Clever girl. Fin gets knocked out at Niagra falls as he moves to stop the Sharknado and is swallowed by 5 matryoshka-dolling sharks. He survives, but only because Cyborg April uses her power and two dead sharks as a defibrillator to save him. As they are about to rejoice the Eiffel tower falls out of the sky with Nova in it, as a way to let everyone know their suffering would continue in the sequel:

**Sharknado 5: Global Swarming**

The sharknados are a global menace. Fin wants to stop them. He also has a 10 year old kid. Nova contacts him. There was a secret cave under stonehenge that had a relic in it. They remove it. They go to London, and suddenly there is a sharknado. Big ben explodes. The queen is made out of a blowup doll and it's weird. April and Fin's son gets taken by the sharknado. There is an evil cult chasing them for the relic that is not Nova's weird lesbian sisterhood shark cult. The sharks can now teleport. Fin and April can't seem to find their son. The pope, who is Fabio, gives Fin a holy chainsaw that shoots lazers while he is in Italy. At some point, in Australia after teleporting around using the sharknado, the lesbian shark cult transform the Syndey opera house into a weapon with the help of Tony Hawk. They make one last attempt to end it all and save their son once and for all. April explodes to save Fin. This sends him to the future, where he finds his son who is now Dolph Lundgren. They share an extremely uncomfortable hug and ride off into a post apocalyptic desert with SonDolph saying he can help Fin defeat the sharknados forever.

The fact that I have watched all of these enough to type this out makes me hate myself a little.&&Last I saw the sharks had ripped up manhattan, which continued until everyone in new york unleashed their own inner shark (all new yorkers have inner sharks) and started fighting back. And something about a big frozen bomb or something? I dunno, you usually have to bomb sharknados to make them stop.

I actually saw that at a public screening in a park put on by Syfy in New York. That was something. &&sharks inside tornadoes and chainsaw man kills them&&Toranado full of sharks fucked shit up. End.

Just Nova travelling the world, surfing sharknado after sharknado. &&Not if you have a jetpack&&Yeah it's pretty much why I've never really liked the franchise. Unlike something like The Room which was clearly trying to be good, these movies are trying to force being ""so bad it's good"" which doesn't have the same effect as if it came across in a natural, honest way. I've got nothing against people who still find enjoyment from these films but it's not what I'd call so bad it's good. &&Yeah, i wouldnt exactly call Sharknado the 'Scary Movie' series of the genre, but...

https://i.imgur.com/jfrMFrs.png&&Purposefully poorly made movies are the second worse thing after a bad comedy.&&>""trying so hard to be 'so bad it's good' that it's just bad""

Thank you, this is the perfect description for this kind of movie.  &&The Room is the quintessential example of this. Tommy Wiseau genuinely believed that he was making a masterpiece, which makes it the Citizen Kane of bad movies.&&With the exception that JWFK is not supposed to be a B movie, but a blockbuster (with the budget behind it). I'm not sure what their goal with those movies is other than ""get bucks from nostalgic idiots"".&&Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is not a B-movie. 

It has a blocker buster budget and one of the most liked actors in Hollywood as the lead. It as a mix of special and practical effects, a cohesive (though arguably unsatisfying) story, and clearly has a real audience. 

A B-movie would be the dinosaur shit you see on Discovery Channel or SyFy. &&He is completely serious. These sorts of bad syfy movies are my biggest guilty pleasure and I have an embarrassingly encyclopedic knowledge of them -- the sharknado series is about as ridiculous as it comes, though Sharktopus vs Pteracuda & Triassic Attack come pretty close in my mind.

 &&Fishy if affirmative&&He forgot that he had to fight off a shark in the space station with a laser chainsaw&&Well it hardly gets more original than this&&Can you really go wrong with a series of shark movies where the protagonists name is Fin? &&They surprisingly get better and worse at the same time. &&In my opinion, the first one was kind of boring.  The actors were trying to do like serious acting and shit... in a movie called Sharknado for god's sake.  However, in the rest of them, they stopped that shit.  The actors are no longer taking themselves or the material so seriously and there are a ridiculous amount of cameos from like all of Hollywood and half of Youtube.  It's much more fun now.  Watch at least 2 and see if you like it.&&If you want a TV show made by the same people and with the same level of batshit ridiculousness then you should watch znation. &&That was in *Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!*.&&Well you know what a shark is, right?

And what a tornado is?

And i think by this far down in the thread you may have figured out what a sharknado is as well. 

Now a portmanteau is a word where by sylables are taken from two other words and combined, also taking on the combined definition of the two original words...  

A hurricane then is a rapidly rotating tropical storm system with strong winds, heavy rains, and further characterized by a calm low pressure center... &&Script is based on actual DARPA contingency plans in case of a Sharkicane.

It's pretty epic for cheap CG.

&&Compared to the rest of the movies, that ending is extremely realistic&&It's also about tornados in unlikely places with starving sharks that growl.

Dont think too hard.&&I thought she was born with it.&&How about sharktopus Vs WhaleWholf&&My favourite title would have to be Airplane vs Volcano&&Shout-out to Mega Python vs Gatoroid, mostly due to [this scene] (https://youtu.be/-zEXV5oiWgc) unabashedly pandering to those of us of a certain age.&&My personal favorite is lavalantua

Tarantulas that spit lava&&Reading that makes me think you had a siezure&&>Shartopus

This is a very different type of movie.&&*Sharktopus vs Mermantula* was never released, it was recut and released as *Sharktopus vs Whalewolf*. Starring Casper Van Dien. &&I remember watching Sharktopus on Syfy... I still maintain it was the forefather of the ""purposefully shitty so it's funny"" Syfy movement that birthed Sharknado. It's just a shame that Sharknado overshadowed its ancestor's incredible ""B-Movie and I love it"" spirit that it championed.&&""BATTLESTAR GALACTICA""&&That's the asylum not Syfy&&Shark-Nut-Oh&&All I could think of is the guy swinging his dick around like a desk fan&&Starring Sasha Grey.&&The Last Whorenado: It’s Fucking Time. &&Run up to your significant other first thing in the morning; yelling Cocknado while helicoptering your pecker.

Edit: I hope Rick Moranis stars in this porn parody too.&&The movie itself is already a parody of campy horror movies, right? They may as well just have full on real sex scenes in the movie.

🤨🤔😐

> they evolved from sharknados to lava Nados, lightning nados, Boulder nados, and even nuclear nados.

Why did they start at lava then move to lightning, surely they would start at lightning as it's a storm. How are Boulders in a tornado!?  What the fuck is a nuclear Sharknado and how...just how. 

> he lattter resulted in niagra falls being reversed.

What the physical fuck like water flowing up the fucking cliff? Haha

I'm fucking dying over here.&&> There was even a baby born inside of a shark.

[MFW](http://i.imgur.com/zRKUVBS.gifv)&&I don't believe you. &&> It’s also implied that the sudden increase of sharknados is part of a something bigger. There’s clearly something causing these disasters. This might have been answered in 5.

lmao holy shit&&This is absolutely amazing.  You've typed explanations that are exactly long enough to be entertaining without exceeding my TLDR threshhold for Sharknado related information.  You, sir, are a really minor internet hero, but a hero nonetheless.&&I sort of believed you until the plot of the 4th sharknado at which point this HAS to be some kind of elaborate prank.&&lmao that was a hell of a ride&&>The sharks can now teleport.

(I know you couldn't actually help that.)&&2 headed shark attack

3 headed shark attack!

But wait, 5 headed shark attack!

Actually saw 2 headed shark attack, it's not even ""so bad it's funny"", it's bad beyond that in a territory of just really really sad.&&A large part of what's funny about bad movies is knowing some guy made the choice for that to appear genuinely believing it was a good idea. If someone is trying to make a bad movie, something wacky happens and you go ""Well, that's just because they wanted a bad movie"". Compare it to say Incredible Bulk where they paint the guys head purple and have him smash a toy helicopter. You're laughing thinking ""Did they really think this looked good??"" ""What's with all the CGI clip art?"" ""Are they *running in place*??""&&Agreed. Movies that are so bad their good are only great when they're trying to be a good movie but just fall super flat&&It also helps that Tommy Wiseau is genuinely one of the weirdest people in existence.&&These box office records aren't of a ""so bad it is good movie"", people genuinely like them... for whatever reason. &&Nah dude. The room may be the most recognizable example that most people know about. But the best example? Neil Breen stole that title from Tommy *years* ago. &&You've got to be fucking with us.
&&I don't know enough about these types of movie to know if those others that you mentioned actually exist or not.

Yes they fought them with lightsaber chainsways. No they were not anywhere near the moon. They were orbiting earth and Somehow the dad made it to the moon. I dont know how he stayed alive on the moon with a limited air supply, but knowing this series he’s probably still alive

Hes not in any of the really crazy ones though, like [Mongolian Death Worm (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504443/), starring Sean Patrick Flannery or [Mega Python vs. Gatoroid (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1680138/) starring [Tiffany vs. Debbie Gibson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaWEzSClo-M). 

I think also most actors on SyFy network shows around that time had it in their contracts that they had to do a few of these too, there were always folks from Stargate and stuff popping up in them. [Wyvern (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1331335/) with Don S Davis (Gen. Hammond) is a personal favorite of mine.

I wasn’t sure what the movie was about since I tuned in right in the middle of it, but I bought it on DVD so I could watch the whole thing. &&Yeah i think for any remotely funny movie thats rereleased, you better be prepared to basically have a Rocky Horror style viewing.&&if this comments section is any indication, you are 100% right&&I saw a Lebowski showing at a cool cinema in CT that does occasional showings of old movies. Honestly, the crowd was excellent---no noise except laughter the entire time.

Most modern movies aren't dialogue driven, so if you're not used to it there's a learning curve before you can really appreciate it.

Lebowski gets high marks among film buffs because dialogue is extremely difficult to write, but the Coen brothers really made it seem effortless. &&Ha ha!

&&That’s fucking interesting.  &&Someone peed on your rug Dude?&&Dios mio, man. &&I saw [Going Places](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5974030/) which is a follow up movie about the Jesus. It explains why Jesus was in jail (8 year olds, Dude) and it was pretty comical. Gotta say, there is a part of the movie that made a good number of people in the audience extremely uncomfortable and my friend said that he was about to walk out.

It wasn't near as good as Big Lebowski but was an interesting watch. Not sure how the general reaction will be when it is released. It is a *much* darker comedy than Big Lebowski. Susan Sarandon was probably the best part of that movie.&&Been a priest of the latter day dude for 3 and a half years now&&> you better be prepared to basically have a Rocky Horror style viewing

Do you mean that the audience will be reciting the lines? If so... that's a real buzz kill.&&Never thought about that aspect. Rocky Horror, IMO, is best seen in the theater with all the interaction. I haven't seen anything else with that type of interaction, so I don't know if I would like it or not for anything else. It would be cool if theaters had the option of interactive or non-interactive, but I realize that will never happen because it just wouldn't be feasible.&&Honestly asking: why would you go to one of these expecting anything less? The most fun aspect of going to these is getting to watch something you love with a ton of people just as excited. I usually walk away with a better understanding of what people actually enjoy about the movie or find funny. My wife room me to a double feature of nightmare in elm street and nightmare 2 few years ago ( a movie I never really cared for) and came away with the realization that people enjoy it because of the campy comedy. &&I went to the recent showing of Fight Club in LA with the Dust Brothers playing the live soundtrack(!) and it was basically like that.

They'll be my first&&I was probably exaggerating a bit much but yeah i kinda picture people reciting the lines, i suspect it would depend on a few unapologetic and bold fans being in the audience getting things going...so yeah just speculating, but i can picture it for this movie.

Not without retaliation lol&&I honestly wouldn't expect any less from this type of movie.&&I saw The Room when they showed it in select theatres this past January for one day only.  I'd never seen it and walked in late to a group of guys in the very front shouting at the screen.  This was in conservative Irvine CA and figured was in for a long movie - people next to me were muttering under their breath about it ('are they going to do this the whole time?') but being orange county nobody would actually do anything about it.  Turned out to be a really great time - the dudes up front had obviously seen it a million times and had something funny to say in every scene -- granted it's a movie that warrants it.  They even had plastic spoons people would throw - I think a spoon makes a cameo at least a dozen times throughout.  Would go again 10/10. &&basically what they do at lebowski fest&&Is that a bad thing? If I'm gonna pay to go watch a movie I've already seen a million times, I'd like if it were some kind of goofy, rowdy experience&&I've been to a few and the audience/undercover actors heckle lines into the show but i've never seen people just reciting rocky horror.

&&I'm a stick in the mud. I'd want anyone being too loud to get booted out.&&>Steve Palopoli wrote about the film's emerging cult status in July 2002. He first realized that the film had a cult following when he attended a midnight screening in 2000 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles and witnessed people quoting dialogue from the film to each other.

A bit too late with those fears.&&The Room has an entire audience participation culture around it. I actually feel bad for anyone who goes into a screening of it without knowing that&&What a story!&&This is the exact purpose of those screenings. In fact watching The Room with friends exclusively to mock it is about the only reason to even watch The Room. I totally get not extensively researching a movie before watching it but it baffles me how many people make it into these screenings with zero idea what they're going to see.

I wouldn't want to see a big screening of The Room as my first experience&&Conservative Irvine CA? No one in orange county speaking up? I've had a very different experience living in the OC it would seem lol &&Not to be a bummer, but for the room you are supposed to join in. At my theatre (which is in Saskatchewan, you are encouraged to throw spoons during the movie as it is part of the tradition.&&This however is normal for the room. A theatre near me does showings of the room and rocky horror all the time and they are so much fun. You learn new stuff to do every time. Biggest piece of advice for people seeing the room is you can never have enough spoons. &&Same. I saw a midnight showing if super troopers in Portland about 10 years ago. People recited the whole movie and it was fun. &&Went to a room showing without knowing hardly anything  about it and among the best few hours of my life. Soooo funny.

I absolutely loved that show.  It was canceled after one season and honestly couldn’t have sustained a second (it was basically My Fair Lady) but he was fantastic in that.&&Columbus was really good, one of my faves from last year, surprised it’s not mentioned in article&&I scrolled quickly, but did not see Better Luck Tomorrow mentioned. John starred in that 15 years ago! So glad to have him back in the spotlight. That is a very good movie!

Edit: A Word&&He was really good in season 2 of The Exorcist, it’s a shame more people didn’t watch it. &&I saw John Cho once at a Wholefoods. He was buying food, as you do. I was a little star struck I guess. I just smiled dumbly, I might have given him a thumbs up, maybe even the double thumbs, I've been known to do that on occasion.

He gave me his quintessential nonplussed eyebrow-raise and said ""..ok..."", then watched me sideshow my way into another aisle. I had the feeling that he wanted me to leave, but also that he wasn't going to turn his back to me. Not that he had any real reason to be alarmed, but I respect his prowess and reserve. 

I'd say it was a quality interaction and I hope he remembers me. &&I've always though Cho was way too charismatic for the roles he got. He could be doing the kind of stuff Clooney was a decade ago, and I'm glad he's finally getting opportunities to flex.&&He can just taste those meaty leading man parts in his mouth right now&&John Cho was excellent in Season Two of The Exorcist. Damn near perfect. His story arc was equal parts heartwarming and heartwrenching, and it was due in no small part to his performance. &&I believe he was in a show called ""Off Center"" a loooong time ago. I remember it being good, but I can hardly remember it anymore. He deserves it.&&People mentioning Jackie Chan and Jet Li like it’s supposed to disprove that there is a lack of leading male asian roles in Hollywood. They are literally the only two people that anyone can name in the past three decades. Three in the past five decades if you want to count Bruce Lee. All of them only getting attention in Hollywood by doing martial arts more than serious acting. Making a real good point you guys.&&Columbus and Searching had to be made during those 2 years. &&Finally?  Harold and Kumar doesn't count?&&*reads headline*

I always thought he was a lead in Harold and Kumar

*reads article*

> Cho’s new movie, *Searching,* is the first mainstream, contemporary thriller headlined by an Asian-American actor. 

That's oddly specific, but point taken&&His audition tape for the role of Jim in the Office was pretty cool, he would have been a decent choice if John Krasinski wasn't perfect for the role.&&How has no one mentioned him in the star trek films. The scene where he's threatening Khan to stand down is amzeballs&&Hope ""Searching"" doesn't flop&&I'll never trust him again after visiting my first White Castle this year.

Disgusting.&&I don’t care if it was the screenwriter’s idea, THIS MAN taught an entire generation of dudes the word, MILF. &&So, when do we get more Harold and Kumar?&&> There has to be this element explaining what the Asian-American hook is

This is by far my biggest pet peeve with media with minority characters. I don't need some hook explaining why the character is a woman / Asian / black / gay / transsexual / other / anything not a Christian white male. They just are what they are. Please stop making a big deal out of it, and just be natural.

It's probably different in other places but where I am, your race / gender / orientation don't come up very often, if ever. Why does it have to be a major plot point?&&Just saw preview screening of ""Searching"" and Cho is fantastic.  Clever and imaginative storytelling filled with suspense and mystery. Have enjoyed his work ever since seeing him in ""The Men's Room"" an NBC series that never aired; I saw the pilot on a DVD screener and have been trying to locate those lost episodes ever since.  Anyone know where I can find them?

&&Next up should be Randall Park. He was one of the best parts of Ant-Man and The Wasp and is great on Fresh Off the Boat. He needs to be put in a funny 80's Tom Hanks role.&&It's kinda frustrating as an Asian American to only see leading Asian American actors as a martial artist. There was a jackie chan interview on conan where he was lamenting about how he wanted to be the lead in a romantic drama movie or something similar and no studio was willing to even talk to him about it, but as soon as he mentions Rush Hour 4 everyone is calling. &&Holy shit, Hollywood is casting an Asian man that isnt placed in a stereotypical extra minor role, kung fu role, or a demeaning and stupid role? 

I’m actually impressed and I’m not being sarcastic. I’ve just been so disillusioned with how Western media treated Asian men (de-sexualized, feminized, villainized, moronized, etc.) that this is all I can say. &&He’ll always be the guy that introduced the word milf to a whole generation.&&Wish they’d cast him as Tony Chu in a live action version of the Comic series Chew. &&The headline itself feels insulting to his role as Harold in Harold and Kumar. He was one of two leads in a trilogy, why does that not count?

Also this movie looks terrible. Nobody liked Unfriended, this format of showing everything through different apps is terrible and visually gross.&&Being cast as the lead in a movie =/= Hollywood leading man. &&Such a promising show.&&Join r/Flashforward to reminisce and complain about the early death of the show&&Fuck that show got me so hyped for nothing...&&The first 3 or 4 episodes of that show were sensational. Such a good premise. &&Never forget&&Dude, I loved Flash Forward, but all my friends hated it. I thought it delivered pretty well.&&I thought I was the only one remembered it.  It was Cho and Karen Gillan, and it was awesome.  Networks didn’t give it a chance because of the AWFUL name.&&So many amazing cancelled abc sitcoms: Happy Endings, Pushing Daisies, Better Off Ted, Dirty Sexy Money.&&Dammit, I really liked Selfie. I believe they canceled it before the first season even finished airing...&&Such a good show. Too funny to last. And the terrible name.&&I thought, for obvious reasons, the second season of The Good Place wouldn't have anywhere to go. Now I'm excited to see what season three has in store. 

Writers can surprise you. &&I loved Selfie!! 

I was really sad it didn't get a second season, but you're right that the story didn't have much gas left in the tank already. &&That show was surprisingly good and just kept getting better. It’s a shame they didn’t give it a real chance.  John and Karen were really good together. &&It only got half a season actually :( they cancelled it mid season. They didn’t even finish airing it on tv - after they pulled it, they just aired the remaining episodes from the front 13 online.&&Though not a leading role (but highly important role), he was in a show called Go On where he was great in.&&I haven't seen Selfie, but I doubt it was better than Off Centre... The greatest thing Cho has done... Even better than the Harold & Kumar movies put together.&&I was surprised that with Karen, it didn't take off. &&In Selfie, he was also one of the few, if not the only, Asian romantic lead(s) in a sitcom. ever.

Edit: an American sitcom&&I remember him in FlashForward. He was great.&&If I could give two seasons to a cancelled show, I'd give two to Selfie (and possibly a name change). Seriously loved it, and it makes me sad that it isn't mentioned more often.&&It was refreshing to finally see an Asian male as the lead love interest. I was super into the show and when it got canceled I was almost 90% sure it’s because westerners didn’t like seeing or watching a show with an Asian guy in the lead love interest role, which upsets me. &&Cho is so fucking good in it. It's a reserved role, but packs so much meaning and emotion into little variations of his voice and tone. Really powerful stuff from him and Haley Lu Richardson. One of my favorites from last year as well for sure. &&That cinematography&&Yes! Columbus deserves more attention. One of my favorites as well.&&i'm still waiting for an asian man to kiss a white woman on the big screen&&Other than the amazing performances from Haley Lu Richardson (seriously keep an eye on this girl) and John Cho, the cinematography is really incredible and beautiful. The whole film has a theme about the beauty of architecture and geometry, and it's represented so well. Every shot seems like someone just set the camera down and hit record, in the best way ever. An example: https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/31141881732_6801b30411_o.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1&&God that movie was good &&If I remember correctly, in one of the Harold and kumar movies, they do a throwback to that film and someone yells at him ""better luck tomorrow!""&&Oh man, I remember watching that movie back in undergrad.

I was devastated when they cancelled it, I had no idea the ratings were so low. &&He was amazing in The Exorcist. Really hoping for a 3rd season. 

Edit: just saw it was cancelled. Nooooooooooooooooooooo.&&I loved that season far more than the first and it was mostly due to him. He did a great job. I wish it wasn't cancelled.&&One of the best shows on tv.  Easily the best show on broadcast before it was canceled.  &&Yes! He was great in that. I really loved that show. He was just as charismatic as the two priests (Ben Daniels and Alfonso Herrerra). His sadness was palpable. I'm so sad that it was cancelled. i wish more people could have watched it.&&I pretty much only watched it for him and the girl that plays Negasonic Teenage Warhead&&I loved that series overall, too. He did great. Did it get cancelled for season 3?&&He became one of my favorite actors from that show! I loved it, and loved him in it! &&man I loved that series.

People get *really* defensive and have trouble understanding the nuance and history of the situation.

I'd love to see more Asian males in non-stereotypical leading roles. Something that doesn't *require* them to be Asian. You can still make those films (martial arts films, films like *Crazy Rich Asians* or the *Joy Luck Club* (which probably shows howrare even those movies are since I had to go back to the 90s)), but I'd like to see more where their race 100% doesn't matter , like a majority of films starring white leads.

Also I love John Cho but Randall Park is my absolute favorite Asian actor. Shit, he's probably my favorite underrated actor. More roles for him now please.&&One of the very first sex symbols in Hollywood was Japanese, Sessue Hayakawa. 

Over the decades, Hollywood actually put in efforts to change the image of Asian men and de-sexualize them. That's why you have portrayals like Mickey Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffanys. 

People don't get how much cultural impact in society representation and portrayals of minorities on screen can have and how society viewed Asian men for so long is an example of that. Because it wasn't always like that. &&This is true. Donnie Yen was in rogue one in an important but not lead role, it would be nice to see him and others more often on the big screen. &&They are also Asian, not Asian American (I know Cho wasn't born here, but he has been here longer than Korea). They also had a huge catalog in Chinese cinema before coming to the US. Also, as you said, they are in films due to their martial arts skills, not necessarily their acting (although I think they are both pretty decent actors, albeit usually playing the same types of roles).&&Lou Diamond Philips?&&Don't forget Chow Yun Fat.

Especially when it comes to Asians. I feel like it’s worth mentioning because directors, writers, award judges need to see that many different groups can be represented and the audience doesn’t care so long as the story is good. Right?

That would be ideal. But Hollywood cares about money and old ideas. They believed an all black cast couldn’t do well in the box office and be marketed to the masses, black panther proved that to be false. Hollywood is discriminatory by nature, so they look at race and gender and age to decide how they are going to market a movie and how they will cast a movie. 

That’s just the way it is. To say, well race shouldn’t be mentioned is just putting blinders on. Race should definitely be noted if it means that someone else of that race might get an opportunity to play the leading man or lady. &&Don't ever watch *Crash*&&MILF&&If you haven’t watched it, there’s a show called The 100 with a half-Filipino lead actor who’s the furthest thing from an Asian stereotype. &&How do you think us Indian men feel? &&Its getting pretty amazing reviews. &&I’m not trying to argue, but for discussion’s sake I think it depends on the definition of “leading man” or “lead actor.” If a leading man is just any man starring in a movie then duo or not Harold and Kumar counts. But then you’d have to say that Howard Stern is a leading man for Private Parts (Not knocking Stern). Which is fair according to that first definition, but I think leading man is supposed to be more of a consistent leading role sort of deal. 

Like Jackie Chan or George Clooney or Matt Damon would be a leading man, but Jeremy Renner and John Cho could be argued either way at this point.

I’d be interested to hear other’s thoughts on this, because I think the definition is pretty dependent on who is talking.&&It got really good reception at Sundance.

And agree 100% that we need Asians in regular roles like Aziz as Tom in Parks & Rec.&&randall park was one of the best things about antman and the wasp.

it'd be cool to get an Agents of Atlas movie with him.&&One thing I really hate about American comedies is that whenever there is a black man on screen he is almost always only black. That is how deep his character goes. He says ""white people"" or stuff like that.
 
Like look at the movie shawshank redemption (just the first movie that came to mind), Morgan freeman is a character, he is black but that is irrelevant. Wish that was the norm. &&I'm Indian (so South Asian), what I want to see is more Asian American stories. 

The character's whole identity shouldn't revolve around being Asian. But the character also shouldn't be a character that can literally be played by anyone, but just happens to be played by an Asian. 

I feel like these are the only two types of Asians that are seen in American media. Not that there's anything wrong with it inherently, but there needs to be more Asian stories told in general. Where a character is Asian, and that plays a role in their life because when you're a minority/immigrant your ethnicity usually does, but it shouldn't be their whole identity. 

I am also SO over the whole white person dating an Asian and hur dur aren't cultural conflicts hard story. Enoughhhhhh jesus. It's like Asian stories only matter when a white person is involved. &&I love Randall Park but I don't really see him as a leading man. He's more of a character actor and works best that way. His role in Fresh Off The Boat is great though because he isn't the star but you still get a lot of him. Give him more roles for sure but I can't see him in a lead role.

Although to be fair I find with comedies sometimes people you wouldn't expect to take a good star turn do it with a good script. For example Zach Galifianakis in the first Hangover... although I have never really liked him as a lead in anything else.

Or they deliberately try to drown it by being smartasses, like how everyone remembered that Blade was a ""superhero film"" when people started talking about Black Panther, when they all knew what people meant when they said BP was the first black helmed superhero film  and it wasn't an R-rated vampire story with no superheroes in it made a decade before that most people probably didn't even know came from a comic.

But they just wanted to go ""well, ackshually..."" on people even mildly happy about something.&&Exactly this.  Sort of off topic but regarding crazy rich asians/ joy luck club, even within the asian community many people do not like these being seen as like ""the holy grail of asian american literature"" either/ being compared to black panther - because they show a very limited side of the asian/ asian american experience that many do not relate to and see as a caricature of asian culture made from stereotypes.  Especially with Joy Luck Club, both my SO and I find that novel/ movie to be extremely stereotypical (from an outsider's POV) and a mutilation of asian culture (to the point where it almost feels foreign to even many Chinese ppl) when it is used to generalize the asian experience in the States - and find it appalling that it is taught all over high schools in US that this is what asian american experience culture and experience is like.  I do not doubt that there are some people whose lives are actually like that, but to use it as exemplary of Chinese/Asian culture and use it as teaching material  in HS nationwide seems really gross. It shouldn't be taught for asians living in the states that they need to hate their own family, their upbringing, and culture and reject it to find who they really are.&&Absolutely, it's getting really tiring to see that Hollywood casting is pretty much ""White, unless the story requires otherwise"".&&>One of the very first sex symbols in Hollywood was Japanese, Sessue Hayakawa. 


I have to be honest with you, as an Asian man, I thought to myself, ""How can a Japanese guy be a sex symbol in Hollywood?"" Maybe it's just due to the current culture in flux but it just didn't compute for me.

And then I looked up a picture of him. Hot *damn*, the man is sexy. He's got badass in his eyes.&&>That's why you have portrayals like Mickey Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffanys.

That bs gets me fired up every time I think about it. There's no way for me to like that movie because of this. &&True. When you ask a girl to name sexiest male stars they will be mostly white.

Check social media. An Asian dude happens to date a attractive white girl half the comments will be about his small dick and that he's prob rich. Literally have read comments like ""why settle for an asian? ""&&In the 1920s silent film The Cheat by Cecil B. Demille, the Chinese-American male antagonist is portrayed as lustful and predatory towards the white female lead. Racist and one-dimensional but interesting to contemplate in the sense of how different a stereotype that is to what Hollywood peddled just a few decades later. (Basically, it's a stereotype we now perceive as being applied solely to black male characters.)
&&THANK YOU. I thought i was the only one on here who knows about sessue.

They gave him villain roles, so he'd be ""undesirable"". They wrote his stories to have short periods with the main female lead, then force the female lead to return to the white male lead because they want to tell the female audience that being with a white male is ""correct"", and being with any other race is bad.

He is one of the first actors to start his own production company, and yet is absent in hollywood history when talking about that very achievement. 

They actually wrote in laws (different races cannot be portrayed to have romantic stories) stopping minorities from having romantic roles to stop his star power.

The reasoning? To stop the corruption of white women desiring men of different races. Literally documented as the reason.

They then gave all his roles to an italian man, who is still ""exotic"" at the time, but looks basically white. And thats where hollywood marked the start of the ""male sex symbol"" phenomenon, after they kicked sessue out of hollywood, and only removed the law after the ""male sex symbol should be white"" thing is entrenched in culture.&&Yup, and they did it *because* women were going nuts for Sessue Hayakawa’s “exotic lustful bad guy” image instead of the clean-cut (white) American men. &&I'm surprised Ken Watanabe hasn't been brought up.

The step-dad in the first one, and the uptight FBI agent in the second.&&That awkward ""I'll be seeing you"" convo towards the end had the entire theater I was in dying.&&Fun fact: He was actually a redheaded Irish guy in the novel, that's why his nickname in the movie is ~~Orange Joe~~ Red.&&Much like Dinsel in The Equalizer, or Will Smith in Enemy of the State. Every so often, ethnicity isn't what the character is written around. &&> Morgan freeman is a character, he is black but that is irrelevant.

Because in the book he was a red-haired Irishman.   If you hire a black guy to play a red-haired Irishman and don't change the dialogue, his race is subsequently going to be pretty irrelevant to the story.&&Red was Irish originally anyhow. To be fair, not every actor is Morgan Freeman.&&It's a difficult balance, because you also don't want to downplay minority experiences with ""colorblind"" roles either. That is, you want a good distribution of good roles for minorities: some roles where the person just happens to be a minority, but the role could have been written for anyone, and other roles that speak appropriately and sensitively to that minority group's experiences as a minority group. I always think about Aziz Ansari's show as a great example of this: a number of characters get to fill both these roles: minorities as everyday, across-the-board relatable characters for viewers of any race, while simultaneously avoiding downplaying their minority identity, and giving them a minute to explore those identities. I think this sort of scenario is the ideal.&&Too many white guys lusting over Asian women in Hollywood. That's what a lot of Asian women don't like Hollywood movies. It makes them look like they're just there to be fucked by white guys and that's it. &&I'd like to see more of this too. I think for that to happen we need to get more Asian/Asian American people *behind* the camera, writing the stories, directing the content, and so forth. &&Randall Parks on that Cranston career path. He's doing his Hal role, just needs the Walter White&&> Randall Park

Jim has gotten a lot of roles since the Office&&>I love Randall Park but I don't really see him as a leading man. He's more of a character actor and works best that way. 

That's fair. I just think if he could slowly build up his resume through some really good comedies then he could really make a name for himself. Maybe not in super dramatic or super action-y roles. but definitely in some good mid-range budget movies.&&They made his character a little too dumb for a fbi agent for my liking&&> Nuh-uh, here are several Asians that had supporting roles as computer guys in the background scenes lol crushed bajenga!!!!  

My personal favorite: ""Asians shouldn't complain about Hollywood representation since they're doing economically well in America.""  

Upon my asking the poster whether black males should stop complaining about police brutality since they're doing well in Hollywood, I suddenly started getting a string of non sequiturs

&&He's not just A sex symbol, hes the FIRST sex symbol. 

Hes the dude that made women at the time realize its possible to think ""hot damn i want to sleep with him"" just from watching him.

Then hollywood shut that whole thing down, forced him out of hollywood, pushed a white male as a new sex symbol by giving all of sessues roles to him, and only allowed sessue to come back to hollywood when the culture of sex symbols being white is entrenched in culture.&&I wish they would release a version with those scenes cut out because they add nothing to the film and aren’t necessary for the plot to make sense&&>why settle for an Asian 

Disgusting. Ever thought he could just be a good man? 

I hate racism.&&That’s funny

I thought Jeremy Lin put the small dick thing to rest.  &&White actors/actresses need only be half-decent looking to be considered hot; minorities need to be objectively near-flawless to rank as sex symbols. Look at the way Lucy Liu was treated as the lesser Angel when she's objectively far more attractive than Cameron Diaz or Drew Barrymore.

I always notice when walking through duty-free shops at airports how many bland and/or washed-up white actors are used to peddle designer watches and fragrances; you'll practically never spot a non-white face among all the pretentious, photoshopped posters. The message is clear: any white celebrity (whether a botoxed-to-fuck Nicole Kidman, decrepit Michael Douglas, drug-addled Depp or even a random B-lister) is inherently glamorous, aspirational, and aesthetically pleasing.&&Ay but with the proliferation of Kpop and dramas we steady takin over bruh. I definitely think that media representation plays a huge factor in it because I mean honestly they don’t have any “cool” asian roles or people ya know.  I fight racism by sleepin with ladies of all ethnicities. &&It does for upvotes on Reddit though&&Kevin Spacey begs to differ.&&To be fair, America does tend to lump biracial children into the race of their non-white parent if one is white.  When neither parent is white, it's not as straightforward socially.  For example, if you ask anyone, Obama was the first black US president.  Very few people would say he's not black because he's biracial.&&TIL keanu reeves is part asian. &&How do you get more “leading” than that?!??&&Asian Jim was definitely the FBI agent in Ant-Man. People want John Krasinski to be cast as Reed Richards (Mr. fantastic) and find an excuse for FBI agent Woo to go see him. &&>I visited America partially to try White Castle 

Pulled a muscle in my face from laughing so hard. I can only imagine your disappointment &&>We got a resurgence of Neil ~~Patrick Harris'~~ Poon Handler's career.

FTFY

&&That was the Christmas special, I think? It kinda sucked, like a White Castle burger, apparently.&&That one dude from the daily show is gonna blow ip hopefully&&You were supposed to be the chosen one Aziz!&&He didn't even fucking do anything. He was just awkward&&[deleted]&&And yet Under the Dome got three seasons....the fuck!&&That show burned me hard. That and V&&It’s like a Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza place.  Good show with Ryan Reynolds, awful name&&That comparison makes me want to watch Selfie. Don't trust the B was great. I remember Selfie only because of the shitty title, and that's the same reason i never gave it a chance.&&But what about the Beek? He was fantastic in the show and should get something.&&I watched Jane die&&I didn't like Krysten Ritter before I watched JJ. But goddamn if that didn't turn out to be the best of the Netflix Marvel shows.&&Honestly, that show and Two Broke Girls should have traded names.

Or even New Girl. But I love New Girl.&&And it's *still* not as bad as Cougar Town. That show was great, the name was trash. &&I actually have experience with this. 

I was taking my Semester in LA program through my film degree. We got to meet various speakers and one of them was Bob Kosberg (or Robert Kosberg) who's been in the industry for a long time and has basically become a pitch salesman. He'll pitch an idea or story and others will buy it and/or write it. 

He talked about how every year there's a buzzword and he capitalizes on that buzzword to sell a pitch. 

His word that year was Selfie. &&Amazing show. I was one of the many people that avoided it because of the name, only to catch it all on Hulu, binge it in three days and hate everyone including myself for not watching it when it was airing.&&That show was awesome. Santa Clarita Diet is from the same creator. Timothy Olyphant was custom built to deliver that kind of dialog.&&Track down Andy richter controls the universe, another show the creator did before ted&&The whole set design of the show was amazing. &&To be fair it's not like Joe McMillan really knows who the fuck he is in the first place.&& forgot the t... guardians of the galaxy&&[ehhh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_Daisies#U.S._ratings) For an ABC show in a prime slot leading into a night, It looked ok for the first season, not great, but a huge slump after that.  Moving it to Saturday is good indicator the numbers weren't as good as you seem to think.  

And pretty much putting it on Saturday meant it was dead.&&Sorry, we now say lit&&Chau rules. The man predicted it.&&I completely agree.  The point of the show was that as much as Cho needed Karen, Karen actually needed Cho.   They made each other better people.  If she was already perfect it would be a really odd character development &&Actually known for Cummins and heroin.&&As a Korean-American, watching John Cho starring in Star Trek gave me this warmth of a feeling; kind of like ""Wow, finally... a great blockbuster movie that has an Asian American guy playing such a meaningful role during my generation."" I wanted to personally thank all of the writers, casting director, & J.J. Abrams that made it happen. And I appreciated that Han Sulu was especially dashing in the film.

Now hearing that this another Korean-American guy having a significant love-interest with a pretty Caucasian actress in ""The Walking Dead""... I distinctly remember saying to my friends ""no way..."" when they told me about the show featuring such couple.

When I witnessed that, I was a very happy Korean-American student in a college where the demographic was 85% Caucasian & <1.0% Asian. My 1st gf in college was white, and that was very surreal for me at the time.&&Comedy.&&I haven't seen that movie but that description sounds hilarious. If I saw that in the theater I would've audibly said ""what the fuck?""&&>  ""Romeo Must Die""

I was in the middle of puberty when that came out and JESUS CHRIST was it such a sexy letdown.&&[deleted]&&Wait huh?

Black men with White women is insanely more common than Asian men with any kind of women in American media.

Black men with White women is also more common than White men with Black women.

If you include television, there's a shit ton of Black men being with all kinds of different women. &&It's kind of unbelievable you've taken a thread and comment chain about Asian male representation in Hollywood and managed to make it about the plight of Black males again.

It's also kind of a perfect microcosm of one of the biggest problems for Asian advocacy issues - so thanks for this perfect example. &&Wait what? Black male and white woman is the most common/safe pairing in Hollywood. Hell Jessica Jones is one of the hottest shows out there and she marries Nick(Luke cage) cage. Hand maids tale also has the same dynamic. 


Black and white was rare in the 60s. The major easy pairings are black man/white woman, Asian woman/white male and it's so annoying. I would love to see Asian male and black woman. The closest we have is altered carbon and that's not enough. 

Also Latina woman and white male. Another trope. So much of a trope it's a hugely popular American sitcom now. We need to push ethnic pairings and family composition from these safe tropes. &&I was thinking Kumar's girlfriend Vanessa, but I checked and see she's only in the sequels. Still, though.&&Who, Piefucker?&&Typecasting and he got old.&&Jason Biggs really only fit that awkward teen/young adult role. So after he got past a certain age he really didn't have much opportunity because he looked too old to play those roles. He was excellent at them though &&He's staring in Orange is the New Black if I'm not mistaken. &&Maw you got the right one. People need to leave Batman and Robin alone. It was campy and fun like the TV show. I was young when it came out so I enjoyed it, but Id still rewatch it every now and again.&&yeah and then dealing with their kids who are trying to hide it from Them.  ""are we really gonna smoke your sons' weed?!?""&&I would watch that. Even better is if they could some how work in a parody of the old ""I learned it by watching you"" anti drug psa.&&His acting in In the Mood for Love was perfect &&The guy seems to really like playing undercover cops. At least from two of his breakout roles in Hard Boiled (come on guys, you don't know one of the greatest action movies of all time?) and Infernal Affairs (the original Departed).&&The dude's handsome af and his english is really good, yet he keeps getting the brooding, stoic, silent roles unfortunately. Which I guess is the same with his Korean roles.&&The Good, The Bad, and The Weird is fantastic.&&He's in a Korean show called Mr. Sunshine which is airing on Netflix right now if you're interested in seeing what he's up to.&&Considering his rep in Korea, it might be better for him to start focusing on the States exclusively. &&I had such a crush on him when Jurassic Park came out! Soooo handsome to 14 year old me. I was pissed about his role in the reboots.&&He's wonderful as Hugo Strange in Gotham. Campy as fuck but in the fun way. &&> BD Wong

Loved him in Oz, he's a great actor ([and singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbo-snzC3g0)).   
I can't believe he's close to 60 now.&&Dude is killing it as White Rose in Mr. Robot. Probably the most complex and nuanced role I’ve seen him in. &&Benedict Wong too.&&I really really hope Stephen doesn't fall to the wayside. Since walking dead ended I think he's only done voice roles. I was all for him as Nightwing&&Hollywood is fucked up. I was listening to the Bobby Lee podcast and he shared a story of going in for to read for a part and running into Steven Yuen. He was shocked and pissed they had Steven come in to read. Like all his work wasn't enough and he still needed to audition for roles like a Hollywood newcomer?&&i liked that joke in the beginning where he's trying to explain to Paul Rudd's daughter ""Ok sweety, the reason why your daddy is in trouble is <super long technical description of violation>""&&I mean did you wanna get dinner later?&&TIL

I'm so very glad they gave that role to Freeman. I can't imagine that movie any other way&&I thought it was a short story, not a novel? &&Though the film did lift the lines ""Why do they call you Red?"" / ""Probably because I'm Irish."" straight from the book and just let Morgan Freeman's delivery carry it.&&Perfect, how it should be. &&Very similar to how they wrote Ellen Ripley's character to be a man and then just switched genders. And we got one of the best female action roles in history. &&Why do they call you ""Red?""


Maybe because I'm Irish.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7p1aanWF5Y&&Brooklyn 99 champions this, it’s progressive without being an insulting marketing ploy &&Totally agree. I think you there should be a healthy mix of ""colorblind"" movies led by minorities, movies that emphasize minority experiences and movies that use stereotypes (because I think everyone should be made fun of, at least in a way that's smart and isn't totally dickish). I think what constitutes a ""healthy mix"" changes depending on the political/social climate at the time, but I think we should be able represent people in both good and ""bad"" ways.
&&Killing Eve on BBC. Makes no mention of Sandra Oh being Korean, though it does mention she grew up in Canada, to explain her lack of London accent.&&Thank you. I'm Asian-American (Filipino) and while I'd love to see more roles where the Asian characters aren't stereotypical mystical kung fu men, I also don't want them to go so far down the other way that their race doesn't matter at all. Show the culture, but don't make them stereotypes. Give them a cultural identity, but don't make it their only identity. 

And also--I'm not saying mystical kung fu men are bad. I love wuxia films. But please give me variety. &&Asian fetishization is a nightmare and has always made me super wary of dating.

Fetishization is a weird word.&&That's true for sure, there's a lack of representation in these occupations as well. Whether that's due to discrimination, Asians not picking these careers or a mix of both I don't know. &&My favorite Cranston role is still his role on Seinfeld.

&&But not Captain America&&I think he's already made a name for himself! I mean, I love him. And he seems to be in a lot of stuff these days.

He's really great at good fun clean comedy (mostly cause he has this super friendly image) and he has been breaking into big movies recently (he's in the new Ant Man).&&I wouldn't say dumb, just a quirky straight man foil for Paul Rudd. It's weird and almost oxymoronic to say that but I don't know how else to describe it.&&especially when the comics version is actually a badass Asian James Bond, and not a comic relief.&&I heard the fan theory that anybody at that level probably isn't actually that dumb, so he might be obfuscating stupidity &&My favorite is whenever black actors complain about the quality of black roles in Hollywood somebody shoots back ""but what about Asians? They have even less quality roles and you never see them complain!"" because 9/10 times that same poster will later repeat what you said when Asians start complaining.&&Though the score for the last scene still gets me to the soul, what's funny is that the film doesn't make sense when compared to Capote's original novella. A gay friend talking about one of his wildest but dearest friends who ran off to do her own thing gets turned into a straight guy's wish fulfillment. Yunioshi was a minor character in the novella, but his nosiness that got her in trouble was actually the actions someone else. Turning him into a racist caricature was all on the film.&&Its also crazy to see John Cho and Randyl Park basically be considered the hottest asian dudes in hollywood... when they look extremely plain compared to actors in Asia. 

&&Lucy Liu is considered average in China. There's literally no way she could play the role of an attractive person in China. Also in American porn the Asian women are very below average. Something about racial fetishes I guess.&&Definitely does on /r/nsfw_gif.&&Excellent point. This is also why Alex Winter has been leading man in countless movies since ""Bill & Ted"" while Keanu Reeves has fallen into obscurity

^^^/s&&He'd actually be ok as reed&&I wasn't alone either, there were three of us.&&What?? The Christmas one was hilarious&&I really really hope he is not the chosen one. His characters in everything I've seen seem like that guy you felt guilty ignoring in high school, because he's harmless, but just too damn annoying &&And Penny, who's not on the boat.&&I really hate myself for watchin the entire series. The first season was okey but after, it is probably the worst piece of television you can get&&I think Under The Dome got three seasons because it wasn't a show, it was the longest advertisement ever created. That show had so many awkward product placements..&&Me too! God, two great shows, back when everyone was trying to follow up on the success of lost.

It's on Hulu. &&He got Dawson's Creek, what more does he want?&&Dude, spoilers. (/s, just in case)&&I could’ve saved her but I didn’t &&i was the same. Ritter was meh. But she was such a bad ass in Jessica Jones, you have to love her.&&I really hated Jane in BB, and I think that her portrayal of Jane was just so good that hate was unfortunately bleeding (for me) into the actress. I felt the same way once watching Jessica Jones. Made me realize how awesome she is. &&Two Broke Girls was like the lowest common denominator of comedy &&Penny Can!&&Ok, calm down Abed.  &&Did they eventually have an ad campaign revolving around how bad the show's name was?&&Did you watch it the actual order, and not the abominable ""order"" it aired in? Last I checked, it was still out of order on Hulu and Netflix, to the point that the main story is unintelligible.&&Olyphant is so underutilized for his comic sensibilities/timing. I figured after Justified industry types would realize that but he hasn’t had the carrer I figured he would after it ended.&&SCD & Better Off Ted are both amazing.  I had no idea Timothy Olyphant could do comedy; that dude is hilarious.&&The reason I watched Santa Clarita Diet. Saw an article announcing the show that started with that it was by the same guy, instant watch for me. &&Timothy Oliphant is the greatest goddamn actor of this generation. The issue is that he's too great of an actor so you don't even recognize him in half the stuff. 

If you told me that it's the same guy in Santa Clarita and Hitman, I wouldn't believe you. &&""What you think when hitler comes back he's just gonna goose step on in!?""

""I'm sorry *when* hitler comes back?""&&Is *that* what 'lit' means? 

I used to be with It, but then they changed what It was, now what I'm with isn't It and what It is seems weird and scary to me. 

And it'll happen to you!&&I wonder if this is something only Asian American men would ever truly understand. We are the quiet, ignored minority. Media has a tendency to treat us as if we don't exist, especially not as a sexual being.&&I'm Asian American too and it was interesting watching Black Panther. As I was watching I was just thinking how meaningful it actually was to have a superhero of color. Like black kids could think ""I could be a superhero too!?""

I didn't realize how meaningful having someone that looks like you play a role like that until I saw how different it felt watching.&&I would rec it, it is a decent action movie with some laughs.

English speaking audiences are *really* picky about the foreign accents they will accept as fluent - they tend to be mild French and Northern European ones, and anything much beyond that is seen as poor English even if the content of their speech is grammatically and synactically perfect. &&It sucks how underutilized he is, but when I get stuck watching one of the reboots I just get so excited to see he's there. It's like no one else even realizes he was in the original. &&He was recently in Burning, which received great critical reception at Cannes. He's a hilarious guy and I also hope he picks up more roles. &&Je was in Okja&&I was worried for him too after he left The Walking Dead, but he's been in Okja, Sorry to Bother You, and Burning (Beoning), so his post TWD career is off to a good start.&&To be fair, a lot of major actors still audition, especially if it's for a role or genre that they haven't really done before. It's one thing if it's a cameo or smaller role, but if it's for a lead or supporting role, it's not surprising that a casting director would request an audition. &&I loved that and I loved Michael Peña in it too as well as Laurence Fishburne, the movie definitely let minorities shine a bit. And I love the growing Hispanic representation as Peña himself has definitely been doing great in recent years. So I hope that Park and Cho and others also get the opportunity to be the ones that open the doors for Asian representation. &&He talked through the ventilation as God to help guide the choice.&&It's a novella from a Stephen King collection called Different Seasons: Hope Springs Eternal.

Actually youtube itself was super asian back then too. &&I got the impression he was fine as an FBI agent but just socially awkward as fuck, like the dinner conversation. &&If people think they can play *that* game, just bring up Arabs and/or Muslims, and it's game over.

As a total aside, there is a post on askReddit that gets thrown around quite often in paranormal threads about a guy that got hit by a car, and in his ""unconscious"" state, lived an entire two years with a wife and child. One day, he's staring at a lamp, and reality slowly starts to come back to him, and he wakes up minutes after being hit by a car.

In my opinion, the best episode of Star Trek, period. Any franchise.&&True that. Hispanics are often portrayed as gangsters or funny dudes with accents. 

Off the top of my head the “usually” non-stereotyped typecast Hispanic actors I can think of is Salma Hayek, John Leguizamo, Shakira and that’s all I can think of. Selena Gomez maybe??

'Incredibles 2' Hits $1 Billion at Box Office Faster Than Any Animated Film,40566,93ftie,https://www.thewrap.com/incredibles-2-hits-1-billion-at-box-office-faster-than-any-animated-film/,1248,1533053496.0,,"Obviously this is the third Disney movies that hits $1 Billion after Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War in 2018.&&> the 36th film in box office history to hit $1 billion and the seventh animated film to do so, alongside “Frozen,” “Minions,” “Toy Story 3,” “Finding Dory,” “Despicable Me 3,” and “Zootopia.”

It's interesting to see 2 titles from Illumination Entertainment on that list, along with the obvious Disney and Pixar ones. Illumination seems like more of an upstart compared to Dreamworks Animation, Sony Pictures Animation, and Blue Sky, but apparently it's been making more big hits in recent years. (I say ""in recent years"" because this isn't corrected for inflation, so huge hits in previous decades like Shrek or Ice Age wouldn't count for as much.)&&Is it wrong that I found the secondary story of mr. Incredible struggling with home life to be far more interesting than the main plot?&&It was everything I wanted after 12 years and more. Even Though I didn't get the same goosebumps I got watching the first one when Dash runs on water. I don't think that scene can be topped. &&It’s faster because of inflation.

The only movies to make over a billion dollars between 1990 and 2009 were The Dark Knight, Jurassic Park, Phantom Menace, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest, Lord of The Rings: Return of the King, Titanic, and Avatar.

No movie before 1993 made a billion dollars. Since 2010, 29 movies have made a billion dollars. If you include inflation only 3 of those 37 movies have made it onto the top 10 list — Titanic, Avatar, and The Force Awakens (with a caveat and probably won’t count within a year).

It’s easier than ever to make a billion dollars thanks to inflation.&&I wish the reported numbers about movies would be done in ticket sales instead of box office totals. It's easier to hit $1 billion when the tickets are $15 each. The number that matters is how many people went to see it. It will still be a LOT of people, as this movie is excellent, but it's a more realistic indicator of a movie's success to the audience. The money is really only important to the studio.&&All because of momma Thicc...&&They absolutely nailed the mannerisms of Jack-jack.  I have a 1.5 year old daughter and it was like watching the animated version of my daughter on screen, tantrums and all.  

I can't wait to watch it again!&&And still not in Finland. One month. A MONTH !&&It's almost like that's what happens when you finally give people what they want.&&Those damn perverts!&&FUCK YOU ‘MINIONS’!&&Pixar was the best thing to ever happen to the film industry. When toy story came out I was fucking 12. It was, even though I was in those pre-teen years, I thought this movie was the tits. It redefined animation. The only thing comparable to this that I have seen before this, was Akira. I thought that movie and it's animation was the future. Pixar has since, been a house hold item. There isn't a movie or short done by them, I haven't seen. Even as a teenager, young adult, grown man right up to a dad that I haven't owned or went to the theater to watch a Pixar film. They get you right in the feels and the animation wraps you right up into it. They can and have made a grown man tear up before. I'm looking at you Up. And then WallE, then parts of monsters Inc, then originally toy story, then again with Wreck it Ralph. &&...and Hollywood still complains that piracy affects their business! &&Because Mrs. Incredible is thicc af&&It worked. Only movie I have seen this year in theaters. &&Well I didn't like it but I'm not surprised about how much it's made. It's a film that you were excited to see if you saw the first.&&The hype carried it VERY far. Incredibles 1 was one of the greatest animated movies ever made. &&Why is the metric of most money made still used?

The population grows, ticket prices go up.

Of course newer stuff will get more gross income. There's gotta be a better way, no?&&If only it had a story that deserved that much

It was beyond predictable and bare bones and I still can't see the infatuation Reddit has over it besides just outright nostalgia&&Damn. Disney is just gonna keep on bring those money home and next year it’s going to be even bigger for them. But seriously can’t wait for Avengers 4!&&Its amazing how when you give the people what they want. They spend $$ and purchase the product/service you are selling..&&its a franchise that deserves it. &&Its too bad the Anime movie ""Your Name"" wasn't released in theaters throughout the USA.  It would probably have hit 1 billion by now too.&&Awesome! Now it only needs $400 million more until it's officially not a flop!&&Was anyone else kind of underwhelmed by incredibles 2? Outside the toxic stuff Brad Bird always codes into his movies, the whole thing felt a little... unremarkable. &&Isn't this a progressively lower and lower standard because of inflation? 


Not to take anything away from this movie (it was everything I hoped it would be). I'm just wondering if its only the fastest because inflation makes $1b easier to reach than it used to be. &&Well it fucking deserves it&&Now Disney will know they can make a meh film and it will still blow up because it's Disney. I've wanted a sequel for a long time but I was a little underwhelmed. The villain was a bit of an idiot and her plan was ridiculously convoluted and unnecessary. &&Well, that's incredible too!&&Inflation and being at the beginning of a slow summer period definitely helped though... so let's not go crowning it the best animated film of all time or anything.&&I'm sure moviepass covered a good portion of the earnings.&&Wonder how much of that was from moviepass&&Cant beat the thicc 😂&&That is until Hiccup and Toothless throttle it in March. &&That’s a thic paycheck &&Never seen any of them, but I know half of Reddit went to see this movie because they want to bang the Mom.

Wow. ^/s&&Wouldn't a monetary value be baseless due to inflation over time? Ticket count might be more indicative. Otherwise you'll always be breaking sale records as time moves forward. Or make adjustments for inflation. &&Welp guess there will be a sequel &&And it's still not out yet in Norway :/ &&omg $1 billion a lot of zero there &&Such a great movie. Not surprised at its success given how well they coordinated the age of their target audiences with their release schedule. &&Doesn't Infinity War count as animated film at this point?&&Including inflation?&&Math is math!&&Every big release is a new record. I don't think I'm impressed anymore.&&its because of DAT ASS&&I just saw the movie today, it was great! I actually might just.. go see it again!&&Movie doesn't hold a candle to the original, but this isn't surprising. &&That movie was SOOOO mediocre. &&Am I the only one bothered by the headlines?  It's called inflation... Something will get to a billion faster than this, then something else will beat that, and eventually we'll have a film hit a trillion at the box office.  

Report these films relatively speaking or it's nothing more than a sensationalist headline. &&Just this year!  That's insane.&&That 4 billion investment in Star Wars wasn't so back breaking huh.  &&* this year.  

They have several others that have also hit that mark.  &&The mouse is pleased. &&It's not even out in Germany yet (and I assume most other non English countries). So those numbers will go way up once they releases in September. &&""obviously"" ?&&Sam jackson is killing it in the box office&&Disney brings in so much business for movie theaters that they demand 60% of the ticket sales now. Makes hitting a billion dollars faster and easier.&&Illumination basically had a shitload of luck in striking gold with the minions. &&It's just titles that saw a theatrical release in Asia. There are tons of shit movies that make bank in China because it's a foreign film.

For example: Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within had a theatrical release last year. Yes, the underperforming 2001 film. IN 2017. ""Highest Grossing"" says nothing about the quality of these films, but rather how widely distributed it is. 
&&Sorry, but I didn't read the article so not sure if they took into account inflation. Just talking of Pixar, but I remember Bug's Life coming out and being less than luke warm while when Toy Story was released just blowing the fuck up. The goofy lamp bouncing across the screen and a crazily well rendered CGI movie was so awesome. I can't even explain how fully engrossed I was when Monsters, Inc came out with Sully's fur. Each individual strand of hair was meticulously rendered making such an aesthetically beautiful movie that was equally as hilarious. Pixar was this unheard of production company that was just blowing away audiences with massive hit after massive hit. I worried when I heard that Disney bought them worried they would bury them under rules but they've done a pretty good job so far.&&WHY DID THEY CHANGE MATH&&No I think that's the general consensus. The villain just wasnt as good this time around and the Mr. Incredible struggle was pretty funny and well done&&Also because it's a great father storyline. One that doesn't make him out to be a trope. I think most people found that refreshing.&&I enjoyed having Elastigirl front and centre, I certainly hope they follow up with movies for Violet and Dash following a theme of concentrating story on other family members.&&No, they dedicated a lot of screen time to it for a reason. It's a film about a superhero family - the family plotline is just as important as anything else..&&Edna was amazing as well. She killed every scene she was in.&&Same here &&Not really. I mean that was kind of the whole appeal of The Incredibles to begin with.  watching superhuman just be normal people. But what we got in the second one was kind of more of a traditional superhero story.&&The main plot was pretty much the same as the first movie, just role swapped and more epilepsy. The home life was hilarious and wholesome. &&No, that was by far the most interesting part of the story. We’ve seen superheroes fighting villains a billion times before. What we haven’t seen is a superhero trying to be a stay-at-home dad.

Similaly, I found one of the best parts to be when Elastigirl gets a phone call from Dash in the middle of a chase. The chase itself is uninteresting, but the addition of the phone call makes it fresh, funny, and relatable.&&I honestly thought the main plot was bad. Feel like it fell apart in the third act. I did enjoy the Mr. Incredible plot though.&&I found that part boring. I've seen that so many times. There are dozens of movies on this exact premise. The one with arnold, the one with vin deisel, the one with johnny cena. I'm thinking theres one with stalone as well and one of van damme too, but I might be wrong&&God I haven't seen it yet, my favorite part from the first one was when Bob breaks down about ""not being strong enough"" and finally breaking down to his family he's not strong enough to carry on without them.  Is there any scene's like that in this one?&&It was neither better nor worse, but somewhat different to the original, much more of a comedy. The story beats are quite similar but the humor was ramped up to 11 and I loved it. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much watching a movie, it was pure joy. It was the right approach, because I don't think they could've matched the drama of the first one as it would've become too overbearing for an animated film. 

People say it didn't need to exist and they're right. Just like I don't *need* ice cream yet I eat it with joy just the same.&&His giggle brings it home. Like a ""Well look at that!"" type of giggle.&&Not gonna lie, I had some goosebumps with how Elastagirl split the motorcycle in half and used the momentum to launch herself. Was an amazingly clever use of her superpower. &&>It was everything I wanted after 12 years and more.


Really? [Like I feel it was a good movie yes, but not ""we've been working on this for 12 years"" good. Screen Slaver was no where near as interesting as Syndrome, the family is split up for most of the movie (You know the movie about a superhero Family, you might want to see them all fight together... as a family) but instead of Mr. Incredible splitting off from the family to go to an island (as in the first one) it's Mrs. incred- oh, wait Elastigirl, (wouldn't want to ""reintroduce the world to the Super"" again with something wholesome, like a family, of supers.) going off to do her own thing.](#spoiler)&&Idk, I think the motorcycle chase with elastigirl was at least comparable. That was pretty intense.&&I honestly wasn't very impressed with it. 

It felt pretty derivative and had a lot of sequel problems, being both too much of a rehash and the new elements not really working with the themes of the first movie. &&Well it seems like I'm still looking forward seeing it... Premiere for Incrediblex is 31 august... sigh I hate the delayed release schedule Disney has for their animations here...&&14&&I think you can take Jurassic park and the phantom menace off that list as well because they needed 3-D rereleases to cross $1 billion.&&Also because of the international box office more than inflation&&The argument against that would be that if movies were cheaper people might go to those way more. For example if Infinity War was 6 € how it used to be when iwas a kid i woulda seen it 6-7 times. With prices how they are i won't go more than twice. This effectively shows how much a movie is ""worth"" to people rather than how many times they saw it. Seems fairer to me.&&There are a lot more factors that go into it than ticket price (as someone mentioned, cheaper tickets could have also pushed more people to the theaters which would increase the gross); I don't think either way of recording gross is necessarily superior. That said, worldwide grosses are basically impossible to estimate in terms of ticket sales. That's why you can't find any inflation-adjusted worldwide lists. Domestic sales are a lot easier to estimate in terms of ticket sales.&&There's way more competition to theatres these days.  Gone with the Wind was in theatres on and off for like 10 years to get the record to highest ticket sales, but that's because there was no other way to see it.  Star Wars IV did well in it's initial run, but was less than $1 billion adjusted for inflation in that run.  It made it's insane records due to its re-releases.

Today movies can be streamed online easily, purchased digitally or on disc relatively cheaply.  And there's so much more going on TV show wise, and with YouTube and other websites that fewer people want to go see movies.&&Also don't know about your city but all of Missouri pretty much has $5 movies Tuesdays and Thursdays and they get easily 50% of their business on these days. While inflation is present IMAX tickets were $12-15 in early 2000s when I first saw IMAX, and today the prices are still $12-15. Literally no change in 10 years where I live.&&https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jQyrEjAKaRs&&I knew it wasn’t just me! I’m like...damn.&&Anyone with a bubbly baby I'm sure was tickled by that. That was my and my wife's lasting impression for sure&&I feel the same way, the baby is perfect. &&Plus the jack Jack vs the raccoon was hilarious!&&I thought people wanted a good story?&&The ""Elastigirl gets hypnotized"" fetishists?&&Wreck-It Ralph ain’t Pixar&&And Ratatouille with that deep ending monologue&&Cars 2 was their peak /s&&I love the anti-piracy messages on DVDs and Blue Rays.  

""Don't steal this movie. ""

""I obviously didn't!""&&Often sites also report the adjusted for inflation number, which is a better mark of how many people saw it. &&The Bob stay-at-Home comedy was top notch. 

The raccoon fight, the Edna scene, Violet coming downstairs invisibly to grab ice cream, the diner scene. The whole theatre was hooting and hollering. 

The “main” plot was the cliche bad part. I thought the family stuff in the middle chunk of the film was tops. &&And the thighs of Mrs Incredible. &&The movie oozes with 1960s charm that's why I liked it. &&I watched the first Incredibles for the first time a couple days before seeing the second one, and I don't think I've ever had a movie so over-hyped for me in my life. I thought it was good, and very well-made, but I see people losing their minds over these movies and I don't quite get it. I guess nostalgia is just a hell of a drug.&&So ""they didn't manage to trick me"" = ""bad movie"" now?

How come being able to guess one or two things about the film takes away so much of the experience for you? Okay, so you figured out in advance who the villain was going to be. Did that really ruin the movie? I thought it was plenty fun figuring it out, and then watching with suspense hoping that Elastigirl would figure out out in time as well.

The lines were gold. The family was written rich with quality. The feel of the movie was true to the spirit of the first. Had a good balance of drama and comedy. Most of the movie had great pacing. They gave us all the characters we were hoping to see, including the government dude, Edna, and Frozone.

It was just fun. It did not have to change cinematic history by having the edgiest, most refreshing plot device in movie history to be just what it meant to be - fun.

I had fun watching it. I'm sorry you did not.&&> and I still can't see the infatuation Reddit has over it besides just outright nostalgia

All a movie needs to have Reddit circlejerk it is:

* Superheros

* Animation/heavy CGI

* ""Comedy"", except it's not really funny

* *le nostalgia*

* Some things aimed at children (legos, for example)&&Yeah but you're most likely an adult who has already watched lots of other movies. To young audiences things might not be as obvious as you perceived them&&I watched infinity war last night. I'm in the same boat as you.&&Such a shame, a USA mass release of a movie like that would only raise the bar of all anime.

Crazy how nature do dat.&&It's an annuity: one moderately successful movie whenever they want for however long they want.&&Considering 3 out of the 4 Star Wars movies they've released have grossed over a billion dollars each, I'm inclined to agree with you haha. &&Idk my one co-worker seems to think it's the worst thing ever and the only way to save the series is to scrap everything Disney has made, no female or minority leads, no backstories, old extended universe only. &&Personally, I thought they got it for a steal.&&The mouse will allow you to live.. for now.&&He's the [highest-grossing actor ever](https://www.statista.com/statistics/655480/all-time-top-grossing-actors-box-office/).

* Many (most?) of the MCU films
* Three *Star Wars* films
* Two Pixar films&&https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/worldwide/all-movies/cumulative/all-time-animated

Yeah. And ""The Secret Life of Pets"" -- seeing that as more successful than ""Coco"" or ""Inside Out"" seems wrong to me (we only rented Pets once then pretty much forgot about it, it was pretty average.) And ""Sing"" did well too, so I think Illumination has been lucky with all its releases so far.&&Because for some reason little kids absolutely love them and I seriously have no idea why. &&They were good in doses throughout the first movie, and honestly helped that movie be as good as it was. Then they cashed in on the merchandising and made them the focal point. Minions are not a focal point, they are the comics in the background and sometimes in the foreground.&&Illumination's model is cheap and quick by-the-numbers productions. They've basically replicated the same high energy, colorful movies with easily advertised mascots (the minions, bunny from pets, pig from sing, etc...), they are not as polished as pixar or ghibli but because they advertise like crazy all parents flock to their movies. Their model is very effective (even though I despise what it's done to animation as a whole).&&Spirit within was so good, and beautiful&&Spirit within was great though, and deserves to do good&&MATH, *IS*, ***MATH***!&&This got the biggest laugh from me as I have been through the exact same situation.&&I totally understand is complaint though. We keep trying to invent new ways to teach math with different goofy formulas and tactics what they never seem to do is actually teach the raw mathematics and understanding of how math works.&&Yeah I enjoyed the hell out of this movie but the first one was honestly perfect. And Syndrome was an amazing antagonist.&&I thought the villain was well done, but Syndrome just set the bar way too high.&&I agree fully. From  the trailers it looked like they were going to pull some bumbling Mr.  Mom bullshit but they handled Mr.  Incredibles  transition to home life realistically.&&I think the villain was fine, just... about as cliche as a superhero movie villain can get. I walked out of Incredibles 2 wanting to see Incredibles 3, mostly because Incredibles 2 decided to stay in first gear for so long (i.e. deal with the ""supers r bad"" thing the first movie implied was over and done with).&&I'm skeptical that's the general consensus. Both plot lines were interesting, Mr. incredibles was just funnier.&&The only parts that made me chuckle was Mr. Incredible being sardonic. The rest of the movie lacked the personality that I expected and was mostly a rehash of the first movie, down to the part where they literally went through Violet's arc again.&&I think it's just because the Segway between the 2nd and 3rd act where the villain is revealed just feels so sudden.&&Yes. It was so much more than the typical ""huhuhu I'm a goofy bumbling dad! I can't take care of my own children!""&&See? And I thought it did. &&> I enjoyed having Elastigirl front and centre

Me too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&&[We all did fam, we all did.](https://i.imgur.com/smpDuEu.gif)&&Does Edna eventually get her own film?&&The scene where Robert returns to pick up the baby and finds him to have adopted her mannerisms and walk is excellent.&&Edna's ""You are ELASTIGIRL! My GOD woman, pull yourself together!"" scene from the original is still one of the funniest things I've seen in most movies.

They way Edna say ""My GOD woman"" with her facial expression and her arms dropped at her side like she's holding something was just hilarious.&&> The chase itself is uninteresting,

A bike that splits itself in half and powered by the driver's elastic powers is uninteresting?&&When violet is comforting her dad telling him hes great&&As a dad, that scene chokes me up every timr&&Nope

It’s really not even close to the quality of the first. I mean it’s funny, but syndrome was a fantastic villain and the villain in this one wasn’t memorable at all except for one action scene. 

The first felt like a really well crafted spy/superhero movie while the new one feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. They even boasted about how long it took to make this one before the film started and how they hope it lives up to the wait and it really did not
&&I thought the plot was thinner and more predictable, but I enjoyed the character interactions more.&&Damn well i thought it was leagues worse than the original&&People will disagree with me,and that’s fine ,but I really did think this film was better than the first. 

I really do love how most of the film changes the dynamic by having the father stay home,and yes on the end,he does show up,but I kinda get the feeling (even though they were never gonna do it ) if they did keep him and the rest of the family out of the action ,people would’ve still complained. &&That's sold it am going to watch it thanks for this happy and positive review. All the very best for your day.&&The implications of a part 3 is much more important though, I would say. Even if the movie didn't exceed the original, it set up a whole world of possibilities if they do a 3rd movie because the heroes are reinstated back. It would be very interesting to see how people will start coping up with heroes being legal again, from both sides.&&I just gotta say that 3 runaway anythings is 2 too many runaway things for any movie. I mean... cmon.&&I loved jack jack scenes the most, he is so expressive and funny &&Yeah, while I was pretty disappointed with it and thought there was a lot of wasted potential; I’m absolutely looking forward to being able to double feature it alongside the first one with some friends!&&It is so perfectly the laugh of a ten year old realizing that he can run on water. It's so pure.&&The thing about the film being about family struggles is that they are trying to relate to one of the biggest struggles, absent parents. The first one is about a father who tries to take it all on himself to take care of the family while being worried about not being strong enough to take care of everything. It's a common fear for many dads.

Now that society has evolved and we have mothers leaving the home to take on the job as well, the sequel focuses on that aspect of the family struggle. How the dad copes with being the stay at home dad while the mother is absent and learning to enjoy her newfound freedom.

I get wanting to see the whole ""fight as a family"" argument, but I think they did a very good job of realistically portraying how a family deals with real life complications creating absences. &&She was always Elastigirl, she's only known as Mrs Incredible in merchandising due to a legal dispute&&I think your points are all valid. To push the idea of why they used Elastigirl as the leading super instead of the family as a whole, I would say it's because the implications of throwing the family back into the mix would cause more harm than good. Mr. Incredible isn't chosen [because of his brute force approach](#spoiler), but when [the family fights the Underminer, the entire family gets jailed and the kids are separated from their parents. Given that supers have a lot of stigma and the kids need to grow up anyways, selectively picking Elastigirl would be the smartest course of action while preserving the safety of the family.](#spoiler)&&My main beef with Screenslaver was the missed opportunity [to keep them closer to the moral highground. Rather than the casual disregard for life and consequences (lazy!) have Screensaver give the public impression of cartoon villainy, but as part of Helen's investigation discover that no loss of life resulted from them (maybe even have Evelyn explicitly mention the maglev scheme as the biggest risk in relying on Elastigirl to succeed, or show the train operator being 'woken' at the last second the engage the brakes). Shift their motivation away from a petty 'just ban supers again to spite my brother' to a more reasoned argument against giving them free reign. Maybe tie in an incident by one of the supers emboldened by Elastigirl's resurgence pushing things too far resulting in collateral damage.  
While Syndrome's actions were still cartoonishly villainous (they *are* after all cartoon villains) in wanting to profit in personal wealth and power from his inventions, the core conceit of ""when everyone is super, no-one will be"" can be argued to be a moral outcome. That the inventions could find their way into the hands of the malicious as well as the benevolent is no different than the demonstrated distribution of powers to both superheroes and supervillains.  Screensaver missed the opportunity to provide a similar moral ambiguity to their actions, an opportunity for ""you're wrong, but you raise a good point"".](#spoiler)&&That's the great thing about film. It's subjective.&&I think the Dark Knight too, it made 996 or something so they re-released it quickly to get it over the mark.

I don't blame them, they were agonisingly close and if any movie deserved what was an honour back then...&&>  i woulda seen it 6-7 times

How many times did you see it?&&On the other hand, it'd give an incentive to lower prices. &&It's in dollar movies now... I watched it for the first time over the weekend.&&It's kinda weird with all the kids there.&&Yo wtf &&Not *T H I C C* enough&&Is that not what they gave us?&&No, just Shadman.&&Yeah the Bob home stuff would've been great as a half hour 'episode' &&Racoon was good. Bob at home was ok but they completely undid all of the character progression he had from the first movie. Edna's bits felt like they were only included so they could bring back the character.&&I agree that the bits as they stand alone were excellent, but you used the word ""chunk"" when describing the family stuff and I think that captures why the movie didn't sit well with me. 

It felt like the family piece was a chunk of an unrelated movie. It didn't feel like it tied in with the main story arc at all. It felt like Bob trying to be a good father could have worked as a Pixar short where at the end he finds out he doesn't have to be perfect because his kids think he's super and then curtains. Instead it gets attached to the main plot where we get the ""Bob is a good dad moment"" followed by a ""by the way here is the rest of the movie and we need you guys to fight so forget that shit you were doing for the past hour"".

Felt like they had a lack of vision for this movie I guess. &&Edna felt a bit shoehorned in tbh, why would anyone even consider using her as a babysitter

was pretty funny tho&&I don't know why but when the giant baby part happened I just couldn't contain myself &&Reason enough to watch the movie right there.&&cant wait til shadman does his thing&&I missed the James Bond aesthetic the first film had, this one had more of a Metropolis feel to it which I didn't like as much&&The scene where Mr. and Mrs. Incredible sit in front of the motel pool after ""the incident"" had a good aesthetic. It was a slow moment (which was appreciated for this movie).&&The first Incredibles movie was like the go-to film to play in class when my teacher in high school  was feeling lazy. Saw it maybe 20 times in school before I hit senior year. It is a very well-made movie and it has it moments, but it didn't move me like other Pixar films and the ""action"" scenes were... Well, animated. Like you I just never got the hype.&&So I am not allowed to like movies that fit under any of those without being a part of a hivemind? That is too bad.&&What's coming next year? Avengers 4, Captain Marvel and Star Wars?

They’re still making it but it won’t be the same.&&Or maybe they make beautiful films and know how to market them. &&The secret life of pets had near perfect trailers for their target audience of families that love pets (which is like 99% of families lol).&&They're simpletons, do slapstick comedy and butt jokes, and speak in incomprehensible gibberish. That's like the ultimate combination for ""Oh my God this is hilarious!"" For kids. &&r/minionhate&&Slapstick comedy (defies language and thus appeals to children worldwide in a broad age range regardless of native language), super recognizable, adorable, brandable design with enough flexibility to have distinctive character silhouettes while keeping them all definitively ""Minion"", and their role as the comic relief in a film full of cool visuals and action means the kids develop positive associations with them wherever they see them, and since their scenes see so much repetition they become etched in the kids' minds.

Also note that their language isn't total gibberish.  A lot of Spanish syllable fragments and accented, quick pronunciation means they appeal to Latin American kids, children of LA immigrants, and kids around the world who enjoy the rhythmic cadence and usually festive tone of delivery in most of their ""dialogue"".

Also the lack of a distinct language means they don't need to worry about translation, meaning every audience sees the original performances and sound mix, fresh from Illumination's main team.  

Their design is frankly genius and they deserve every dollar they're earning.&&Well they’re more than likely not made for you. &&Little kids, and middle-aged women.&&minions are fucking hilarious my dude IDK how anybody could dislike them

they're like wacky sentient jellybeans, kids gotta love it. wacky yellow beans. super funny!  


and there's obviously a ton of sex appeal under the surface to keep the grown-ups entertained at the same time... like, it's definitely no Ewok, but can you honestly deny that those minions give you a wonderful little tingle every time they say ""banana""???? they're so yellow, and those goggles, and the perfect hair they all have it's like mmmmmm. and there's tons of variety between them, like some are really squat and some are taller, and some have one eye and some have two, and sometimes they dress up in wacky outfits, so there's gonna be something for you no matter what you're into!

personally I think Illumination deserves every penny they got out of the minions!!!&&one of their best selling toys is a fart cannon. you can guess the type of humor they strike a chord with. &&That was one of the best retro silver-age comic jokes they did. &&Too real&&That moment you go from simple addition and subtraction to algebra where they add both letters to the equations in combination with word problems.

First the joke in the movie is a reference to New Math from the 60s in response to the Cold War. I haven't really looked at New Math in a long while so I can't really comment on how different it's content is.

Today the ""new math"" is designed to have a greater focus on developing critical thinking skills at a younger age and not have be focused entirely on rote memorization. Most of the things now aren't about goofy formulas (most new programs should try to encourage multiple working algorithms, not any one specific one). And whole some places misinterpret the focus of the ""new math,"" young kids should still be expected to know their basic number facts. &&I tried teaching math the right way and my cousin was all, ""that's now how we were taught.""  The hell, what the fuck are schools doing?&&Syndrome was great for a lot of the same reason that Mr. Glass is great in Unbreakable. They're villains that perfectly understand what it means to be a hero, and have complete belief that what they're doing is the right thing. &&He was great because his story was meta, kinda like Watchmen but kid-friendly and not nihilistic as much. I think his character has only gotten better with age and he'd be even more popular now in an era where we have three-four superhero movies a year.

""You sly dog, you caught me monologuing."" So good.&&Yeah and not to mention he got lots of other superheroes dead. Hes definitely not powerless&&That's fair. You also have to consider that they were in a movie surrounded by absolute 10/10 characters, so anything short of that is definitely going to stick out a bit.&&I'm curious as to why you think that. I personally found the villain to be pretty weak and saw the twist coming from a mile away&&I'm just thinking that Jack Jack showed they started parenthood on hard mode. Imagine your first kid being a baby who turns invisible? Or makes a force field while you are still pregnant with the kid (wow, it's a good thing her mom is Elastigirl)? Or a second kid who as a toddler learning to walk, probably ran across the city?&&Elastigirl had one too many encounters. First a train. Then a helicopter. Then a direct assault. The train and the helicopter scene needed to be merged, or else the heli and the direct assault did.

First gear was good, but you already said it - they stayed there too long.

I still like both the movie and the villain. Whole thing was wonderfully done. It was just up against part 1; it never had a chance.&&Didn't even chuckle at the guy being asked if he can uncrush things?&&Not even Dash at the restaurant enjoying  his 'delicious tap' got a chuckle?&&Except they didnt &&Calm down Goku&&It would have to be a prequel to the first Incredibles.&&The whole theater broke out in laughter during that scene. It was amazing
&&*super &&I'm still mad that she didn't say hes incredible instead for the flavor win. ):&&I get that it's not *as* impactful as the scene in the first movie but [the scene where Bob confesses to Violet that he's struggling is a great scene and I think would definitely apply to that guy's question.](#spoiler)&&The Crusher guy looks like a Fortnite reject&&Syndrome is comparable to Loki in how memorable he is. Screenslaver is like the dark elf in Thor 2. &&the action scene was really fucking great though, probably ties with the throne room battle in TLJ as my favorite action scene I've seen this year. Probably helps that I saw it in 3d, it was a fucking great time.&&You pretty much nailed it. If they do a third it should be some time later when the kids are a bit more grown up, so it can be about how they deal with the kids moving out and establishing their own identities.&&I wouldn't say Syndrome was a fantastic villain by any stretch, but this villain was certainly much less interesting.&&The plot was incredibly predictable. The two of them walked onto the screen and gave their spiels. I immediately called what was going to happen from there. The thing is there was no attempt at a misdirect or anything.&&The villain and plot were derivative. 

The first one’s villain tied into the struggle of the protagonists. This second one has those things completely separate. The villains motivation is instead topical meta-commentary but beating the Screenslaver does not aid the resolution of the family’s internal struggles. 

The best part of the movie was Bob staying at home by far. The action was good but it lacked any higher purpose. &&For me the 14 year gap really made it suffer in that I expected so much more. If it came out like 2 or 3 years after the original it would’ve been fine, but 14 years created way too much expectation, and I think it’s fair. One would think that releasing a sequel 14 years after the original would mean that they’ve finally created this amazing idea after brainstorming for so long, and it just wasn’t. It didn’t need to exist. What did it add that we needed to see? Jack Jack’s powers being realized by the family was great aaaand.. that’s about it in my opinion. The Underminer fight was good and it was the perfect opening, but we really didn’t need to see it. There was no story to continue/wrap up, like let’s say Andy going to college and moving on in Toy Story 3. I wish they did a time skip, partly so that we could’ve aged with the characters and it’d be like catching up with old friends. I think that’s very effective when done right.

All in all, I’m surprised it got the overwhelmingly positive response that it got. Bummer.

Edit: Bummer that the movie was disappointing, not that people liked it.&&The animation, music and action was incredible. However I hated the majority of the movie, simply cause i held the first one to such a high standard. &&I thought it was too much like the original to be considered an improvement. &&Yup. Kind if surprised it's getting the high marks we're seeing. &&It really felt like they tried a few different things and wanted to give up, but had too much invested to stop. What were they going to do? ""Sorry, after more than a decade and all this money spent it looks like we won't actually release the movie.""

There was very little character development. We didn't meet anyone new that could advance the story. The family was more concerned about external struggles than getting their own stuff together.

What's next? The family goes through a divorce, the kids get even more edgy, and we find another bad guy that seems to be an afterthought stapled on to the plot?

Heck, if the entire movie was little more than the parents hashing out their issues at home that would have been 100% cool. ""12 angry men"" is one of my favorite movies and it takes place in its entirety in a single room. 

I would rather they gave the movie another decade to come up with something to be proud of, instead of something that felt like they were cutting their losses. &&You're welcome, I hope you have a great time at the cinema.&&This is true and thinking back on most of my little issues with the movie, the family fighting together issue is lower on the list.&&I disagree. I think that opportunity was definitely there, and the message was permeated through the film much more than was done with Syndrome.

First, >!the ""Screenslaver"" persona has the rather controversial anarchist message that we are drones to capitalism, that (and I quote) ""...Every meaningful experience must be packaged and delivered to you to watch at a distance so that you can remain ever sheltered, ever ravenous consumers.""!<

But more importantly, the main motive of the villain, the one that I said was sprinkled throughout the film>!, is that Superheroes are damaging to society - a moral dilemma touched on by other films such as Marvel's Civil War too, that Superheroes are dangerous. The opening scenes of the film make it quite clear that Supers do more harm than good, and its brought up again with the Devers' parents' deaths. Evelyn Dever makes it clear she holds this belief and is doing what she must to ensure nobody has to unnecessarily die.!<&&>!a revelation to elastigirl that there had been nobody hurt during the screenslaver ""events"" JUST before having her perform a PR move where she went to visit someone in the hospital that was hurt by her as collateral damage during one of the screenslaver events could have been on par with the ""i'm not strong enough"" scene.!<

imo.&&What's the point of comments like these? Literally nobody said it wasn't.&&Yeah, I get that. I was hoping to hear something they had to say in return about it.&&That doesn't make *you* right.&&18 .&&This is for the kids! You can tell they love it.&&No

It was extraordinarily predictable with very few interesting scenes and a lot less depth than the original&&It was decent at best. The original had a really good balance of extraordinary hero stuff blended with regular family stuff. This movie had both of those things but they were so far removed it felt like two different movies. &&No. The plot was worse than the original. Considering they had 12 years to think it over, it was underwhelming. &&>shadman.jpg&&> Bob at home was ok but they completely undid all of the character progression he had from the first movie. 

They may have undid it, but they made it very visible that being a stay at home dad wasn’t what Bob wanted at all. They showed that he struggled hard to accept that he should be happy and proud of his wife for kickin crime, when that’s all he wanted for himself and got sidelined. Especially since it wasn’t even a week after the timeline of the first film, Bob had a rush of what superhero life was like before going into hiding, so it was a hard thing for him to accept so abruptly &&> Edna's bits felt like they were only included so they could bring back the character.

TBH, as someone who went to this movie expecting nostalgia fanservice, I couldn't've asked for better.&&Undoing the lessons learned in the first movie is a pixar staple, though. Look at the *Cars* franchise. In all 3 movies, Lightning learns to stop being an egocentric asshole. &&>why would anyone even consider using her as a babysitter

Because she has all the technology needed to handle a Super baby? She also doesn't really work so has free time. Frozone is the only other person who knows they're super, so it's not like the options were big.&&Superman's Metropolis or Metropolis the 1927 silent sci-fi film?&&It appealed heavily to the ""functional disfunctional family"", which I think a huge demographic group of people identify with.  It also nailed an authentic, nostalgic superhero/comic book vibe.  Between those two interest groups and their huge overlap it was a spectacular story for many.  But I think it wouldn't resonate the same way for people whose childhood was not as defined by such interests/experiences.

Also if I watched any film 20+ times in the same year I would hate it no matter what.&&Lion King, Toy story 4, Aladdin, Dumbo and Spiderman 2 too&&Avengers 4 is going to do so massive I can't even imagine. &&Gambit isn’t happening, and no way in hell Dark Phoenix hits a billion. I really don’t think Dark Phoenix is gonna do so hot.&&To be fair gambit has been ""coming out"" since like 2010.  I've lost hope in that picture until I see a trailer.&&> Gambit

Yeah, there's no way that's going to be 2019.&&And Monty Python and the holy grail's Black Knight, and Benito Mussolini, and the Blue Meanie and Cowboy Curtis and Jambie the Genie!&&Spider-Man’s profits should go to Sony.

Gambit isn’t going to be made lol.&&There's a Frozen 2? My 4 year old is still semi obsessed with Let it Go. Why are they making another Toy Story, the third film was like a perfect end to the series.&&WAIT THE'RE DOING A NEW ALLADIN&&I think this period will be remebered as the disney green age, when they were making ridicolous ammounts of money and almost monopolizing box offices&&Judging by Disney's recent history, perhaps they will make Avatar - StarWars crossover, directed by Michael Bay.&&John Carter was fun.&&At least each of those is an interesting failure though.&&OK, 2 of those were from the failed ""let's move Pixar's best directors away from Pixar and have them direct live-action movies for a change"" years. I hope they learned from that.&&First of all, I really liked John Carter and thought it was a solid film. Definitely wanted to see a sequel. Second of all, naming 3 mediocre movies, out of the plethora of really good movies Disney has put out, doesn’t mean that OPs statement is any less true.  They didn’t say every movie Disney makes is great; just that they are really good at making great movies. &&Tomorrowland was a fun romp.&&The thing is, none of those are *bad* movies. They’re interesting, well-executed movies that never found a strong audience. Weird sci-fi based off a book from the 1900s, weird sci-fi based off a theme park ride, and weird sci-fi based off a book from the 1960s are all interesting gambits, but not particularly profitable ones. They’re not trash by any stretch of the imagination, though. &&I liked Wrinkle in Time. It wasn't for me but I liked it.&&I really like John Carter.  

You forgot:  
Mars Needs Moms  
Lone Ranger  
Home on the Range&&A stinkle in time.&&Was AWIT a turd? Didn't see it but wanted to. &&I liked John Carter.&&I think it’s true though. Maybe in 2010 the justice league would’ve been a big hit. The standard for these movies keep increasing. The Antman and the wasp wasn’t that greatly received even though it was pretty similar in formula with the original antman. I don’t know if Disney can keep finding people like Watiti to breathe new life into things people are tired of either. What I’m trying to say is they can’t make any Thor dark worlds, iron man 2s, age of ultrons and  have audiences happy with it any longer.&&[deleted]&&Nah pretty shit, hasnt grown much at all this year, like so much less than just even an average index fund.

So there's a new approach to help them learn math organically and to show that there's more than one way to the answer - which is what college-level math wants people to know more than to turn them into obsolete calculators.&&He also had one of the most memeable lines ever in ""You sly dog, you had me monologuing!""&&I feel like that’s slightly debatable for Mr Glass. His reasons for finding a real life hero were very much for his own insecurities and wanting a purpose. If anything he had complete belief it was the right thing **for him**.  Mr glass doesn’t seem to give a rats ass about anyone else as long as he has confirmation that he was meant to be a super villain.&&Mr. Glass is pretty great in the Incredibles.&&Honestly so many quotables from the original movie. &&I think the twist was predicable as hell, but the character itself was fine. I was hoping that the villain was not going to be obvious and be some... third party or something. But then it fell into the cliche.&&Can you unpunch something? &&Did he do that too? Otherwise that was Bob's line.&&Yeah they avoid using the word a lot, that moment would’ve been the best time&&It was implied. You were meant to think it.&&That is what I was about to rebut with. Thank you.&&Which sucks for them because they definitely thought of that before Fortnite was released.&&You're making me wonder if I've seen Thor 2, so I guess that's right on track. &&lol, to demonstrate your point: I spent a moment thinking ""wait, there was a dark elf in a thor movie?""  &&I don't think the villain was THAT bad. In the very least, I think the methods of the Screen Slaver were pretty cool, and that makes the character memorable in my opinion. 

With Thor 2, I struggle to give a single plot point from that entire movie, let alone from the villain. Thor 2 was just not a great movie. &&Screenslaver is like Ultron, cool and intimidating in the moment but we all know she’s gonna lose, making her ultimately forgettable.&&The throne room scene in TLJ was a Power Rangers Fight.&&Yeah it was weird. When the two siblings came in I thought ""Ok, they know we've seen the first movie so they know we're expecting one of these guys to be the villain. I wonder how they'll twist it.""  


>!But they didn't.!<&&I disagree. The first movie ends with most of the family strife being resolved. This movie was more about preying on the parent's (and other supers) desire to make heroes legal again so their kids could have a better life, and reinforcing that the Parr's are a team. The struggle was more external, than internal division of the family. 

Rehashing the family divided by a villain again would feel derivative to me. &&On top of that, they basically played the exact same action sequence three times.

They have the heroes catching/stopping a runaway vehicle 3 times:

1. The underminer's drill.

2. The train.

3. The boat.

Every single one was basically ""oh no, will this speeding vehicle crash into this crowded location and cause catastrophic damage??

And each time you pretty much know that it won't.&&spot on, it all felt obligatory, like we had this chill family comedy and they remembered they needed someone to beat up at the end&&Great analysis, you should write reviews.&&I was really surprised to see no time skip. 

In a way I felt like it was the exact same plot and they contrived a step back to make it the same plot.

Seems like by the end of the first film they'd decided that people were cool with super hero's being out and about so long as there was a super villain causing havoc. 

Then it was established in this film that no, not under any circumstances were super hero's allowed. 

So we're back to hero's stuck at home not allowed to do anything. 1 parent goes out to work for a super rich organisation. Turns out that the bad guy was the (co-)head of the organisation and captures that parent. Kids are needed to spring into action to turn the tables to save the day. 

There was feminist re-colourings of the various plot points which I quite liked but I came out feeling like I'd watched the same film.&&The plot was a real letdown. Everything else was fantastic.&&this, it felt like the first one but it didn't have ""dash running through the water"" scenes (barring the fight scene in the little room with the flash lights).&&I agree with all your points. You could see Screenslaver coming from a mile away. This Disney trope where the villain is revealed to be one of the good guys 2/3s through the film really hurts the films overall quality. It’s lazy and it leaves no room for the villains character to develop past “Haha I’m evil for reasons, I bet you didn’t see that coming.” And it’s a damn shame because all they had to do was make the Underminer the main bad and it could’ve been great. He was more interesting in the first ten minutes of the movie for Christ’s sake. &&[deleted]&&Dude for real?&&The surprise villain twist is getting really, really, old. &&That seems unfair considering that the first movie was incredibly predictable also.&&I disagree.  I thought it was as good as the original.&&> feels shad man&&I think the stadium scene was 3 months after the first movie’s events but yeah this movie took place over the course of about a week.&&Spiderman Isn't owned by disney though, its owned by Sony.  They just rent him out to Marvel for the Avengers films. &&Dumbo and Spiderman 2? What a weird crossover.&&We really need moviepass to survive!&&Don't forget Live-Action remake of Lady and the Tramp and Sword in the Stone for Disney's Streaming Service.&&I think it's a bit odd that Disney placed Dumbo in the same month of Captain Marvel, Aladdin in the same month as Avengers 4, and Spider-Man 2 in the same month as The Lion King.  There's no breathing room and as a result they're constantly competing with themselves.

Also I'm still confused why they're making a movie on a Disneyland ride starring the Rock&&Toy story 4?? What? Why and how? And Aladdin and lion king and dumbo? They’re remaking them??? I guess hollywood remakes old hits for each new generation&&Wait whaaaaaat Aladdin & lion king??? Remakes?!??

The Incredibles is clearly styled as mid century retro.&&Yes now I remember reading about the set theory aspect of it. From what I can also recall, the whole point of New Math was in reaction to the Cold War and the  USSR's success in their space program.&&It was pretty eye-opening going into my college calculus class with a well-revered professor (quite popular in her field) and she told us how she ""gets shit wrong all the time"" and hates arithmetic. That was when I realized being a human calculator isn't a pre-requesite for math. 

Honestly, we should just give every student a calculator as soon as they learn the basics. Way too much time is spent on arithmetic in grade school and it's a huge waste of time. It's prone to errors and takes away from understanding *real* mathematics. &&In turn though, they don't understand WHY they are doing these calculations.  Only how to arrive at the answer given a formula.  It's why a lot of people get the simple age math problem wrong.  It's also why you get a lot of those boyfriends asking girlfriends how long it takes to get to a place 45 miles away if they are travelling 45 miles an hour.

I understand the way of rote learning is boring as fuck, but that just means you have to get a teacher that lays it out in different ways to make it interesting.&&- When the suicide hotline gets you to keep talking about your life story to stop you from killing yourself&&I was at least really glad that they didn’t make the Bob Odenkirk character to be the bad guy because he would have been even more predictable.&&Maybe, but there was a huge re-write like 9 months from release, so who knows&&I forgot I’d seen Thor 2 five mins after it ended. &&I only just watched it a couple months ago. It was pretty much the only MCU movie I hadn't seen because I heard less than stellar reviews of it while in theatres but finally decided to watch it when I (almost sadly) realized that it was the only movie of that massive franchise I'd never seen and it turned out pretty meh. Not bad so didn't regret but it wasn't anything to write home about. &&The only reason I remember thor2 is because of the avengers alliance Facebook game I was playing back then &&You're definitely not wrong but that's because star wars always mixed that bit of old school martial arts with the older school Three Musketeers fencing. Lots of swashbuckling with crazy flips and rolls.&&I think the way they were trying to twist it was [making it seem like the brother was going to be the villain, but he was actually genuine, and the cool, techy sister was the evil one.](#spoiler) Still kinda predictable tho.&&If these were supposed to be plot twists (but not really) I think there are 2 points.  
One is if that guy >!was working together with the girl and sabotaging the train was his plan while the girl provides the tech!<.  
Second is that these >!convenient timing of Screenslaver attacks were ultimately meant to illegalize the heroes, not help them!<.&&I’m not saying they should have the same conflict. But the screenslaver’s mantra was not actually related to the manipulation of the parents. 

So on one side you had “I want to make the world better for my children” and on the other you had “modern society is weak and lazy and I arrived at this conclusion because my father died and he relied on supers?”  It’s a weak connection between motivations compared to the first film. 

There are certainly ways to bridge that gap that don’t involve rehashing. &&I'm okay with that.  It just has to be believable how it's stopped.  Doing things for shock value is the worst way to go.&&So what if they're similar? The display of powers were cool and so creative.  
And why ignore the Raccoon fight, Screenslaver tracking and fight, house fight? And most of the boat stuff was about saving the heroes and catching Evelyn, stopping the boat was just a small end bit.&&Those are all good observations. I didn’t make those connections. Man, I’d love to sit down with Brad Bird and hear him explain how this differed enough from the first to follow through on. It almost seems like they didn’t want to make it, but were so tired of all the fan outcry for it that they just threw something quick together, story-wise. Like, “If they liked the first one, fuck it, give it to ‘em again. Change some stuff to distract them though.” I liked Helen/Elastigirl being the action focal point this time, too, but when you realize that it didn’t really add anything to the story (did Bob learning how to parent really matter enough to make a movie-long arc out of for a movie that was wanted for 14 years?), and it’s actually a recycling of Bob’s role in the first one, it really diminishes it. The more I think about it the more of a mess it appears to be 😕&&Like how Dr. Horrible got into the Evil League of Evil and it only cost any joy of his life and the life of the only woman he ever loved? 

I hope that sequel gets made...
&&Can’t get old when it wasn’t a surprise. 

Also can’t be a good villain when the villain’s motivation has nothing to do with the family’s struggles. You know, like *the first film*.   

Blows my mind it took this long to make a movie and they missed that huge aspect of what made the first one great. You can’t have a great movie where the villain is just slapped on because “well shit we need a villain”. &&I'm really tired of the ""well off kid invents something that people can't imagine exists"" technologist. They are ALWAYS the villain. &&But it's not old to the little kids who watched it.

But I wouldn't doubt that you're right.&&> Dark Phoenix

*IF* it's a good movie, it will have a tremendous box office. But with the latest X-men movies that's a huge if haha.&&Isn't Spider-Man still the biggest seller for merch?

That tiny robot girl though, god damn, she was an amazing actress. I kept forgetting that she wasn't George Clooney's age.&&“They won’t see bad movies regardless of genre”

The *Transformers* franchise would like a word with you...&&And my point is they used to go regardless of it was good or bad in the past because it was new. Now the standard is raised and people expect more for their money that alone is evidence of fatigue of a genre. The superhero plot itself isn’t enough any longer.&&I did forget that, but now imdb reminds me she voiced the teenage porcupine character who sang something I had forgotten about during the final talent show.

I know ScarJo's a singer, though, I remember the song she sang in ""The Jungle Book."" (It's actually a shame the snake's song ""Trust in Me"" only came in the close credits; that movie could have used a third song so the singing giant ape didn't seem so out-of-place.)&&There's somewhere farther to go?

I only saw Thor 3. &&But she's immediately introduced as the techie one and I mean...screensaver and all that. &&I honestly think from this angle casting Bob odenkirk was pretty deliberate. I mean I heard his voice and immediately thought ""Saul Goodman!!!"" Who is kind of a slimy character, and even though he's never really the villian he's not really a beacon of morality. It kinda was a subconscious thing but I definitely thought he was the villian for awhile and that might've contributed.

Or I'm reading way to far into it.&&Did you even bother to watch her little speech when the character is first revealed? [She obviously recognized modern society was weak and lazy because of their reliance on technology. That reliance makes society weak, and if you're weak you rely on supers to save you. No supers means no choice but to break free from your trance and become more independent.](#spoiler)&&The villains plan was literally to keep superheroes illegal.&&I don’t *know* this to be true but I do know a lot about the parties involved in making this and I know what I saw on the screen so allow me to pontificate and present a theory:

Let’s begin by acknowledging Brad Bird is a libertarian type and actually kinda a closet objectivist. He’s been questioned about this and he acknowledges it but kinda shuts down further discussion by saying “yeah I had an objectivist phase”. However, those themes are all over The Incredibles and Ratatouille. In Hollywood you can’t let people know you aren’t drinking the leftist kool-aide without ramifications.

A few things have changed since the first film released. One, Pixar was still a separate entity from Disney and they essentially had autonomy. There was no decision making by committee in the way Disney runs their operation. If Lassiter hired Bird to do a movie, it’s because he trusted his vision. 

Bird has said he’d only do this movie if he had a real reason to tell the story. As has been pointed out, this movie - while very entertaining - didn’t need to be made. I think you’re right about the public demand and the obvious decision it would have been to the board at Disney. I think there’s a good chance Bird went so long without making one was in part because the right idea for a script didn’t come along and possibly in part because of the changing atmosphere at Disney and Hollywood/society at large. He may have known he wouldn’t be able to hit the same thematic beats anymore with Disney calling the shots. Stuff like “if everyone’s super, nobody is super” or “we keep finding new ways of celebrating mediocrity”. Watching incredibles 2, it actually felt schizophrenic at times. The message of the movie seemed to be at odds with itself. There were some shoehorned feeling feminist beats that at other times is pushed back against.

Bird is one of my favorite directors and I know his style and tone. This movie did not feel like he was calling all the shots.



&&I'm starting to see the Disney Sequel formula. Toy Story 3 is praised by everyone, and I really like it too, but it is extremely similar to Toy Story 2. I think a lot of the disney sequels are relying on the nostaligia and popularity of the first movies, that they completely ignore the things that made the first movies special. &&so many capeshit movies are guilty of this and it's shit every time&&http://collider.com/spider-man-marvel-sony-deal-explained/#mcu


From the article:

Producer Amy Pascal, who at the time was the head of Sony Pictures, was able to strike an unprecedented deal with Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige to share the character of Spider-Man. After lengthy discussions, they agreed to move ahead with a new reboot, although this time things would be different. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still financed and distributed by Sony Pictures (i.e. they pay for 100% of it), and Sony gets the box office, but Marvel Studios produced the film and served as the “creative lead.” That means Feige and the Marvel Studios braintrust helped pick the director and cast, helped craft the film’s tone and style, and made sure to bring something fresh and new to character that audiences are already very familiar with. In short, they made a Marvel Studios Spider-Man movie.

So what does Marvel Studios get in return out of this deal? Besides getting to play with a toy they’ve been eyeing for a very long time now, they get to use Tom Holland’s Peter Parker in a set number of MCU movies (five in total, per this initial agreement, including Homecoming and its sequel). That means that Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place within the same Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Strange and Iron Man, and Holland’s Peter Parker—after making his debut in Captain America: Civil War—is appearing alongside folks like Tony Stark and Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers 4.

While Marvel Studios doesn’t get any box office from Spider-Man: Homecoming and its sequel, they do still own the merchandising rights to Spider-Man and thus if Homecoming is a success, that’ll no doubt extend to the toys, underoos, and other Spider-Man products available. Moreover, ensuring Spider-Man: Homecoming is a good movie helps the MCU brand—if folks like this Peter Parker, they’re going to want to see him in Infinity War and whatever other MCU movies he’s in.

The current, complicated deal that was struck between Marvel, Sony, and Disney (which owns Marvel) is at present only for Spider-Man: Homecoming, its sequel, Civil War, and the two Avengers movies. If all goes well, they’ll come back to the table and renegotiate to keep this going. Or it’s possible that Sony says “we’ll take it from here” and Peter Parker disappears from the MCU altogether.

It’s a bummer because McAvoy and Fassbender are so fantastic as younger Prof. X and Magneto 😕&&I know, and Dark Phoenix is one of the coolest X-Men stories also. I hope it doesn’t suck.&&Logan was killer though&&Apocalypse has been the only bad X-men movie since Origins though.  The franchise is hardly in a rut.&&I'm basically 30 with no kids ha I just got stoned and wanted to time travel.&&I mean, Transformers saw a huge dive with The Last Knight. It's box office was nearly half of what Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction made at the box office ($600 mil vs $1.1 billion). Not necessarily a flop, but definitely a bad sign when it was also a $100 million less than the first one.

I've heard they've pulled Transformers 6 off their release schedule, and basically have it on ice. If Bumblebee doesn't do well, it seems like the franchise could be in significant trouble.&&But that’s not superhero fatigue.

Superhero fatigue would mean the entire genre is suffering. Infinity War just made $2 *billion*&&She has a whole album online too.

There is next to no fundamental originality in blockbusters anymore. It’s why we’re in the golden age of television. &&Toy Story 3 at least made me feel something, even if it was derivative. That furnace scene is heavy as shit and way more bold than any scene in the Incredibles 2&&They make over a billion a year off Spider-Man merch alone.

Thank you kind internet person for your clever humor xoxo one love ❤️ &&Not really that crazy when you remember that Titanic was in theaters seemingly forever, like almost all of 98.

Really fucked up. &&Are you talking about the house the Incredibles stay in? Because they show Elastigirl using an a secret exit in her Elasticycle.&&You’re right, IMO the MCU has killed blockbusters. They’re all so bland nowadays. It’s gotten to the point where I just follow a few select directors (plus Ethan Hawke because he’s somehow always in solid movies)&&It also will just generate more sales for the various Spider-man comics. And then they've got things like Into the Spider-verse coming to also capitalize on it. Not that people need much incentive to get into Spider-man, but I'm sure it helps.&&I agree, this does seem possible.&&Don't mess with the mouse. &&""Thank you for the meal and the very pleasant evening.

I love you and hope life is great!&&I'd be surprised if we don't see an Infinity War/A4 double release.&&It's still pretty crazy looking at boxofficemojo how solid it was for months and months and months. There will never be a film like that in history. 

These modern blockbusters storm out to massive numbers in the first two weeks then by week three drop to the numbers Titanic was doing three months into its run. &&That's extreme unusual, it must have been a second run discount theatre as Titanic dropped from 3000 to 500 in the summer and then to just a couple dozen in the fall. &&DoFP is the highlight of the new X-Men (aside from Logan of course), but they keep fucking it up!&&That's fair. I'm definitely not arguing that people won't go see bad movies. I'm more arguing that they aren't sustainable.

As in I doubt we're going to be seeing 20 Transformer movies...

Six movies is an outstanding success for most franchises in most genres. But superhero movies have longer-term goals with their universes, and churning out bad movies isn't sufficient for that.

The MCU never would have made it to 20 movies if most people considered them bad. X-Men has been rocky, they needed a few soft reboots, but they'll make it to 13. The DCEU has already gotten to 5 movies, with only 1 that's been widely considered good. They may not make it past 8 if Aquaman and Shazam suck (although Wonder Woman seems pretty likely to get a full trilogy). Sony's Spider-Man universe fell apart after two movies.

The MCU changed the goalposts of what studios want to accomplish. Especially with superheroes, but it's not limited to that. They all want that 20+ run of success, but churning out shitty movies like the Mummy definitely isn't going to get them there.

It's more in that long-term outlook that I partially agree with the person you responded to. (I also think competition plays a big role in that: giant robots smashing shit aren't common, so Transformers doesn't have all that much competition, whereas there's quite a few  options if you want to watch a superhero movie these days - meaning quality plays a heavier role in what people watch.)&&",2018-07-31 12:11:36

In 2002, she contributed to a study on memory called ""Frontal lobe activation during object permanence: data from near-infrared spectroscopy"" during her psychology studies at Harvard.

In 2003, Portman graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in psychology.""

And this wasn't a green astronaut who had just made selection and was in training, she had already flown on the space shuttle. Somehow she made it past NASA's psych evals and went into space.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

> Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

> The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

> It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

I tend to consider phd’s scientists. Hence MD/PHD’s being *physician scientists* and people who graduate as engineers being distinguished as engineers rather than scientists.

But then again last time there was a guitar around a campfire, we had the wannabe hippie playing The Times They are a Changin’.  Apparently he was not amused by me borrowing the guitar to play One Last Caress.&&That's the thing. I don't even consider them to be a hippie band. They were more of a punk/ska band then a hippie band. Outside of a few songs (mostly the songs played on the radio), they really don't sound like a hippie jam band. Brad Nowell and the rest of the band were huge hip hop and punk heads. They toured and played shows with punk bands. They covered a ton of a punk/hardcore songs. Before they were signed to a major label, nearly all of their material was recorded/produced in a DIY ethic. Even the break through self titled album was produced by the dude from the Butthole Surfers. They just became co-opted by the hippie and frat boy party scene after he died. Sublime was and will always be a punk band at it's core.

I guess this is my main point too. They are definetly over hyped and over played when it comes to that modern frat bro/neo hippie demographic. But then if you look past the surface and really listen to their albums, they had a style and sound that goes way past what their modern fan base is into/thinks of them. They were a totally DIY, underground band that threw all these music styles together into some totally fresh and new (at least at the time). I would be a millionaire if I had 5 cents for every time I met some body who said they were a huge Sublime fan but never listened to 40 oz to Freedom or Robbin the Hood all the way through (or knew about their cover of We Are Only Gonna Die for Our Own Arrogance,   New Trash, KRS-One, Pool Shark or any of the other great songs they did). It seems like the fan base they largely have now (the ones that Sublime + Rome play too) is a whole lot different than the grimey basement shows they were playing back in the early 90s.&&Don't get me wrong, Sublime has been a massively successful band, but the fan base they have now and what they are most well known for, is very different than the music scene they came out of and the bands they were influenced by. Their hit songs (What I Got, Santeria, Wrong Way, Doin' Time, Smoke Two Joints, Date Rape) have been sorta co-opted by this newer fan base that is made up of neo hippies and frat boys. They have these huge hit songs, but their best material is within their deep cuts on albums like 40 oz to Freedom and Robbin the Hood. You gotta remember, that Bradley never saw any of that real success. He died right before their self titled album was released and never got the chance to enjoy the fruits of their labor that they received after constantly touring small venues/basements/punk venues or struggling to find opportunities where they could use equipment to record their songs. Even their biggest tour before he passed, the very first Warped Tour, ended in disaster when they were kicked off the tour after Bradley's dog bit an attendee that was fucking with him. They had a die hard cult fan base before he died (a big part of the reason why they were even signed, it was mostly due to word of mouth) but it was nothing like what it is now (which mostly came about because Bradley died). Dude was really struggling with life up to that point, he felt like he was failing as a father and musician, even getting to the point where he had to pawn his guitar just to make sure he could make his ends meet and support his habit. 

It sucks when I hear people put down Sublime as being some one note feel good California band because they have only heard those big songs on the radio. If you listen to the rest of their material, they have such a diverse range of music styles, themes (both fun and upbeat, along with sad, depressing and contemplative) and topics that they cover. An album like 40 oz to Freedom is a DIY masterpiece, 23 songs put together in a college recording studio that they had to sneak in and record through the middle of the night just to be able to get the chance to get the songs down on tape. There is Robbin the Hood, which was largely recorded in a crack house alone by Bradley Nowell on a cheap 4 track portastudio while he was on a drug binge. These albums are covered in absolute gems of songs that constantly get over looked in favor of their feel good pop hits like What I Got. The band's material is so much deeper than that. The band and their fan base was a lot different while he was alive compared to what they are now. If you were to ask Brad back then what kind of band they were, he would of told you that they were a  DIY ska punk band. They came out of a punk scene that nurtured their style. No one ever talks about that kind of stuff anymore, the amount of effort him and the rest of the band put into their music just to make it happen. It sucks when you talk to someone and they either ""love"" Sublime because of those huge hits that came after he died or they hate the band because they think that's all Sublime had to offer. &&Oh shit holy nostalgia alert&&Props to that website for putting all 50 on the same page and not some slide show bullshit.&&We were so preoccupied looking for the deep state we never thought it'd be deep space. &&Astronaut love triangle that happened in the mid 2000’s.&&First time I shit myself as an adult was a bottle of wine and laughing too hard at Parks and Recreation.

- someone I do not like says something racy : ""holy shit burn this motherfucker to the ground and anyone who likes them! only reasonable thing to do - we must send a message.  zero tolerance""

-----&&This is a really good article.  Especially this quote:

>To demand that every artist who works for you to have never had a past, to have never had jagged edges that have been sanded over time, is asking for people who will make boring art.

I hope Disney takes note of how many celebrities and journalists (as well as the public) are coming out against them and in support of James Gunn.&&Political correctness is a bitch. Free speech advocates have repeatedly pointed out the whole ""Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences"" mantra is a double edge sword and is giving power to mega corporations to control speech. The mob always seems great until it turns on you.&&Well this is the aftermath of the outrage culture Hollywood helped perpetuate, reap what you sow &&Why anyone uses Twitter is beyond me. It's a cesspool.&&I think the big take away from this is Twitter is garbage and no one should use it. &&What hurts Hollywood is all the fucking pedos roaming around. Gunn may very well be innocent but within the context of the industry “jokes” like this don’t go over well &&I'm not a very emotional guy and also not into PC but after reading some of his tweets I'm just thinking ""Wtf were you expecting, James Gunn"". As good as his movies are, you have to be a very special kind of stupid to take a so stupid and so big risk like that. &&I like his movies and I'm on his ""side"" politically but the mental gymnastics on this are mind boggling to me. Even if it was 10 years ago and even if Disney did know and even if the tweets only re-emerged because of a right wing smear campaign, I still dont think its unreasonable for a company whose primary focus is children to fire someone when tweets like that become a major news story. The double standards are appalling.&&Oh I get it, because a lot of people in Hollywood are pedos&&This is why people shouldn’t use twitter. &&Am I the only one not shocked that Disney fired a guy after finding that large of a volume of pedophilic tweets?  Like, even if he was joking, that's a bad look.  It's not a free speech issue, it's just a child-friendly company protecting their reputation.&&Regardless of your opinion on either event, that one Roseanne tweet Gunn made is soooooo ironic now. I laughed so hard.&&[deleted]&&No. Just stop.

I’m so sick of these double standards. Which one is it, we’re going after everyone with the social media mob if they say messed up things or not?

Don’t pick and choose who based on politics. That’s just ridiculous.&&[deleted]&&Oh yes, because as we all know Hollywood is just made up of saints & angels.

Good. I hope it does. Hollywood is full of pedos and abusers in general.&&Nah, James Gunn was more than happy to metaphorically hang anyone on twitter that didn't proscribe to the same political and moral views as his. Him being hung by his own rope is the ultimate example of just desserts. That's all.

Remember kids, don't throw rocks if you live in glass houses.&&My point of view on this is pretty simple. I do not support firing people for things like this dredged up from their past.

James Gunn, on the other hand, has advocated for it for people he disagrees with politically and is part of a political movement that is known for doxxing their detractors and tries to get them fired or ruin their lives. These tweets were even dredged up in response to him doing the same thing to someone else. 

I call this karma. &&If this was a conservative figure, the posts here would be calling for this person's head. This guy made a bad decision in tweeting some terrible things. He has to own that. This wasn't one joke. Or something said in the heat of the moment. This was multiple jokes. Thought of over time. Typed out. He knew what he was doing and what the consequences would be. I can't see the sense in defending this clown.&&Isn't it funny that everyone here is defending James Gunn would shame anyone else they didn't already like if they made the same comments. 

[James Gunn justified his own firing.](https://youtu.be/MKrZAWlJsNs?t=2h14m35s) 

The point to let people grow and learn from mistakes isn't something that should apply only to people you like. It needs to stand for everyone, but no one kicks up a fuss when this has happened before. &&""The expendables were so manly I fucked the shit out of the little boy pussy next to me!  The boys ARE back in town""&&I was reading the tweets in question and they literally make him sound like a pedo...

It's like, not enough to convict him or anything, but it's enough to show a reasonable person there's something wrong with this guy's sexual bent toward children.

Kinda messed up that people run to defend people who ""joke"" about pedophilia.

&&I know the urge to bring out the pitchforks is strong in social media, it seems unavoidable, any time you put a big group of people together they seem to gravitate towards a mob mentality.  But could we at least keep the lynching to a set of *consistant* rules?

I'm sorry, but I'm seeing way too many people willing to ""turn the other cheek"" for Gunn, presumably because he shares their politics, while being absolutely unforgiving for anyone who isn't wearing the same jersey.  Its hypocritical and its going to result in someone who really should be pilloried getting a free pass.&&He said a lot of real fucked up nonsense that would have gotten him fired from many jobs. Pedophilia isn't 'edgy.' I do honestly think Gunn has changed  but his shit was still very and willfully public, so that's on him.&&>Gunn, now 51, was in his 40s when he sent them, hardly a kid. But so long as there has been no actual criminal activity, there has to be a difference between who a person was and who a person is. And we have to allow for the fact that people can change.

The very next sentence:

>Roseanne Barr IS the kind of person who dresses up in a Hitler costume and threatens to bake Jews in an oven. 

The photoshoot the article refers to was 9 years ago, made by a Jewish woman, for a satirical Jewish magazine. Notice how standards are selectively applied on a whim. Gunn's past doesn't matter because it was years ago and nobody broke the law, so he shouldn't be fired. Rosanne does something years ago that doesn't break the law, and it's indicative of her entire character, so she deserves what she got. Convenient.
&& but really tho, if these were trump or chris brown tweets people would not be nearly as forgiving. to me it seems like a case of “i liked that so you can’t take it away”&&[removed]&&I might be downvoted for this, but I have never joked about pedophilia or raping little boys. Even more, it was stupid to have posted about it for the world to see. It is naive to think that Disney wouldn't have fired James Gunn for these comments as ANY EMPLOYER would have fired their employee for these comments. It was, at best, offensive, terrible jokes that should have never been made.&&i think a company that makes kids movies should be totally fine with a dude who makes weird kidfucking tweets because i like superhero movies as long as he isnt a republican&&So funny watching everyone circle the wagons for this guy. If he voted for trump people would demand his head.&&If Trevor Noah was a conservative he would be fired by now. He would be called a racist and fired. &&He was part of the lynch mob, so I have zero sympathy for the guy.&&People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Gunn was tweeting in support of Rosanne getting fired for her tweet. Gunn's firing hurts Hollywood if they are all pedophiles. &&Sooner or later this outrage culture was going to come for someone people generally liked. &&Ironic given how many Hollywood elites support suppression of speech they don’t agree with. &&“To demand that every artist who works for you to have never had a past..”


THAT has never been the official position of Disney, and it’s extremely dishonest to suggest that it is.


Disney did not say “uh oh, James Gunn has A PAST therefore we need to fire him.”

Disney said, ‘James Gunn, a grown man, made some very public comments about little boys touching his d*ck, and the best things about being raped. The comments were reprehensible and evil, & we do not want him to be a part of our organization.’

&&James Gunn was all about celebrities getting fired for shit they said years ago. Live by the sword, die by the sword James. &&This is why - despite my disgust at conservatives and the Republican Party - they stay relevant. Because the double standard that fuckwads like Trump spout - the liberal and media double standard - exists. 

If this were a conservative celebrity the people defending Gunn would be calling for his or her head. 

Stop being hypocritical. Either this shit is OK or it’s not. &&Hollywood, assemble to defend and deflect!&&God I really dont think it's the end of an industry because of one director.  Its gonna be ok.  Fucking jeez.&&I'm just going to point this out to all the people crying and complaining about it being ""10 years ago"".

Donald Trump's ""locker room talk"" happened in 2005. That's 13 years ago. The same people saying that ""people can change"" in regards to James Gunn were probably the same ones blocking streets to protest Donald Trump because of his ""mean words"".

I'm not saying I like Trump or I'm okay with what he said. I don't and I'm not.

I just hate the hypocrisy.   


\*Prepares for tons of down votes because I mentioned Mr. Orange\*&&You guys should have come out against firing people over Tweets before it effected someone you like.&&It’s 2018. This is what the people want, 100% PC tolerance. Enjoy the hell you’ve all created. &&If anyone can look at james gunns tweets and defend him then they need to take a long hard look at themselves. This wasn't just one or two tweets this was more than 10,000. The repeated sexual jokes about 3 year olds were alarming enough but 10,000 deleted tweets, many of which were about children is disgusting! But guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2 were great movies so lets just forget about all that! Holywood is full of perverted peadophiles and james gunn is just a new one to the list! &&I've said this before, but this is but one of many times this tactic has been used against people on either side of the spectrum countless times in countless ways. I understand why Gunn was fired - Disney being labeled 'pro-pedo' is a living PR nightmare - but it's still especially important to treat him with good faith and a minimum of humanity even if the tweets are awful.

This incident can be a good lodestone to help coalesce public opinion, but that alone won't be enough. If this is going to go anywhere there needs to be a sustained effort to look at all the previous and related instances going on elsewhere (like no platforming), look at what the limits of 'tweetdiving' should be and especially consider how selective presentation (whether by activists or media itself) contributes to this mess.

It's easy to 'start' a conversation. Without a sustained push to bridge the polarization and build a middle ground, it'll devolve into cries of 'hypocrisy!' from left and right while this cultural standoff drags into perpetuity.&&Great now Disney is trying to take our Gunns away.&&When Roseanne makes a racist joke, she is fired and everyone cheers. When Gunn makes a joke about raping babies and gets fired, everyone says Disney was too harsh. Either its all ok, or NONE of it is ok...&& zero tolerance policies are dumb. &&Yes Hollywood, stand by your pedos and rapists.  Show your true colors as you always do&&Why is it okay for Roseanne to lose her show but not this guy to get fired for making jokes about pedophilia?  Anybody who was sexually abused by adults would surely argue its no joke. It’s not okay to abuse children, even as a joke. If Roseanne can be reprimanded for saying something racist why is it bad for this guy to be reprimanded by suggesting sexually assaulting children in society?  Double standards. Pedophilia is no joke as anybody who has been abused can attest. &&Rian Johnson supposedly deleted ""thousands"" of his tweets.&&Michael Rooker left twitter completely. &&if you want to be a politician - or anybody - when you grow up, kids really have to start preparing for it the moment they sign up for social media.

EDIT: just because I made this comment does not mean I'm comfortable with this being the status quo. As u/badasswaffles said, the pressure shouldn't be on kids to censor themselves. However, my point was, we have to be careful, since there are people out there who do not understand the difference between a tweet from when you're 19 and ignorant and having learned your lesson to grow into an educated and compassionate 40 year old. I don't need y'all telling me that we shouldn't have to censor ourselves to protect ourselves from the shitstorm 20 years later based on past mistakes. I 100% agree with you but that's not how its playing out. The internet used to be free and open but now giant conglomerates are trying to ruin it for everyone so we need a regulation to prevent regulations. Its like that. Doesn't make it right, but there's a point where you have to face reality and protect yourself.&&Anyone who gets even slightly famous should whack their social media accounts wholesale and start over.&&It was the sacrifice for their art &&Movies were better when ""coke"" was a line in the budget. &&And coke. Don't forget the coke.&&Celebrities in general were (at least perceived) better before twitter and instagram.&&amen brother &&Don't forget womanizers!

Cool! &&I know who Dan Harmon is but what situation are you referring to?&&~~Try 6 years ago, when this surfaced the first time other shock jokes from his blog surfaced for the first GotG movie in 2012.

EDIT: I linked this article forgetting that it was regarding his blog and not previous tweets. The two are different enough that I think it remove a lot of the validity of my post. He was making shock homophobic jokes that weren't landing. I'm leaving the original message in context for each of you to determine your opinions with this additional info.&&I'm a bit out of the loop, what's going on with Harmon? I know and old short film resurfaced that he's now being called a pedophile over, but I'm not privvy on the reaction&&Wouldn't losing a star director be a bigger deal for the shareholders?&&So the company that is acquiring the rights to the Deadpool movies is being careful about things that might cause outrage? Doesn’t sound like a good decision when the movies has already made boatloads because of the outrageous things in them.&&They shook the boat more by firing the guy. A simple press release saying ""long time ago, no big deal"" wod have shut things up faster.&&It doesn't even need to be good.  People will watch it anyway because they've invested 40 hours into the MCU already.&&I mean honestly it won't be too different if they still use his script, he finished writing the movie a month ago&&>What’s funny is the general audience don’t know anything about this. 

I was just thinking that this was somewhat falling into Streisand Effect territory.  Until I heard about Gunn being fired I was completely unaware of any comments he made 8-10 years ago.  I barely knew who the guy was other than hearing his name associated with the GotG movies.&&I'm trying to overcome this. I hate Trevor Noah, but I don't want him fired for his previous jokes.

...I just want him fired cuz he sucks.&&[deleted]&&You forgot the part where people complain about YouTube not creating a safe space &&Sooner or later, we have to realize that we have to treat this with Nuance.

Those tweets would get anyone in a public-facing position fired.&&This should go both ways. I see people on the left and right trying to use this and get people fired from their jobs. It's stupid. Everyone has done or said some really dumb shit in their life. Nobody is perfect.&&I hope The Mouse never find out the guys who play Iron Man and Captain America had a massive drug addiction and had a banana in his ass in Not Another Teen Movie respectively. &&Not only that but how many of the Disney execs have skeletons in their closet?  I would wager more than half.  &&As I’ve said before, I don’t like the idea that your long past can come back to bite you... but Gunn did advocate for that very thing before so we can’t complain when he’s held to the very standards he proclaims. &&But that implies that Disney is interested in making art (boring or otherwise). They are interested in making an uncontroversial product with the broadest appeal possible. It remains to be seen how strict a retroactive code of conduct they can enforce without affecting the quality of their output. &&This lacks context, those jokes were; peadophilic in nature, outstanding in sheer volume terms and tagged in people who have since become convicted peadophiles.  For a childrens entertainment company those are more than jagged edges that much is surely plain to see. I will defend free speech to the death but people have to be aware that the things they say can and will affect their lives, especially if they end up having such high profile ones.&&This take kind of glosses over what he actually said though.&&I guess people forgot that jokes about pedophilia were pretty popular back when Gunn made those tweets. So many Pedobear memes.&&I didn't really like that part. Apparently he was fired because he was an asshole 10 years ago, when he was 40 years old.

I agree that people should be allowed to grow, and we should forgive past transgressions to an extent. He should not have been fired for some stupid jokes he posted 10 years ago. That's just a knee jerk overreaction.

But we shouldn't really turn being a 40 year old prick into part of the ""process of becoming an artist"". He was just an asshole at some point, like most of us were at some point in our lives.&&We had this happen in Brazil where some famous actors joined the mob and pointed their pitchforks against another artists with some bad old tweets. Then people found out these ones themselves had their own dirty tweets and had to face a mob too, and loosing contracts and sponsors&&I don't like this outrage culture. &&And Gunn himself helped perpetuate. This only happened to him because he was trying to dig up 10 year old history of someone he doesn't like in order to harm them. You reap what you sow. &&Yeah it's funny how this has kind of gotten forgotten about by 99% of people discussing this.  This started by Gunn being outraged at someone else for having a different political opinion than him, then now people are getting outraged at the people getting outraged at Gunn for having different opinions about the acceptability of pedo jokes than him, while seemingly forgetting it was Gunn's outrage that kicked off this whole thing.&&I was wondering how long it would take for this comment. This is honestly nothing more than chickens coming home to roost on the PC police. They say the left eats their own, this is a perfect example. They unleashed a beast, and only fed it more after the Rosanne fiasco. So this naturally makes it viable for right wingers to weaponize the outrage against the very people who created the outrage machine. &&Too true.

Not like he drugged and raped a 13 year old or anything

&&Disney didn’t just find these tweets. They’ve known about them since they hired him way back. They’re resurfaced screenshots. &&It’s shocking when a company knowingly hires a guy who used to tweet like that, then he apologizes and cleans up his act, then 6 years later fire him for it anyway. It’s like hiring an ex-con, them doing some of your company’s best work, and then firing them because one customer blindly dislikes ex-cons.
&&What was it? &&I don't think it is for one simple reason:  Gunn accepted the consequences.  

He never made a ""They are infringing on my freedom of speech"" argument.  He never tried to blame medication.  He never publicly begged for his job back.  He said 

> “Regardless of how much time has passed, I understand and accept the business decisions taken today. Even these many years later, I take full responsibility for the way I conducted myself then,”

So he recognizes that Disney will not continue to pay him due to words they consider abhorrent and accepts it.  &&He was 41 when the tweets started so not even ""nearly 40"".  I wasn't aware of how old the man was until this whole thing broke out.

You are absolutely right though.  In any other job (except maybe police these days), this kind of thing coming out would mean immediate termination of employment.&&Right? Now Hollywood is whining because it is one of them, but whom of Hollywood came to the defense of Trump when the pussy grab tapes from well over 10 years old appeared?&&Yeah for real. I guess the irony of Gunn’s Roseanne/free speech tweet is lost on everyone here. 

No, I’m not making a false equivalency of Gunn and Roseanne. Yes, I’m implying the logic Gunn used in that tweet applies to his own situation. &&And he can do that, you can do that anyone can say whatever they want and disagree with anyone as much as they want. 
The angry mobs will turn on anyone at any time and for any reason, it is changing the way we communicate. Maybe soon some ideas or opinions will be too controversial and people will have to censor themselves in order to get jobs, friends, etc. And I think that's dangerous, but that's just me. &&Hollywood is a political cartel.&&I'm a pretty leftie dude and I 100% agree with you. I may not agree with conservatives but the shit they get is beyond the pale&&This has to be the most frustrating part of society today, in my opinion. If we like someone, we'll defend them to the death. If we aren't naturally inclined to like someone, then who cares? Screw them, I don't care if their career is ruined, they suck as a person. 

I can't decide if it's a serious lack of empathy, reasonability, or something else entirely, but in my opinion it's dangerous. 

If having a past doesn't really matter (which it shouldn't because everyone does), then we need to apply this consistently across the board. Otherwise society is one large popularity contest in which those with the most charisma always win. Not too difficult to see how that ends for us. &&Where was all this support and empathy when there was the witch Hunt on the ceo Mozilla for supporting prop 8? 

I hate this internet hate mob thing and have been speaking out about it for years but it's pretty fucked up that the big liberal names were all ok with it until it happened to one of theirs. &&The reality is that there's always going to be people attacking anyone who makes mistakes, and those people are loud and never entirely go away. There's no such thing as forgiveness anymore because we're all just caught in a spiraling vortex of bitterness.&&Happened with the comedian Owen Benjamin. He went on twitter and said that 5 year old children can’t be trans or something like that and he got a lot of backlash for it. He didn’t do himself any favors with what he said after that but for him to lose gigs and work because of it I thought was wrong. He expressed his opinion but since it didn’t fit the narrative people went ape shit. What’s happening to James Gunn is in my opinion the same thing just the other side of the aisle. I don’t think he should’ve been fired by Disney for something he said ten years ago especially when they already knew about them when they hired him but that’s the world we live in. The whataboutism is getting a bit out of hand if you ask me.&&[deleted]&&James had two options: Throw a fit and potentially lose future jobs, or openly and calmly accept it, and be professional. Silence wouldn’t have been an option, as if he had said nothing following Disney’s statement, it would translate as not accepting the decision. For the sake of his career, he had no choice but to say “I accept this.”&&That's shock humour alright&&You don't understand, I REALLY REALLY need him to direct my superhero movie so it's ok&&I also think there is a difference between making a rape or pedophilia joke and hitting a woman. &&[deleted]&&Trump apologizing for his past tweets and owning up to it is something I cannot possibly imagine.&&haha thats priceless. &&That first tweet is meant to be read sarcastically right?&&Exactly. If Gunn was a Republican, people would be calling for his firing even harder than they are now.&&I doubt less than 1% of the Gunn defenders would defend him if he was a republican. Damn hypocrites all over the place&&Let's be honest, Disney didn't do this as a ""protect the kids"" thing. If it was, they'd also be saying ""one condition of buying Fox is that Bryan Singer is fired"". You know, since he's [actually been accused of molesting and raping kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Singer#Sexual_abuse_allegations).&&[deleted]&&> kids movies

all movies&&He also made weird movies that had rape in them. Clearly Disney knew who they were hiring. Not defending his horrible 'jokes' but it isn't like Disney didn't know that Gunn was really fucked up.&&It's pretty hilarious. If it was a right winger making racist jokes he would be absolutely destroyed on here, but some how a left-winger makes dozens of pedophilia jokes and the tune is ""they're just jokes people need to understand that"" &&If you’re older than 15 and don’t realize that those kinds of things should not be broadcast with your name next to them, then you’re just an idiot. 

It’s not like he had a particular viewpoint about an issue that is no longer PC. He made jokes about kids pissing on his feet and worse while he was a fully developed adult. 

You can think that’s perfectly acceptable, but Disney doesn’t need to hitch one of their wagons to the guy. &&[deleted]&&Seriously, wtf.  Shit like this makes defending ""the liberal media"" an uphill battle for the rest of us.&&Surely orange man is not as bad as you purport him to be&&orange man bad. how could you¿&&Liberals; ""well that's different""&&In Hollywood, rape is cool&&And still act Holier than Thou to the rest of us.&&Just like with Roman Polanski.&&People criticized James Gunn for this, many trying to claim they must all have been in the same vein as the ones screenshotted(word?)

He deleted 20K tweets in FEBRUARY, long before any of this controversy. It is being reported by not-so-reputable news sites like ScreenRant as being in reaction to James Gunn being fired when this is an _astonishingly easy_ thing to fact check. Here is a [screenshot of his social blade page](https://imgur.com/a/pmnCtTs), and you can easily check this yourself. It's amazing how fast this kind of false information can spread when people hear what they want to hear, especially when it's this easy to confirm.

It's also worth mentioning that in both cases of James Gunn and Rian Johnson, they deleted a large chunk of their TIMELINE. As in, James Gunn chose a date A and a date B and deleted every tweet between. He didn't go through all of his tweets individually and find a thousand ones as horrific as the few that have been spread around. 

EDIT: ScreenRant has, for what it's worth, now amended their article to reflect these facts. MovieWeb still has the headline ""Last Jedi Director Deletes 20K Tweets Following James Gunn Firing"" which is just not true. &&I this point I would just fucking delete twitter and have zero social media presence.

&&Wow, so Disney is reacting entirely to the current political climate instead of the act itself. If they legitimately had this much of a qualm with his comments, they would've fired him in 2012 when this originally surfaced. 

Edit: I'm aware that they're two different sets of statements. The same logic applies, even though the comments are different in terms of shock value (which is what he was going for in the first place anyways.)

I'm also well aware that Disney is a corporation. They will adapt to whatever society deems appropriate in order for them to make more money in a capitalist country that also happens to be the movie capital of the world.

My original comment is stating the obvious. The public outcry wasn't bad in 2012, and Disney was making money off of Gunn. Now that the political climate has changed, Disney believed they could make money by distancing themselves from Gunn. Like one commenter said, it's all about the bottom line.

Edit: It's been pointed out that I and many others probably saw the same curated list of tweets and weren't shown at the same time all of his other inappropriate tweets on other taboo subjects. It is harder though to find a more general list of inappropriate tweets that have not been curated to fulfill a certain slant, either for or against. For that reason... I'm just going to cease to give a shit about this whole thing. In reality, this bloke is just some shitposting millionaire who appears to have committed no crimes especially against children; so his and Disney's business no longer interests me.&&Does the general public know or care about this?

You'd get fired from any white collar job as well

It's hilarious to see this thing predictably fall along left/right lines.

People like Cernovich loved the opportunity to claim a scalp by using the left's favorite strategy against them - and Gunn made himself an easy target by *tweeting creepy pedo shit that doesn't look like a joke because it doesn't have a punchline*

Predictably, the left circles the wagons - after demanding Roseanne be banished and exiled - using many of the arguments you see here in this thread.

Just do a Ctrl+F for 'bad faith' and see how often it gets repeated. Suddenly we're supposed to care who outed someone's behavior and not care about the behavior itself.

We didn't have megathreads of people defending Roseanne, and James Gunn himself had an awful lot to say about Roseanne getting fired.&&Agree 100%.  The *only* caveat in this case is that James Gunn *himself* was one of the people trying to get people fired for their prior shitty tweets.

He then literally tweeted ""Freedom of Speech does not grant you freedom from consequences"".

I can think of only one person whose reputation actually got better after the internet made it possible to know everything about them.

That person is Fred Rogers.&&Tbf, I'd say it's also very easy to hate a personality if you only got limited information, which is something I feel happens very often with internet personalities.

Take this situation as an exmple, if you just heard a bit about Gunn's provocative comments (and provocative is a nice way to describe some of that stuff), then he might look like a complete asshole. Yet if you know that he was more of a troubled artist; who still had to find his stride, and later stopped it, then he's suddenly looks much more like just another flawed human being.

Honestly makes me wonder if there is also a trend on the internet to assumed people are the worst, which can seem quite dehumanizing. Particuarly with internet personalities, I've often seen many absurd attempts at charachter assasination.&&I've never heard this expressed before and holy shit is it on point. &&Well he deleted his twitter account, apologized about it and AS said he made a stupid skit and moved on.  It didn't hurt him from a content creator standpoint but he did go ghost after it was revealed.  He was attacking alt-right people and they dug up his past to be like ""look at this hypocrite"". Same thing with Gunn but Gunn got fired because he works for a child-centric content creating company. &&It's only going to get worse now that some dickbag proved he can goad one of the largest companies in the world to drop a billion dollar content producer.&&Yeah, exactly. My biggest issue with it is that some people will applaud Disney for this move while completely unaware that Disney addressed it when it happened, then was happy to keep employing him. The way a lot of these stories are coming out, it seems as if Gunn's comments *just* surfaced, which makes Disney look a lot more favorable. The only people that like this news either didn't do their research, or are convienently ignoring the fact that Disney already addressed this and is obviously trying to save face.&&Yeah, I honestly fucking hate today's outrage culture. All it takes is for one notable reporter (or a bunch of Twitter trolls apparently) to dig up something to put you on blast and your career is ruined. This shit is unacceptable and needs to stop. In the words of the great Zombieland, people need to nut up or shut up.&&Haha, my god Inhumans was hilariously bad.&&Inhumans doesn't have Stan Lee cameo. So, not ~~cannon~~ canon. 😏😏

That's literally why you're seeing a theme, because those were hand-picked, and there aren't many subjects that work for shock humor (which has to be extreme to give the cue that it's a joke because no one would really say that).&&So why didn’t it matter last week? Disney does background checks. They knew about the tweets. If this is really a big deal Why aren’t people mad at Disney for knowingly allowing a pedophile work on two movies?

At some point, social justice warriors are going to see that public shaming/bullying and no-platforming is not a good system of justice, because people can(and will) just put it right back on you.

In the end, it almost always comes down to an escalation until both sides are lying in ruins.

Take the #MeToo movement where even people like Matt Damon who said things like a joke Al Franken did years ago needs to be treated differently than a person who rapes someone.  He got blasted by the media for saying that.


This is just the inevitable outcome of what's going to happen.  No one's perfect, and yes, certain sides in Hollywood have been using that to get rid of people they don't like.  Unfortunately, they're finding out that if you live by the sword, you may die by the sword.


There needs to be apologies by all sides.  And not a ""I'll apologize when they apologize"" situation.  But that's never going to happen.  And what you see is really only the beginning.  We have more of a chance of social media going away so people can't publicly get themselves into trouble than partisan groups willing to admit they are wrong, and that being offended should perhaps be solved by apologies rather than mob justice.&&[deleted]&&Sometimes when everybody loses, you win.&&Is it, though?

# Bogus Production Problems Might Stop Bill & Ted 3 From Happening

Julie Muncy  Today 10:45am 

The adventures of Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan might not be  continuing after all, in some of the least radical news we’ve gotten in a  while. 

Just a couple months ago, word was that a third *Bill & Ted* movie, *Bill & Ted Face the Music*,  was a sure thing, with the main cast ready to reprise their roles as  older-but-not-wiser heroes. Now, star Keanu Reeves isn’t so sure. 

Talking to Yahoo! Entertainment, he said that, “I don’t know if \[*Bill & Ted 3*\] is a reality,” adding, “We’ve been trying for a long time to get that film made, and it still has its challenges.”

Those  challenges, apparently, are the normal logistical concerns that can  torpedo so many movies. “I really love the characters, and I think we  have a good story to tell,” said Keanu. “Part of it is business  stuff—financing, rights, deals. Nothing creatively.”

Friends, this  is not triumphant news. I am officially bummed. Please, someone, let  Keanu make his movie. He deserves it.

Yes, Bill. But, I do not believe we will get Jon Wick until we have a dead puppy.

Ted, it's pointless to have a dead puppy before we even have decent pencils.

Well, how can we have decent pencils when we don't really even know how to kill?

*Star Trek*'s *Into Darkness* and *Beyond* almost didn't happen, for instance, because Paramount didn't think that the first two films made enough money (despite both more than doubling what was spent on them).

([EDIT for later-arriving people](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8z2zd1/keanu_reeves_bill_ted_3_facing_production_issues/e2fu01d/).)&&> How is Keanu Reeves not big enough to greenlight a movie?

JW2 was a massive success.

Before that, looking at movies he was top billed on:

47 Ronin did 38 mil domestic off of a 175 mil production budget.  If you include foreign totals, it's up to 150 mil.  So that lost 25 mil + marketing, so easily 50-100 mil.

Day the Earth Stood Still did 79 mil domestic + 153 mil foreign for vs an 80 mil production budget.  So it certainly made money, but most of that money was off of foreign showings.

Street Kings did 26 domestic and 39 foreign vs a 20 production budget.  So again, def made money, but that profit was due to foreign showings.  

Lake House was the same thing, 52/62 vs a 40 mil production budget.  Constantine was 75/150 vs a 100 mil production budget.  

Now this isn't new information, you can look at pretty much any top movie, and except for ones that obviously play better to an American audience (Black Panther, Incredibles 2), the foreign totals outpace the domestic totals.  Because, you know, there are more people not in the US than there are in the US.  

But Keanu movies seem to NEED to foreign markets to profit at all.

American comedies in general do better in the US than outside of the US.  Makes sense, since they are written primarily for a US audience, unlike an action movie which is more broad in scope.  Looking at some of the top grossing ""Comedy - Remakes"" on box office mojo shows that:

Longest Yard - 83.1% of it's take was domestic
        
Cheaper by the Dozen - 72.9%
  
Mr. Deeds - 73.7%

Freaky Friday - 68.5%

Seems like if you aren't Eddie Murphy, you're basically reliant on the domestic audience to make you money.  So you've got a star that plays better to foreign audiences and a genre that plays better to domestic ones.  I can see how the people in charge of financing things like this could feel that there is very little money to potentially be made so why even try, especially after the 47 Ronin debacle. 
&&I'd guess because 'straight' comedies (versus action comedy etc.) aren't big in the box office anymore (and they don't usually make a lot of money overseas). So when they are done they are usually done cheaply. And it might be too cheap compared to the vision of the project.&&Keanu tried for like a decade to get [Passengers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1355644/) made, but never could.

Finally someone greenlit the movie on the condition that Keanu NOT be in it. And they did some rewrites and made it more sappy, I believe.&&Actors don't have the same kind of star power they used to have. They still have star power, just a different kind.

Back in the day, attaching Harrison Ford = GREENLIGHT.

Now, actors have much more pull in specific genres they've had great box office success in. And every territory around the world is a little different.

For instance, Bruce Willis is a big name domestically and internationally. Make Bruce Willis a part of your movie, and you're going to be able to land some foreign pre-sales. But how much money will you get from adding Bruce to the cast? It depends on the genre.

Bruce Willis in a thriller?  A good sum of money.

Bruce Willis in an action movie? A lot of money!

Bruce Willis in a sci-fi action thriller with a few horror elements? Tons of money!!! The Sixth Sense, Live Free or Die Hard, Die Hard, Die Hard, Die Hard, Die Hard, Looper, 12 Monkeys, The Jackal, Red, Red 2, etc.

Bruce Willis in a British parlor drama with a 6 hour runtime?

Much less money.&&Honestly the track record of comedy sequels, especially in the last 10 years or so, has been pretty bad. I’ve been been anticipating this one for a while but I also still have nightmares from Zoolander and Anchorman 2. &&Because Keanu is an action star, Bill and Ted is ancient by Hollywood standards and it might not be good enough to make back its money.

Just a big name star isn't enough especially if it's outside their normal style. It'd be hard to bankroll a Tom Cruise comedy but mission impossible Fallout 2 will get money immediately. &&His career has always been hit or miss. He was a joke for a long time. His acting was wooden and laughable. 

He was horrible in Much Ado About Nothing (will never figure out why a casting director thought that was a good fit). He was stiff and uninteresting in Dracula and surrounded by much better actors. He was awful in Permanent Record (a movie about teen suicide). He was unimpressive in River's Edge (at least it fit the character). 

His big movies have always been action - Speed, Wick, Matrix, etc.

He is a risky cast if it is not an action movie. Bill and Ted's was awesome, but it is not a given hit.&&It’s not guaranteed to be as popular as Reddit thinks. The last one came out a decade before today’s teens were born and a lot of today’s 30/40-somethings have probably forgotten the franchise exists&&I've watched enough episodes of Entourage to see why.&&Ryan Reynolds had a terrible time getting Deadpool going; it took years. It wasn't until the test footage leaked online that Fox greenlit it because of the overwhelming response they received. &&I think Keanu is now so associated with action/drama it’s tough to get a comedy made around his star power alone... &&Because he's the only big thing about the movie. B&T was the peak of Winter's acting career, and idiot goofball duo comedies died in the 90s with Paulie Shore and Off-Brand-Alec Baldwin. Those kinds of movies just aren't made anymore; instead, comedy has moved towards less campy idiots in either realistic or otherwise serious/edgy situations (Hot Fuzz, Tropic Thunder, Superbad). Almost all successful modern comedy is about relatively normal people who get in over their head. 

Keanu _needs_ to be in comedy somewhere, because he's been building his super-serious action rep for so long that the payoff would be hilarious. But take away how much we want to see that, and what else does B&T have? Like the new Ghostbusters, it'd end up being a movie that nobody really wanted.&&Maybe they'll remake it but with women&&At which point, what does ""confirmed"" even mean?? &&As a big fan, the first thing I do is ask Ed what's going on.

Added bit:

Bill's dead. The criminals manage to find Wick and take him down, sending him to hell. What they don't know is John Wick has been here before, and it's his territory. He finds the Grim Reaper who knows where Bill is, helping him join ~~Ted~~  Wick in seeking revenge on the baddies.

Exactly.

It's that nowadays, every step of pre, pro, and post is constantly written about on the Web.&&[deleted]&&Maybe Netflix or Amazon will step in.&&I thought that making double what was spent, is still losing money after theater split, marketing, etc?&&Requesting dosh&&CBS split the IP down the middle basically before they made the 2009 movie. Every issue of 'making enough money' has been because of a history of just terrible management from the top.

So those two companies split, and they split the IP. Bad Robot is little more than a shell production company owned by them to make the JJ Verse. Both of them were always competing for the rights and proceeds of these movies.

Beyond didn't do as well as it needed to by these guys standards, because the movie has to make 3 entities money, not just one.

STD is in the same boat. It was only made to extort money out of Netflix. They paid so much for worldwide distro that CBS basically made the series for free.

The problem is the greed of CBS. CBS, paramount, Viacom, whatever they are now they see Star Trek as a cash cow....because it has been for decades.&&Then we need a Bill & Ted/Star Trek crossover!&&I honestly wonder if they're worried it won't do well because the youngest generation of movie goers likely have no idea about the original films and that the viewership of those of us going to see it mainly for nostalgia won't be enough. &&47 Ronin was murdered by studio meddling. &&That *47 Ronin* debacle you mention was actually a great movie, some totally amazing scenes anyway.

Cruise = big budget action

Lovecraft = dimensional bending dystopian universe that rarely has any ""action"" and more just hallucinations, cross dimensional chaos, and psychological terror with the occasional earliest forrays into body horror.

Having cruise there makes me think they were going for an action flick, and while I understand the desire to do that to sell to the studio, it just doesn't do Lovecraft service. Its like saying anything with face-tentacles automatically makes it Lovecraftian.

Now, replace Tom Cruise with Sam Niell and we got something going.

Vanilla Sky is a fine example. &&[deleted]&&Cruise is fantastic at non-action movies. IMO due to the money making machine his action films are along with the his ties to a cult have resulted with the public forgetting how solid and consistent of an actor he truly is. 

His non-action roles are his best performances.&&Vanilla sky. Rainman. Both great movie that he actually acted decently in. He doesn't only do action. He can only play himself, but not always action. &&>Cruise = big budget action

Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire, Risky Business?&&I think you’re typecasting Cruise. It would be nice to see him in a non action role &&Cruise has done some amazing roles outside of his action movie stints, though.&&Sam Rockwell.&&Which is amazing, considering how cheaply del Toro can produce a movie for.

Although, to be fair, I don't know how much money it would take to create a decent ""Mountain of Madness"" movie in the first place.  &&Cameron isn’t funding Avatar, at least not his personal bank account. He has a production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, but even then Fox is providing almost all of the funding for the Avatar sequels. There was a big hoopla over them announcing all four with a billion dollar budget all together. Cameron isn’t going to spend his own money when he can get others to pay for him. At the Mountains of Madness was canned because Del Toro would not agree to a guaranteed PG-13 rating for Paramount. They were going to give him the 150 million, they just didn’t want it be R-rated, which was a smart business decision on their end because the movie would have flopped.&&Not if you're trying to launder money.&&In a world...&&I can't even go on anymore. I just lurk on reddit, make sad comments, hoping for some save after no cowboy bebop. But now with B&T3 unconfirmed I am totally bummed. Totally. &&Keanu tried to do a live action Cowboy Bebop?

Wow, I can understand why he looks so sad sometimes, so close to greatness.&&You mean like veronica mars!&&It should be though.&&Unless they're doing something pure CGI, it's not *that* expensive.&&The Mummy is directing now? &&I feel sad that we're just calling it The Mummy, and lumping it in with one of my favorite movies, The Mummy.

Let's just call it The Mummy ~~06~~ '17.&&Pacific Rim was considered a safer bet because the Transformers movies were making buckets of money.&&Yeah, they were willing to make a PG13 version, but not a rated R version. The last update I remember, which was still a few years ago, was Del Toro was trying to convince them to let him film a rated R version for the home release, but release a PG13 version in theaters. &&Also it would be a $200m horror movie, not a big budget action movie. It's possible for horror movies to be that successful, but they are way less of a sure thing.&&Yeah but I actually liked(not loved) Pacific Rim. The mummy was an abortion served on a silver Platter. &&You also have to remember that the budget numbers that are released to the public are often falsified in that they don’t include most marketing costs or after market costs like shares to producers and actors that had a percentage stake.

So it could have been a tighter profit than most realize, or none at all. Hollywood studios operate primarily off of licenses at this point. After those ‘hidden fees’ not even Disney movies profit, but they make it all back at the parks and through the toys and gear etc.

I don’t know everything, but I do work in Hollywood and I know a lot of times those budget and profit numbers are mostly for investors and stock holders so they aren’t freaking out because they don’t understand the process of losing money in one spot to gain money in another.

Which back to your point, paramount probably should have made a third regardless because it boosts their Star Trek brand. 

It’s a dumb business, honestly. 🤷🏻‍♂️&&The opening scene of Star Trek Beyond was one of the best I can remember. Much like Thor: Ragnarok, the third movie made up for every shortcoming of the previous 2.&&I think it's not that they look to make that, it's that your box office total has to double up the production cost and that is when you start actually making money. &&Wait.. *a new Hope*?&&Oh, you were clear. I just thought the movie had some really powerful, really cool scenes. 

The movie seemed a bit lost in its arrangement. Like you said, ""a star that plays better to foreign audiences and a genre that plays better to domestic ones."" It was a hollywood action-movie version of a Chinese epic, seems good on paper.....&&It has less to do with pleasing the Chinese people and more with pleasing the Chinese government.

The Chinese government has some ridiculous rules on how much money foreign movies can make and then take out of the country. It's something in the range of 5-10% last I read. There are ways to increase this amount though.

Film in China? Extra 2%

Film using top grade Chinese actors? Extra 1%

Have those actors actually say something? Extra 2%

Those random pointless scenes involving China exist to unlock that extra percentage.&&Yeah but on the other hand you get a western actor in a Chinese movie now and then... Haven't you ever longed, desired from the depth of your heart, to see Matt Damon defend the Chinese wall against monsters, for example...?&&*Yippee Kay-yay, my good man.*&&Yeah I mean, it's basically in spirit Die Hard In Space.&&Honestly, I’d watch Bruce Willis paint a wall for two hours.&&Well, according to wikipedia it brought in $48.5 million world wide with a production budget of $30 million. Factoring in advertising and marketing the movie probably broke even at best. It certainly didn't make a lot of money.

Oh no, I've become one of them!&&And IIRC Peter wanted to make Ghostbusters a franchise (the protagonist of the game got tasked to help start this plan at the end).

 
So, logically, the backdrop for this could’ve been anywhere, possibly NOLA with its roots in the paranormal. &&Man you nailed it. Early into the movie the OG team could find out that there's a group of women doing their ghostbusting job. These women, while competent, could use a little mentoring to be true, effective ghostbusters. The old guys are starting to feel their age, and some of them are hesitant about training a new group of ghostbusters, but eventually the guys all come around and then we're left off with Kristin Wiig's new group for the next movies. I would have been super okay with that.&&IIRC, it actually took parts from one of the other ""Ghostbusters 3"" scripts, and I think some of the actors said it basically was Ghostbusters 3&&Just like the Back to the Future game... it was like a second trilogy that worked really freaking well.&&I found a video on YouTube that's basically just the cut-scenes from the game and the walking around that has plot and it's basically like watching Ghostbusters 3. It's pretty awesome.

But yeah, they've all said it's essentially GB3. You had basically *everyone* come back, minus Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver. Even people like Potts, Atherton, and Max von Sydow as the voice of Vigo. It's everything you could want from a third Ghostbusters movie, only it's interactive.&&At that point it makes sense to give up&&But bill Murray was still in the movie .&&Internet theory. Daniel steaks the girl and always strikes first. In Cobra Kai they have Johnny tell his side of the story that portrays this and expands that Johnny had a rough child good with stepfather and loosing his mother and Cobra Kai was the thing that gave him confidence and happiness. &&Did you see the part where mr.miyami rubbed his hands against Daniel before the final fight? All of sudden Daniel got some sort of mystic power and destroyed Johnny with one kick. Poor Johnny, he trained and competed in karate for many years but he gets his ass kicked by some amature with no talent and few months of karate.&&Nah man... fuck that kid.

But I liked it on Netflix. &&Oh definitely&&But probably wrong about Annihilation though &&There's only one really good thing in that movie and he did it all with one arm tied behind his back.&&Oh yeah, this is a given seeing as they want to invest in sci-fi. Bill and Ted would be the perfect flagship for that goal.&&I was thinking Tom Hiddleston, but Gyllenhaal works as well. &&Ooh yeah give me that Nightcrawler Gyllenhaal. &&> A Few Good Men

Yea but that was 1992, though I will admit Eyes Wide Shut is actually not too far off. &&Also Lovecraft is never about the big thing happening, it focuses on one person's mine destroyed by the big thing and other people trying to piece it back together, some of whom go crazy in the process. I thought Annihilation did a great job of presenting this type of horror in a movie. If they could use Natalie Portman, Tom Cruise would be fine&&Most people forget that Cruise used to really go out of his way to differentiate the types of films he was in. Seems he’s tried to stick mainly to action films the last decade or more, but he did plenty of dramatic work in the ‘90s. I mean, he’s worked with Kubrick and PT Anderson. At the Mountains of Madness also doesn’t involve a detective or anything like OP is talking about, it is about an Arctic expedition. I can totally buy Cruise as a Shackleton type given his love of dangerous stunts. The script for the movie is easy to find online, and while I don’t think it is that good if I’m being honest, Cruise would have been fine as the lead.&&If you give him good material he will act the everloving shit out of it.&&Seriously. Just cause the guy only does blockbusters doesn’t mean he can’t act circles around most of his peers. &&Yeah, like playing a pickup artist self-help guru with a dying father.  That would be cool.&&Nothing about Del Toro’s movies are cheap. He had to pay for pre-production out of pocket for The Shape of Water, waived his salary completely until budget and marketing had been recouped, and had to use sets from his TV show The Strain to off-set the costs of renting places and building new environments. Without the luck of that and GDT agreeing to work for free while paying all the crew out of pocket as the production came together, not to mention most of the actors working for guild minimums or not much more, the movie would have cost at least twice the final budget. And At the Mountains of Madness was going to cost 150 million. That’s the opposite of cheap, especially for such a niche film.&&Shoutout to the late, legendary [Don LaFontaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_LaFontaine).&&I read this in the Honest Trailers guy's voice.&&Let's do this... here's a pencil to sign the contract...&&Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure was made in 1987 for $10 million, and grossed $40 million domestically. Bogus Journey, though, was produced for $20M and grossed only $38M domestically. And it's been twenty years. All this is probably giving the money people some reluctance.&&Those edits are so old-school! And what is up with all the damn cats!&&“...and that’s a wrap!” &&Truckloads*&&Oddly enough, I think a PG-13  At the Mountains of Madness  movie would be perfectly doable and not missing much, it isn't like the original story had tons of gore.  &&Such a strange concept that essentially we could be in a world where directors make two movies.

Some of it would probably make the Mob blush. :-P&&I don't agree at all and think Beyond was a shallow popcorn flick compared with Into Darkness.&&Yeah, I've always heard it as box office total needs to be about double the stated production budget to break even, because that production budget doesn't include marketing, the studios don't get 100% of the box office number, and so on. &&I believe it’s actually Return of the Jedi that had this happen, but he’s not wrong. (Foreword: the article I’m sourcing here came out in 2011. I vaguely remember hearing something about at least the Star Wars incident being somewhat fixed over the years since, but couldn’t find any evidence of it, so assume everything I type after this has “as of 2011” at the end of it.) David Prowse has still never made any residuals off the movie. And to make it worse, they still occasionally send him letters saying “we regret to inform you that as Star Wars: Return of the Jedi has still never made a profit, we still have no residuals to send you.” The movie had a budget of $32 million, and made $475 million. 

To quote TheAtlantic.com:
“Confused? Imagine you're running a lemonade stand with your buddy Steve. Your mom says you have to share half your profits with your sister. But you don't wanna! So you pretend your buddy Steve is actually a corporation -- call him Steve, Inc -- charging you rent for the stand, the spoon, etc. ""Dang, mom, I don't have any profits, I had to pay it all to Steve, Inc!"" you say when you come home. But the money isn't gone. It's as good as yours -- in your best friend's pocket.”

[Here’s the article ability how it happens](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/how-hollywood-accounting-can-make-a-450-million-movie-unprofitable/245134/) including an expense sheet for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, showing how they somehow put that movie on the books as a 167 million dollar loss, despite being one of the highest earning movies of the decade and having a budget of $150 million while making almost $1 billion. 

Hollywood basically creates new companies in charge of making each movie, and then that company gets to charge the studio for everything they want. So “Star Wars Inc” would charge LucasFilms $500,000 for “marketing” and that way LucasFilms gets to say they spent more than they made. &&It’s hurting a lot of movies. &&Definitely why Dr. Strange's climax was where it was.&&Oh god.

Obviously, a script written in the 21st Century is going to deviate from the original story somewhat, but Lovecraft's stuff is pretty sexless even for its time and doesn't have much explicit violence. The horror is more abstract and cosmic than splatter, though I'm not sure what the MPAA's stance on existential nihilism is.

Lovecraft *was* a racist bastard, even by the standards of his time, and that *is* reflected in some of his work. However, a modern film adaptation  would certainly exclude any hint of that, regardless of rating. In any case, I think At the Mountains of Madness is one of the few stories that don't have any hint of prejudice.&&It could be done. If Jurassic Park could get that rating, so could ATMOM. It would be a pretty hard pg-13 and probably fairly terrifying for kids, but possible. &&I felt the exact opposite. The first, to an extant, and the second far more, seemed like generic action schlock with ST names slapped on to me. I kinda liked them for what they were, but was kinda disappointed in them. Beyond, I have more complicated feelings about. I think it's much truer to the franchise, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it as much. Overall, I'd say it's probably the ""best"" of the three, even if it was my least favorite. 

IIRC, Simon Pegg, who is a huge Trekkie, got to help direct 3, and there's a big shift in tone, and details, back to the show. Things like fixing warp travel from some kind of hyperspace rippoff in 2 to having a propper Alcubierre-esque effect in 3. And the whole premise feels more like an episode of the show.&&Can we all agree the the first one was great?
And that the music is great?&&I enjoyed Beyond for that very reason.  Yeah it was dumb pulpy sci-fi, but it executed it so well.&&Into Darkness just struck me as a half-assed remake of Wrath of Khan. Beyond, on the other hand, was pretty great, IMHO. &&People can have opinions guys, I agree that two was much better than three. &&I felt like Beyond carried the most Star Trek spirit out of the 3. It was great to see the movie open up with a diplomatic mission. I rolled my eyes hard at the trailer initially but I think it might be tied with the first one for me. 

I didn't hate Into Darkness by any stretch but I did feel like the Khan thing was underwhelming and honestly could have been far more interesting had it not been Khan aaaaand had there not been magic blood involved.&&Into Darkness was universally trashed for being a dumb and cynical rehash of plot elements from the old Star Trek movies, whereas Beyond was a largely original action-adventure with the characters. So yours is a fringe opinion to say the least. &&The natural gas and oil industries do the same thing with their accounting in order to get around paying land owners for the minerals they extract. Chesapeake energy is notorious for this and has screwed over many home owners.&&If this is the way it works, I’m honestly surprised my personal movie going experience over the years has been as enjoyable as it was.

1979's *Star Trek: The Motion Picture* gets unfairly maligned for its Kubrick-esque tone and the score by Jerry Goldsmith is probably the best of the franchise.&&Also I will say they pulled off what seemed like an impossible task. Rebooting it, I mean. For all the issues people may have with them, I don’t think it could have been rebooted any better. &&I don't agree at all.

At any rate, I couldn't get personally immersed at all in Beyond because of the precise opposite-- Beyond felt like absolutely nothing more than an execution of formula. It may not have rehashed elements of older Star Trek films in the same way, but I can't think of anything it did that comprised unique storytelling or approach.

It's where you feel like they could have written the script as any action or sci-fi movie and the characters you know were inserted after the fact.

It's been such a great show but if they don't get the audience from Netfilx, which is a better audience than MTV, i don't know if it will last. &&""A spokesperson for Netflix said *Peaky Blinders* will remain on the service, uninterrupted."" Thank god.&&Sweet...  they can put the money towards another 5000 garbage titles nobody has ever heard of...&&> Weinstien

You had one job, OP...&&I’m forever salty at TWC for ending Marco Polo after 2 SEASONS which was one of the most underrated shows I’ve ever seen never be talked about.&&The real question is why should it have happened at all. Weinstein was removed from the company already, and in this company's catalog are countless classics, including Tarantino movies like:

- Inglorious Basterds
- Django Unchained
- The Hateful Eight

And Academy Award winners like:

- Citizenfour
- The King's Speech
- The Artist

And audience favorites like:

- Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny
- Sin City: A Dame to Kill For
- The Founder
- The Fighter
- Big Eyes
- Paddington

That's the work of literally thousands and thousands of talented people who had fuck to do with Weinstein's shameful and criminal acts, but they're all erased from history if you severe relationships with the company holding that IP.
&&Removed from Netflix: a bunch of awesome films created by many hundreds of talented people, but the co-owner of the company used his power to sexually abuse women.

Still on Netflix: Jeepers Creepers 3. Made by a few dozen talented people but directed by a man who fucked a 12 year old boy and filmed it, spent 18 months in prison, and continued to make films. 

Victor Silva paid his debt to society, it was a pathetic 18 months but he still paid.  Disgusting part is because nobody knows his name, Netflix gives zero fucks about removing the movie. 

Get accused of something and you’ll lose your career. Capture your assfucking of a 12 year old boy on film and it’s no biggie. 

Shame on every media company that fired someone for an accusation but left Victor Salva’s movies (Jeepers Creepers 1-3, Powder) available. 

Shame on every Hollywood star that shunned anyone falsely accused but agreed to work with Victor Salva. Rose McGowan, looking at you. 

Bunch of fucking hypocrites. &&Ah. Even fewer movies and series on Netflix to watch...
Edit: Words :)&&Did ANYONE read the article? This is 0 to do with ""Harvey"" or any of that, it's about the company going bankrupt and Netflix not having to accept/pay for shows/movies, basically Netflix gets to terminate their contract and not have to accept new movies/shows from a bankrupt company.

When the dust is cleared the company that owns the rights to the Weinstein movies will likely make a new contract with Netflix. &&I'd better hurry up and watch hateful eight before it gets removed from Netflix. &&Using the Peaky Blinders picture just scared the shit out of me. I was about to flip a table if they took that off. &&Scared me for a sec with the Peaky Blinders in the thumbnail&&This is just a move for Netflix to shed movies from 3rd party sources. Anything to do with Harvey Weinstein is just a favorable coincidence that they’re using as an excuse. &&So now there's even less to watch on Netflix&&So what does this mean?

Whew. Thank god. &&All this hypocritical type talk, it really just looks like the board are filing bankruptcy and strip mining the company, it looks better for netflix if they part ways before a company they do a lot of business with disintegrates. Obviously if the company who sells them the IPs doesn't exist then contract renewals can't happen. All that's happening is a middle man being removed, another one will soon take their place.&&PEAKY ""FOOKING"" BLINDAHS!!&&I Almost had a heart attack.

Which wouldn't actually make much sense anyway, since they've terminated their relationship with him.

Even assuming that they still have a stake in the company, they're not likely to see any value from it. Every attempt to buy the company has failed due to its looming debt.
&&Good. Because otherwise it would be horrendously unfair to everyone who worked under Weinstein company&&Well, the bankruptcy probably has something to do with the fact that Harvey Weinstein is now radioactive and very few people would work with him.&&Is it the ""we are restructuring the company"" bankruptcy or the ""we have lost everything and have no hope of recovery"" bankruptcy? &&Basically what's happening is Lantern Entertainment recently acquired Weinstein Co.'s assets.

The agreement is not “terminated,” it’s assigned to the buyer of Weinstein Company’s assets.

No, they aren't.&&>That's the work of literally thousands and thousands of talented people who had fuck to do with Weinstein's shameful and criminal acts, but they're all erased from history if you severe relationships with the company holding that IP.

This comment shows how badly the article misrepresented the situation. **The Weinstein Company no longer holds the IP.** It was sold to another company. And if you look at the actual filing by Netflix linked in the article, Netflix is consenting to allowing their contracts to be shifted over to the buyer. The effect of this is literally the opposite of what you’re saying: by this agreement, Netflix is *preserving* its relationship with the new company that will hold the IP. &&> Weinstein was removed from the company already

From stories that we heard their entire board was corrupt and fully aware of Harvey's behavior. It's very much possible that Netflix knows more than general public and wanted to leave that deal ASAP.

As for movies, as the company does go down, someone will buy rights to them. &&I get what you're saying, and I'm a Netflix fan, but I'm not yet willing to equate removal from Netflix with erasure from history.&&That's not how history works&&I’m not familiar with any of the films you mentioned.

Who have already been paid for their services and can continue to work in the film industry.  And those known for their work are known for their work outside of the name of the company.

It's not this life-or-death struggle you make it out to be, and I'm glad that a media-delivery entity has decided to take a stand on the ethical side with actions rather than simple words of condemnation.&&Pretty sure it has to do with the company and bankruptcy, don’t think it was actually about Harvey Weinstein&&Had no idea who he was and had to look it up. How the fuck does he still get work? &&Valid points. But nothing to do with why Netflix chose to drop their contract. Weinstein is potentially looking to declare bankruptcy and financially is no longer a viable vendor to work with.&&But read the article. Netflix wasn’t trying to make a statement. This has to do with discharging certain obligations in the bankruptcy proceedings. If Netflix were trying to take a moral stand, the timing right now would make no sense. 

Edit: Gave you an upvote though. Because your point is still spot on. &&Lol that's cute you think they did this because he was a rapist.

The company basically had internal memo for fines for Harvey's transgressions. I can't remember exact numbers but like: ""first offense you have to pay this amount of money, second offense you have to pay this amount of money, etc.""

They all knew about his abusive behavior and tried to control him through some bullshit system of internal fines.

They are all complaisant in this. &&Didn't literally everyone know of Weinstein's behavior though? &&The NYTimes article that originally reported on it wrote about this. They showed that assistants were being used in these exploits, the higher-ups were more than aware, and that it wasn't even an ""open secret"" so much as a known factor in the company.&&... that's not how contracts work.&&as I recall, we both kinda liked it&&Breakfast at Tiffany's?

At least get Steven Graham to play Al Capone&&I always thought a [Capone spin off would have been so good transitioning from Boardwalk Empire](#spoiler), maybe this could scratch that itch.&&He was an extremely clitche example of a mafia boss, almost to the point of being cartoonish, in fact. 

It's like as if he watched The Godfather and Harvey Birdman the Flintstone's episode and decided to do a hybrid of the two protagonists with a heavy emphasis on the cartoon one. &&Dude. It was amazing acting, And the story was fantastic. Just enjoy &&I actually liked him, but I think the cinematography and art direction did him a lot of favors, too. Now that you mention it, I can see how some might find his performance as campy, but in the moment, while I was watching that season, I was into it.&&Tommy will do what tommy does u heathens&&Tbh I totally thought they had that kinda of campy characterization on purpose. 

Like how in mob movies they're always roll your eyes intense so you're not really scared of them you just like watching. Adrien Brody's mob was just as campy but actually scary. Makes you want to write him off as a nonthreat which is what the Blinders do at first until realizing they might be in over their heads. I freaking loved it&&Read it: the sun is now blue &&Not sure if his character died too, but I'm pretty sure he was dying of consumption or cancer or something.

The protagonist is Tommy, the middle brother of a family of Gypsy's that fix races while avoiding the larger gangs. They're known as the Peaky Blinders for their signature peaked-billed hats with razors blades sown into the cap to use as a weapon. Having survived the horrors of France, Tommy has no fear of the larger gangs so he decides it's time to increase the family's fortune and play some deadly games with even more deadly enemies. 
The show also follows the ultra-religious Protestant police Captain sent in from ~~Dublin~~ Belfast to Birmingham for nefarious reasons.

>According to the contract, if Weinstein ""treated someone improperly in violation of the company's Code of Conduct,"" he must reimburse TWC for settlements or judgments. Additionally, ""You [Weinstein] will pay the company liquidated damages of $250,000 for the first such instance, $500,000 for the second such instance, $750,000 for the third such instance, and $1,000,000 for each additional instance.""

>The contract says as long as Weinstein pays, it constitutes a ""cure"" for the misconduct and no further action can be taken. Translation -- Weinstein could be sued over and over and as long as he wrote a check, he keeps his job.&&It was parodied even earlier than that, in the show Action! with Jay Mohr. (1999)

The show was fantastic, had A-list celebrity cameos, and was cancelled after the first season - as season that ended with an episode parodying the Weistein brothers.

No one went for Harvey when he was king Midas despite all his predatory behaviour.

Hopefully Superman makes a cameo. &&I just want a wholesome superhero movie.&&This looks humorous &&I hope this is campy as fuck and hilarious.

I really hope they make him act like a kid but in a man's body with Superman's powers (like they did in Young Justice), instead of that edgy pre-teen crap we got in the animated movies...

Please don't fuck this up DC. &&/u/dauid you guys couldn't get a Coke sponsorship?&&Okay, this actually makes me feel optimistic. 

I'm a huge Captain Marvel fan (Shazam! whatever) and this looks like it could be capturing the feel of the comics, or at least the comic run I got into. Fun, light, with humor and heart. I really hope that that is what they're going for.

But I'm being super cautious and not trying to get my hopes up. :D

There's this whole plotline where the main character (Billy) learns to consider his adopted siblings his family. There's a few other heartwarming things scattered throughout IIRC. Haven't read it since it came out.&&Not to detract from Shazam, but Ant-Man and the Wasp is super wholesome, if you haven't seen it yet.&&Homecoming is pretty wholesome. Peter is anyway &&It should be... I mean it's Shazam, a 15 year old kid given Superman body and powers at the say of a magic word. The first photo shared (him sipping Iced tea) by the Shazam actor was funny as well.&&""I'm something of a superhero myself""&&Same. This needs to be as lighthearted and fun as possible. &&""Nice costume, did your magic genie make it for you?"" &&Go web go! Shazam!&&If they are going for a more silly, light hearted, then blue and gold would fit perfectly. &&Booster Gold is in my top 10 list of DC heros.&&I grew up with Giffen's JL and I love every single character that passed through it. I guess it's nostalgia, but to me, there are characters that could never be written as well as Giffen wrote them. Deep, wholesome characters. They were silly but they also kicked ass. Best Martian Manhunter ever, for example. Man, when Despero showed up, it got heavy! I loved it.&&Yoo yes Plastic Man would be great. I hope it's first shown in the background through the media ads and commercials he would be in then we actually meet him &&The first 2/3ds will be great and then the climax will be an overly orange tinted explosionfest with bad CGI.

Probably. 

(Just like Wonder Woman.) &&I’m with ya! With the several missteps they’ve had, I’m certain they will find away to mess this up.&&I think the director mentioned the buttons holding the cape on (those have to have a more technical name) have Tawny on them&&I hope we get a mister mind cameo.  (The evil tiny worm)&&Look at Shazam, his costume is cosplay level.



Edit: I meant that as a good thing &&Working on the show right now. Getting to the end of season 4 and despite some nice plot happenings I can see why it started to fall out of favor.

I'm not that well versed on that but it seems they're always unequivocally extremely enthusiastic. &&Nice to know that the audience was funny, but what about the movie?&&Noooo ooonneee saves like Captain, no one flies like Captain, no one drinks cola from a can like Captain. &&Would be the best thing ever if he came in to give advice or something&&They will. They based this on Johns run, I just hope Billy is not an asshole. Because he was a kid who was just like a last option of the wizard in that comic.

The movie seems to be going for the silly look.

Nah of course it’s supposed to be silly. &&He's still confirmed and there's no reason there would be a cast change in the foreseeable future.&&Came too far to see this reference. &&Charles* Carmichael.  I miss Chuck ):&&S (Sinbad)

It is literally a kid doing what kids do, thrown into things far larger than what he likely is mentally capable of. If they play that up, even including getting freaked out by girls and 110&#37; missing cues while being flirted with, by humor alone this movie could actually do well.

I cannot believe I have more faith in a light-spirited Shazam film than the majority of the DCCU.&&There was a JLA storyline where a demon called Nekron was granting favors for souls trying to become the most powerful demon ever. He tried to tempt Captain Marvel to get his soul but Captain Marvel couldn’t be tempted. Captain Marvel then gave Nekron his soul willingly to spare the souls of his teammates. The innocence of Billy’s soul, combined with the way it was given, was enough to destroy Nekron.

Edit: Neron not Nekron.&&So hes Andy from P&R? &&In Dark Knight Returns Gordon mentions to Bruce how he was fooling them all those years by having Alfred bring him sparkling cider instead of alcohol when Alfred would bring drinks &&Batfleck shared a scotch with WW in Justice League movie.&&In Batfleck movies he's a drinker tho.

Also he's his foster-brother.  Or he's Shazam, but not the wizard, Shazam--that's Shazam.

Like, *they know* how it's supposed to look, they absolutely nailed it, but they just didn't bother? What the shit?&&This and it was really the first wave of comic book movies. It was smart to ""ease"" into the comicness of it all. Especially when those films/comics actually have some very heavy social themes which leads them to have a weird serious but still ""comicbook"" tone.&&I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I think Fox absolutely did the right thing for that time by scrapping the original costumes. After *Batman & Robin*, the general audience had no interest in bright, colorful superheroes, dismissing them as childrens entertainment, so Fox instead capitalized on the success of *The Matrix* by pretty much saying ""Hey look! It's not a 'comic book movie', it's an action movie featuring sexy people with powers and cool black leather costumes!""

Fortunately, we are past that now, and can see movies that aren't ashamed to show their  comic book roots.&&Did they sort of do the ultimate x-men look? A lot of movies from that era kind of felt more like ultimates universe, even Hawkeye in avengers&&It's important to note that X-Men paved the way for more colorful comic book superhero movies that followed.

At the time the first X-Men came out, studios and audiences still had a bad taste in their mouths from the Joel Schumacher Batman films.&&I'm still amazed they were able to keep Logan's hairstyle so close to the comics and not have it look absolutely ridiculous.&&He stopped making videos?!

Nope. Just a regular ass mustache he could have grown in a month.&&Reminds me how after Justice League flopped a redditor came and wrote something along the lines of ""I have an insider in WB who just told me that based on the results of JL WB is scrapping all movies, even those like Aquaman who were already in production...""

So it became more and more piecemeal the later it got. The show’s characters were still so good that I cried at the end. I truly missed them, when it was over.

I would gladly have suffered through many more poorly written seasons for a chance to enjoy the main characters longer. I have other favorite well written shows also with great characters like Leverage and Burn Notice, but Chuck has my all time favorite characters. Such a brilliantly silly heartfelt adventure.

I ate an ungodly amount of Subway sandwiches during the campaign between S2 and S3.

Almost all of DC needs that. Superman, the Flash, Green Arrow. All of them are often cheesy, and lighthearted. Delivering one-liners and being enjoyable to watch.

Man, I loved that movie.&&I'm so fucking glad this comment isn't a cruel joke. &&Man, I want to look forward to it, but based on everything they've said about it (which isn't much), I'm scared that it's basically gonna be a soft reboot and fall flat. There's gonna be another time skip, the original team is going to be taking a minor role so that they can focus on mostly a new team, and it's only airing on the WB's exclusive streaming service (which could kill its ratings severely even if the season is considered good).&&""PUT THE COOKIE DOWN! NOW!"".&&Yes, actually.&&Psylocke's costume in Apocalypse is pretty much identical to the comics though, so the later X-Men films started to embrace the aesthetic.

Then by Days of Future Past they dulled it down again.&&It's kind of tough to really stick close the comics for a ton of female characters.&&Eh, I disagree.  They looked like the 90s PowerRangersTheMovie versions of the 90s costumes.  What I mean is they had like stupid armor padding and whatnot.  Deadpool actually nails every X-Men costume better than any of the X-Men movies have.&&also, the daredevil movie followed the comics a lot, and they look super silly&&Except Spider-Man came out right after X-Men and was a resounding popular and critical success. As usual the explanation is, make a decent movie and the audience will lap up the comic book charm. &&I was managing a movie theater when the firat Xmen films came out, and when pics of the uniforms first appeared, they came with rhe explanation that bright yellow and dark blue outfits looked bad in tests, so they went with what we saw. I'm not sure how true it is, but they did give a reason at the time, because they knew people would complain. &&Nick Fury as well&&What's weird is Wolverine isn't even the only comic book character to have that awkward haircut. Beast, Quicksilver, The Owl, and also Timber Wolf at DC all have variations on that haircut.&&Mmmmm dat face plate&&Slap on a leotard and some gloves, make a frame for your face out of cardboard too. This is gonna look rad. &&Swimsuit on top of full body spandex. Supers are so weird. &&Not gonna lie, I was a little disappointed when I saw the costume she wears in the MCU. Yeeaaaaaah, it's a million times more believable and realistic, but it's a *comic-book movie*, so realism isn't the main thing I'm looking for. Ultimately, it's the portrayal that matters, and Olson is, aside from her inconsistent accent, great in the role.

Conversely, I was initially thrilled when I heard that Psylocke's costume was going to match the comics and it looks completely ridiculous in the movie. Maybe some of that is emotional carryover from hating everything about the movie, but it still just didn't work.&&I understood that reference&&To add on to his uncanny resemblance, Cahill actually does have a real passion for Superman and the charisma to pull him off. &&Seriously, the dude is like a cartoon that got made into a person, and they're completely fucking it up. When are we gonna get chills from him like we did when Superman was beating/talking to Darkseid? &&No, you are not a bad person for wanting a First Thunder movie.  You are the best person in this thread.&&*David Sandberg is on set directing a scene, when suddenly his phone buzzes*

That movie is rather dated by pop culture standards.  &&Yep. A lot of DC characters are humorous. WB probably chose to greenlight this project for that exact reason. They need a more light film. 

I loved the comic which this movie is gonna be based from. It was both really emotional and funny to me.

I’m looking forward for that Daley & Goldstein’s Flash movie as well because I think the character hasn’t been quite done right. The CW made him too serious, and the JL overdone his goofiness.&&SMASHING!&&What do you want them to do? CGI it out? Because we know how's it going to turns out. &&Yea like him being ares is a cool twist, but have it be a human facade, and then bring out the fire and brimstone ares as something else. We didn't need a buff David Thewlis.&&My major complaint was that there was actually an ares at all. The whole movie was leading up to the idea that human nature is just violent. that last act was seriously out of place compared to the rest of the film and I can only think that it was a corporate decision and not a directorial one to have Ares be alive. I can just picture a higher up in a suit saying to Patty Jenkins, ""No, you can't end it like that. In order to finish the film we need a final battle with a ton of CGI.""&&I would’ve preferred that there is no big bad, and Diana’s biggest challenge is learning to accept that humans should be protected despite their flaws. I really felt like they had a great set up to that when the town gets gassed and Chris Pine is telling her that humans can just be really shitty regardless of nationality... and then they throw it all away by revealing that there actually IS an Ares who is behind everything.

I get that a massive superhero blockbuster without a satisfying final battle is ambitious for DC to sell to audiences. I also understand that they tried to keep the spirit of humanity’s violent side by including a few lines about how humanity would have started the war without Ares anyway. I just don’t think it was GOOD. &&Wait, I thought Crusty Old White guys were the Nazi officer's of our time? With regards to movie villains of course.

In IW she doesn't have it because they are on the run and it's far easier to tell someone is a foreigner with a Sokovian accent than someone who uses an American one, so to blend in she did that.&&The MCU tries to balance style and realism, and there's just no way to make that outfit look like something she would decide to wear. The costumes she's using in the Avengers movies are pretty stylish in their own way though.&&I think Elizabeth Olsen said she wasn't really comfortable with the idea of wearing Scarlet Witch's costumes from the comics, given how revealing and impractical they are. Marvel explicitly told her she'd never have to wear the red bathing suit when she took the role. I'd love if they gave her a more theatrical and comic book-y costume, like her newer [costume](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/4943622-tumblr_ny9kioql1w1re8ijgo1_1280.jpg). It's sexy without being insanely revealing, it doesn't require her to wear what amounts to a red leotard and maybe some tights, and it'd be way more believable and easier to recreate. I think they could even make that design of her tiara work, it'd be awesome to see it. &&You know why you got that reference.

Diana would've had to live with that fact but continue to be a shining example regardless. &&But also Shazam is portrayed as INSANELY buff like most heros. Looks like they’re trying to go for that even if the muscles do look puffy. It’s a kid’s idealized version of what a superhero looks like.

Even Tom Hardy can’t get that big. Only people that big are pro body-builders. &&Except Shazam the character is supposed to be the same physical size as Superman, if not bigger. He is listed as 6''3 and 220lbs +.

Henry Cavill went from a massive transformation of being slim/lean to jacked for Superman, actors these days are expected to bulk up for the part, especially superhero actors.

Shazam and Black Adam are also supposed to be the same size. So they need to make Shazam look as big as Henry Cavill's Superman and Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam.&&I love the last episode, how it was done to reflect the first episode. The cinematography, etc.&&I kind of loved the subway stuff.  Very similar to how 30 Rock and community handled their sponsors.  Seems less creepy when marketing is overt and part of the comedy. 

I’m just so thirsty for a cuke thinking about it. It’s heaven in a can. &&I didn't think in this point of view, welp you're right x)&&Big is one of my favorite Tom Hanks films! Such a classic! Got to play on the 'BIG' piano at FAO Schwartz a few months before they closed forever. Check that off the bucket list.&&I grew up on Big (as well as too many other movies)!  I remember being freaked out by the Zoltar machine for some reason&&The main character is a kid that turns into an adult like Shazam, too. And it's got lots and lots of wicked puns that would make translation a nightmare.&&Actually, the average price for a lego piece is 10 cents. The more you know&&I would laugh if this wasn't so sad, being the kid with no Lego at all while some of my friends had gigantic amounts of Lego sets.&&Its funny that Batman and Robin is still one of the most colorful superhero movies out there.&&Christ, imagine a gritty psychological deconstruction of Shazam, Snyder-style.

""I'm a man... but it feels wrong. WRONG!!!""&&It doesn't have to be considered like Marvel just because it isn't dark. &&Did... did you forget about Wonder Woman?&&From the basic premise alone, Shazam just doesn't work as a ""dark"" film.  I don't think Nolan could pull off a Capt Marvel movie.  &&Are you saying Tom Hanks isn't Superman?&&Sweet. I hadn't heard of Shazam before and actually got it mixed up with Shaq's Kazaam, so that's good to hear &&If his character actually had sex with his gf in Big, then technically he got laid at 12.... AhNiiiice!&&...in a sweet loft in Manhattan. Paid for with an executive job I got with a fraudulent SSN and no resume.&&Ah, the 80's were a different time.&&Depends on the storyline, but typically no. It causes friction with the team if/when they find out, so he keeps it secret.

Look up the scene in Flashpoint Paradox where Wonder Woman finds out he’s a bunch of kids and the ramifications of that...&&For a long time Shazam was treated very poorly in the comics because DC had a grudge against Fawcett Comics for being more popular. For years Shazam (then Captain Marvel) outsold Superman comics. Elvis Presley even styled his half-cape after Captain Marvel Jr. then later, FC fell on hard times and DC bought the company and their characters.

So, knowing that and liking Shazam can be a roller coaster in DC. For a while he was in JSA. He, a 13 year old boy, developed a crush on another teen superhero, Stargirl, a 13 year old girl. Except no one but Stargirl in the organization knew that Shazam was actually 13. They thought he was some 25 year old man. So he was faced with either revealing his biggest secret to a group of masked vigilantes, or quit with them thinking he was a pervert. He quit the JSA.&&Generally his identity gets found out to flesh out interactions with the rest of the heros. There's actually a really good animated movie about Shazam, I'd say it's one of the better animated movies, its this one

That deleted scene in The Wolverine and all...&&lets face it, comic accurate Wolverine looks like a mexican luchador. &&Costume Designer: What're we making?

Director: One piece swimsuit with thigh highs and some long gloves.

Costume Designer: I'm out

Director: Wait wait wait... Also with boob armor ***and*** boob window

Costume Designer: You had me at boob.&&Make it as short as black panther's ears&&Such a great pun. Mauve along people, nothing can top that. &&Oof&&Impressive, Very Nice.&&Ha! 🤣&&Take your upvote and get out. &&thats just his super villain alter ego Rapeman&&It's funny how that evolved. They cast her just before she blew up into one of the biggest stars in the world. Once it was obvious she was  going to be a far bigger draw than anyone else in the franchise they were sort of obligated to make her a focal point, even tough Mystique was rarely important beyond as a side character in the comics. It would be like casting Chris Pratt to be Yondu, and then realizing after you started filming that he actually should be the lead of your franchise.&&I don't think it's ever in question whether they're familiar with the source material (I guarantee you they are provided access to archives of material, consult time to talk about the character with people involved in those comics, etc), but rather that every creative department has a discussion of whether that source material is appropriate for their take on the stories.  Sometimes, for a host of reasons, it's not.  The 90s style of skin-tight latex-looking costumes don't work in theater film because they can come off as fetishist.  The filmmakers have to balance making the film in such a way that fans familiar with the material can recognize the familiar while also experience something new--and still make that work for people who are generally unfamiliar with the source material.  

Take Thor Ragnarok, for instance: they revamped looks of many characters from the comics, but the scenery/settings were deliberately made to look like they were drawn from Kirby's vision.  That gives people an opportunity to be the person who 'understood that reference' and also temper the otherwise hard-boiled tone that would come with Planet Hulk material.  &&My main problem with her is that personality-wise her character is completely different from the comics. Lawrence seems to young to play the character, and she just completely lacks any real gravitas.&&I don't care for Lawrence as Mystique at all, costume or otherwise.  I liked the mystique from X-Men 1 & 2. &&Wasn't she wearing a bra and panties for half the movie?&&She had also been living with Americans (and Vision) for a few years, so she might have started to pick up their accents. &&But it was inconsistent even in Age of Ultron and Civil War.&&I've come to really dig it because the character is so good. I like her a hell of a lot more than Hawkeye or Black Widow at this point.&&Exactly, Wanda busting out an outfit like that in the movies would raise eyebrows from the movie crowd, and induce eye rolls from the more casual comic book fan base.&&That's what you get when you have Zack Snyder as a director.&&The Wisdom of Solomon, the Strength of Hercules, the Stamina of Atlas, the ~~Power~~ Ping Pong of Zeus, the Courage of Achilles, the Speed of Mercury.&&> Who doesn't love Zachary Levi.

Marvel, evidently.

Poor Fandral...&&So far I like the humor of the Director as well. Some of his posts are definitely funny. &&My question is: is that the suit, or has Zachary been doing nothing but lifting weights since Chuck&&Yeah, Geoff John's Shazam run in New52. It is only 1 issue. It baffles me it wasn't continue. Read it. It is good. This picture is in the comic as well. Also, the costume looks new 52 as well. I honestly find it funny/amazing how most of the cast looks like their characters in that exact comic. Freddy and Mary castings (look-wise) is perfect.&&Hahahah. Shit son. I know this is just a joke, but Snyder said Injustice was never gonna happen. The knightmare scenes are basically Injustice, but a timeline that is gonna be prevented from happening.

But to be honest, I like Kingdom Come's Billy (Obviously don't do this too early WB. Fuck. I love Death of Superman, but you did it too early so I hated it). 

Even though he was darker there, I liked him. Obviously he wasn't a kid anymore, and he sort of became with the villains, but I liked that arc. Also made sense to me that Lex Luthor would be able to brainwash a kid. &&It should have been a huge-ass God-Like CG character. Mustachio was lame.&&With fire eyes.

Its really not that hard.&&Yeah I know. He's like the rob liefield captain america. Body proportions are all out of whack. &&I think you nailed it. Captain Marvel isn't supposed to look realistic. With Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, their costumes have a deeper meaning. The kryptonian family crest, the ancient armor of the gods, the psychological manifestations of fear. Shazam is just a kids idea of what a superhero should look like without grasping any deeper meaning. He wouldn't look like this if a 30 year old man was given the powers. His image when he transforms is a manifestation of how he sees other superheroes. Of course it looks goofy.&&Getting as big as The Rock is out of the question lol&&I don't think they're going to be comic accurate since Affleck is noticeably taller than Cavill but in the comics Superman is taller. &&Height wise Levi (6'3"") and Dwayne Johnson(6'3""-6'5"" it's debated) are about the same height.  Muscle padding plus light CG could do the rest of the work. Levi also has a a year or two to get a tiny bit buffer before the sequel with Black Adam. Also not everyone can bulk up to the same size as everyone's body is different.&&My headcanon is that [the entire series is Chuck explaining to Sarah how they met and fell in love after she lost her memory.

Isn't comic-accurate wolverine like 5'2?&&Nightman.&&Yeah, Apocalypse really suffered from the Mystique focus (everything but First Class did actually imo but Apocalypse was the worst) &&To be honest I think DoFP managed to utilise her stardom really well. Mystique was an important part of the film, as her deciding to kill would essentially trigger the Sentinel program. She was important to the film, but not the main focus as there was so much else going on. 

As well as Mystique having a great character arc we also have the two timelines story with Wolverine at the centre, a continuation of First Class with the rift between Charles/Magneto/Mystique, a future war, some political drama, and all topped off with the cool Quicksilver scene. 

I think we all take for granted how good the script is in that movie really is. Apocalypse on the hand is a different story...&&> The filmmakers have to balance making the film in such a way that fans familiar with the material can recognize the familiar while also experience something new--and still make that work for people who are generally unfamiliar with the source material.

This was true before Marvel Studios flipped the bird to the conservative approach and went full-blown comic book. Rather than try to change the character to fit the world they created (X-Men, looking at you), they build a world where the audience is convinced the character can exist.

Captain America is a great example. *Look at his stupid costume,* they said; *no way that it can work on screen*. Yet Marvel builds a world around the character where his costume not only fits with the story, but enriches the story. Steve Rodgers actually states what everyone is thinking, that his suit is old-fashioned and, citing the implication, really silly looking in modern times. Coulson is right there with the slam dunk quote, that given what is happening in the world, everyone could use a little old-fashioned. Just like that, his silly costume becomes a symbol of what he stands for. The audience no longer thinks it looks silly. With one Phil Coulson quote, they're now proud to see him wearing it.

All the X-Men movies needed to do was to endear the audience to the colorful suits in the same way. Here is a quick example of how easy that could have been:

**Scene: Danger Room Interior**

Most of the X-Men have gathered to discuss [insert dramatic situation the team needs to deal with]. They all have their black leather tactical gimp-suits on and everyone in the room looks ready for war. Wolverine steps to the front of the group, lighting a cigar.

**Wolverine:** *I'm not Chuck.*

He stops in front of Cyclops, who curls his lip in disapproval.

**Wolverine:** *Yeah, I know, kid. But if the Professor were here, he'd want to remind you all that this rescue is just as much about the humans we're attacking as it is about the mutants we're going in there to save. For every human aiming a rifle at your head, there's a thousand more of them watching on YouTube waiting to see what you plan to do about it-*

POP! Wolverine is interrupted by a loud snap at the back of the room. All heads turn toward the back, where the young mutant Jubilee is loudly chewing bubble gum. Standing out against the sea of black leather, she is wearing a bright yellow trenchcoat, a pink graphic tee, and Chuck Taylors. Her glare is narrowed at Wolverine. Tension is palpable.

**Jubilee:** *I want to make sure I have this straight, Logan. I'm supposed to be afraid? Afraid to lose control of my powers while fighting against the government-sanctioned genocide of my species? Afraid to do everything in my power to free other mutants from imprisonment and slavery? Afraid because a handful of BLOGGERS might accuse us of forming an army against humankind?""*

Another loud snap of gum. Wolverine shifts his gaze to Cyclops, who seems to find this amusing.

**Jubilee:** *Newsflash! We ARE an army! And even if you wanted us to pretend like we aren't, you have us dressed from head to toe in tactical black leather like a bunch of Nazi stormtroopers. I say if we're going out there to prove that we're different than the humans we're trying to stop, we should LOOK different. The people you're talking about are always going to see us as freaks and weirdos anyway, it's not like yellow spandex is going to push them over the edge.*

Wolverine arches a brow.

**Wolverine:** *Yellow spandex?*

He sighs in defeat. Jubilee snaps another bubble and grins.

**Wolverine:** *Get on the plane.*

Jubilee skips past Wolverine, toward the Blackbird. The other X-Men follow behind her, talking excitedly about their costume ideas. Only Scott Summers stays behind, smiling wide at Wolverine.

**Cyclops:** *You know, I think she's right. If we keep doing this thing dressed like a black-ops military unit, people are going to be afraid. I don't know if yellow spandex is the answer-*

**Wolverine:** *It isn't.*

Wolverine grunts and heads toward the jet, flicking his cigar at Cyclops' feet. Scott frowns, but turns his gaze toward a blue and yellow flight suit hanging next to a rack of parachutes. He tilts his head, considering some costume ideas of his own.

**End scene.**

Hasty fanfiction aside, a scene like this works functionally the same way as the short dialogue between Cap and Coulson. You have a character (Wolverine) arguing what the audience initially thinks, that bright costumes are stupid, and a second character (Jubilee) making an endearing argument for why the bright costumes are necessary. Through the context of the scene, if I did my job right, the viewer should be inclined to agree with Jubilee and now the costumes become a part of what make the characters special. At this point, because of the great work done by Marvel Studios, superhero costumes are a big part of audience excitement and nobody thinks twice about bright colors or weird helmets.

Wish they would have taken a moment in the early films to create a scene like this, so that the X-Men wouldn't be limited to tactical Underarmor because of audience perception.&&To be fair, the whole point of First Class was to show these characters as young people just learning how to use their powers and what their place was in the world. The problem is that they are leap-frogging these people through time without aging up or replacing the actors. First Class was set in 1962, Days of Future Past in '73, Apocalypse in '83, and the upcoming Dark Phoenix sometime in the 90's. Most of these characters should be at least in their 50's by now and that's not even considering the fact that Magneto's powers manifested during his time in a Jewish concentration camp and Professor X is ostensibly the same age as him.&&A bra is just a corset’s poor low class cousin. &&I heard it was because she was training with Black Widow on becoming a better spy and fitting in with crowds. Having less of an accent would do that. And she gradually loses it throughout the films which would make sense if she’s learning. 

Whether any of that is actually true or just bullshit to cover up how much Olson changed it on her own is still up for debate. &&She started using brain powers, and then took on some accents of the people she brain powered.

Do you mean one collected volume? I seem to remember it ran as an ongoing story at the back of Geoff Johns' Justice League run for a little while. &&Sweet might check it out. Think I've only read Power of Hope and the Monster Society of Evil&&Literally just a dainty British man in a metal suit. What the fuk.&&Uh. Yeah, that would've been cool. Too bad that they have to show off the face if it's a somewhat famous actor... I hate that...&&He's like the general male body designs of parts 1-3 Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Part 1 in particular.&&True, but he should at least be as big as Cavill. Cavill made the transition from lean to jacked (went from about 175lbs to 200lbs).

I know The Rock has been a big fan casting for Black Adam for more than a decade now but in the comics/media he's always been the same size as Superman and Shazam.&&Pretty sure there's only a 1 inch height difference between them in comics, and even though Affleck is taller I think the films downplayed that quite a bit.&&Oh wow, that gave me goosebumps. &&Reminds me of my favourite DVD, *Watchmen Babies: V for Vacation*.&&Gotcha.&&don't forget MarvelMan who's basically a copy of DC's Captain Marvel and now owned by Marvel&&Actually they officially just went and changed the characters name to shazam.  The wizard is just called the wizard now.&&Or Marvel's other Captain Marvel, who's an alien dude.

A lot of it...&&I'm guessing he said that since I think you can only buy it as a collected edition since it ran as a backup story in New 52 Justice League.&&Thanks.

Good times.&&Dying is basically the Injustice timeline.&&Oh, I was talking about him giving a henchman a lit bomb and then dropping him down a hole to explode.&&I don't feel so good..&&Damn... 

It would have been cheesy as hell... But I still want to see it.&&I wonder if....jumping to Logan, where the actual comics are like history books... he dons that suit and that’s when the comics get written, with him wearing that. Then in Old Man Logan they’re in hiding. &&What could have been....&&I’d never seen that clip. Gave me chills. I think they need to just go for it, put him in the classic suit. It won’t be as stupid as it seems.

I’ll buy it, no problem. Hell, I watch a superhero movie and I get emotionally invested in the friendship between an angsty sentient raccoon and his ridiculously laconic tree bud. The Dark Knight has a dude dressed like a literal clown. Put Wolvie in the yellow, black, and blue and I’ll see it in theaters. Two times.&&Never seen that scene. Damn, would have liked to have seen him in it. Even if they just did some photos of it. Granted the case suit probably wasn’t a full suit, but still....&&Well he has to start with the full costume, but when he flexes the costume is ripped apart leaving just the mask. &&Comic accurate wolverine doesn't really look *that* bad [in real life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3wDj7bYve0&feature=youtu.be&t=240).&&He was never fat.

""This is fake! It isn't real, alright? Just a fairytale.""

*As he throws the comic to the ground, light from the window reflects off a page, the screen flashes and suddenly we are in the middle of a battle from long ago. A combination of lasers and bullets flash across the screen as Wolverine (dressed in the Original yellow costume) releases his claws, with a faint smirk on his face.*

""Always gotta be the show off."" Echoes Scott's voice. 

*Logan turns around, before realizing it was just a memory. Just a forgotten story. The smirk is gone, like so many other things.*&&Once Disney gets ahold of the XMen, this is likely to happen, considering how outlandish the costumes are in the MCU even without the XMen.&&So... you're saying that Hugh Jackman is.... Captain Kirk???&&The ears are definitely too silly.&&Yeah, calling him fat was a bit of an exaggeration on my part. He was definitely a bit stockier than he's portrayed now though, even in the comics. And I didn't mean to make it sound like he lost every fight he was in, I think they just used him getting beat up a lot to sort of lampshade his reckless nature and impulsivness in battle. Of course, a lot of Wolverines sleazier qualities became less wink-wink nudge-nudge as anti heroes started gaining popularity, so it's not like he's a radically different character now, it's just portrayed through a slightly different lense than it was at the time.

I haven't read an X-Men comic in like 10 years though, so I might be wrong. &&",2018-07-11 11:33:36

Arthur Conan Doyle *killed* Sherlock Holmes because the fans were driving him batty. 

That's the curse of success. &&Seems more likely that famous people will quit social media. Hell it is already happening.&&*sorts by controversial*

I'm going in.&&Imagine a world without twitter. &&Fans have always been toxic, but the media was intelligent enough to ignore it for the most part. Now ""journalists"" get paid by the click so they write/post/create articles about the most inflammatory subjects in their field. Thus exacerbating what's mostly a non-issue and also giving weight and validation to random internet person's random opinion. &&Christopher McQuarrie (Director of Mission Impossible:Fallout) doesn't want to make a superhero film because of this &&People got oddly defensive when that article about James Gunn defending Ahmed Best was posted yesterday. 

Edit:

https://reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8wktdx/james_gunn_sends_message_to_angry_star_wars_fans/&&Star Wars seems to be the primary example of this. Quite a few actors got heaps of abuse. &&As Spielberg has said: Original content is migrating to television / streaming services. 

It’s less expensive to make sequels and “genre” movies as much of the CGI is already rendered, thus larger ROI. 

Money Talks over Fan Satisfaction 

&&I'm not a big star wars fan but when I read about the abuse that little boy took for phantom menace it's fuckin disgusting. My son looks like he did in the film right now and to think of him being treated like that absolutely breaks my heart and I'd want to single handedly beat the shit out of those people. You just can't win with anything anymore. Everyone shits all over everything now.  &&On a brighter note: maybe we will get more original work instead of pimping to unappeasable fanbases?&&Was there fan backlash to Logan?!&&I don't see anybody turning down Marvel films.&&The outrage culture we're creating (or have created) is unbelievably toxic and isn't going to result in anything good. I'm seeing this in film, TV, games (dear god do I see it in games), whatever. Perfection or get the fuck out is pretty much the order of the day. Nobody can do anything right, nothing is ever good enough, everything is fucking awful except the very few things we deem to be OK (but even they better watch out!).

I don't understand what's so hard with seeing something, providing polite and constructive feedback and then voting with your wallet to see things change the way you want. Unfortunately instead we see people scream and rage from the high heavens about *everything*... before invalidating it all by forking over money for the next instalment of the series without so much as waiting for a review because maybe *this* one will be better or whatever other reason.&&Man on one hand I see what people did to Kelly Marie Tran and John Boyega and my blood boils.

On the other hand, I'm reminded of a Silent Hill: Revelations panel I sat in on at a con years ago (I was waiting for the next panel) and the director kept referring to Pyramid Head as 'Red Pyramid'. This was one of many things that just made it seem like he didn't get the content at all, and during the Q&A when fans were like 'hey why are you doing that' he got super indignant about it, to the point of just being unnecessarily rude. Like yes? I guess technically? He can be called that? But that's like referring to Nicolas Cage as Nicolas Coppola and that's just weird. &&Honestly, if a person needs to go and harass an actor/actress for a role they played then they are pathetic. Seriously... how much of a loser do you need to be to bully someone off of social media for a character they ACTED as.

&&That isn't fandom though. That's people with serious problems calling themselves fans as an excuse to be horrible people. They aren't being horrible because they're fans. They're being horrible because they're horrible people.&&No, they won’t. Because “genre” films are the highest grossing, best paying movies. So until “talent” starts hating money, I think everything will be just fine. &&On the topic of fandom hating... remember Ghostbusters?
The huge backlash against the all-female remake was largely blamed on misogyny, but in reality I don't think that was a movie anyone ever wanted, or asked for. It also turned out to be terrible. It was an uninspired concept from the get-go. Why not just make a separate movie ""inspired by"" Ghostbusters with an all-female cast and all-new plot?? That would allow you more creative freedom to make something beautiful.&&Wait, so if fans keep telling the creators that they don't like their characters, then they won't be able to continue to create characters that aren't being well-received?&&fuckin' hate these threads. just becomes a MCU/Star Wars shitshow, for the 8000th time this month. &&Wait why are Movie workers so sensitive ?? Oh no a bunch of nerds who live in their basement made fur of me while i make millions of dollars......oh heaven have mercy on their souls&&Of course that fandom is perfectly fine when it comes to blowing huge wads of cash on movies and merch though right?!

'We want all your money but none of your opinions.'&&Reddit needs to hear this. 

Now, let the downvoting commence!&&Also because most villains are one and done in films, so they aren't stuck in a 3-5 film contract for 10 years &&Also, playing villains is most likely to be a fun acting experience.&&Really? I think leto got a lot of personal backlash for suicide squad

However 50% of that was backlash towards the design choices etc. rather than his acting (the other 50%)&&Jesse Eisenberg disagrees&&I *still* remember Catwoman. 

I wish for the day that would make me forget. &&Michael Ironside once said he preferred playing villains because villains win several times in a film, while the hero only wins once, the last time.&&Cant agree there, people have been shitting on jared leto ever since suicide squad especially in the lead up to blade runner 2049. The movie was bad enough to overshadow him but some folks haven't let go.&&Having just read a bunch of comments about Ben Affleck in the new DCEU and seeing this I couldn’t help but think of his line from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back: 

Holden: The Internet is a communication tool used the world over where people can come together to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another.&&Perfectly balanced&&I hate having a voice

its awesome&&No no no. 

The internet is awesome because it gives everyone a voice. The internet sucks because everyone uses their voice. &&>  Arthur Conan Doyle killed Sherlock Holmes because the fans were driving him batty.

And then brought him back a few years later, because money.

It's a repeating cycle.&&Similarly, Agatha Christie grew to despise Poirot but fan and publisher demands meant she had to keep writing about him until she couldn't take it anymore and killed him off.&&Yes, but the Internet makes everything exponentially worse. Imagine the trouble you had to go through to heckle Sir Arthur back in his hey day. Now imagine if he was writing today and had a twitter account. &&Fair point, however the fandom around Star Wars in particular has gotten intensely toxic. As an ""original"" Star Wars nerd from back in the day, I'm appalled at some of the shit these guys/gals come up with. It's just fucked. You can't blame Mangold or any director for telling them to get fucked (in more eloquent ways of course)&&Nothing wrong about letting go of that nasty Twitter. It's always the firestarter.&&Maybe if enough famous people abandon Twitter, the whole Twitter-verse can collapse and leave the world blissfully Twitterless.&&[deleted]&&jeez. most of those idiots are like ""YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN'T CRITICIZE A BAD MOVIE!?!?!?! HOW OPEN-MINDED OF YOU"" when in reality, criticism is not harassment. If they think harassment is criticism, maybe I should tell them what I'll do to their family if they don't stop posting their stupid ideas on reddit, and to take it easy bro when they can't handle a little constructive criticism.&&Twitter is probably one of the worst things to ever happen to online discourse. It creates this philosophy that anything worth saying can be said in 140 characters, which is utterly wrong and quite destructive.&&The sooner hack journalists can no longer cherry pick tweets from complete nobodys to craft a narrative, the better. At least they will have to put some effort into being bad at their jobs.&&I’m imagining it. It seems quite nice. &&I don't have to; I've lived in it.&&One writer quotes three tweets and suddenly we have a narrative about tens of millions of people.&&Dude there are articles now proclaiming fan wars based off of a couple tweets, then ironically starting a war by giving it traction. It's ridiculous.&&Comic book guy trope has been around forever and trekkies/trekkers before that.  They’ve just been given communication tools.  That said, don’t acknowledge it but I swear journalists seek out toxicity.&&That, and modern social media lacks boundaries. It used to be that the bad stuff was contained, not drooling all over actor's instagrams or twitter feeds. 


Outside Outrage is a real problem. I am a Guild Wars 2 player and our game just had a rocky situation, but all of the game's social media got flooded with outrage that was from reddit/r/all and certain youtubers who build carriers on pointing to where people can go and latch onto drama. Marvel has had it's own share. Back when MCU was just starting out, there were regular articles from 'upset fans' and it was clear they didn't know the first thing about Marvel. One marvel sub that I was modding at the time got flooded with people bitching about   situation and had all the basic facts wrong. I don't know where it was coming from, but it was the first clear brigade I saw on this site. &&Has he been offered superhero films to direct?&&He’d be perfect for Green Lantern Corps or a Superman film. Oh well &&Every superhero film I’ve seen this year in theatres (Black Panther, Avengers, Ant-Man, Deadpool, Incredibles) all had a trailer for Mission Impossible and I’ve grown to greatly resent the film for this.&&People don't read anything but the sensational headlines and apply it however they want.&&Wait what’s this about &&The thing with fandoms is that in their mind they take ownership of what they love.  So instead of accepting and enjoying new content for what it is, they're disappointed when it's not what they wanted it to be.

You see it all the time with books turned into movies.  No matter how great the movie, it will never meet the expectations of what the fans imagined when they read the book.&&Star Wars is probably the only big fan base that has completely turned against its creator. You won't see MCU fans turning against Stan Lee or Harry Potter fans turn against JK Rowling. But the level of vitriolic hate that Lucas has gotten over the years is unimaginable.&&This is why Episode 7 was so conservative. As much as I hate JJ for what he did with Star Trek, I really am not sure if he could have done anything else with Episode 7&&I felt horrible for Kelly Tran, the asian character actress. 

She went as far as deleting her social media due to threats and abuse. You could tell she was a genuine fan of the series too.

Just because you think she is a bad actress, or think the movie was bad does not mean you should personally attack her. &&Worst bit is imagine the rollercoaster of emotion for the poor kid. He went from doing something that most kids could only dream of, to going through all that in. That's a hell of a long way to fall&&Didn't most of his hecklers come from school?  Kids his own age? &&>will drive smart, creative people out of wanting anything to do with big franchises. 

Yeah, to a certain extent that's not a bad thing. We have more than enough franchises and could get back to supporting the smaller guys a bit.&&No because Logan was actually good.

Same with Blade Runner 2049.

&&Joaquin Phoenix did&&Yah, but likely Affleck is getting out of the cape because of fan backlash. And the problems with BvS and JL have nothing to do with his acting.&&Jon Hamm did.&&Lots of people do. Weaving wouldn't come back. &&Marvels fanbase is being created with the current movies.  It's the next generation of Marvel movies that will have to deal with a fandom that feels they own Marvel and they better not screw it up.&&Worse, it has to be *my* specific definition of perfection. One of the weirdest things I saw about the backlash against the Last Jedi was that there were two camps who wanted precisely opposite things. How the hell are you supposed to appease people like that?!&&I think the majority aren't screaming their heads off on the internet about all this shit. But the minority, holy fuck, the minority. And I think they are able to inflate themselves so they seem like so many more people when they devote their lives to bashing actresses across all of social media and writing blogs for some cut rate review site that gets reblogged and retweeted and shared four hundred thousand times. 

But I think most people like or dislike movies and then they go on with their lives. Because they understand that entertainment isn't something worth pouring all this focus and rage into. They understand you don't need to build up the release of a movie into this moment that defines a point in your life and it must bring you, not just happiness, but pure elation and anything short of that is *literally an insult* and therefore the creators must pay by being ruined. 

I also think younger kids, in the teens and twenties are the ones who are so furious about this shit. I have some friends on Facebook and every week is a new circle jerk about how everything new is terrible and a cash grab and art is dead and corporate studios are ruining film and everyone who likes (insert video game/TV show/Movie/Comic here) is a brain dead, uncultured twat who are making this world a worse place. 

Sorry guys, someone liking Game of Thrones isn't going to bring fourth the end of the world. Although, spending time raging about stupid, meaningless shit on the internet and not paying attention to politics and not voting might. &&> I don't understand what's so hard with seeing something, providing polite and constructive feedback and then voting with your wallet to see things change the way you want.

How do you go about casting an informed ""vote with your wallet"" when the studio will only interpret success in terms of the profit made? If I see a new film or get a new computer game and it turns out to be offensively bad, I've still communicated to the studio or publisher that I'd like to see more of it.&&To be honest, I don't get why they even thought a movie like that would be a good idea. &&That's my take. Sure, directing superhero stuff can be risky but that is mainly because the directors often don't make the effort to understand the literal libraries worth of material. Having the Mandarin be a red herring is sort of creative but having the bad guys be exploding powered people just comes off stupid.&&What, you don't want to engage in a little fandom bashing to make yourself feel superior? C'mon, there's all kinds of toxic communities on reddit dedicated to bashing other communities. You have to keep the cycle of hate going! 

Give it a little try! Say something about how 50 people on twitter somehow make the entire fandom on reddit the absolute worst. Or why not try out a little self-flagellation! Talk about how you used to be a fan, but 3 dudes on instagram make you ashamed to like something because of guilt by association. Why not insult the masculinity of the people you disagree with? Perhaps you could make some sexist comment using the social stigma of male virginity as a sign of weakness. I bet they shave poorly too.

Life isn't going the way you planned? Maybe work isn't as fulfilling as you'd like? Happiness is only one toxic comment away! Get that happiness you want at the expense of someone else. No matter how bad you've got it, there's always someone out there who is worse than you!&&I was just about to make the same comment.  If you're using a built universe with an already large fan base to be able to dip into more pockets with your movie, you're dipping into more opinions, ones that are already biased towards the existing product you're borrowing from.

Should be obvious you do your best to stick to the source well or you're risking upsetting a core chunk of your audience.&&I mean, he says that, but any push will be met with a greater pull in the form of dolla bills. I would take a 10 million dollars and permanent fame and in exchange have to deal with a bunch of neckbearded losers threatening to burn my house down on instagram. Also, is reddit that bad? Most of the horrible comments are downvoted to the abyss.&&*Laughs in Tom Hiddleston*&&You're right, 4 more films with Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze probably would have been a bad idea.&&This is the one thing I hate about superhero movies. Especially Batman movies. Villains should be a plague that come back every so often with a bigger and better story line. Batman movies could last forever. If Ledger hadn’t died, we would have finally seen a villain come back (not that Scarecrow didn’t, but it just wasn’t the same). &&That's why the ""premium cable series"" has taken off. You can shoot a few episodes for a prominent series and then get killed off and going about your movie career.&&Oh please, that's literally what all of these actors/actresses want most of all.  In an industry where you can go from it-girl Lindsay Lohan to Lindsay Lohan in the blink of an eye, it's pretty damn reassuring to have a deal in place for 3 or more blockbuster films that'll keep your name alive for all the right reasons.   &&My grandmother made it big in theater (breadwinner levels, in the 50s) and I remember her talking about how much more fun it is to play the ""heel"" in a production. I also remember how she'd reminisce on my mom as a child pointing out how my grandmother was ""always evil at work"" as a dig when they argued, so milage may vary&&That was my understanding as well.  ""We need to revamp the joker, the last one was really good and we don't want to have to follow that.  Let's... do what's popular with the kids!  Give the Joker a grill, and Ha Ha Ha tattoos!  It will be ""gangster"" as the kids say!""&&There was the fact he got ""into character"" by like hiding condoms full of rat blood in his castmates' trailers and other antisocial shit.&&> Really? I think leto got a lot of personal backlash for suicide squad

Wasn't a lot of that due to him being an absolute fucking weirdo, and then calling it ""method acting""?&&Eh, I think it was mostly his ""acting"".&&Hard to blame ppl for only seeing the ZUCK every time he's on screen&&I thought it was a very bold choice for Eisenberg and the film makers to have Lex Luther transitioning from male to female during the film. &&That was simply bad EVERYTHING. I mean you couldn't really get any more worse than that. &&Leto did it himself by being method for a movie that really has zero need, look into the interviews of the crazy shit he pulled even at rehearsals and read troughs, from interviews I've read he was a giant douche being the joker all the time and that just made everyone else manic and weird.  &&Huh? Joker wasnt even the main villain for that movie. He wasnt even a villain really, barely a charecter tbh lmfao. If anything Suicide squad is the perfect example. Everyone shits on the movie for being awful, but no one (for the most part) brings up how awful Cara Delevingnes charecter was as a major critique of the movie. Everyone remembers the extremely rushed character backstories, the awful dialogue, etc.&&Suicide Squad deserved the backlash. &&His acting in Blade Runner 2049 was the weakest in comparison to everyone else in that movie imo. He needs to stop trying too hard. His Joker performance was cringeworthy to say the least. &&Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms yo. &&What the fuck is the internet?&&Look at these morose motherfuckers right here, looks like somebody shit in their cereal....&&He’s a great Batman. It’s a shame the Justice League movies are underwhelming.&&[Fictional characters!](https://i.giphy.com/media/BXjTZmuLz0zrq/source.gif)&&As all things should be &&Money and death threats. Same recipe that gave us The End of Evangelion&&I thought he was frozen and woke up in the 22nd century?&&Edit: Spoilers below for the final Poirot book, sorry.

Wasn't he the killer in the final book as well, or am I mistaken?&&Remember when Stephen King wrote a book about an author killing a character in his best-selling series because he was tired of it, and a fan ended up rescuing him from a car crash and torturing him because she loved that character?  


Anyone?&&Yeah but conversely imagine waking up and your mailman dropped of a couple hundred pieces of physical mail decrying your work&&Well i guess im sorting only by controversial. I want to be an angry depsising old man by the time im 26.&&Siskel: ""I have to admit, I enjoyed that movie. I'll go ahead and give it a thumbs up. If you're going to see a movie this weekend, go see this one.""

Ebert: ""I disagree. While the acting was fine and the writing had its merits, I would like to do horrible, unspeakable things to the director's family which I will describe in excruciating detail right now.""&&IMO Twitter is bad because it rewards inflammatory discourse. 

The more controversial you are the more people will notice you, this makes people go overboard with their opinions.&&This is by far the worst thing that has come of it. “The Internet is outraged!” Who? “ClamSlammer71” with 12 followers in Iowa? Who the fuck cares what they thought in 140 characters? How low a denominator are we really watching for? Picking four tweets and saying there’s a story there is lazy and intellectually dishonest. That and it’s lazy writing. “I’ll fill my graph quota with Twitter screen caps! I’m a genius” fuck those hack journalists&&I once decided to check out the twitter outrage about some movie character being black when the media reported on it, there was like 6 people in total complaining about it.

I can't remember what movie it was now unfortunately, but it made me not take any of that shit even slightly seriously anymore.&&Citing tweets in journalism seriously needs to die. Or citing tweets in general, who really cares what random influencer thinks&&And then it gets posted on reddit and everyone here treats it as reality, too.

Don't act like we're not part of the problem.&&Mean world syndrome on steroids. Same reason your local news leads off with a homicide 500 miles away, even though crime rates have been going down.&&Twitter EXPLODES as conservatives / liberals threaten to BOYCOTT (*popular franchise*).

Source: half a dozen tweets from random dickheads no-one's ever heard of.

The sad thing is that 'real' news organisations have started doing this kind of shit.&&Yeah it's almost a guarantee that journalists seek out toxicity. Just like they've always sought out the controversial, the gory, the divisive, whatever it was that would get the most people to pay attention. It's a lot easier that way, since the more negative types of humanity for whatever reason find it easier to voice their negativity and participate around negative topics than the positive people find it easy to voice their positivity and participate around the positive topics. I feel like it takes a special kind of journalist to take a more positive story and get it the same kind of attention that a negative story would get.

And yeah these people have always existed, but to add on to the statement about communication tools, it's a combination of both the rise of social media giving us a direct line of interaction with creators, the mainstreaming of ""nerd/geek culture"", and the anonymity of the Internet that has allowed them both the necessary tools and lack of fear required to be this nasty to people.&&> but I swear journalists seek out toxicity.

Because they do&&True, but creators also need to be honest with how small the social media fan base that is throwing shade at them is, compared to shear volume of people that see the film. 

The people that are douches are douches, but Rian has 950k followers. Clearly not all of them hate his guts. And clearly far more than that saw the film. &&> I swear journalists seek out toxicity

""If it bleeds, it leads.""&&Outrage Merchants on YouTube are the fucking worst thing in gaming right now.

Shitty games/ dev practices? Easy, don't buy it. But these fucks stir up so much shit that it's harder and harder just to talk about a game you like without mouthbreathers shitting up the place because their favourite talking beard whipped up some more outrage for ad money.&&the way social media in itself works is part of the problem. just look at what usually gets upvoted on facebook (and, tbh, reddit as well). commonly not nuanced, differentiated postings but instead everything is either (exaggeration on my part incoming) the best or the worst thing ever.

(with many people seemingly being accustomed to state something ""sucks"" when really they didn't actually hate it, they just didn't *love* it)
&&We don't know, but when someone on Twitter ask him if he wanted to do a Man of Steel Sequel with Henry Cavill he said he would love to do it! So then people ask him more questions about it and he clearly said he wanted to do it, but then Star Wars fan attacked him for defending Rian Johnson that's when he said he won't make a Star Wars or a Superhero movie because of the fan.&&I wouldn't be surprised, he's best friends with Bryan Singer &&But I never get tired of seeing Henry Cavill go into punching mode in that bathroom scene in every trailer.

I will see that movie JUST for that fight scene and dammit all if that scene disappoints me...&&But like... What else would you expect?  You see certain types of movies, you get certain types of trailers.  &&Yep. He even said that movies in general are open to criticism, but people took it as him trying to shut down criticism because, again, odd defensiveness. It was embarrassing to watch.&&I recommend you go over to /r/thanosdidnothingwrong and tell them your theory. 

Warning: There is a chance you would get banned.&&It's what happens when people make their hobbies / media they like **part of their personal identity**. When you do that, any affront to the thing you like is viewed as a personal attack on who you are; whether that be criticism of the thing you like, or the creators ""screwing it up because it's not what you wanted/expected"". Except there's millions of people into that thing, and they all have different expectations. Creators can literally never please everyone, and as something goes on longer and gains more popularity people will all like the thing for different reasons. When the reason *they* picked doesn't continue prominence, or just isn't executed how they wanted it, or is flat out dropped... well, rage.

The things we like make up who we are, but no one should ever define themselves by the things they like. They're a part of you and something you like based on who you are. They shouldn't be something that actually tells *you* how to be or act. Draw inspiration, sure. But not outright control.&&The problem is that now they feel like they can do anything they want. At a convention a person who didn't like a fictional pairing an artist drew, gave her a cupcake or something and it had a fucking needle in it. She tried to kill this other person citing ""You're a dirty pedophile for shipping that."" (It was an 18 year old character with a 20 year old character. Not even close to pedohilia) 

Fandoms can be terrifying.&&Eh, there's a decent contingent of Harry Potter fans who are disenchanted with JKR. After approving Cursed Child, defending Johnny Depp, and apparently leaving Dumbledore's love for Grindelwald out of the next Fantastic Beasts film, she's weathered her fair share of criticism.&&> You won't see MCU fans turning against Stan Lee

If they'd be turning against anyone, it would be Keven Feige.

The only roles that Stan Lee has in the MCU is creating the source material and showing up for his latest cameo. To get upset with him over anything that happens in the MCU would be like getting upset with Sir Arther Conan Doyle over any choices made in a new Sherlock Holmes adaptation.&&And now Lucas is starting to be respected again while the new Star Wars is being trashed on.

It's like poetry...&&7 played it boringly safe to the degree that it seemed like a ripoff or parody of 4. 8 played it completely unsafe and threw away or even shat on plot threads set up in the previous film, seemingly telling the audience they were idiots for thinking X or womdering about mystery Y, and wiped the slate clean to try set up its own new thing. 

Both films therefore got a fair amount of flak, often from the same folks. 

But no-one involved deserves hate-mongering or harassment over it. &&Imagine getting to be in a star wars movie and all people do is shit on you for it &&I hate that this happened. I didn't like Rose but the actress doesn't deserve any of that. &&And then, after being bullied for years by the world, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago and is in jail bevause of it. I really feel bad for him, the kid can't catch a break. &&So did Ava Duvernay. And Patty Jenkins. And Edgar Wright.&&He was actually the best part of BvS, but using him as comic relief in Justice League was a bad turn.&&There wouldn't be backlash if the studio and director could get on the same page. Not going in to who did what wrong but there was clearly some issues there that the press took advantage of. It was pretty clear in the films as well. Makes me sad since I thought he was a great fit for the role and there's so much potential that seemed to get wasted. &&Is that fan backlash or normal “hey I don’t want to be in shitty movies” regret?&&Which role? &&Well that is disappointing to hear. He would make a fantastic Reed Richards.&&I heard that was because he just hated wearing the makeup/mask. I believe Bale also said wearing the batman suit was why he was done after 3 even though he liked everything else about it. &&“You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.” -John Lydgate&&You don't support the ""more of it.""&&Lol, this would be great marketing for Reddit.

&&Too accurate. &&> Talk about how you used to be a fan, but 3 dudes on instagram make you ashamed to like something because of guilt by association.

That one. That's the one I think I hate the worst. You get people who are huge fans of something but insist they aren't part of the fandom, even though they talk about the thing a lot, make fanart, and go to the conventions several times a year. But they're not one of *those people*!

&&Yeah I think for the most part that's 100% true. 

I think though, there's probably at least a few quality actors who have enough work, and are already rich enough that they'll just say, ""ya know what? I don't need this shit.""

I think with Star Wars specifically I could see it happening. &&If Loki had been shit though, would they have brought him back so much?&&Loki was more of a gray character.&&TBF at least all of his interviews confirm he's a fan boy and has enjoyed doing the films. I'm partially hoping that instead of getting Loki as we he knew him back, we get ""Avengers"" Loki in modern day due to time travel shannaigns.&&[Maybe...](https://media0.giphy.com/media/ZphI1eKaJtkY0/giphy.gif)&&[deleted]&&*for you*&&Allow me to break zee ice.&&I would have been *cool* with that&&Ice to see you&&CHILL OUT it would've been a great idea :D&&I vould geeve dat contrrract offah dee cooooold shouldah!&&What killed the dinosaurs?

THE ICE AGE!&&It hurts even worse because of the genial dialogue he delivers when finally getting caught ""I think you and I are destined to do this forever."".&&Batman has enough excellent villains that they could come out with a new film every year for a couple of decades...&&I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure a lack of opportunity wasn't what turned it-girl Lohan into strung out Lohan. I think... I think it might've been drugs.&&> My grandmother made it big in theater (breadwinner levels, in the 50s) and I remember her talking about how much more fun it is to play the ""heel"" in a production.

You're grandmother wasn't in theater, she was a pro wrestler.&&Tangential rant, but why do characters being given tattoos in films have such fucking terrible tattoos? If you're trying to get the millennial crowd, you should know there's been a huge push of late for much better tattoos and far more people get them. Instead of that we just end up with shitty villains having terrible ""prison"" tats with tacky shit like damaged on it. Why?&&The whole design just made me think of the sort of thing a twelve year old would excitedly describe to his mother.

edit - got the name of the podcast wrong. fixed now.&&I never laugh while taking a shit, but you almost made me break that rule&&> from interviews I've read he was a giant douche being the joker all the time

From what I've read, Leto is a giant douche all the time whether he's playing the Joker or not.&&Doesn't help that he literally was the worst version of the joker ever. &&He was following ledger who played in method waters for his joker.  Every role should be given 100 percent, even in bad films.  The difference is in maturity.   Leto was immature.  &&I saw movie in theaters and we all laughed non stop at Cara dancing and moving her arms/villain part. it was so bad. that and the cgi for the flame at start of movie&&Well I think Cara delevigne gets a pass because she's not actually a professional actress. She's a model who was popular for a bit, made the jump to acting and failed. Leto, Smith and Robbie are all professionals who have done movies where they've shown that they actually can act, so it's a bigger failing on their part to underdeliver this badly. 

Also she's the ""one and done"" villain and is literally the least important part of the movie from a moviegoers perspective because it's the Joker and Amanda Wallace who are set up to be baddies in the future films. Also the Joker is a cinema icon and seeing a botched portrayal of a very famous character like this is just jarring.&&Hes known as the worst on screen Joker ever. &&Suicide Squad is up there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen.&&>Joker wasnt even the main villain for that movie. He wasnt even a villain really, barely a charecter tbh lmfao

So *that's* who was responsible for Series 4 of Sherlock!

One was a remake of 4, the next was dealing with issues of the previous one and added some new ones. Feels like someone should have had a plan, but didn't.

Take snoke (sp?) and Luke. They make the main characters irrelevant by simply being so much better. Writing that story takes finess. Neither movie has that. Darth and Palpatine had a way different power dynamic.

What SW lacks is a Kevin Feige. Someone that organizes everything and keeps everything on track. Love or hate MCU, but damn it feels like the most massive TV series of all time. The movies interconnect so well.

I agree, but that has nothing to do with Affleck. Yes, BvS and JL were let downs, but how is that at all Affleck's fault? Affleck actually did well(as good as those scripts would allow) playing Bruce/Batman.

But still the fan backlash is pushing him out(if the reports are true).&&Don't know. All I know is he said he turned it down because he didn't want to be tied to six movies.

*I say this from experience.&&Yeah, it seems like his douche setting is always as a 10, but he turned it up to 11 for filming. I feel sorry for Margot Robbie having to do another film with him. I'm not sure who else is going to have to - but if anyone lists their names, I'll feel sorry for them too.&&He's an asshole for playing the Joker ""Method"", then it's all down hill from there &&I've got a theory that it takes a traditional leading man type to play a great joker. With an actor who's already kind of scary or wierd, it doesn't work. Look at some examples.


Cesar Romero was the classic joker of the 60's Adam West days, and before that he was mostly cast as a *latin lover* type character, all suave and attractive like.

Mark Hamill was obviously Luke Skywalker, the hero type to end all hero types, and he's given the most influential and beloved voice-over rendition in the history of the character for a very long time. 

Heath Ledger of course kind of started as a heart-throb, 10 Things I Hate about you, a Knight's Tale, the Patriot, a lot of people didn't really take him seriously as an actor at the time, except for Brokeback Mountain. Then he plays the joker and he's almost everyone's favorite joker. 

I think it's because the joker doesn't just have to be deranged, he has to also be magnetic. There's a charisma to him; he's not crazy in a real world psychological sense, his psychosis is completely fictional and flamboyant. He's an entertainer; he's a *clown* who thinks that doing evil is *fucking hilarious*. 

You don't get that in Leto's joker, he's just a weird-looking psychopath.&&But was Leto's Joker *damaged*? I'm still not sure, maybe they could have given me some indication.&&Seriously, who the fuck was the guy that said ""Yeah just belly dance at the top of this staircase while summoning a skybeam to end the world."" &&Yeah, you definitely have a point. The expectations for Caras performance were lower. However i dont think they were so low that belly dancing on top of a staircase as the main villain in the final big important fight is excusable. Also I never saw Margot Robbies performance as a MAJOR flaw in the film. I mostly thought it was the writing being horrible and the fact that her character was essentially useless (not saying she was amazing by any means tho). I dont know, maybe in wrong though.&&Yeah, and rightfully so, in my opinion. But he was such a minimal character in the whole film, he basically did nothing. Thats why, even with how bad he was, every other major flaw that was on-screen for longer than cameo length, which there A LOT, had a much bigger impact on why the film failed.&&""Smokin' weed, smokin' weed, doin' coke, drinkin' beers...""
&&I've always thought he was a better Batman than Bruce Wanye.

i dont get how some people do it, i truly dont have that care or patience to engage someone i know is trying to argue.&&Twitter is especially cancerous because of it’s format. First off, you can’t have meaningful discourse in a tweet. Second, it’s extremely easy to take things out of context on twitter, again because of the format. If someone does try to have a longer discussion you can cherry pick a single tweet out and use it to support anything you want to turn it into. Finally, with respect to the article at hand, it makes it far too easy for jackasses to shit talk directly to actors and creators, and given that angry assholes are far more likely to start screaming directly at people than any other demographic Twitter, and most social media, are akin to letting a crazy angry madman sit next to you all day so they can randomly scream at you and berate you. All social media is pretty cancerous, but Twitter’s format is particularly abusable while simultaneously being pretty much worthless for any meaningful discussion. &&We should go back to *bullshitters*&&I've got a feeling that there must be a name for that.

I dont think most fans cared about Lady Death being in the movie because Thanos trying to get laid just didnt seem like a good storyline for a movie they took ten years building up to. If you make a great movie, fans will love it. &&I think it's fine that there's a black Hermione onstage, but it's definitely a trend that Rowling wants credit after-the-fact for things she didn't put in the books.&&Black Hermione was a fannish headcanon that emerged long before the Cursed Child casting. (South Asian Harry was another, but that didn't receive the same official support.) Let's be clear: the fans who drew Hermione as black knew perfectly well that JKR meant her white as default, that in the absence of clear racial markers they were supposed to read her as white. The point of the racebending was to turn the canon's default against itself. To reject the implicit suggestion that Hermione must be white because she wasn't Other. It was a way for fans of color to find a place in a story that never gave them much narrative centrality.

It's all well and good that JKR has embraced the headcanon, at least when it comes to the limited and exclusive sphere of the stage, but at the end of the day Emma Watson is white and she's the face most people see when they think of Hermione. I'd rather JKR didn't get so much credit for the racebending when the fans did all the legwork to imagine her very white text more diversely.&&This. I've pointed this out on Twitter so many times yet I get called racist for pointing out JK's hypocrisy. A black Hermione is more than welcome change for me but it's cringy as hell to see JK being considered the epitome of ""liberalism"" when in reality she's just trying to earn some social respect points  

She could've changed Hermione's race while admitting that she messed up in the original books, but she straight up lies about Hermione's race in the books by saying that she never mentioned it! Ffs&&...wouldn't this have come up in the movie casting like a decade ago?&&Isn't Dave Filoni universally loved among Star Wars fans thanks to his work on Rebels and Clone Wars? I think he could play the Kevin Feige role well since he is a Star Wars fanboy, open enough to take risks (bringing back Maul, introducing the Mandalorian race etc.), and has a good idea of building roadmaps for his shows.&&JJ and Kasdan did do a plan though. RJ was allowed to completely ignore it. Various people involved in the films have confirmed that post TLJ being released. &&They had a plan of sorts to follow, but Johnson threw it out. Daisy Ridley confirmed that Abrams had written rough drafts for Episodes VIII and IX, but, when passing from one director to another, Disney let Johnson choose what he wanted to keep.

Daisy Ridley said Johnson kept nothing.&&100% agree. 7 made it seem like they had a plan and were building to something, even if the film itself played it hugely safe. Then 8 felt like a middle finger to anyone who expected anything of that setup. Narrative whiplash.&&It's okay to have different directors, episodes 4, 5, and 6 all had different directors. But the new ones seem to lack a timeline for directors to follow. It's almost as if they were told to just wing it&&With the way Episode 7 and 8 played out, I will find it hard to believe anyone who says Disney has a plan for Star Wars at all. It's stupidly obvious that they (Disney) are making it up as they go along.&&Apparently there was a plan though. JJ and Kasdan planned out eps 8-9 as part of their work on ep 7. Apparently TLJ ended pretty much in line with the plan, but everything that happened in the film was different.    
The problem is RJ was doing his take on a new SW trilogy and not doing a sequel to JJ's take on Star Wars. By doing his own thing, he didn't care for the larger picture and Story JJ was setting up. Just working with in the boundary of the end of TFA and where his film needs to end.        
The core problem is RJ couldn't actually think of a decent enough way to bridge the start and end point. It's clear he was only interested in the Rey/Luke and Rey / Kylo stuff.   
Everything else is filler. The entire galaxy is conquered is the opening crawl, the position the rebels are in at the start of the film is essentially where they are at the end. It was just a make busy plot because he had no clue what to do. He didn't want to, or didn't know how to tell the big story of the FIRST ORDER reigning supreme and so ignored it.&&His name is Ahmed Best.&&Yeah. He got arrested for reckless driving and then went to jail and then a psychiatric facility. I can't find any info on if he's out now or anything, but I hope he's doing better.  &&“I think the most diplomatic answer is I wanted to make a Marvel movie but I don’t think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie. It was a really heartbreaking decision to have to walk away after having worked on it for so long, because me and Joe Cornish in some form—it’s funny some people say, ‘Oh they’ve been working on it for eight years’ and that was somewhat true, but in that time I had made three movies so it wasn’t like I was working on it full time. But after The World’s End I did work on it for like a year, I was gonna make the movie.”

I think it may have been a bit of the shoehorning into the greater MCU, but also Edgar Wright gave this answer as to why &&He has a bunch of un-Batman like one liners. I mean I don't mind a dry Batman comment from time to time, but they were all over.&&The trailer had some lines but they were in character lol but the reshoots apparently added stupid jokes from him, plus he put on weight before the reshoots so you can see his face become fatter and back to slim in some scenes&&Well that's what I meant. Affleck did great in the role and I'm all on board with him being Bats for as long as possible. Problem is the studio issues leading to poor choices in the films seems to be pushing him out the door pretty quickly if rumors are to be believed. 

Hell, all the bullshit reporting surrounding him directing and then not directing and then the Gyllenhaal thing could have all been squashed but they continued to hold weight in some capacity. Seems like the studio doesn't have a clear vision. &&> All I know is he said he turned it down because he didn't want to be tied to six movies.

That's a perfectly acceptable reason, but it's an entirely different thing from what the post is about.

&&I could also see him as a Tony Stark.&&I don't know how good of a Batman he would be but he could probably wake up and shoot all his Bruce Wayne scenes in one take before breakfast.&&..What?  The mythology has almost nothing to do with the comics or movies.  &&> manslaughter of Baldur

I'm pretty sure making someone inadverdently kill another is still murder. Manslaughter implies a mistake of negligence.&&In Norse mythos he had gender bending tendencies that the other gods made fun of him for. He got back at Thor by turning him into a cross dresser.&&Also apparently they cut out some homoerotic subtext between him and the Grandmaster in Ragnarok. When he says, “We’ve gotten close,” he (at least originally) didn’t just mean as friends.&&Now this is a theory but, I think in the first one, yeah he was a bit immature and hated Thor because he was daddy's boy and hated his dad because he never told him he was adopted. Sometime between it and the Avengers he got the scepter which contains the mind stone.

The theory is that Loki wasn't really in control for this section. The mind stone was influencing him to do evil memetically. You notice that when the avengers are in the room with the scepter they all start fighting each other. It's like the One Ring in LOTR. After being captured in Asgard, Loki had some time to think and come to terms with his adoption, Thor and all his other issues. He's still a jerk but he's not evil anymore. So he still wants control of Asgard but he doesn't want to enslave the human race anymore and kill a bunch of people. He then feigns his death and impersonates his dad to accomplish this.

He's got control, time to put his feet up, concoct some theatre plays and enjoy the good life in Asgard. This is where we see him in Ragnarok. He agrees to help Thor with minimal resistance. Maybe his observation of Hela helped him a bit more but he was team Thor the whole way, well, they're still squabbling brothers but he's genuinely helping. [And after Ragnarok](#And now that Asgard is gone and there's nothing left for him to hold power over) he realises he should just hang with Thor and see how things go.&&So basically, he's Chaotic Neutral.&&Loki is probably the second most important character driving the MCU plot arc, after Tony Stark.&&Doctor Doom&&[deleted]&&*points gun back*

You might need 50 of them in a typical shoot where it takes 3-4 weeks of on-set work, or you might need 100 of them in an environment where sweat or abrasive fight scenes are happening. Either way, it is cheaper and more efficient than getting a person to hand-draw fake tattoos and touch them up every few minutes &&Easy to see why. They wanted to update the 1950s powerful rich genius stereotype - the huge strong manly ubermensch business man - with what that means today, ie Zuckerberg-Musk. &&Known as The Mandarin technique in Iron Man 3 and the All Hail the King one shot. &&He did. Unfortunately the scene was just shot too dark that nobody could see him.&&Will the real Lex Luthor please stand up? 

Please stand up?

Please stand up?

Oh god, please let therer be another one.

Edit: Corrected Luther to Luthor. Doh!&&For five minutes, before getting killed by the real villain.&&It's when I conduct my serious business, converse with my number 2. No laughing matter&&Eh. I feel like Margot Robbie is on a crazy train, too. For example, who goes around and asks people if they can tattoo their toes? Margot Robbie, that's who.&&And yet. He’s still getting more movies in the DC universe.. 

What the hell &&Heath did the joker somewhat in Method, and it was fntastic. Jared was just trying to buildy the same hype and aimed for where a shitty movie and his own acting couldn't take him.&&Heath Ledger method acted joker didn't he? HE wrote out all of that joker's backstory.&&#HA HA HA&&See I've never seen Bruce Wayne as incredibly charismatic. Certainly he's eccentric, but he's always had a sense of serious tone from being batman&&He's a really good out of cowl Batman too. Like if Bruce Wayne could live how he really wants to, full time vigilante without any of the playboy facade. Batcave Bruce Wayne I like to call him&&It's like I've been edging for ten years

All I remember is pain, anger and confusion.&&Congratulations!&&And now I know where that meme comes from. What is life. &&おめでとう！&&Yeah but wasn't that book written many years before it was released? I think she released a few more books about Poirot before killing him despite having that intention. Also I think I've read that she regret making him so old initially since that hampered the ability to write more about him.&&Curtain (1975)&&Ka wills it.&&damn &&To be fair though, that's only [nine days](https://youtu.be/ZIANBamMgas) in universe.&&eThAN BraDbeRrY!&&""Great moves ethan, keep em up""- michelle obama as she shoots ethan in back&&Eurgh I hate to be that guy but it's a lighting thing. If you watch if frame by frame he goes dark all over due to it, so his light stubble goes straight to 'WHABHAM BEARD MODE'.&&Was awful. But Abrams did a good job helping bring it back. Thought every one since has almost gotten better.&&When you actually talk about it out load, the majority of comic stories don’t translate directly well to movies or to a believable story. I’m glad Marvel Studios has found the right balance of deviating from source material just enough to make fantastic movies, while not losing the heart and soul of the stories they’re telling and the characters they’re portraying.&&And doesn’t actually walk the walk either, ie Grindenwald.

If Dumbledore is actually gay, make him gay. This shouldn’t b hard given how adamant she was about that *after* finishing the books.&&I was talking about this with my brother and he pointed out that her being black completely undercuts her being a mudblood.

Being discriminated against for being a mudblood won't shock her if she has already faced discrimination for being black.

I'm Irish and white and it'd shock me if I faced that discrimination. Ireland isn't even a racist country and I've still seen plenty of racism.&&That's the thing, JKR cast Emma Watson as Hermione. She doesn't get to do that and then turn around and try to pretend Hermione was black all along. I don't have any problem with them casting a black actress as Hermione in the stage play but JKR's reaction to it just pissed me off.&&And it's weird how Disney kept such a tight reign on the spin-off movies (essentially replacing Rogue One's director and outright firing Solo's) when they flippantly gave Johnson total control over the main trilogy. You'd think they would've kept to JJ's and Kasdan's carefully thought out plans and give the spin off movies free reign to have fun.&&That's where the Kevin Feige equivalent comes in.  I would have preferred a single director for the trilogy, but as long as someone oversees the project to make sure it comes together as a cohesive whole, multiple directors can work fine.

Star Wars currently doesn't have that despite really needing it *more* than the MCU.&&[deleted]&&Bale could have managed that in real time.&&Well yeah, he essentially played him on tv for like 9 years&&It inspired the characters. My point being until Loki actually killed an aesir he was cool. &&> gender bending tendencies

As well as species bending tendencies. Odin's horse, Sleipnir, was Loki's progeny and Loki was not the father. &&There's also that little thing [when he got pregnant from a horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleipnir).&&This was covered well in Neil Gaiman's Norse Mythology!&&Great, now I'm imagining a Goldblum / Hiddleston sex scene...&&Loki sucked the Grandmaster off for his social status and no one can convince me otherwise.&&I want Mads Mikkelsen for Doctor Doom. &&Allow me to break the ice.&&Ice to meet you&&He'll never catch up to someone as cool as Riddler. He can't quite cut the mustard. I wouldn't relish seeing C.K. over and over. He **may o**r may not be a bit character in some future film, but never the main villain. He should give up villainy and go back to his first love, salsa dancing. I thought he quit a life of crime because he needed simple yet career-ending surgery, like an open and shut knee replacement.&&He'd just do it himself... Instead of laying out Knives and Baby onsies in a weird as circle to lay in.&&Fucking Veronica！（I'm a sad thirty odd year old man spouting modern memes because I find them hilarious.）&&Sounds a lot more feasible than someone having to redraw the *exact* tattoo everyday. But who knows. &&Yeah I think that's how it's done, I've seen a few behind the scenes clips of tattoos being applied to cast members for Vikings and they were basically fancy temporary tattoos&&See, I think the Zuck-Musk brand of businessman CEO just doesn't fit the same role. And actually, I feel like everything about his character suggests that yeah, the tech CEO doesn't make a good villain the way Lex normally does.&&Pedantry.

1950s Luthor was a mad scientist.

1980s was a businessman.&&> Easy to see why. They wanted to update the 1950s powerful rich genius stereotype - the huge strong manly ubermensch business man - with what that means today, ie Zuckerberg-Musk. 

Uh, [Jeff Bezos is the richest man on earth, bald as Luthor and ripped AF](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/886013837002059776/5vtIKoe8_400x400.jpg). Why base him on the Zucc when you can base him off Bezos? Plus Bezos is already developing an army of robots which is something Luthor does all the time.&&The tech-wiz angle was a mistake and they didn't think it through, though I can see the appeal on the surface.

I guess the alternative would have been too risky for Corporate DC, because the real answer is a modern Wall Street Shark.  Back in the day you didn't have teenagers and stay at home moms all over the internet leaping to take offence on behalf of Oil Barons or Captains of Industry, but in todays climate that's almost guaranteed to be a politicised subject and they wouldn't want to touch it with a bargepole.&&Somewhat? Heath was full method for those movies.

""It’s a combination of reading all the comic books I could that were relevant to the script and then just closing my eyes and meditating on it,"" he says. ""I sat around in a hotel room in London for about a month, locked myself away, formed a little diary and experimented with voices — it was important to try to find a somewhat iconic voice and laugh. I ended up landing more in the realm of a psychopath — someone with very little to no conscience towards his acts. He’s just an absolute sociopath, a cold-blooded, mass-murdering clown, and Chris has given me free rein. Which is fun, because there are no real boundaries to what The Joker would say or do. Nothing intimidates him, and everything is a big joke""

> Despite assurances from Gilliam, these ideas are explored in the 2012 German documentary Too Young To Die, where Ledger’s father explains his son’s Method approach to creating a character. “It was typical of Heath on any movie, he would certainly immerse himself in the character and I think this was just a whole new level.” &&He didn't take it out on his co-stars off-camera, though...while he played a villain, by all accounts he was perfectly pleasant and professional on set. Whereas Leto played mean ""pranks"" on the cast, even giving Margot Robbie a live rat in a box (the rat was later adopted by Guillermo del Toro and lived a long happy life, but seriously, not cool).&&I thought it was just that Heath kept himself reserved on set and didn't joke about and stuff to be more into his role, whereas Jared was sending people rats and being rude to them.&&A few anime have aged well and Eva is one of them.  

But lordy... Gundam Wing aged \*very\* poorly.  I tried watching that again and I couldn't get into it anymore.  I was in like 6th grade when that aired on Toonami and it was the coolest thing ever at the time.&&[](/strixievain)

Holy shit, is 1.0 older today than OG NGE was when 1.0 came out?!

I was a teenager when NGE first aired... oh ive wasted so much more than my life.&&WHAT. 1.0 was 11 years ago?... Oh my God it was.&&1975 didn't seem right as I remembered Christie dying in the '70s and stumbled upon this interesting bit of trivia.. Curtain *was* published in '75 but posthumously and was actually written in the 40s! &&Cool, thanks!&&Damn I didn't know she kept writing into the 70s. I figured her heyday was like the 40s.&&I say thankee, sai.&&The rest of the time was spent filing incident reports&&Making a huge deal out of it when it isn't important to the storyline is what ruins stories. &&lol bruh, Irish people have been getting discriminated against for centuries.

The crazy part about the world is, all white people arent a homogenized collective.&&JKR wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants to talk diversity but not show it on the page. Dumbledore being gay is an even clearer example of this. Once all the books are out she then tells us something she easily could have made clear in the text itself

It's not the biggest deal and her hearts in the right place and all but it's still a thing she did.&&Even had his dad with him.&&Agreed, anything Loki did to non Aesir was more or less treated like petty theift.  Thor had his panties in a twist because he liked our world, the Avengers and all that jazz.  The rest of the Avengers didn't like Loki for obvious reasons, he was a threat to just about everyone they swore to protect.

Most Aesir didn't give two shits, and saw Loki's actions as being on par with someone messing with your phone, until he went too far and killed an Aesir.

Now we can argue all day long if that makes him a villain or not (I think it does, but that's from a ""likely victim"" end of things) &&No? Multiple times before he tried to start Ragnarok, it was kind of his goal.


He worked with Thor because, well, Thor would beat the shit out of him otherwise, but he constantly tried to create chaos&&The next God of War game is going to be unreal. &&And this one time, he turned into a snake because he knows I love snakes.  So I picked up the snake to admire it, and then he turned back into himself and he was like ""nyeh, it's me!"" And then he stabbed me.&&Let me get this straight. Loki gets fucked by some horsey thing and gave birth to a horse, which his dad rides?&&A lot of people are impregnated by horses, it’s not a big deal.  It’s just one of those things that happens.&&Then gave birth to said horse, who serves as Odin's steed.&&Pfft, what ancient god worth their salt *hasn't* had sex with an 8-legged horse?&&I can only get so erect&&It's my birthday 🎂 &&I thought this was common knowledge until this thread. I may be visiting Tumblr too much?  Goldblum can do no wrong there, including Loki. &&He's already Caeceleus or however the fucking that's spelt.&&Mads Mikkelsen, Michael Fassbender, fuck it let's just add ~~General Kenobi~~ Ewan Mcgregor to that.&&That was so edgy it hurt. His joker was terrible.&&at the very least a stencil or something. i feel like there is no way they'd be drawn freehand every day&&Are we all just forgetting about Jeff Bezos who is pretty much the living embodiment of Lex Luthor right now?&&I think Tech CEO could still make a lot of sense for an updated take on LEX. Would make an easy way to work Braniac in for one. Although even as a tech CEO Lex should still be imposing, somehow. It was a good idea just... not well executed.&&A Jobs kind of tech CEO would have fit much better. Authoritarian-type control poorly hidden by a harmless turtleneck. &&Because he isn't nearly the famous presence Zuck and Musk are. Not nearly as identifiable. So people's mental image of a genius self-made billionnaire (especially one who is probably evil) isn't Bezos.&&I think the person you are responding to meant method as in “never dropping character, even during the production.”


Ledger didn’t continue to act like a psycho and terrorize his coworkers. He didn’t like... sneak over to camera staging and fill the lens case with cow blood or some other idiotic Leto-esque crap. He used the Stanislavski method but he still acted like a professional when it came time to actually make the movie.


Which makes sense - movies are complicated things with hundreds of people often involved. Communication is paramount, and even with the best communication and planning, shit goes wrong. If you are setting out to make a good movie, having a very disruptive person on set gumming up the works sounds like it would only detract from the final product. And Leto sounds like he was a lot more than simply disruptive.&&It's a rat in a box!

Rat in a box, baby&&Gundam Wing was one of my favorites back in the Toonami days and I absolutely agree. Endless Waltz isn't too bad as it's comparatively short and self contained, but man is the main serious tough to watch.&&Cowboy Bebop aged well too. Still my favorite.&&Not anime, it's more like an homage, but the new Voltron is freaking *awesome.*

Prince Lotor is one damned smooth criminal.&&I actually still enjoy gundam wing. 

That said, it deserves the criticism. 

For one thing, the color palette is just *boring* in the series. Endless waltz looks *much* better. and at this point I can't watch it and not see the standard anime tropes (I didn't know they were tropes back in the day) and the plot twists aren't all that surprising (admittedly, I remember my head exploding a few times as allegiances and motives changed back when I saw it as a kid). But I still enjoy watching it now and then.

It's good to throw on when I've got the flu or a wicked hangover and just want something I don't have to think too hard about or that will make me nauseous. &&evangelion is one of the greatest pieces of visual media ive seen and probably the most artistically valid anime out there&&It was written in the 40s as she wanted an end to the series and she feared dying in the war, she stored it in a vault but personally authorized it's release and publication in 1975. 

Agatha Christie died in 1976.&&As mentioned above she wrote this particular book in the 40s as she feared dying in world war 2 and wanted an end to her series. Towards the end of her life she authorized the release of the book.

However the last book she wrote was *Postern of Fate* which was written in 1973.&&Right but she’s trying to make it important to the story after the fact. She claims that Dumbledores love for Grindekwald was an extremely important factor in the war and the latters downfall. That sounds like something that should have turned up in the books, and the upcoming movie, and can really add to the story. But it didn’t show up in the books, because it’s really just a post-release addition she did because now that it’s safer she can act like she was a brave inclusive author the whole time. &&She made no deal out of it and then insisted on it post-series.

She could have given one explicit throwaway line and then not have had to spend so much time later talking about it.

She wanted to have her cake and eat it too. Keep something controversial out of the books proper and also get praise for diversity she never cared to show.&&That’s why I’ll just remember the books as they were written. Not as they were post edited.&&> ol bruh, Irish people have been getting discriminated against for centuries.
> 

We know that. When you live in Ireland you're not getting confronted with anti-Irish propaganda all the time. So it's not a presence in the way it used to be. &&Odds are she was thinking of none of this when writing the books. Shocking I know but she might not be as amazing an author as the fandom thinks and it was enough for her to keep the massive plot somewhat organized without getting into sociology and such. Cynically this might be time to retcon things for controversy and attention.&&I'd've liked an event in the MCU where Loki convinced thor to dress up as a woman and get married to a giant to get his hammer back.&& Well there was also the fact that it wasn't just any Aesir, but Baldur, one of the most beloved. His death was also thought of as one of the first events of Ragnarok. &&and until he confessed to killing Baldur, that was all cool. Or at the very least forgivable.&&yay a return for the minigames &&Kratos: Boy!... wait, girl?... Horse??? I guess he really can turn into animals. &&>And then he stabbed me.

I remember seeing this the first time and that line was the best bit.

I expected it to be something normal like ""so he turned into a snake and bit me"" or similar. &&Odin isn't really his adopted father in Norse mythology, they are more like cousins or brothers.

But yes a strong and swift stallion fucked Loki and Loki gave birth to the best 8-legged horse in the world which was later tamed by Odin.&&I just read the wiki on Sleipnir. That is pretty much it. The gods made a bet with a builder that he couldn't finish his project on time. But the builder was making crazy progress because his workhorse was super strong. In order to sabotage that builder(since the gods didn't want to pay) Loki shapeshifted into a mare so that he could lure away the work horse. The shapeshifted Loki and the workhorse gallivanted all night making it hard for the builder to finish his work on time. The gods won the bet and the builder was killed by Thor for being a frost giant. Loki gave birth to Sleipnir later on.

""Mister Doctor.""

""It's *Strange*.""

""Perhaps, but who am I to judge.""&&Just switch actors midway and don't reference it. &&Not to mention that real life Zuck has a few supervillain qualities, too.

I think he might actually be a white Martian, though.&&What about Branson? He's pretty well known. 

&&Legend of Galactic Heros is good. Well it's like watching a book if that makes any sense, but the characters are amazing. Just don't expect amazing personal fights like most modern titles. This is more a massive game of galaxy chess.&&I watched the original Yu-Yu-Hakusho on Hulu the other night and the intro theme song brought a tear to my eye.

Edit: 2018 animation is on the way&&The main series was tough to watch the *first time*. Of course, when it came out on Toonami, I was in my 20's so I was already getting tired of it's boy-band-bullshit.

There are very good Gundam series out there (8th MS Team, Stardust Memory, etc...).

Gundam Wing wasn't ever one of them, IMO.&&Cowboy Bebop is a timeless treasure. A high water mark of anime. If Watanabe makes it, I want to see it.

edit: [Watanabe's Blade Runner 2049 short, called Blackout 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrZk9sSgRyQ)&&I can handle the muted colors.  It's the writing and the voice acting that I can not handle.  It's all so extreme.  

That battle song still gets in my head though.  DA NANANANA BABABABA &&Woah that's amazing, that she actually decided to write the finale to her story in case she died in the war. I suppose that shows just how important to her it was &&I was in the HP fandom, trust me: people have a reasonable view of JKR. The books are fun but they're not perfect.

And I left before Pottermore and Cursed Child, so I can only imagine that things have gotten more negative since. 

I don't think she's being cynical. I think, for whatever reason, she didn't present a particularly diverse world (honestly, when the books were first coming out I doubt anyone cared that much, especially about major characters being gay- times have changed) and now she feels bad. 

The solution is to just bite the bullet though. You had your shot and apparently it wasn't that important to you at the time. &&“I’d’ve” thank you sir for leveling up my grammatical skills.&&Well what else are you gonna do? The gods know that as soon as they punish him, their fates are sealed&&You just had to go there. Now I can't get the image out of my head of Kratos going rage-mode and grunting furiously whilst...

(Friend was visiting last week and he was trying out Dad of Boy while I was doing stuff in the other room and all I could hear was Teal'C making loud grunting noises repeatedly for an hour...)&&Sleipnir is... They just... Don't address where it came from.&&Have you seen the other scene? Goldblum is mouth fucking tentacles in a hologram. It's sort of hard to miss the gay ""undertone"".&&Zuck does what the NSA does, except instead of listening for terrorists and tormenting ex-wives or girlfriends, he helps sell razors, diet tea and vacations. The whole charade of the government getting pissy with him about privacy laws was retarded since they’re the ones continually passing laws removing protections from spying. Not even selling your stupid quiz data and personal profile info, which you give up willingly, they can monitor every single thing and do when they have to. If Marc was working towards some unity AI project like Westworld or Ex Machina, maybe he’d scare me, but he’s just running the worlds most profitable group chat. 

Bezos and Musk are a bit scarier. Bezos can lose money for decades consolidating consumer products away from stores and directly to your home, and wants robots to replace as many of his workers as possible. Musk just does whatever he wants, sends a bill to the government, and moves on to the next thing. In a few years, he’ll be able to drive from his house, to his rocket factory, to his battery/car factory, to his massive-earth-moving tunneling factory, or ya know use his privatized underground super-speed people mover.  &&Jeff Bridges wasn't available.&&LOGH isn’t just the greatest anime of all time, but also one of the greatest shows ever produced. &&As far as anime aging well, Yu Yu Hakusho is one which can be enjoyed today to the same amount as when it was released. The animation quality was really good when it first aired and still retains a lot of the quality due to its hand-drawn scenes and surprisingly simple combat animation. The story is actually fairly mature for a shonen genre staple as well, and certainly deals with the subjects of coming of age, love, friendship, and responsibility in an interesting and compelling way, all while maintaining quality action and fight scenes.

No comments about the ethics or implications of the oligopoly that is the American media being consolidated even further. Nobody wonders about the level of power Disney now wields in the marketplace and how it might influence American culture. 

I mean, what does this mean for copyright laws given Disney's propensity to try and push the copyright term further and further out? What kind of influence does Disney wield over the American government now? Is Disney too big to fail?

This is absolutely terrible for consumers. I suggest you look into Fox and Disney's holdings. They control production and distribution in many facets, including HULU, which is a blatant breach of anti-trust laws. But as long as everyone's fanboy characters are under one roof, then it's okay I guess...&&> I don't think this merger is quite as worrisome as other industries.

It is in the way that its becoming a monopoly and pissing someone off at Disney could basically get you blacklisted from half the projects in production.

Look at James Gunn as an example. I wont debate if he deserved it or not but he's on Disney's shitlist and that means he cant work on anything Fox related either.&&Another perspective: I work in animation, and I'm greatly worried about Disney buying up studios. 

The more Disney acquires, the less possible places I have to work. This also opens up more room for Disney to set the standards for content, wages, and business practices that can set a precedent for other studios. Just recently, Disney has dealt with two major scandals that are rippling through our community: [wage-fixing](https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/disney-settlement-wage-fixing-anti-poaching-animation-1201975084/) and [Lasseter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseters-pattern-alleged-misconduct-detailed-by-disney-pixar-insiders-1059594).

Animation is already a small, geographically-locked industry with very few places that pay a living wage and create decent content. Not all of us want to work for the mouse.

For consumers, Disney now owns MORE of the biggest franchises ever, and they are already [muscling out](https://deadline.com/2015/12/the-hateful-eight-star-wars-force-awakens-arclight-theater-fight-1201668018/) other movies in the box office. This is like a Walmart opening up and taking business away from the local mom and pops shops down the street. Of course, there is still PLENTY of content outside of Disney, and while they don't own the market (yet), their influence affects our whole industry. 

That said, we still have four of the ""Big Six."" While Disney+Fox owns about 34% of market shares, NBCUniversal+Time Warner+Viacom+Sony collectively own about 48%. Not quite a monopoly yet, so we're still okay. 

That also said, all these businesses have [direct ownership of affiliation with almost all news outlets and internet providers.](https://www.webpagefx.com/data/the-6-companies-that-own-almost-all-media/) AT&T just [acquired Time Warner Inc.](http://about.att.com/story/att_completes_acquisition_of_time_warner_inc.html) in June. Media corps and telecom corps have been consolidating for a while and continue to do so, which affects all of us. 

This goes beyond characters and movies. &&> There can always be new interesting characters created outside of Disney.

hahahaha...and where will we watch these famed new characters?

When a quentin tarantino movie already can't get played in a theater because the theater is forced to use all it's screens on star wars...what hope is there for anything new?&&Considering Disney has been the major player in the development of this country's IP law, their growing power is dangerous to a great many creative industries, not just the ones Disney is directly involved in (which is, uh... honestly most of them)

Think of how quickly Luxxotica turned a similar a similar share of the market into actual dominance over every part of it, even the parts they didn't own.&&There's more to the entertainment industry than just the entertainment.

Disney makes video games but none have been really good. The last ones to even pop up on the radar of most people is the Epic Mickey and Disney Infinity series.

Probably has little to no effect effect. Disney was already big enough to influence such things.
&&But muh MCU.

I say this as a Marvel fan. This could turn into a bad thing down the line, especially with Disney's influence on copyright laws. And how they've been sort of bullying theaters.
&&I have some Disney stock, and I'm still waiting on my call from Bob Iger to give him the green light.  &&I imagine it went like this for Fox: ""Disney makes a ton of money, and thus we will make money with these stocks!""

Part of the laws though is that whenever a big merger like this takes place, the companies need to have the deal approved by the government under its anti-trust rules. This deal was approved awhile back, on the condition that Disney would sell off the regional sports networks it was acquiring with Fox.  &&There is some government regulation, generally (that was part of the concern about the AT&T/Warner + potential Comcast/Fox mergers, that regulatory overview would put them at risk), and Microsoft in particular has run into some problems in the past, but the days of 'trust busting' have sort of gone by the way side. There's just too much corporate money in politics. &&We’d need to bring Teddy Roosevelt back from the dead. &&I believe that once this deal is completed Disney could have a ~35% share of the annual box office.

&nbsp;

KACHING!!!!!!!!!!&&Come on, we all know that what they REALLY wanted was that super-lucrative Fantastic Four property...&&There are a LOT of things wrapped up in this deal.  Honestly speaking while the Marvel rights and Star Wars Distribution were undoubtedly a factor, there's also the Fox broadcast network, FX, and maybe most lucrative of all:  The ENTIRE back catalog of 20th Century Fox.

That last bit is more important than a lot of folks might think, because that's MAJOR fodder for Disney's impending streaming service.

There's a reason the big streaming services have been tripling and quadrupling down on original content these past few years:  Before long every major media entity is going to have their own service, and they won't be licensing their stuff to the outside services anymore.

When Disney launches their streaming service now, it's potentially going to have:

All Disney programming and movies.

All Pixar films and shorts.

All Marvel Studios productions (except I think the Netflix shows, which by nature of their contracts can continue to be produced at Netflix, but Disney will be free to make NEW streaming shows they can spotlight on the new service).

All Star Wars programs and movies (including a new live-action series).

All of 20th Century Fox's movies, or well...just [look at this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_21st_Century_Fox), minus the few things listed in the article as not being sold.

All of the other Disney Subsidiary movies (Touchstone Pictures, Buena Vista productions, etc...)

When I was thinking of monopoly break-up I was thinking more in terms of ""a company is basically forced to split into smaller pieces"", like how ""Ma Bell"" AT&T split into a bunch of smaller companies. &&It's difficult with entertainment, because they aren't hindering the production of other studios yet even though they own incredibly valuable intellectual properties.&&It happened to standard oil.

You mean shift to lowest common denominator established IP forgettable PG-13 style films instead of taking risks with more daring, original ideas and a hands-off approach toward creators? Because that's a more likely scenario when Disney steps in and shows Netflix that there's much more money in an X-Men/Avengers/Avatar crossover than there is in Annihilation or Beasts of no Nation.

When people cancel their Netflix subscription and switch over to 'the one that has all the franchises' we'll learn that 90% of folks aren't interested in the kind of film Netflix is currently making (smaller, non-established franchise, mostly original stuff) and we'll lose them. That's the most likely scenario.&&Plus Disney has plans the launch its own streaming service with its own original content. &&Netflix isn't about movies, it's about the original TV shows.

The reason Netflix has been making b movies is because studios have already started blocking Netflix.   It's not that Netflix doesn't want to carry Disney movies, it's that Disney won't let Netflix buy their shows for streaming.

While Super Nintendo World in Orlando has been delayed for the time being, Nintendo also confirmed that they are ""working with Universal's Illumination Entertainment on several new films"".

> **Nintendo has confirmed its working with Universal’s Illumination Entertainment on a number of upcoming movies.**

> While few details have been shared a Pokémon movie slated for next year (which isn’t being done by Illumination), and a Mario Brothers movie slated for the next few years, though a specific date has yet to be, but it’s likely it’ll be timed to coincide with the opening of Japan’s Super Mario World in 2020, just in time for the Olympics in that country. 

> **The Illumination-partnered movies might give Mario and other Nintendo brands an updated aesthetic similar to the one that Illumination is giving to the Grinch (as seen in the advertising NBC has been running during its Olympic coverage).**

> Instead of shoehorning Nintendo into Universal Studios Florida’s KidZone, it now looks like the company has opted to have the juggernaut of brands to anchor its third theme park (or fourth, if you count Volcano Bay). In recent weeks, we’ve heard new rumors of a large DreamWorks presence in the Magic Kingdom-style park. Other brands rumored for the new park include *Lord of the Rings* and *Jurassic World*.

> All indications point to Universal fast-tracking the new park with an opening now expected in the mid-2020s. That would place only a few years after the rumored 2021 Orlando opening of Super Nintendo World. 

> With this difference now being less than 48 months, and with other projects in the works for Universal Studios Florida, including a rumored Ministry of Magic attraction at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and a new live-action mixed-media show replacing the now-closed Terminator 2 attraction, it seems Universal would get the most impact by placing this extremely popular brand in the new park instead.

And ESPN has had a plan building over the last 5 years to kill sports on cable, and while it started with the $5/month ESPN+ subscription this spring, it's going to be a long con.&&That's a good question.  But I think the REAL interesting question is:

With this deal approved and now officially underway, will Fox waive any barriers to Disney using FF and X-Men characters while the rest of the likely-to-be-a-year+ long process of merging the two companies takes place?  Basically a very short-term version of the Spider-Man/Sony/Marvel deal until ownership is fully transferred?  

In short...will Fox give Marvel a head-start on bringing any/all of those characters to the big screen?  Though truth be told, such a deal might still be complicated enough that Disney/Marvel might just say it's not worth the trouble and they can wait one more year or so.

But if they did, we could likely start getting hints of/cameos of X-Men and/or FF characters as early as late next year....or maybe even at the end of Infinity War Part II (It doesn't take a WHOLE lot to film a post-credit cameo...and who knows what's been discussed/prepared behind-the-scenes while all this was going on?)

I feel they are likely to wait a bit on that because of the wholly-negative public impression. They haven ever had a good FF flick unlike both Spidey and the X-Mwn which have had decent and very popular films this century.

I expect them to be in the periphery of the MCU for a while as cameos and whatnot and then get woven into phase 5.&&Oh, sure.  The main thing is that they a) have to work them into Phase 4 (or, IMO, more likely phase 5, but who knows - they're smarter than I am) which they can't really even START doing for a while yet since things aren't quite finalized, and b) have to overcome the audience perception (basically every FF movie has been considered a stinker).  I think there's a lot there, but Disney is very sensitive to the mainstream perceptions of things, especially given how big the MCU has gotten.

New Poster for Spy-Comedy 'The Spy Who Dumped Me' - Starring Mila Kunis & Kate McKinnon,35242,9218xl,https://i.redd.it/t5tr3u7sw9c11.jpg,1459,1532602593.0,,"I know the license plate is supposed to mean “DUMPED.” But being from Des Moines, my initial thought was they stole a police motorcycle.&&I don't care about the film, but more posters need to use art instead of photography. Something about it feels retro and the hipster in me loves that&&> Audrey and Morgan are best friends who unwittingly become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of the women discovers the boyfriend who dumped her was actually a spy.
&&That is straight up beautiful - such a pity that truly great poster art is all but banished from mainstream marketing in favour of generic face-mash.

Though in this case I can sympathise as I can barely recognise them - mega points for artistic creativity but zilch for accuracy.&&Poster art like this and the Godzilla: King of the Monsters art really give me hope for movie posters in the future. 

https://m.imgur.com/gallery/BEnf55M&&I want to like this movie, as both actresses are funny and good and all... but it looks so bad. &&That arm is all kinds of fucked up.&&[deleted]&&Even if it is a generic comedy like other people are saying, I still think it’s a cool idea to do the poster like this and they deserve props for that at least. I’d love to see more movie posters like this. &&Looks like Archer to me.&&Every time I see this trailer, I'm bored by Mila's story, and I just want to see what Kate's up to.&&It sucks an artist is wasting their talents on such a shit film.&&That's pretty cool&&The title of this movie is really really bad. 

&&Honestly, gets an upvote from me for not using the standard white background/red text that all these types of films seem to get. &&I don’t think necks work that way. &&The movie that flopped.&&RULE 34:  The Spy Who Dumped On Me&&This movie looks terrible. ☹️&&Kate McKinnon is so good on SNL and so bad in movies.  This looks like another flop for her. &&And yet somehow Mila Kunis looks as disinterested in this poster as she does in the trailers/promotions for this movie.&&this is a nice poster, saw this being promoted on moviepass so i assume its going to be awful.&&This is a poster looks so good and looks like it could be apart of the posters of the 70s/80s. Man I hate how movie posters look now they are just so bland and boring. &&[deleted]&&People are praising this because it uses art instead of screengrabs, but am I the only one who things the drawing is trash? It looks like they hired a high school art student to make this.&&Saw the trailer today.

Movie looks terrible &&This movie is gonna be trash &&I don’t think Kate McKinnon is very funny.&&I'm gonna go see this I think.&&I like it. Obviously inspired by posters for the low budget ""Eurospy"" films of the 60s  (007 knockoffs made to cash in on the James Bond craze).&&I like that they are wearing clothing inspired by men’s wear&&that's a solid poster.  This would be boring if it had been a CGI picture, but as a drawing it's interesting.  A great example of how scaling back the tech can make something better. &&I'm sure it'll be a smash at the box office.....&&IS it just me or is the Kate McKinnon craze already over? I feel like this movie is a low grade movie that barely gets any traction.&&This poster is better than the film will be&&Now there’s a movie I’ll never fucking watch&&I hate to jump the gun here but this looks terrible.&&Clear example of a Movie that was Named first then written after.&&sounds like some hot garbage&&I like Mila Kunis and Sam Heughan, but this movie sounds awful. &&Kate McKinnon is so unfunny. Don't get the hype. She's the same person everyone movie. &&Coming to you from the creative minds of ""Romcom VII: Not Much More Than Pandering Trash"" and the blockbuster hit ""Women: They Just Can't Stop Thinking About Men!"" &&It almost looks like she's wearing the same outfit Al Pacino wore in Scarface.&&Given the choice between a poster like this and another Photoshopped-into-the-uncanny-valley lineup of slightly bewildered faces, I'll take this every time.&&great poster, but I just cant get interested in this film. The trailers just make everything about the premise look so hamfisted and forced. It honestly looks like a B movie script with big name stars and production values. 


The actresses have shown in previous roles they have great talent and I'm sure they'll do the best they can with the roles, but the trailers make it look like its attempting to be a fun, yet serious,  girl power, love story, spy thriller......nothing about that combination excites me personally. And, in my opinion, I think that combination is going to turn off or miss a lot of the intended demographic audience. &&No ty&&Poster is pretty cool. Movie looks like ass, though. &&Am I the only one who thinks this movie is going to flop?&&Why do I already feel like it'll be such a bad movie&&People funded this.....people had jobs working on the set, actors flew in and slept in hotels to make this movie. Weird...&&This movie looks fucking bad&&Kate McKinnon is so unfunny&&Kinda looks like a GTA V loading screen&&Is this another ""WOMEN ARE FUNNY GOD DAMN IT"" movie? &&Is this going to be one of those movies we’re not allowed to criticize because it has two non white males hwadlining it? Like Ghostbusters or black panther?

Definitely a cool poster at least, though.&&Looks like a steaming pile of shit&&so two acctresses who aren't funny&&Nice poster but ""James Bond"" in the right corner looks a bit off...

Too bad the movie sounds incredibly lackluster. The trailers are just blah as well.&&I'm checking it out just for Gillan Anderson alone. Forget the two leads.&&Can we get more posters like this please? So tired of face posters. They all look like the same damn movie, different faces.

I was like ""I've watched the trailer it doesn't take place in DSM...ohhh. dumped.

I live in La Crosse Wisconsin, and you would think that we would be LAX because of our name, but we’re actually LSE. When really, Los Angeles, (LAX) should really technically be LSE. But whatever.&&Or... Da Moped!&&Way to Spoil the Plot Twist!!&&Do the police drive scooters in Iowa? &&Henry Cavill in the window&&Your cops ride Vespas??&&For those who are wondering this poster is a parody of a [Vespa](https://www.andersondesigngroupstore.com/a/collections/shop-by-product/8092125511/from-the-heart/italy-rome-by-vespa)  poster.

Update: Original poster painting by [Kai Carpenter ](https://www.andersondesigngroupstore.com/blogs/news/kai-carpenter) . He has some cool looking vintage-like paintings!&&I'm just happy to see a movie poster that isn't a dozen characters all smushed together doing different things. This poster tells me something about the movie and characters -- I'm actually more interested in seeing it than a was before because of the poster.&&The reality is another awfully Photoshopped MCU poster coming&&Check out [Mondo Posters](https://mondotees.com/collections/archive/Posters); they do limited edition art posters for all sorts of new and revival films. People line up here in Austin every time they do a new release. && sometimes studios just want to really spell out to the average viewer what the fim is, to an intense and frusteating degree. Theres an inbetween, and thats almost always an online or convention exclusive, it then caters to the right people who actively take part in movie news/interests. 

I would also bet that in some form, the artists poster trend plays into it. Places like mondo have close and ongoing ties with the studios like marvel, and regularly license posters. These make a tidy profit and collectors are driven to these as they are a far supiror version. Having the offical poster be said poster could devalue its collectability and a studio like marvel doesn't want to lose out on the cash. 

On top of all this, design studios often do make incredible posters but they are whittled out piece by peice until we end up with the photosghop throw up that is so common. I witnessed this myself at a place called empire design in london, they showed us some really beautiful work that was just scrapped for being too ""artistic"" &&The retro feeling is probably due to the retro styling. Just a thought.&&Something about it bugs me. The perspective feels wrong and after looking at it awhile I realized that with the way her arm is drawn she's shooting left-handed but looking down the sights with her right eye. Also what is her right hand supposed to be resting on? Kate McKinnon's leg?&&It looks like an Archer poster. &&We had this poster hanging in our family room as art:  
http://shop.olympic.org/en/product/index/view/id/792/product/en-chf-stockholm-1956-equestrian-games-poster-792

I think art was used in the past when color photography was far less common.  Color photography didn't dominate until sometime in the 1970's.
&&I think you can still do really great stuff with photography, but it's up to the designer of the poster whether they are prioritizing the art, or the advertisement of the film, and it's obvious to the viewer which the priority is.&&Unless they don't look like anything close to resembling the actresses or the setting. Like this poster. This doesn't say anything to me. &&came here to say the same thing. I mean, not all posters should be drawings, but really none should look like photoshop versions of Drew Struzan.

I mean, we all like Drew Struzan, but his style is pretty standard for all film posters of major blockbusters. &&I'll be honest from the poster I thought one of the women was the spy and dumped the other one &&Why is it that whenever it’s women in the lead it’s always about their boyfriend or some stupid shit? It’s like that superhero movie with what’s her fuck where she’s just a jilted lover. Ugh, come on.&&Outrageous Fortune?

edit:  minus the preexisting friendship&&Not a very good spy tho &&I think Mila Kunis definitely looks like Mila Kunis here.  Kate McKinnon could be anyone though.&&Is it, though? Hand drawn art for marketing media is awesome. But, this poster isn't exactly a masterpiece. Look at the weird way Mila's arm is bent, and the unnatural twisting of their necks. Something is just off. &&I think the issue was that it came down to one or two guys. [I know this guy is somewhat of a legend](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Struzan).

Somewhat related, I have [this poster](https://i.imgur.com/p8gXpWR.jpg) because I love the hand drawn look so much more than most recent posters  &&I can't say I'm a fan. It's a nice concept but it looks rushed. The buildings on the left are all painted whereas the ones on the right are just recoloured photographs. And then the guy in the window looks like he was shopped in as an afterthought.&&Drawn/art posters are making a resurgence, they are anything but banished.&&Yeah. The final release poster will be nothing like this. if it's a comedy it'll have a red uppercase text title on a white background.&&>  truly great poster art

This is terrible art especially for a 'Hollywood Movie', where to start - the awkward go go gadget arm and pose, off balanced seating position making sure she would fall backwards, the dull indifferent robot expressions and driver whom would crash from craning her head back to smile at nothing.&&considering the HARD twists in those necks?  yeah... those girls dont' look comfortable at all. &&Wow I want to watch this movie now&&Hmmm... 

Reminds me of [this poster](https://www.andersondesigngroupstore.com/a/collections/kai-carpenter/italy-rome-by-vespa)&&Justin Theroux and Gillian Anderson are also in the movie, both really good&&You can expect McKinnon will not know when to dial it back. She would be so much more funny if she was a little more subtle at times. &&I’m not a fan of McKinnon, she got typecasted hard. Just like Melissa Mcarthy always plays the loud crazy women, McKinnon always plays some brand of a crazy lady who can’t stop having fun no matter what’s happening.&&Haven't seen the trailer.

Guessing girl gets dumped, friend talks her into confronting the guy, they get sucked into this whole adventure with spy protecting them the whole time, bad guys lose, girl finds out spy really did love her but dumped her for her safety, spy and dumped girl live happily ever after?&&Idk, probably better off not giving away the best shit in the trailer like every other movie&&Trailers and marketing do sometimes make a film look worse than it actually is. Spy, starring Melissa McCarthy is a good example of this.&&I saw a trailer and it looked like a 2 hour Lele Pons video where loud=funny. There's a setup and instead of a punchline, they scream or make a funny face&&Even if it looks bad, it looks like Barry Peterson did some good work on the action. So I’m probably gonna check it out . He did a great job with Game Night &&I actually sat down to watch the new Ghostbusters movie despite all the hate it got, and Kate McKinnon's character was insufferable. I cringed about 80% of the time she was given any attention, and I say that because there were genuinely a few laughs. In fairness to her, I don't think the character was given a great script and the editing was awful. &&I've actually seen it in an advanced screening. Its honestly not bad, but it is a weird kind of boring. The action scenes are meh, and the comedy is only coming from Kate McKinnon being the whacky sidekick. The trailer makes it look worse because there's genuinely not that much to show. Kinda feels like they had an idea and didn't take the time they needed to make a great script.&&It is!  I kept looking at it to figure it out.  The way she is holding the gun with her arm extended, it should be coming across a fair portion of her face.  Clearly the artist didn't want to cover that much of the face and they chose to kind of 'migrate' the arm down and to the left.  It doesn't look natural at all.  &&Yeah. They're trying to show her face while holding the gun. Geez just use the other arm then! &&Can't believe these studio with their truckloads of money couldn't  find themselves a better artist for this gig, this poster looks ok but still screams amateur, definitely not movie poster ready. I'm sure there are plenty of better artist out there that would love to give this a shot&&The artist should have switched the hands. It would help this image. &&It is. The used too heavy of a shadow on the knuckles the back of her hand, so it almost looks like her hand is inverted (like it's her other hand, fingers curled in). 

C'mon.&&Also, the second Kate starts driving upright, Mila is on her ass in the street with a broken face.&&I can't see it it looks normal, tell my dumbass what I'm missing 😖&&Is this even an actual poster made by the studio? There are no legal lines. &&Specifically the chase at the beginning of ""Job Offer.""

ODIN doesn't beat Sterling Archer! Only Sterling Archer beats--&&> Looks like Archer to me.

My guess is that's not a coincidence.&&The scene with her ogling Gillian Anderson could be the whole movie and I'd be totally fine with it.&&How many times did you watch the trailer?&&Im in Berlin saw the poster for it here, where it’s apparently called „Bad Spies“, and I can’t decide which is worse.&&It's a reference to what is arguably the best Bond film of all time. I thought it was ridiculously boring, but hey, it's famous.&&I like it. &&How do you know, are you a neckspert?&&I feel like she's a tremendously good skit-actress who hasn't found her groove in cinema yet. 

Everything she does on SNL is fantastic and her skits reliably get a good laugh out of me (unlike 90% of the rest of the show's skits, sadly...) but her movie career has just been an awkward mess of her playing a skit role for 2 hours. It doesn't work well and it's not funny (to me). She just ends up being a 1-dimensional quirky lady (Ghostbusters, for example). 

I think she needs a solo movie that takes advantage of her hilarious skit abilities - like a ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Airplane"" where it's just rapid fire joke-joke-joke-joke instead of some drawn out plot that takes itself too seriously. &&She was the only one who looked like she was having any fun in Ghostbusters.  When Egon is the fun one, your movie is bad.&&I think she's often the only decent one in relatively crappy movies. Like Ghostbusters, she's overdriven, but in the same way that the original Ghostbusters were kind of overdriven, she's dedicated to playing a weird character weirdly. Same as that bachelorette party where she's the Australian friend.

She's got good comic sensibilities. But seems to wind up in a lot of movies where either the movie itself or the rest of the cast are kind of either dragging her down, or just going for something completely different. &&Blame the script writers. I think she's really talented but she does take a lot of shit projects&&She’s going to continue to get opportunities though, Hollywood still feels really bad for her because they thought she had four years of playing Hillary Clinton every Saturday night locked in. &&>Kate McKinnon is so good on SNL and so bad in movies

I blame type-casting and shitty directors not understanding how to utilize her (lookin' at you, Feig).&&I thought she was funny in Masterminds :(&&Well, at least they're trying. &&It's not trash, but it's pretty bad. Mainly the arm - which I'm sure the artist had proper reference for - but it seems this is one of those cases when what works in a photo just doesn't in a painting. The second most glaring issue is the man in the window. He's out of scale both in relationship to the building, and to the level of finish. It looks like he was painted at the same scale as the women, and then shrunk down, and it shows. Third issue is that there are a lot of inconsistensies in the level of finish all over the piece.

Still, even though it's far from great, I'm happy to see a painted movie poster.&&Drawn characters and photos filtered and painted over for everything else. Car and buildings are so out of place. &&And Kunis looks like Magnum PI&&Muh vagina \*cue ear splitting laugh track*&&That’s a good line. I can’t decide which way I’d go. IF it goes over it’s going to be at least 80%, BUT there is a really good chance it will be 20% or less.&&To me it looks like some sort of pan-european architecture. Whatever it is, it's absolutely intentional. I wouldn't be surprised if it happens almost completely in Europe.&&They look like the generic Europe sets in Universal Studios, Hollywood. &&Well, Ashton, is from Iowa, so..... tide goes in, tide goes out. You can't explain that.&&Yeah, where's the weather beacon? &&It was shot mainly in Budapest, AFAIK.&&The spire makes me think Germany. The building on the right scream London Beaux arts, but the ornaments on each window seem french. The left seems Italian, while the center buildings has a roof I'm sure I've seen in Zurich.

And the colors look like they're from Sint Maarten.&&That looks like Rome. &&*Policeman officer scooter&&I'm honestly surprised by how many people from DSM are around here. Wonder if I know any of y'all.&&Everyone I know in La Crosse just calls it LAX anyway.&&Awesome! I had no idea&&So MCU movies&&The 'Search Party' poster with the lead using a cellphone flashlight like Nancy Drew was pretty cool too.&&

&&I actually thought that Aquaman did that pretty well with their den of geeks coverbas it looked like a comic book cover. Agreed though, the fad needs to die&&The poster worked then!&&There are more creative posters, it's just that the poster they give out to theaters are the most generic ones.&&Yeah, so many movie covers these days are just shots of the actors photoshopped onto some random background. They all look very samey, even big blockbusters like Marvel films have quite boring covers.&&""floating head syndrome""

&&Or a movie poster with two characters standing back to back, one of them with a serious 'I mean business' face and the other with a goofy 'did I do thaaaat?' face.&&In fairness, the ones from this year were okay.

Action comedy = the lead is a fish out of water and is incompetent at their job. The only exception to this is if the lead is a straight white male, at which point they are just incompetent and inexplicably haven’t been fired.

In action movies with female leads this year, we had

- The badass Evangeline Lily character in *Ant Man and The Wasp*. Paul Rudd’s character was an incompetent buffoon.

- Mrs. Incredible in *Incredibles 2* being the main source of competence. Mr. Incredible was an incompetent buffoon.

- Domino in *Deadpool 2* being the main source of competence. Deadpool himself was an incompetent buffoon.

- Bryce Dallas Howard being the main source of competence in *Jurassic World*. Pratt was an incompetent buffoon.

- Literally just *Ocean’s 8*.

- *Annihiliation*, where Natalie Portman stars as a badass scientist space marine type thingy.

We also had five action movies where a female wasn’t the main lead:

*Black Panther*, *The Rock Stars in a Die Hard Knockoff*, *The Rock Fights a Monkey*, *Childish Gambino Fucks a Robot*, and *Sicario 2*

So, basically, the majority of action movies to come out this year directly contradict your claim. &&Yeah when I first saw the trailer that was the first thing that came to mind. Why can’t she just be a spy on her own?&&There’s actually a word for this, but it has something to do with the [Bechdel Test](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) &&Because mainstream media treats women like they’re still 1950s objects who only care about gratification from some schmendrick dude, usually played by Owen Wilson.

No, I’m not a bitter old lesbian. You’re bitter. /s &&Looks more like Scarlett Johansson or Amber Heard&&She could be Justin Bieber,  Hillary Clinton, or Ruth Bader Ginsburg. It is hard to tell ;)&&I wouldn't have known it's Mila Kunis if I didn't know about the movie beforehand&&thought it was Katherine Heigl and was sad to see her in the movie &&Looks more like Alison Brie than Mila.&&The title text looks off too. It doesn’t look “authentically” 70s enough—it’s clearly Photoshop text—so ends up just looking weird and out of place.

I like the idea, but the execution is off.&&What throws me off the most is the angle of Mila Kunis’ head. The poster is beautiful and I love the style, but I can’t unsee that her head looks weirdly stuck on &&Thank you. The style is nice but people are gushing over it because it's  refreshing, I guess, when the job done isn't that great.&&Definitely intentional &&And don’t forget *Outlander* fans will come out in droves to see Sam Heughan.&&Gillian Anderson is gonna be in it?!

Fuck yes, I'm gonna definitely go see it &&I found this to be the case in Ghostbusters. Every goofy scene felt like an SNL skit where she was trying to make the other cast members laugh. They almost felt improvised. &&Too much SNL in her blood for that&&""WA-OOO THE ALIENS CAME DOWN TO PROBE MY HOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAA!""

She's like one step away from being a real life Fozzie Bear.&&i think we’re in the vast minority but i agree. she is so unbelievably extra in every movie. that over the top character absurdity might work in a 2 minute sketch in SNL, but i find it incredibly grating across a 1.5-hour movie.

also why does she always have to do an accent?&&Totally agree. She needs to learn to be a little more subtle and ease up at times. &&Thank you! I always thought she was extremely one-noted. It drives me crazy how the media adores her and hails her as one of the funniest celebrities alive. It always feels like she is exempt from critiques.&&She's great on SNL, maybe my favorite female cast member after Wiig, but I don't know if she's ever been in a good movie. Maybe her style is great for sketches, weaker in a 90 minute film. &&I loved McCarthy her in Spy. That was one great movie, and in the same vein as this one.

E: fucked up vein with vine lmao

E2: fucked up again smh&&Pretty common among comedy actors. Just think about the range portrayed by actors like Chris Farley, Adam Sandler or Chris Tucker.&&I think it's more along the lines of spy dumps girl. Evil organization doesn't follow FB relationship status and tries to take girl as leverage. Girl runs with bff and becomes the badass spy herself. &&From the trailer it looks more like her boyfriend gets killed or is otherwise incapcitated and the two girls are the one who have to finish his mission.&&I always watch comedies just for the plot&&yeah, and i think Airplane was just about a guy landing a plane.  i mean, it was Filled with hilarity, but what a boring premise.  hard pass.&&Spy turns out to be asshole, girl kicks spy to curb, girl realizes she’s loved her friend this whole time, end movie on five minute scene that puts Black Swan to shame. 🙏&&Honestly it does not really matter what the plot is, it feels like improv line after improv line, like later Will Farrell where they kept everything instead of just having like a handful of improved lines that are pure gold. &&I think it looks more like girl and her bff end up together at the end.&&If there's so little good shit in the movie that the trailer has to be unappealing af in order to not give it all away, then the movie is probably shit.&&I really liked that movie&&I thought Kate McKinnon was the best part of the new Ghostbusters. Her and Chris Hemsworth were the only two funny things in that movie.&&They could have at least lowered the gun, and it would be a more believable eye line.  Shouldn't she be shooting at a car behind them, and not high in the air?&&My first thought when looking at it (ignoring the leg position) was she was turning backward to her *right*, aiming the gun with her *right* arm. When I looked more closely, she's holding it with her left arm and leaning forward with some weird elbow angle. It just looks *off*.&&Yeah that’s the weirdest part, I get how they could have messed up the arm, but the hand looks seriously wrong.

They could have had her pointing the gun at the viewer, that would mean she gets a full face and doesn’t look all bent.&&It was made by an agency, but yes it’s legit.

The Spy Who Loved Me is the best of all time? From Russia with Love all the way.&&How is this a reference to GoldenEye?&&Lets just say I have a neck for these sort of things. &&“What are you, the rug doctor?”&&She's over the top in a way that works super well in small doses and becomes grating if given too much screen time. She needs to learn to dial it back and ""be normal"" so that her comedic scenes stand out.

Even if the entire move was jokes any one of her characters would get super annoying if you had to watch them for 2 hours. &&Yeah, She was charismatic. Her and Chris Hemsworth both. &&Looks like they MS Paint cut and pasted Pierce Brosnan in that window.&&But the public is calling for a Des Moines based spy escapade. When will Hollywood listen?&&One of the trailers has a one-liner that goes “would you rather die having never been to Europe, or die having been to Europe?”

So yes, Europe it is.&&Movie takes place in Budapest!&&Punk me once, shame on you, Punk me...You can’t get pumped again!!&&Is that what The Tide challenge is all about? &&They tore it down a few years ago. It's still a tender topic.&&I know! My friend texted me and said he was in LAX, and he’s in the military so I wasn’t sure if he was in Los Angeles or La Crosse. I assumed the latter though.&&Star Wars does this too, and I think most Disney/Pixar movies do as well.&&In regards to posters with a lot of faces, I personally really liked Thor: Ragnarok and Infinity War's posters though :(

I agree that many could have had much better ones. The first Captain America had some typical posters with all the people crammed together, but the one with him holding the shield looking down with all the shrapnel flying around was amazing. Too bad Winter Soldier's poster was nowhere as good as the actual film. Iron Man 3, Avengers 1 and Guardians 1/2 also had a pretty cool posters.

And to be fair, Infinity War had to display the idea that almost every single big hero was coming together in one movie, it was a massive selling point that brought out casual viewers or people just unaware of that fact and helped make it such a massive success in the box office. 

I even know some people that said they weren't considering seeing it until they realized the scope of the movie and how the Guardians of the Galaxy were in it and some didn't even know they were connected to the MCU movies. I'm sure Black Panther's success with the large audience it gained from many people not invested in the MCU movies also helped for sure, knowing that he would be back in another movie (the Avengers, no less which is a name almost everyone knows at this point) just 2 months after his own movie, and Wakanda with him no less (that part more from trailers than the poster though.)

But yeah Avengers 4 could totally have a cooler poster with less faces (and that's guaranteed ;) rip) because Infinity War was such a success, the next movie is expected to do just as good if not even better.

Want to add the Spider-Man Homecoming poster was probably by far the *worst*, especially compared to the other poster they made with him in the suit and jacket with the Avengers tower in the background.... an obvious and very stupid choice, but surprise! Sony had control over that.&&Pretty much every blockbuster does this&&It’s just...two brothers. It’s two brothers.&&IIRC, that's the one Sony made. The one Marvel made is so much better.&&[Good thing they later fixed it.](https://i.imgur.com/hbgeZ26.png)&&^(Hey, did you know that) **ZENDAYA** ^(is in this movie?)&&Holy shit. I'm in accounting and I could do a better Photoshop job than that...&&Wait is this real?&&Why is the Washington monument there!?&&That looks like an Oscar-bait drama.&&That poster is for Iron Man 4 featuring Spider-Man&&Literally never saw this poster, only one I saw was the one with Spidey laying down, which was a really good poster.&&let's not forget about [Ghana posters](https://imgur.com/gallery/dWNjB)&&It's just unfortunate that the ones they put on buses, billboards, and in cinemas, are the crappy photoshop posters.&&I've got a copy of that Spidey Odeon poster, it's great! &&Ok. That infinity war is insane. But who the hell is in the very top right? Is it supposed to be a Ronin version of Hawkeye?&&To be fair, it’s not hard to admire Mila Kunis&&Yeah, after reading these comments my interest went down. &&r/GirlsMirin&&Like *Knight and Day* or *Killers* but a lil bit gayer. &&I'll bet right now that that over the movie they develop feelings for each other.&&I imagine the pressure would be enormous to make a ""real feeling"" lesbian couple.  But I guess romcoms are typically fantasy anyways.

FWIW, The Kids Are Alright is a pretty good movie from 8 years ago which features one half of a lesbian couple as a lead.  Though you can subtract points I suppose because she's bisexual and it's a drama, not a comedy&&Imagine Me and You is about as close as you'll get to a lesbian romcom. It's very British, pretty cheesy, and a fun watch (and excitingly for an LGBT film, has a happy ending). It has Lena Headey in it! &&You didn't like Fried Green Tomatoes?  (/s *kinda)&&It would definitely be new and interesting &&I'm totally down for giving Kate McKinnon a lesbian romcom. &&

Other Scott : And you didn't bang her? Are you gay?

Scott Pilgrim : I couldn't stop thinking about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

Jimmy : Is that the Uma Thurman movie?&&You can agree and also be excited&&Its a different kind of ex-bf movie. When she become badass through circumstance instead of whiny or manipulative. &&this is a good list. I'd also say the female characters in black panther were great, and although skyscraper wasn't great, Neve Campbell's role was pretty good too. She still needed the rock to rescue her but she was badass in her own right. Dead

Deadpool went 1 for 2, domino was awesome but Vanessa was only there to further Wade's development. 

I wish we could just have strong lead characters though without the need for someone else to prop them up, male or female. &&* Bryce Dallas Howard being the main source of competence in Jurassic World

Did we watch the same movie? She was hardly competent in either of the movies.&&because i dont' think it's about being a spy... i think it's about having been involved with one accidentally and now it's a ""fish out of water"" kind of story where these girls are ""in over their heads.""

i mean, if you didn't want to go the BF route, you could do it like, ""her mom was the spy."" &&There are movies out there with women spys? The head of M16 (james bond organization) is a woman. Why can’t this story be what it wants to be without criticism? There’s no doubt that this woman getting dumped is crucial to the dynamic of this story.&&You forgot to make Owen say ""wow""&&i think you've been watching old movies.&&Have we been watching the same media? The action badass 'don't need no man' heroine has been a big thing for a while now. &&Huh? I feel like we’re watching vastly different movies. I’d say there are plenty of issues with the writing of female characters in modern day media but I generally don’t see what you’re describing. I also haven’t seen Owen Wilson in forever, funnily enough.&&My first thought was [Jessica St. Clair](https://ucbcomedy.com/user/875)&&Annnnnd thats a Ginsburn&&Or Rudy Guillani, the presidents “lawyer”&&Don't forget Ellen. &&The text was definitely added by a different artists. Someone made the poster and left that spot blank so they could add localizations and other text. &&After the Holtzmann debacle I’ve come to call her The Human Noodle. &&I don’t particularly find her that funny at all. It’s always so overacted and cheap laughs which is frustrating because it seems like women either have to be fat or crazy to be funny anymore.&&She's the female Will Ferrell; Just be weird and YELL ALL THE TIME.&&Aye, Spy is a great action-comedy and easily surpassed my expectations. The Verka cameo just made it all the better. &&""Look at me, I am the spy now.""&&watching the trailer it does look like they're going for the ""dumped girl becomes bad as spy without really knowing it,"" angle. But it's just so hamfisted and forced it just looks awful. &&I’ve only seen the posters, but I was hoping the movie would be about the main character girl’s experience dating the other protagonist and slowly realizing her girlfriend is getting more and more mysterious before getting completely dragged into crazy spy stuff and finally being dumped by her in the end.&&There are plenty of great storytelling comedies out there. I wish there was more of an effort in hollywood to create smart comedies instead of slapstick/toilet humor type stuff that floods the theaters now, but I still think there is room for the occasional silly, fun comedy like this one as long as the jokes are funny and it entertains me for 90 minutes.

The recent entries of Tag, Life of the Party and Super Troopers 2 has me not holding my breath though, but I'm still going to give t a chance!&&I guess there are really only two plots (according to John Gardner): a man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town.  Probably don't even need to consider anything past that.&&Depends on what the plot of the movie is and how much they want to give away in the trailer. I watched Damsel last night and Sorry To Bother You the night before and of those trailers were completely different than the movie, for the very good reason of keeping viewers in suspense and not giving away major plot points. &&Oh Hemsworth was easily my favourite part. But Kate felt so utterly forced and...try hard-y? I mean, you always know what you're going to get with Kristin Wiig and Melissa McCarthy so I had no issues there. &&Oh cool, LA did it.

I really like them. &&I've heard this from so many different lesbians. The x-files were too scary for me. I still haven't seen one episode.&&The best poster ever is „Taken“. It was called „96 Hours“, and yes on the one I saw it was hours in English.

""Why are those my only options!?""

I've seen that commercial quite a bit.&&to be fair, it is a SW tradition&&If you image search the posters for various Disney movies, you'll notice there are usually two kinds: one is minimal, artistically rich, and has an air of tension or mystery to it. The other is crammed full with every character in the movie.

The first kind of poster - the one with some gravitas and intrigue to it - is usually what accompanies the theatrical release. It's designed to pique your interest in the story being told, or the world it takes place in.

The second kind - the crowded ones - are typically from the video release. By then most of their target audience has seen the movie, so the marketing isn't interested in drawing you in anymore. These posters and DVD covers are for another purpose entirely: to get you to buy the merchandise. By this point there are tons of toys and books and t-shirts on the shelves, and it's not about the story anymore, it's about Disney wanting you to buy all these manifestations of the characters. So they show you the whole lot of them, and generally make them look much happier than they ever were in the movies, because now they're your buddies and you should take them home.

Anyway, point is, the actual theatrical posters are usually very nice. It's the post-theatrical marketing materials that suck.&&[deleted]&&[This one?](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71myggAB1UL._SY679_.jpg) One of my all-time favorite ones!&&Any source on that? The one where he is chilling has Sony headphones so it might have been Sony made as well. AFAIK Sony handled all of the marketing.&&You had a bit at the end of the link that broke it.

Here's a fixed version:

*bloodspot*&&Oh man, I want to make a guest room in my house with all Ghana posters&&That's what gets the general populace into seats though, if artsy posters did that they'd be on the side of buses too.&&Okoye.&&It's interesting to me that Ashton Kutcher starred in two movies that were the same as a different movie that came out at the same time, and both were worse than their counterpart. These and No Strings Attached vs Friends With Benefits.&&Are there any gay action movies? Theron's character in Atomic Blonde was bi, so we're almost there, but I'm anxiously awaiting the day when we get a John Wick type movie where the main dude happens to be gay and we find out like 40 minutes in.&&I loved the Kids Are Alright when it came out, esp since I was starved for any movie with lesbian depictions as a young gay. But rewatching it these days is mixed — a romance with a man is the main plot point and there’s lots of weird stereotypes. It’s still fun though. 

Edit: a good (low budget) lesbian rom com is Saving Face. It’s about Chinese Anerican lesbians in queens with some fun straight rom com side stories&&Uh no I have to disagree. Just another movie about a lesbian couple where one sleeps with a man. &&I feel like the niche is more for something in the vein of Love, Simon. TKAA is good but more focused on the family in general/a little sad. &&Goodness, could you imagine the struggle to find gay actors?&&And Piper Perabo. I love that movie ❤️&&Imagine Me and You is one of my favorite romcoms! I don't know how many times I've watched it!&&Yes! I need a less dramatic lesbian movie &&I think I also just like the Brittney song in the trailer. &&Spy Kids then&&I can never not hear this in Melissa Villasenor's voice&&Yeah but you're not allowed to recognize that. Forget Oceans 8, or the Ghostbusters reboot, either Kill Bill, or any one of the movies off a long list of recent movies with strong female leads. It just hasn't happened in Hollywood yet &&Womp it up. &&From the trailer it honestly looks like they scream and run around for the whole movie.&&Check out Game Night if you haven't already...a very fun and smart comedy that is definitely a step above the other three entries you listed!&&You should check out Sorry To Bother You that's out right now. &&As a kid my favorite was always Man With the Golden Gun.

Also porn, because you can make porn anywhere. &&With enough petitions and hashtags, we can do anything. #petitionformorehashtags&&I remember when we had a film tax credit for the state and then turns out some shady guy abused it so it had to stop. &&Star Wars is essentially the establishee of the trope, if not then the standardizer&&The Incredibles isn’t a satire. &&Pretty sure that this one came about from a moment when Tom Holland was just chilling on set between takes. &&Yeah, that one.&&There was some great promo art as well like [this piece](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGSr4unUMAAUPso.jpg) by One Punch Man artist Yusuke Murata.&&This one is great, as is the TSWDM in OP.

e: Mis-remembered shitty movie posters, I actually saw neither.&&Which is funny because Mila was in the one opposite him regarding NSA (It was Kutcher and Natalie Portman) and FwB (Timberlake and Kunis) . &&The second we get one people will start bitching that anything more than the most subtle of subtle hints is beating us over the head with it.&&OMG, 'saving face' is my favorite! Another movie I really enjoy is 'I can't think straight'. That was a legitimate romantic comedy that focuses on lesbians, without the whole ""cheating/affairs"" Aspect thrown in it. 

'Imagine me and you' is good but it involves the main character having an affair. Which I just dislike, I mean I know cheating is common but it's really prevalent in romantic comedies revolving around gay men and women. &&That's fine.  I thought it was a pretty good family drama movie, what happens when one partner strays.  The couple just happened to both be women.  I remember it fondly, but I guess it's been awhile since I saw it. 

Out of curiosity, is lesbian couple where one partner cheats a trope I'm not aware of?&&Great recommendation, say thankya&&But I'm a Cheerleader or D.E.B.S. I mean. obviously we need more but you should definitely watch those 2&&Then you need But I'm a Cheerleader&&A lesbian romcom would be pretty anticlimactic, they typically rent a moving truck on the second date. &&Wonder Woman, Furiosa, Lucy, the lady Ghost busters, the Ocean's 8 cast, Proud Mary, Hanna, Cataleya from Colombiana, Lara Croft, Atomic Blonde, The Major, Halle Berry in Kidnap and the Call, Gabrielle Union in Breaking In, Evelyn Salt... yep, they just don't exist. &&Grimace meets the pyramids meets upside down blueberry muffin.&&And that random slidewhistle during an otherwise awesome stunt.

An “establishee” if that was a word would be the thing that got established. Like when you get a letter, you’re the addressee.&&Yeah but it looks much better when it's done as art.

Where something so original/unique for it's time becomes so ubiquitous that people start thinking the original is dumb/cliched. &&It’s a homage!&&I havent seen the second one, but the first one was certainly satirical. Not constantly, 100% the whole time, but it contained enough elements that could be satirical that I think its fair to call it a satire.

The movie is completely composed of satirical jabs at cliche superhero tropes and other nonsense.

&&""And then we killed his dog again, because it worked out really well for the rest of the world's largest criminal syndicates.""&&Will it feature maestro and alibi? &&John Wick 3 : Paracetamol&&Lol they have to stop making movies about fortnite. First the one with Thanos and now this&&I hope the film is about John assassinating whoever had that idea, good lord. 

If the second film is called Chapter Two then the third film *must* be called Chapter Three. No exceptions.&&Hot take: The John Wick franchise is better than Star Wars.&&/#2 was very medicore but I loved the first. Hopefully they can expand on the universe without getting too silly.&&Well the Twitter still says Chapter 3, so I don't really see this as confirmation yet. Hope it stays Chapter 3 for consistency.

https://mobile.twitter.com/johnwickmovie?lang=en&&hope he keeps his balance.&&I'm calling it, John Wick will be our kid's James Bond. &&Hoping James Rolfe rants about this in a new Chronologically Confusing installment.&&While I'm an absolute fan, I'm surprised they're making a third.

I mean, how many movies does it take for people to learn to give this dude a *very* wide berth?&&Plot sounded pretty cool to me: he dies in the first ten minutes, the rest of the movie is his dog brutally murdering everyone who was involved in the hit.&&He's gonna need a wife, dog and car to up the stakes.&&Honestly, I think the John Wick movies are just okay outside of the action, but any chance I get to watch Keanu kicking ass and being awesome I'm a happy boi.&&Cool, is that the name of his new dog?&&They should've called it John Wick: Excommunicado &&""Parabellum - latin for 'prepare for war' ""
I think i just i just peed little in excitment reading that&&hey ain’t that the guy from fortnut 

Jk&&Woah the guy from fortnite is getting another movie?&&Garbage for the proles&&Will he show up in Ant Man? He is Baba Yaga.&&Cant wait for the porn version.

When I first saw trailers, I thought for sure that was where it was going. I think it got hurt for being too quirky, whereas the Continental was sharp.&&[deleted]&&Where can it even go from here? By the end of 2 we learned that 90% of the world's population are assassins.&&Oh man that would be awesome... Even better if they managed to get Keenue to pop in from time to time as a cameo, setting it back when he was at the top of his game, but he's just a side piece for the actual show.&&they said they were taking it global in the third one.

if I remember right, Keanu said it like this: ""the first movie focused on the local area, it established who John Wick was. The second movie focuses more on the rules and regulations of the industry. the third will focus on the global cabal""&&right? this just kind of defies the naming convention of the series too&&It's because the entire movie is moving away from the action schtick. It's four and a half hours of John sitting in a dark room, alone except for the corpse of his dog, debating whether or not to fire the parabellum into his cerebellum...

Or not. It's just a shot in the dark :D&&Nah i prefer: 

John Wick: Chapter 3: Parabellum&&I imagine it is a take on the ""9mm parabellum"" round, as well as just sounding cool&&My vote goes to Chapter 3. &&Same, but I think they're looking to extend this beyond a trilogy, so they're gonna go the subtitle route.&&I agree.  It seems weird to change it up.&&Parabellum means ""prepare for war""&&[deleted]&&John Wick 3: Wickier Than Ever&&You should be proud of that pun.&&The movie is a battle royale between john, cassian, that mute chick, and some other rando assassins. Winner gets 300000 vbucks.&&John Wick 3: 22LR&&A fucking pencil!&&Well, same as the first. Second one had a lot of issues. &&I will be onboard even if if Keanu keeps making John Wick movies until he's 70.

Para Bellum

Prepare for War&&Not just the 9mm but was an entire brand that was built up by DWM (Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, German guns and ammo company) centered around the Luger or as it is also known Pistole Parabellum. It involved the Luger and the cartridges designed for it like the 9mm and the 7.65mm which isn't as well known. Wiki says they were trying to manufacture a cool nickname for the gun like how the Colt single action army is known as the peacemaker. Well there's may make peace but our's is ready for war is something I'm sure a DWM sales rep said at one point. The Luger eventually became better known as just the Luger and really 9mm Parabellum is the only thing that's stuck 120 years later. 


If DWM existed today they would probanly try to turn it into a lifestyle brand. Parabellum shirts, iPhone cases, coffee mugs, hats, key chains etc. You'd see douchebags with their Ray Ban glasses, Supreme shirt, Yeezy shoes and Parabellum hat. &&Sic vis pacem, para bellum: Latin for “if you want peace, prepare for war.”&&Isn't a Parabellum a kind of bullet, too?&&John Wick 4:Antebellum where Wick goes around saying ""It's mighty powerful hot, I do declare.""&&Are bees allowed on continental grounds?&&Bill n Ted crossover&&The guy with all of the emotional range versus the guy with none of the emotional range.

In the first movie the Continental was a secret league of elite assassins. By the end of Chapter 2 everyone in the world was part of it. Apparently even all the homeless on the streets are high-level hitmen. Ridiculous.
 
The henchmen have basically become video game AI. They just run up to John to get shot one after another. It's like they forgot their guns can be fired from outside of point blank range.&&Watch it&&They did really well by making Ruby Rose's character deaf, so they didn't have to give her any lines. &&My copy of the first and second one arrived in the mail a few days ago because I got sick of renting it online. I even got my wife to watch them both and she liked them alot. And she's not a big action fan.

Oh man a muppet Ian McShane is going on my list of things I never realized I wanted...&&It's also from “Si vis pacem, para bellum,” which translates as, “If you want peace, prepare for war.”

Source: [Keanu himself.](http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/956201-exclusive-keanu-reeves-talks-john-wick-3-parabellum)&&Not really. Parabellum refers to a particular cartridge, commonly called 9mm. It was designed in the early 20th century for the German army, but it has become the standard NATO pistol round, and so is extremely common and has been widely used in SMGs (though SMGs themselves are on the way out).&&But that's wrong?&&It's Latin for ""Prepare for war."" But it's also used for a type of small arms round. Like a 9mm P[arabellum].

 FTFY

&&Give Wick another 7 movies and we'll see.&&Right now definitely. But they don't have dumbfucks running the franchise so that helps. &&Agreed.&&They have plans to make it a series akin to the James Bond franchise.  So I imagine we can expect a few more.  Probably will see this third film,  a prequel, and then maybe a side movie kind of like Artemis hotel.   &&It truly surprises me that I'm excited to see this universe expand too. The first one was good for many reasons, but mostly because it was such a refreshing style of action movie for a genre that had grown stagnant in recent years. The second one was interesting because it introduced us to a world that was much bigger than just a dude avenging his puppy. I want to see more in this universe, and that's all due to the ground that paved in the second chapter.&&So... 40 minutes of Lance Reddick looking after very good dogs every week for the next 10 years? I'm excited&&Is there? I disagree. I think that the lack of thorough world building added to the simple appeal of the first film. I think that overbuilding of the world is one reason that the second movie wasn't of the same caliber as the first. 

The first movie felt simple and raw. The plot was driven by the characters and their actions, who were driven by their feelings (anger, love, greed, etc.). 

The second movie, by comparison, felt like it had this overarching plot that was happening in the background, and the characters were only acting out roles in this grand plot. The plot of the movie felt detached from the actual feelings and motivations of the characters involved, it made the whole movie feel less engaging and less real.

I'm still a fan of the second movie, I just think that it wasn't as good as the first. I'm preparing for each subsequent movie to be slightly lower quality than the previous one until the franchise has been sucked dry, as is the way of Hollywood right now 
&&I realize there is demand for more world building but I dont think John Wick needs that. That ominous flair is *just* right.&&From what I understand it doesn't follow John specifically and if wick3 picks up where 2 left off, these three movies will occur over a period of a few weeks. So idk, my guess is it probably won't  be happening alongside the movies.&&The universe can stand without the Hollywood A-lister(s) to carry it. Marvel has proved that with SHIELD. 

Then again, DC has shown the opposite can be true with many of their own shows.&&I'd be ok with that, John either finally does get to retire or dies taking out the High Table, leaving The Continental network to pick up the pieces in the chaos that follows.&&It's a concept I'm willing to explore.

Or at least pay money for other, more creative people to explore.&&I assumed a bunch of assassins were there because most of them came to collect the massive bounty on Wick's head. We're only 24 hours or less from anywhere in the world these days, plus I would have to assume The Continental also has some kind of underground airline to rapidly deploy them anywhere in the world. &&Think of it more like- we have a lot of assassins. It could be anyone, even everyone.

That last scene was more a power play, than a confrontation.&&Just wait until John Wick the Fourth and John Wick V&&Reminds me of how they did that deliberately for the Saints Row games

Exactly - pick one and stick with it. &&The third How to Train Your Dragon movie is doing this as well.

Ain't nothing in this world for free&&I enjoyed reading your comment, on Reddit, regarding John Wick's new movie, John Wick 3 featuring the adventures of John Wick. &&> The henchmen have basically become video game AI. They just run up to John to get shot one after another. It's like they forgot their guns can be fired from outside of point blank range.

Haven’t seen chapter 2 but they were largely like that in the first one as well&&I agree 100%. By the end of the second movie I was rolling my eyes since nearly everyone was an assassin having gun battles in the middle of a busy city. Wouldn't there be a police force going haywire because two guys are firing automatic weapons all over town? I never saw a single cop. 

I admit I enjoyed the movie to a point, but you have to believe this is taking place in an alternate universe where police don't exist and murder is not illegal.&&That makes more sense.

That it could theoretically be used for either and both work is kind of genius in its own right, too.&&It's the motto of [all sorts of institutions,](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Si_vis_pacem,_para_bellum&oldid=849041423#Mottos) including the Royal Navy.&&thats a lot cooler than just a type of gun&&I wrote a too long post eswhere but TLDR those are actually related because marketing 100 years ago. It's a good title. &&>another 7 movies

Yeah that’s part of the issue I have with SW...&&My main concern would be showing too much. At the end of the day they're all assassins. If they lean too far into that it could get real boring real fast.&&The first one’s subtlety with its world building really intrigued me. It was so nice to see a good example of “show, don’t tell” in an action film again rather than being force fed exposition. I naturally had questions when the credits it: Who makes the coins? When was this underworld forged? Are there others that rival Wick?

Then chapter 2 delivered without ruining the tone or rules set in the first. &&Loved both movies. My only complaint would be that they may have gone a bit overboard in the 2nd movie with the assassin-to-regular-jackoff ratio. Apparently one person out of five is an assassin, and Morpheus is king of the homeless assassins.&&The best way that I can think to describe the first movie is like the first time you go in to the ocean.  Sure, the water is awesome and there are so many cool things at the surface.  Then, you see the darker parts beyond and it is fucking scary as all hell.

That is the Wick universe to me.  On the surface I get my run and gun awesomeness, but there is this terrifying depth.  They need to maintain that while not exposing it completely and this will be an amazing series of movies.&&The only cinematic universe I actually support having more films. &&Lance Reddick's Pup Palace.

And how could we forget the fifth installment ""John V-ick""&&I never realized it but you're right. 

They loved to fuck around with that game. I wish they would make a 5th but I guess they need a new title.&&“Si ves pacem para bellum” 

If you want peace prepare for war&&As well as a play on the caliber 9x19 Parabellum, or 9mm.&&You say that like it's a bad thing but I would watch the shit out of that.&&Him hammering the floor in the first and going to the wine/gun guy in the second were fantastic worldbuilding scenes&&[Like this?](https://youtu.be/zhe58xORWG0)&&with 2 1/2 hours of him sledgehammering the ground.&&I’d watch that. &&Two colons? Could you imagine the cleaning bill?&&You: can't: tell: me: what: to: do;&&Please don't confuse a hyphen with a dash&&It absolutely hints at that, but Parabellum is just ""Prepare for war"".

So the title is: 

>**John Wick 3: Prepare for War**

Most of the movies at least attempt a level of realism with reload, etc.

Nope!!! Perfectly silent gunshots in the middle of a station.&&Well now it's three people killed technically.&&Heath Ledger showed how to make a pencil disappear&&Agreed. I thought that the first one was a nice concise/succinct examination into a very interesting world that I felt wrapped up very well, I felt that John's story had been concluded in a nice emotional way. He had originally left the business because of personal reasons, came back into it temporarily for personal issues, settled those matters, and then completely left it. My main fear of the second film when I saw the first trailer was that it was going to twice of what we saw in the first film in terms of action without that emotional depth that the first film had. And unfortunately those fears turned out to be true. Don't get me wrong I still greatly enjoyed Part 2, but it lacked that certain je n'ais se quoi on an emotional level that the first film had and it felt like it was almost going through the motions.

 That being said, the second film for all of it's problems (I would still give it a solid 8.16/10), it finished on a note that did leave me emotionally invested to actually be interested in how John Wick's story will end. I do want to see how all of what has happened, how it ends.&&Tokyo Wick John Drift

Edit: and the dog would make a really good cornerstone &&Where did you read that comment though?&&>never saw a single cop

What about Jimmy?&&A cop shows up to his house to check for a disturbance in the first one, sees that he’s been murdering the fuck out of people, and goes on his way. You definitely have to suspend disbelief. A lot. &&Given John seems to prefer pistols, it works as both. The 9mm Parabellum was named after that phrase to begin with.&&Both are correct. Parabellum is a brand DWM had centered on the Luger pistol and 9mm cartridge around the turn of the century but it is derived from the Latin phrase. They were trying to market the Luger as the best pistol and one fit for war. Kind of like Mercedes says the best or nothing. To be fair they were right. In 1900 the Luger was the best, wouldn't be until 1911 when our Lord and Savior John Moses Browning took them to school. And the Luger and 9mm were definitely fit for war as evidenced by the fact that both were used heavily in combat and the 9mm is still the official NATO pistol cartridge.


My take is the title alludes to both. Wick is at war with the underworld that betrayed him but he is also going to use a lot of 9mm pistols. He is also clearly a man who takes the motto seriously given the events of the last two films. That kid started a war but Wick was prepared for it and destroyed everything associated with him. My only complaint was the second one was called chapter 2 and this isn't chapter 3. They should have titled it John Wick Chapter 3: Parabellum. May be hard to fit on a poster though. &&Well, that makes it a pretty unfair comparison. &&I wouldn't mind an anthology format, showing a little bit of the world at a time through different assassins and other members. Could change it up enough to not get stale.&&That is a very legitimate point&&fr, why must we&&So far a few things are interesting they could expand on.

* It seems that the Assassin ""economy"" seems to date back decades, or they are very very traditional since for being in the present time, they still rely on actual ledgers, typewriters, and use their coin currency for payment and services in that industry.

* Cassian and Ares (Mute girl) seem to have had a more ""permanent"" assignment as bodyguards/assassins, like knights to kings or queens, where the relationship was more personal than strictly professional. However, it wasn't quite clear if Cassian was going after John for killing his boss because it means he failed in his job, and his honor required it, or if it was purely because he felt genuine anger at the killing.
* John on other hand basically told Santino to shove his marker up his ass when he showed up in Chapter 2. In the first film, while Viggo mentions that John was instrumental in building the organization, and probably worked for them alot, John almost immediately thinks that the assault against him was ordered by Viggo. It doesn't even cross John's mind that Viggo ordering his son and friends to assault him was a pyschotic, suicidal move. What would Viggo have to gain by attacking John?
* The Assassin economy seems to thrive, and in turn, so does crime. Even John's cop friend Jimmy, are aware of John's past, and seem to just stay out of it since it seems very well run and regulated. It seems almost outside the law, and it kind of hints that their are rules in the Assassin trade about who they can or can't target. 
* The Assassins seem more like knights who can only attack ""pieces on the board"" like bodyguards and other assassins, and are mainly sent to kill the ""kings or queens"" of crime families.
* The rules seem very established, well known, and strictly enforced by everyone involved, and as we saw with Perkins in the first film, subject to fast enforcement.

Just some thoughts. It seems like more you peel back layers the more developed the world is. &&It did kind of mess a bit of the tone set by the first one by going a bit overboard with the amount of assassins in my opinion. By no means does it make it a bad movie, but I have to say I liked the John Wick universe more at the end of the first movie than I did at the end of the second one.&&They super way over did it in the last thirty minutes of the second one. It became so far beyond believable and dove straight into absurdity with the sheer amount of Assassin's. &&Lance Reddick's Perfect Pupper Palace: A John Wick Story&&John Wick 2 on Wikipedia: ""4 days after the events of the first film...""

So 4 days between movies and the movies don't skip time much.

&&The hammering scene was partly made by the narration over it - the combination of watching this made dig up a part of himself he buried with the explanation of who this guy really is.&&Yes. &&It would be asstronomical&&This explanation i like the most. Yaya you want peace and all that. But i am not going for an adam sandler. This is John fuckin Wick.

Sorry. I'll see myself out &&damn now even that game nobody plays underwatch or something is copying Fortnite &&I was just answering your question about a round of ammuntion having the name 'parabellum'. For what it's worth (if you didn't read the link) that name itself (smashed together unlike the real latin) was done by the manufacturer, and the manufacturers own motto was the latin phrase anyway, so the name for the 9mm round certainly is based on the latin phrase (by way of the company name.) I didn't make any judgements about the movie title.&&I'm pretty sure Wick had an arrangement with that cop&&They obviously know each other, and cop obviously knows who John really is and that he's retired. &&Other members would be the way to go I think. I'd love to see the same care and style they put into John Wick used to tell the stories of the people in that world that don't primarily kill for a living.&&Do it episodic, different main character focus. There are familiar call backs like the continental and the employees/patrons but each episode be it's own little self contained story about a different person in this world. Doesn't even always have to be about an assassin. You could have a cool episode just about the cleaner guys or the concierge too. &&I like it! Still only seeing small, but detailed parts of the world in each episode. Could keep things still somewhat mysterious. &&You could do something like the ""sins"" they all make. 

Murder connecting them all. 

Each ""sin"" is the focus of another  assassin. &&I'd be cool with an arc focusing on that mysterious concierge guy. &&What I was curious about- Why did Perkins go to the meeting for her execution. She would have had to know.

I think the general point is- once your number is called, you can't even run.

But with John, it's undoubtedly an entirely different game since he just won't die lol.&&I assumed the whole city seemed full of assassins because they all came to town for the massive bounty on Wick's head&&Guys I'm sorry but I'm just going to tell him: we are all assassins except for a handful of you. Sorry to break it to you like this.&& not everyone there may be an assassin, but could still be involved with the continental&&I thought it was a projection of paranoia from Wick that the directors want us to feel.

But that being said, it did set up this good emotional foundation for Commons character to reappear in part 3 as someone who bails out Wick because he spared him in the second film. &&Yeah, he very clearly asks, ""So... You workin' again, John?"" The cop knows what he does and he's probably afraid to, or agreed not to fuck with him.

A mechanic who wont talk about blood in the car, can do magic in short amount of time, and is liked by everyone would get all the private clientele from the John Wick world.

GIF was made*?&&You know the iconic [house falling scene](https://youtu.be/FN2SKWSOdGM) with Buster Keaton? Yeah, that was all done for real. A lot of the crew members walked off set because they for sure thought he was going to die.

Hollywood didn't give a shit back in the day.

Check out [Way Down East](https://youtu.be/ZnzxputIr-U?t=3m).

All the pre-cgi special effects were invented during this time &&Saw this movie in a festival in my country. A five piece jazz orchestra playing the score live. Clutched my seat more than in Spiderman. &&Damn after watching it again it's super obvious but I never would have got that shit without knowing it first, you know. Wack.&&I know it’s not particularly called for but...this is NOT Buster Keaton. 

It is Harold Lloyd.&&it's so dense... every single frame has so many things going on&&Seen this before loads of times. It's pretty clever, but the scene always irks me because the perspective is off. Its like they are trying to make it look like he's having over that street, but If you follow the building down it would be pretty much across the street facing away from the road in the background.&&This was back in the day when they didn't constantly use green screen because it didn't work&&It was all funny and safe until he fell, hit the mattress and bounced backwards over the ledge. &&Aw wonderful! My town has been trying to figure out how they made that scene the past 95 years!&&Waaait a minute, is this accurate?  I would have assumed the background was rear projection.

I love it enough to have [done a painting of it](http://imgur.com/k0ww6XR) (which I now do not know the whereabouts of...whoops)&&Fantastic film! One of the funniest and scariest movies of all time (if you're scared of heights)!  I got the Criterion Collection Safety Last on dvd and they have a special feature on how this stunt was done, and as you can see by the video provided it was very simply made but it looks fantastic! &&From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd):
>Lloyd kept copyright control of most of his films and re-released them infrequently after his retirement. Lloyd did not grant cinematic release because most theaters could not accommodate an organist, and Lloyd did not wish his work to be accompanied by a pianist: ""I just don't like pictures played with pianos. We never intended them to be played with pianos."" Similarly, his features were never shown on television as Lloyd's price was high: ""I want $300,000 per picture for two showings. That's a high price, but if I don't get it, I'm not going to show it. They've come close to it, but they haven't come all the way up"". As a consequence, his reputation and public recognition suffered in comparison with Chaplin and Keaton, whose work has generally been more available. Lloyd's film character was so intimately associated with the 1920s era that attempts at revivals in 1940s and 1950s were poorly received, when audiences viewed the 1920s (and silent film in particular) as old-fashioned.&&Back when if you wanted a skyline in the background, you actually had to be on top of a tall building.&&Just saw this at the Orpheum in Los Angeles! It was amazing!&&That guy looks like Edward Nygma from the Gotham TV show. Aka The Riddler real name Cory Michael Smith.&&Wow. This is great. But how did they create this post? Did they use some kind of CG?&&We need to have more posts like these.&&I loved that movie. They used to run these on our local PBS station when I was a kid and they were amazing.&&Harold Lloyd actually wore a prosthetic hand because he’d lost part of his real one doing a stunt (he thought a real bomb was a fake one and lit it. He lost half his palm and his thumb and index finger on his right hand). 

He filmed all of these dangerous stunt scenes with only one functional hand. What a fucking badass. &&Wow so they had the phrase safety first in 1923? Wonder how long it has been around&&That’s so Back to the Future!!&&Wait... but how was the demonstration filmed?!&&Hopefully mattress doesn’t bounce. Otherwise can be pretty dangerous to fall on it at that angle&&Harold Lloyd. Who is in no way related to Christopher Lloyd, who did a very similar thing in the 1985 film Back to the Future. &&I would have fell.

D) An Immortal who can only be killed by beheading. E) The baddest MOFO to ever walk the earth.&&Back then they hadn't invented the necessary colors yet to do this on a green screen. &&Damn&&I guess it was safety first after all.&&That is good &&So how'd they film that?&&So the clock could've just kept swinging of the ledge and that would've been the true first episode of American Gladiators.  &&Thanks for destroying it form me hole of an a&&Why did he wear a hat?&&That’s why they call it Hollywood magic.

I'm sure we were all wondering about this...&&That very brilliant i always wondered how did they fimed it. Its very genius&&I've seen many videos of old school filming techniques, and it is quite impressive what they could do with perspective and masking. Masking, if you aren't familiar, was a technique of putting a plate in front of the film to prevent partial exposure of the film, and then they would reverse the mask and re-expose the film to fill in the mask. 

Many people now a days lament the use (and often over use) of CGI. I have nothing against CGI, as often it can achieve effects that simply were not possible, believable, or cost effective with practical effects. I do however have issue with too many directors using CGI to prop up a weak story, and miss the days when you needed to tell a decent story, and not expecting effects to carry the day. 

Anyways, it's always fun to look at some of these old time film effects, just to see what/how they had to do things before CGI.       &&I see they put safety first...&&Are those arms holding the clock?? &&Watched this in a film history class and said that this was probably the first “thriller” movie. Probs one of the most stressed out I’ve ever been, and I watch a lot of horror movies!&&That's still kinda dangerous. What if he rolled when he fell and rolled off the building? lol.&& That's actually really cool. What makes it so cool is that the background is real. They took the shot while a regular day was happening.

&&With a robotic camera!!&&The good ol days.

Where they had to design clever film shoots to make something happen, and when they did it was ""wow!"" But now it's almost all cgi and green screens.

A tumble to far to his right, and he'd have easily went over&&And I believe he only had one full hand while filming this (the other one is a prosthetic) 

How did he damage his hand so badly? He was holding a movie prop ""bomb"" (acme type as seen in road runner) that was actually live and went off while he was holding it. Makes all the stunts he does even more impressive.&&As a self-proclaimed acrophobiac, I went from NOOOPE to Noooope&&'oh good ill land on this mattress' \*bounces onto mattress then off side of building\*&&I bet there was some fuckin guy in the audience like ""I can tell that's the roof of the whatever building this is bullshit!""&&My immediate thought actually was how incredibly dangerous that stunt would be considered nowadays.&&I’d imagine he knows to land “flat” on his back on the matress, and it’d minimise him rolling off the roof. Plus it looks like he’s positioned above the matress in the middle. Can’t imagine how this could have went wrong&&Meanwhile Jackie Chan sees the shot, says hold my beer, and does it for real. And then falls 3 stories, through cloth, and injures his spine. And uses the shot in the movie.

[Project A: Clock tower scene](https://youtu.be/WlY6TcRuPBU?t=2m4s)&&My Dad was the one who restored this film from it's original tape. He use to work in Hollywood and just yesterday was telling me the story about this one in particular.  
&&Oh they totally were fearless and nuts.

A guy named Dick Grace crashed multiple airplanes on purpose; broke his neck once but that didn’t stop him.

He would modify the planes to crumple or break certain ways on contact; but he was nuts.

&&[deleted]&&Growing up watching Jackie Chain, this was true!&&This is Harold Lloyd, not Buster Keaton.  He was probably the biggest star in Hollywood back in the day but his family didn't publicize his films after he died so he was kind of forgotten about. I think they've been releasing them so you'll probably hear a lot more about him in coming years.  I watched one of his movies with my grandpa who was born in 1911 and had seen it in the theaters with his dad when he was a kid (Grandpa was a huge film buff).  It was called ""The Freshman"" and was a comedy about a college kid- it actually held up really well and was super cute and funny.  You could totally tell it was a precursor to today's teen comedies.&&My exact first thought.&&Maybe there is another mattress there.&&https://youtu.be/P0jw_AFEGoI&&Funny you should say that. ~~After~~ Before they filmed it they did drop a dummy on the mattress and it did bounce over the ledge. &&how springy are your materesses? &&As I understood it, the mattress was about a 20 feet fall. So not sure how much he’d bounce. Maybe more?&&Man the behind the scenes crew had better filming equipment than the actual production itself. Way ahead of their time!&&Since it's just a single frame what's being used as a base for the 3D animation... I'd say that cutting it into layers, then applying them as textures on a 3D model, filling in any parts not present in the original footage, and animating, should be able to do the trick.&&The Camera movement is from a bunch of gymnasts standing and moving around on top of eachother on top of the roof, it must have taken unholy amounts of tries to get the movement that smooth.

The projection lines was hand painted frame by frame.&&Eyeon fusion.&&If there is at least a photo of the scene used as the last frame in the zoom-out, you can use that one and the last frame in the actual clip (or more frames, to recover things hidden in the last frame) to reconstruct a 3D model with stereoscopic imaging (this is basically what our brain does on the fly all the time to give us a sense of 3D from the two images from each eye).

Once you have a 3D model you just project images from that onto different viewpoints than the two real ones. As long as viewpoints are between the two real viewpoints there shouldn't really be anything that was hidden in both images.

Try google something like ""3d reconstruction using stereo vision"" for more info.&&Drones&&Hi-tech GIF camera.&&Has to be computer generated. Not a Camera backing away to empty air. That’s my guess. &&Not sure how the GIF was made but there are still photos from the time showing how the stunt worked.&&For all those upvoting, Buster Keaton was THE man. Check out this scene from [Three Ages](https://youtu.be/t_9n2_kl3po). He did all of his own stunts and pretty much all of them should've killed him. His comedic timing along with his own stunts are impeccable. This specific scene with the canopies along with Steamboat Bill, Jr. are reasons alone, in my mind, to consider Keaton the most badass legend of our time.&&Legend has it that he’d just been told he was losing his studio and just didn’t care when he told them to roll the stunt.&&""I hope my trigonometry works out""

-some old movie I can't remember&&Controversial opinion, but he was the best Batman.&&Welp, I finally got *that* Arrested Development reference&&This is fascinating.

In the last Star Wars movie, they realized it was cheaper just to build scale models and real sets. There was less cgi in the last episode than most realize. &&This is why I don't like CGI movies. Not that it doesn't take a lot of time and CPU power to make them but the genius of how these things are done seems to come through much more with practical effects.&&It's amazing what we can come up with to get around the technological limits we run into.&&*cough cough* Christopher Nolan&&To be fair there were a lot less frames back then&&Thanks George Lucas. &&Here's an article about it.

Felt like it was happening on some corner building, on an adjacent street. &&Yes it looks like the clock is hanging off the side of the building&&Yup, you gotta have green to have a green screen.

I'm so glad we live in a time where color exists now.&&they had back projection, which i assumed this was &&They finally got color in the 30s, but it was pretty grainy color for a while.&&Back then, it was much cheaper to do many stunts for real. Or close to it. The man is Harold Lloyd, btw. One of the greatest stunt actors of the silent film era, next to his contemporaries like Buster Keaton or Charles Chaplin.

One interesting fact about him is that he was missing a few fingers on one hand, so he wore prosthetic replacements. They would reverse the film in some shots, depending which side of him they needed in order to hide this.

If you ever get your hands on a book detailing the history of this era or these actors, I highly recommend. Fascinating the ingenuity the early filmmakers had to achieve some great moments in celluloid.&&Came here to say this. It looks like rear projection to me.&&How is that so odd?&&3D models clearly.&&They would’ve projection mapped everything from the original scene which basically means taking the 2d images and projecting them onto 3D models that are roughly geometrically correct, so the clock, the actor, and the street background. Then everything outside of the frame would’ve been 3D modelled and composited to fit the original elements&&We millennials are a wily bunch &&Or maybe F) the baddest mofo alien superhero cat who is immortal & can only be killed by beheading?&&r/notkenm&&[deleted]&&Practical effects- especially when there was ONLY practical effects- add realism.

Take 2001, A Space Odyssey. There’s a real tiger jumping on a ‘caveman/ape’. The tiger was trained, but still. That’s a real tiger.

The (new) Planet of the Apes? No one is in real danger because it’s all CGI. I still love PotA, but 2001 is a masterpiece because the lack of computer-generated stunts helps us to suspend our disbelief.&&What did this ruin?&&Wait a minute. Harold Zoid was based off of a real person?? &&Must download these to watch with my kid. They are amazing movies. I always loved them myself as a kid. &&Does Harold Lloyd’s name have any tie back to the naming of the dumb and dumber characters “Harry” and “Lloyd”?  &&I lived in Iran for a few years as a kid in the early 80’s.  There were only two channels and the Clerics had banned almost all foreign films and anything that didn’t have women in hijab so there was a lot of talking heads and drab programming.   But around the holidays they would play Harold Lloyd... it was such a treat.   &&I went to his former house in 2009: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Lloyd_Estate

**tl;dr Met a Billionaire on Hollywood Homes Tour; Let us tour his house in Beverly Hills; Paid for our dinner at Koi; Let us have dinner at another of his mansions**

Posted this as a comment previously:
Random, but true story. My brother, sister and I were in CA visiting family. While in LA, we did one of the StarLine Hollywood Home Tours. While on the tour, my sister was talking casually with this guy and his girlfriend. He had mentioned his home might be on the tour. She had just assumed on the way to Beverly Hills, we may pass his house.

Anyway's, when we were in Beverly Hills, he leaned up to the operator and mentioned one of the mansions was his if we wanted to drive in. He triggered the gate and we drove in. Huge, well-known estate. We drive to the end of the drive-way and the tour operator asks if she could get out and take a picture since it hasn't happened before. He offers to take us on a tour of the house, which he does. Security comes running but he just explains that he's having fun on the tour. The house/grounds were unbelievable. 

After leaving my sister was still talking casually with him. She mentioned that when he was in front of David Spade's house he was texting him to let him know he was outside. Apparently the guy had lived there for years, but didn't know a lot about the surrounding houses in BH, and wanted to show his girlfriend around the area.

While still on the tour, my sister asked if he had any recommendations for where to go to dinner to get the ""Hollywood experience."" He offered to get us a reservation at Koi (this was early 2009). 

After we got off the tour, we thanked him and said our goodbyes. We were asking the tour operator how much is an average bill at Koi when he came back up to us and gave us his cell in case we had any problems. The tour operator mentioned that we were wondering how much it cost, to which he replied not to worry as we were on his tab.

Anyways, after dinner we texted him thank you. He knew we might be in another city later that week where he also had a mansion, and replied that if we wanted to go to his house there (although he was flying out of town that night so would be elsewhere), to let him know and his staff would prepare us a dinner. He had previously mentioned that it was his favorite house, that he more often uses for entertainment purposes.

We of course took him up on this. We drove up and after checking in with security were buzzed in the gate.  The place was amazing. We were greeted by the house manager and he welcomed us. He mentioned that we'd be eating a seafood dinner since we'd be eating overlooking the sea. While we were waiting for the lunch to be prepared, there were bathing suits at the pool in case we wanted to go for a swim.

They took us on a tour of the house. It was insane. So many things were imported from monasteries, etc. Hand-painted ceiling in one area that apparently the painter prepared 6 months for. Had the ""normal"" billionaire things, private theatre gets pre-releases, etc.

When they served dinner, they had 1 to 2 guys waiting on us. It was amazing. One of the items were crab legs - they were pre-cracked so you wouldn't have to work at them. If that was too much effort, there was a bowl of crab meat already pulled right beside the legs. You get the picture. Insane. :)

We didn't have time to go in swimming as I was about to fly to New Zealand/Australia for a 3 week trip. NZ/Australia was amazing, but this was hard to beat.

Really appreciative of his generosity. 


&&Ikr deep respect to himm&&Holy fuck I just got that Futurama reference&&I’m guessing he wasn’t meant to flip and land on his neck. &&that stunt is fucking dangerous.

theres no fucking way theyd allow that now.&&It's ok, he broke the fall with his neck.&&Lol i those are two different takes played back to back! &&I love Project A. It was the first Jackie Chan film I ever say and it blew me away.

That's the real shit. &&Why are there two different falls??

What if all silent movies are trying to tell us the secrets of time travel and the future and we'll never know because they couldn't speak?&&[deleted]&&How did you write this comment?&&People still comping with that?&&There were definitely photos of the stunt taken at the time.  I've seen them somewhere, maybe in a documentary about Harold Lloyd.&&Buster Keaton was a crazy motherfucker.&&I hate so much how ignorant I was as a child of classic cinema. I can't say I never enjoyed black and white shows. I LOVED watching I Love Lucy, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Dick Van Dyke, etc.

However, I didn't learn to appreciate the brilliance of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or later greats like Bogart until my early 20's. 

While on a medical leave from work following a bad back injury, I was supposed to move as little as possible. 

I decided at that point to watch as many films as I could through free movies on my cable plan or that I could find to rent of old films. 

I suppose I shouldn't suggest I'd NEVER appreciated that era of film but I didn't go out of my way to watch them until my 20's. Once I started, I couldn't get enough. 

There's such a beautiful simplicity in much of them. The films were truly about the stories. The comedy is mostly jokes that, while you might not laugh until you're blue, you're still going to smile and belly laugh in a very heartwarming way. &&When you say ""our time"" what time exactly are you referring to? As I understand it, we're 100 years past the start of his career.&&IIRC he was supposed to make that jump. When he didn't, they reworked the scene to keep the fall&&Wouldn't doubt it. Dude grew up in vaudeville and rolled with what he knew and loved. He was 100% committed to the performance even if it'd cost him his life just to entertain those around him.&&Pretty much just close your eyes and hope for the best at that point. 

You don't even see a T-mark there in that wide shot, so it's all just hoping that everything was measured correctly...&&Fun fact: Michael Keaton has no relation to Buster Keaton. It's a stage name. He was born Michael Douglas -- but since there was already an actor of that name, he needed to use another.&&[🦇](https://img00.deviantart.net/80de/i/2012/032/b/b/the_best_batman__buster_keaton_by_mapacheanepicstory-d4odvoi.jpg)&&Bateman&&I can’t find the clip, but Johnny Knoxville’s first attempt went poorly and he actually got hit by the house. Can’t remember if he panicked or was just off his mark initially. &&Yes...that's what that means.&&It's good from certain angles&&I am pretty sure they called them ""pre-cgi"" back in the 1920s!!&&Ain't got nothin on us animators though! You want a clock? How high you want it? 500? 600 miles high? No problem! Cheap. 

*cries into thousands of drawings*.

Edit: Every upvote = 1 drawing, and I bet it won't even hit close to *Snow White* (1937)&&It's interesting because the amount of practical effects and miniatures reminds me of quite a few 80s (and around that time in general) movies. The good ones utilized just the right amount of balance and while it may have been obvious or otherwise easy to see, it didn't detract from the film and often enhanced it. It comes up a lot but the LOTR movies are to me a modern example of many different effects disciplines working together to really transport the viewer into another world.&&PGI?&&Star Wars didn't move away from scale models until the Disney movies. Each of the prequels used more miniatures than the entire original trilogy. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvpMVirLsY0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvpMVirLsY0)

I've often seen practical effects criticized for being CGI and CGI praised for being practical effects. People don't know what they're looking at.&&Same with the prequel trilogy - there was less cgi that most realise. More models were built for the 1st episode than the original trilogy combined. Nothing wrong with having cgi, its just you always notice the bad ones.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhpFsO8wUoI&&Lol there are no scale models in The Last Jedi. There are *some* life size models and bits of sets. The majority of scenes are still composited with CGI backgrounds or completely CGI like the space battles. &&CGI still has its uses and relevancy. Many practical effects today are enhanced using it, all the while keeping that genius encouraged and intact. &&To be fair, developing the algorithms and technology for CGI required a whole lot of genius, and there is still a lot of artistry involved in the use of it.&&Using CGI effects takes all the same artistry and creativity that practical effects do. The technical aspects are different, but creatively, they both require the same genius to use correctly in a film.&&Yeah but they couldn’t come even remotely close to the things we’re capable of now with CGI. &&Dunno why you're in the negative, you were polite about your opinion, which I agree with.&&[deleted]&&*cough cough* high fidelity earplugs&&Save the frames&&We've still not exceeded 23.976fps when it comes to film (except maybe *The Hobbit*, but only at the pictures - home release is still 24). Here's hoping more frames appear in the future.&&Yeah, I guess that works.&&Man why you go around explaining my joke and people prefer that&&> ""Yep.  The world didn't turn color until sometime in the 1930s, and it was pretty grainy color for a while, too.""

https://i.imgur.com/k4L3LOw.jpg&&Thank you for making me wheeze laugh.&&Better joke would have been back before everything was done on grey screen&&I'm still quite certain this is back projection and not what the gif is showing&&Would love a book recommendation, if you have one!&&>If you ever get your hands on a book detailing the history of this era or these actors, I highly recommend. 

Sir, please fill in the missing recommendation&&Same. I’d need some reference photography showing it was shot on location to believe otherwise. 

Rear projection was cheap, building that set on top of a building would have been far more expensive with labor costs. &&The perspective of the street after seeing the zoomed out view no longer aligns and our brains now decipher everything is not as it seems.&&Thing of the front of the building not being aligned with the buildings in the back... At first.. At least my brain just connects it like the building being on the same street below.. But after the gif the building looks misplaced. &&The side of the building that the clock is on is actually the 'back' of the building in relation to the street and other buildings&&YES! Forgot All of the above!&&Lets compare this monumentally acclaimed classic to a summer blockbuster movie. 

2001 isn’t great because there’s no cgi it’s great because it’s just a great film. &&Yeah, the old Planet of the Apes without CGI really made you suspend your disbelief...

At least choose a better comparison.&&Erryting&&Fun fact: Harold Lloyd is also a lobster.&&Thats what makes him so funny&&i was gonna say the same thing... mind blown&&It's futurama..

Just a regular day though...&&Yea, the director was like, sorry Jackie, could you do that again and this time NOT land on your neck?&&And that was the best take... On one of the out-takes he lands on one of the metal bars of the canopies and, if I remember right, ends up with a giant bruise across his back.&&Luckily his neck broke his fall&&Hollywood stopped doing stunts in about 2003.  Now they just do shitty green screens, wherever possible. &&Yeah that and it was a Chinese film, so they had a lot more freedom over there to do their stunts and time to get a movie done in the quality they wanted.

Same era, though&&Operation Condor left a hole in his head they had to cover with a plate. If you put your thumb in said hole and he hums, it vibrates.

Source: Years ago I ran out of stuff to talk to him about and awkwardly asked if I could put my thumb in his head crater. He obliged but didn't hum, instead kept saying ""Feel dat? Feel dat?""&&Maybe there is another mattress on the floor...&&That's Buster Keaton. &&Buster keaton&&That was Buster Keaton and I can't find a source for this but I remember hearing that the carpenter in charge of building the facade refused to participate when he found out what they were going to do and walked off set refusing any responsibility for what would happen. &&Haha autocorrect in this case, but this is legit what I thought he was called when I first saw one of his movies.&&Everything bounces down here. &&You're very clever, young man, to reference that anecdote. &&http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/5762/Safety-Last-/trivia.html

https://youtu.be/TiIrpEMbQ2M&&Great Scott!  &&That's some neat piece of software.

Tons of older movies in the public domain. &&Your early 20s is not that late of a time to get into classic cinema.

Did you expect to appreciate them as a 15 years old?&&Pretty sure there was something for him to stand on. I seem to remember reading somewhere that there were two nails that fitted into his shoes, keeping him very still.&&Oh and just to clarify, Buster Douglas that Knocked Out Mike Tyson also has no relation to either of them. He just thought they were awesome dudes&&Also, there was a silent era actor with his star on Hollywood Boulevard named Harrison Ford, but Harrison Ford was like, fuck that guy, I'M Harrison Ford. &&Yeah, he flinched and got slammed for it.&&‘We’re doing this whole movie in pre-cgi!’
‘Tom, what does CGI stand for?’
‘Computer-generated imagery.’
‘What’s a computer?’
‘No fucking clue, mate.’&&Nolan tries to make a point of it on a lot of his films as well. Same with movies like Hugo or even Gravity really despite the insane amount of CG in the movie. &&Physically generated imagery? That sounds right. &&> Each of the prequels used more miniatures than the entire original trilogy.

Which ultimately means nothing when 90% of the finished product looks like pre-rendered cutscenes from a PS2 game.&&Eh, I mean even there you can tell what is CGI and what is practical. They built a physical canyon for the podracing, then superimposed a CGI podracer on it so it still has this weird green screen effect where the blacks don't match up and the eye can tell, like 80s movies did.&&Well of course the space battles were CGI, if they did it with practical effects there would be only micro-gravity so the combat they were doing would make no sense, it had to be done with CGI to let those hyper-close-range bomber ships appear to work despite the environment they were in. &&Absolutely. It's just a different type of genius. Probably something that inspires me more which affects by opinion.&&Yeah. I don't understand why people don't just offer their opinion rather than downvote mine. &&MCU?&&i think the use of ""constantly"" messes it up.&&lol. Yeah I don't even know. Subtlety doesn't work as well as smacking people over the head with humor, I guess.&&Didn't even read it as a joke

*""Yep greenscreen didn't work because it was black and white""*&&It’s been about 10 years since I read up on it. Harold Lloyd just always stands out to me. Also, Futurama had a similar character to him in an episode.

As for books, I had to google to refresh my mind.

Silent Visions by John Bergston was the one I read that focused mostly on Harold Lloyd.

There is also a documentary on PBS or IFC about Hal Roach Studios and the movies their history. Which details Harold Lloyd, The Little Rascals, The Keystone Cops, and other contract actors they had.

AFI had a documentary on the silent era that had some great segments on Harold Lloyd. I think it’s  called “Golden Era’ or something similar. It was on Netflix a few years back. There is a companion book that goes along with it.

I guess I’ve watched more than I’ve read.&&I dunno, looks fine to me.&&That's a good way of explaining it. &&Um explaing bleese&&Fun fact: Christopher Lloyd also fucked around with clocks. &&Also, he's seriously good at emoting.&&*Jaunty piano tune plays*

He just does crazier and crazier stunts.&&Stunts are still totally a thing in Hollywood and plenty of films still use stunt people, some actors even being their own. Green screen is just popular nowadays because it cuts down on budgets in other areas and is less effort on the director/main crew. &&Considering at least one stunt actor dies almost every year in Hollywood, I think that's a pretty shitty statement to make.&&What's shitty about green-screens?&&And short jumps.&&Is this clip from the theatrical release, though? If so, it is strange having the two falls one after the other.&&It's the best era because jackie worked with Chinese studios and they let him do what ever he wanted.

10/10 would read again &&Keaton was a legitimate badass, his list of injuries sustained is pretty crazy but way shorter than you would expect given the level of danger involved in his stunts. He also fractured his neck during a stunt for Sherlock Jr. and didn’t even realize it until several years later.

He grew up in the Vaudeville circuit, performing alongside his parents as “the boy who couldn’t be damaged”. Harry Houdini actually gave him the nickname Buster after witnessing him fall down a flight of stairs at the age of 3 and remain completely unharmed. 

And then after all that he dies of lung cancer.

X-men movies are fully of them so when they jump it just looks like gravity isn't working as it should and ends up making the scene look so fake.

TL;DR: CG is the type of work that people only notice when it's done badly&&As a VFX artist that's nonsense.  You notice maybe 5% of the things that are changed and greenscreened, removed or added. It's pretty thankless as its one of those jobs you don't notice only if it's done well&&More likely you have no idea what is a green screen and whats not. You just think something looks off so you tell yourself it's a green screen with no actual way to prove yourself wrong. &&Yeah every second that passes we go into the future&&Now I'm wondering how the hell they recorded the year in the B.C. era&&It would be great! The smell of danger! That’s what makes it great!&&Why aren’t you sleeping anyway?!?!&&There's that word again! Is there something wrong with the gravitational pull in the lobster fucking world? &&No but i heard you can get cancer...&&The first rule US copyright law is that Mickey Mouse must never enter the public domain. Congress will pass whatever laws necessary to extend the copyright on Steamboat Willie indefinitely. &&~~Fun~~ Depressing fact, Europe extended their copyright terms [pretty much in line with the U.S.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries%27_copyright_lengths?wprov=sfla1)&&European countries can (and have) retroactively re-establish copyright protection on things that have lapsed, whereas in the United States it's in the public domain forever.&&Lemme put it this way. US awarded Disney with an indefinite copyright to the likeness of Mickey Mouse.

So, they can if they make the rules.&&And yet people still download it when is available or near dvd release and your statement is just as bad as his.....&&It probably depends on what country you're in. In places like America and Canada people have disposable income. In counties like Libya, Venezuela, and the post brexit united kingdom that isn't an option for most people. /S&&I remember reading somewhere that he couldn't force himself to let go so he made everyone that was there leave until he couldn't hold on any longer.  &&Am I having a stroke &&Yes sir.

I seriously don't see why we need Mickey Mouse to be public domain. It doesn't do anything to help the general public. What we should be concerned about is the works that have just disappeared and there's nothing we can do about it because those rights still exist somewhere. &&I read somewhere that the copyright on Steamboat Willie and a few other early Disney characters was most likely improperly filed and those characters are *already* in the public domain.

Of course, that won't stop Disney from suing your pants off.&&While it sounds silly at first glance, it's not as crazy as you think.

For anyone that's tasked with defining copyright fairly, trying to make one from first principles has always been too complicated to do without creating loopholes. 

Instead, they take several extreme examples of things that should and shouldn't be in public domain and then try to come up with a system that unites them. 

There's no benefit in Mickey Mouse to be public domain, it's actively and constantly used in Disney's work since its creation and is the centrepiece for a major economic powerhouse in the US. It does net harm to the public if Disney loses it. The problem with the current system is that it's defined by time, when it should also be defined by continuous use/distribution.&&It's unlikely that it will ever get extended again. The last time it was extended was just shortly before Napster and file sharing took off. There was basically no political opposition to it at the time. No one really cared about being against copyrights. It was something that really only mattered to copyright holders... who of course had enough money to lobby to extend it.

Given that there would be a large backlash from doing it now, not to mention the sharp political divides and general difficulty for Congress to currently pass major legislation, it's unlikely that it would be able to be extended again. Stuff will start to lapse into public domain on January 1, 2019. It's highly unlikely that they'd be able to draft and pass anything within the next few months before stuff starts to pass into public domain again.&&So did Canada, for music at least. I blame the Beatles' estate. Fellas, you made great music, but don't you think it's time for your works to fuel another generation of musicians?&&People do. Most do not. In contention is the use of “so many”. Evidence suggests that does not actually include a sizable portion of prospective audiences.&&*To be fair*, considering *some of* the stunts he does, it's only natural for *someone* to think that *maybe* this time he ~~surely~~ didn't *actually* do *a specific stunt,* ~~it~~ *rather the person on film is a stunt double or CGI.*~~, right?~~

Those are called “orphan works” and they are a frustrating no-man’s-land area of the law.  You search for the copyright owners, carefully document that search, keep those records forever, then hope that they don’t pop up after you use their work and demand a big payday.

Terry Gilliam has been sharing some amazing new posters for 'The Man Who Killed Don Quixote' on his Facebook page. Here is one.,34446,93ahg9,https://i.redd.it/7voeggvc17d11.jpg,812,1533003657.0,,"Dude, Adam driver is on so much stuff over the past couple of years. He's worked with so many good directors. Good for him for trying to seperate himself from a being just a one franchise actor. &&God I hope this movie is actually released...&&Anyone know of a US release for this movie? Or how I can even watch it? I heard Amazon pulled out of US distribution.&&The other posters on Gilliam's site are cool, too.

This poster draws some inspiration from these Dali artworks:

&&the Dali is strong with this one&&Yup, that's a Terry Gilliam movie.

Fuck Amazon for dropping distribution on this. I wanna see it already.&&[deleted]&&Watched it a few weeks ago (Dutch guy here). It really isnt a movie for everyone but holy cow what a ride. Rarely does a movie still hold my 100% attention all the way through, wondering and speculating what the F is going to happen next. The lead roles are FANTASTICLY played. &&I know who. Monkey D. Luffy &&Like even if you didn't know who was directing this, just by looking at the poster, you know it's Gilliam. &&I swear I find out there’s another member of the Skarsgard family with every feature film release&&Reminds me of a Photoshop battle&&Luffy > Donquixote Doflamingo&&Do I ever get to see this movie?&&Luffy?&&It's the guy from that Star War. &&Monkey 'D' Luffy&&Looking OP post history,..  
Dude, you REALLY love Terry Gilliam.    &&Reminds me of Dali.&&Am I the only one who thinks the poster looks like trash? It looks like an amateur photoshop job &&Dalí in a nutshell&&This looks like a Dali painting&&Call me skeptical but I feel like this has been upvoted and promoted by a bunch of paid for accounts. Yes it's a looked forward to movie but some of these posts are kind of sketchy. Nevermind look at this dude's profile. Like holy shit how are accounts like this even allowed r/movies mods&&Canne didn’t think much of it&&What's the status of this movie? I thought TG lost rights to it?&&He misspelled Stellar Skateboard&&I love the Salvador Dali influence in this!!!&&He has been trying to do this movie since at least 2001.

And everyone keeps talking up Twelve Monkeys. Great in concept, but the producers totally destroyed the movie, completely, by adding the text at the beginning.

Same thing happened to Dark City. Both were almost great movies.&&When can adam driver play Marilyn manson already?&&This some Salvador Dali shit&&Why does it link to www.simulated-themovie.com at the bottom?&&The man who killed Han Solo.&&Is anyone else still skeptical about Adam Driver? He's seemed very ""meh"" in everything I've seen him in. Like, I can't pick out anything terrible, but I can't pick out anything excellent either. &&I legitimately thought this was a Tim Burton movie.  Adam driver even looks like Jonny Depp. &&Wasn't Johnny Depp originally trying to make this movie with Terry Gilliam?&&Looks like a 14yr old with photoshop CS5 and a Salvador Dali picture book smoked his first joint and decided to give ""art"" a go&&r/onepiece&&Digging the Bosch vibe.&&It's going to flop&&the trailer was a mess and so is this poster. this movie is gonna suuuuuck.&&I am insanely excited for this movie. &&So wikipedia says it already came out in May in France, is this a new poster for the wide release?&&Pretty sure Luffy killed him&&so much half ass photoshopping..&&Spoilers btw:


Pretty sure he isn't dead, Luffy just knocked him out earlier but I'm sure he could have flown away from the battle with his DF powers after the battle with the Navy and Jack's army.&&Sigh......I don't think I'm going to like this movie. Gilliam is like an art-house Michael Bay. It's all style over substance, but because it's not commercialised he gets lauded for it.&&Reminds me of Time Bandits. &&At work can someone tell me what is this film about &&Gilliam is a genius.&&i really thought that was michael cera for a sec there.&&Didn't Terry already make a movie about how this movie was never going to be made? &&Now if he only learned how to tell a story...&&Scrolled past the poster real fast and it somehow reminded me of fear and loathing in Las Vegas&&Shroud? Is that you?&&I see Adam Driver everywhere!!!&&Check out Adam Driver’s Ted talk if ur a fan and/or wanna hear a cool life story&&Isn't Gilliam from Monty Python?&&What’s amazing about this poster? I’d call it mildly interesting at best. &&Steller Skateboard?? I'M IN&&Dalí&&I already saw that movie a while back, it has a late US release it seems

Awesome!&&I will finish what you started &&Olga Kurylenko is in a movie again? Wow.&&Is this the first Gilliam/Pryce teamup since Brazil?&&Looks like something out of r/surrealmemes&&A little too jarring for my taste&&Oh wow that's so refreshing!&&And of course there will be dwarves in the movie, Gilliam’s signature&&I thought this movie was a no go.&&Shit it's Ben Swole &&Personally I feel like the movie might be a little too out there for my preferences but I'm really impressed that they're making something so unique.&&Any word on release dates for Ireland and the UK?&&It took 5 years for him to get this poster right.

Well, I'm in.&&Gives me a Tarsem Singh *The Fall* kind of feel. &&This looks like shit.&&Man, this is going to be great.

Can’t wait to see it.&&This movie is gonna be such a mess and I can’t wait&&Is there a better quality version of this poster? &&ITS&&Adam drivers nose is a meme&&Fun on photoshop &&adam driver, so hot right now &&Looks like a cross between Salvador Dali & Monty Python. &&Holy shit, I hadn't heard he had started making this film again. Remember seeing the documentary about the making of it years ago and he had to pull the plug. Thought at the time I would love to see it one day, Terry Gilliam is such a unique director. &&What is this?&&Looks like burning man. &&I've seen it and it was incredible! It really feels like a culmination of all his other movies except Tideland and Brothers Grimm. I don't know if he could've made it earlier if the production chaos hadn't happened. &&Am I the only one who gets subtle Salvador Dali vibes?&&So Kylo Ren killed don quixote &&What do you mean he's still alive at Marineford?&&This actor has done so well for himself it is really fun to see! It’s always so fun to see actors and just people flourish in their lives&&I cannot underscore how furious I'll be if I never get to see this movie.&&Goddamn i hope this gets released, i love terry&&The title of this movie is poetic as fuck.&&For some reason this reminds me of Salvador Dali&&He's really done so well for himself, he's killing it since Girls

He was such a doofy looking guy that I never thought he would blow up like this, but I'm really glad he did&&I was on the fence about him when I first saw him in Star Wars and then saw “Lucky Logan.” I’m in. The same thing Channing Tatum, then I saw “A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints.” Love them both. &&[deleted]&&[I've liked him ever since he had sex and was about to eat NACHOS.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg7Mcfun7yM)&&I can’t wait for BlacKkKlansman&&Directors really seem to like working with him. Gilliam, Lee, Jarmusch, Soderbergh, etc. Maybe he takes direction well due to his military background? &&I do like him a lot and as you say, he’s worked with a lot of top talent, but he’s never blown me away in a role in and of himself. I think he’s a very capable actor and has excellent choice in roles/great representation. &&Adam Driver. So hot right now. &&I'd love to see him work with Richard Linklater.&&Hopefully he doesn't end up like Jennifer Lawrence and become overexposed to the point that the general audience develops Adam Driver fatigue.&&I met him in korea when he was doing a tour with his play group for service members overseas.
Really nice dude. They did a free play read on base and it was awesome!&&He’s hot as fuck&&I agree but don't give this obvious promoting account any upvotes like Jesus it goes so far back in promoting this I wonder how many other things on this site have gotten away with things like this. u/craigjclark68&&Yeah most of the Star Wars actors (aside from Harrison Ford) have mostly been stuck in that world and weren’t able to break into other areas with much success&&I can't stand him.  He just kind of looks weird and it pulls me out of movies.&&Him and his buddy General Hux have been in terrific non-franchise work of late. Driver more so than Gleeson, but they're both excellent in their respective indie filmographies.&&He's prove to be an amazing actor.&&Logan Lucky was amazing too. Had me in stitches.&&Did you just say 'cauliflower' to me? &&I'd seen him in like 2-3 things before SW:E7 so I was like 'oh hey, it's him'. Although I loathed his character in one movie... so I sort of prejudged him.&&Seeing it tomorrow (meeting with Terry!!!) and still I'm nervous about this exact thing.&&It didn’t get great reviews unfortunately while it was available&&What do you mean? It wasn't released in theaters? &&I’ve seen posters for it in The Netherlands. So at least there it’s going to be released soon. &&What, no giant foot?&&What do you mean, ""not released""? I saw it in theaters 3 or 4 months ago (I live in France).

Good movie, honestly, probably unable to live up to its legendary status, but very enjoyable if you like Terry Gilliam's style. &&As far as I last heard, Nobody has the rights to distribute it. Not even Gilliam .&&Try see if it's playing at a local film festival. That's how I saw it.&&The first thing that came to my mind when I saw it was Monty Python’s Flying Circus. So yeah I guess it makes sense that it’s Gilliam &&Some inspiration is an understatement imo. This is a direct tip of the cap to Dali. Imitation even.&&Does this mean that the movie will have Daliesque touches?  Long, sparse shots of deserts and clocks and ants?&&Dalí actually [had his take on Quixote as well](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/10/09/salvador-dali-illustrates-don-quixote/), although the artstyle of the posters seem to reference only his more known stuff.&&May the Dali with you padalette.&&He just trying to walk it like dali talk it &&De Chirico aswell&&and the clocks are all melting &&I'm also really pleased that all the lighting is from the same direction.&&We watched a doc on him trying to get the other one done but all the stuff that went wrong. Im so gonna watch it because Terry has been wanting to do this for so long! &&He lost a major court fight over the rights to the film. At that point Amazon didn't have much choice but to drop the deal. Even though it's Gilliam's creative work, he can't authorize distribution when someone else has the legal rights to it.&&You should really go and see it, but it is somewhat disappointing. The movie is a bit of a mess and doesn't feel as coherent or focussed as Gilliam's best work. It is evident it took so long to make. I imagine it was mostly satisfying for Terry himself, finally completing such an anticipated project. The film is self aware though and refers to its difficult inception with some jokes. &&It's not really their fault, blame the shithead Gilliam signed a deal for financing with that didn't do any financing but now owns the rights to the film because contract law is stupid.&&I saw the movie two days ago. It’s fun!&&I know this is going to sound like a joke, but yes, he finished it but you might not be able to see it for awhile. Gilliam is involved in legal battles with an early producer who as I recall actually never bothered to pay, but thanks to some weird laws still has claims. That is causing problems for distribution and your guess is as good as mine when that'll be cleared up.&&The whole legal hoopla over this movie is increasing the hype for sure. I know nothing about this movie other than people involved but i want to see it pretty badly. I may be a victim of the hype.&&From the early reviews and impressions so far it doesn't seem like a very good film. &&the whole thing is a meta narrative making Gilliam the Quixote character, tilting at the windmills of Hollywood. enjoy it as the improbable piece of art it is!&&I had no idea it wasn't released in America but I saw it and thought it was great&&Yeah, I went in with no expectations and I still had them destroyed to the ground&&r/unexpectedonepiece&&The man who ^almost killed Don Quixote&&He didn't kill him though &&SPOYLURS DEWD \:}&&We’ll never hear about Skarsgard Skarsgard, the 11th dimensional child that he had when fucking a void&&This is the father of the family, you've probably seen him in a whole bunch of movies.

Keep an eye out for Valter, though. He’s probably the next Skarsgård we’ll be seeing on a movie poster.&&Oh come on now, Stellan is the original. He's the dad of all the younger ones, he's been around for ages.

In the words of comedian Ari Shaffir: 

""[Adam Driver] is a beautiful semetic man!""&&Yeah but he's kinda the epitome of BDE&&> I JUST HAD SEX AND NOW I'M EATING NACHOOOOS!&&He's like the more successful Jon Heder triplet.&&is It bad that it still blows my mind that he was a goddamn marine?&&He was easily the only reason that I watched *Girls* as long as I did. I totally agree on his doof factor, but he was (and is) such a compelling actor that I knew he was going to be a must watch guy.

That he's done so much in such a short time is even beyond my hopes for him. He's also working with a lot of great directors and his future looks stellar. 

I would not be surprised to see him win an Golden Globe or Oscar.&&He's the new Adam west&&Logan Lucky&&If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend Paterson, it's my favourite movie of all time and Adam is superb in it.&&Daniel craig in Ligan Lucky should have won an award&&Cauliflower&&It's a great movie but it's also just the worst. Like I'm not sad that I saw it but I never want to see it again.&&That clip was amazing and I need to watch this movie ASAP. &&Me too! It was very funny lol. Thanks for sharing the clip! &&He also likes throwing himself into the roles a lot. Especially stunt work.

In a behind the scenes of TLJ they talk about how hard the choreography is and how it's intense. Then everyone is like ""But Adam just goes out and makes it look effortless"" and it cuts to him tearing it up. &&Scorsese. Most actors don't get to work with a director like that their whole career.&&I thought he nailed it in Patterson.&&You should check out Logan Lucky if you haven't already!

He's one of the leads among a few others but I still think he did a great job.&&I thought he was outstanding in Silence &&I thought he was pretty incredible in Silence, sure Andrew Garfield kinda stole the show but Driver's performance was still outstanding.&&I think he's fine as he is. I feel he's really good in understated and soft-spoken/mild mannered roles. Aside from Kylo, that is. Not that his portrayal of Kylo is bad in any way, in fact he might be my favorite character in the new star wars films. &&He killed it in Silence though really nestled my haunches &&Girls. It was difficult to watch with my girlfriend at first. But he was just a great character. Worth watching. &&He was fantastic in Silence.&&He is amazing in Inside Llewyn Davis&&So many movies mentioned here with him I haven’t seen! Definitely gonna check them out (especially the Jarmush one!). I quite liked him in Logan Lucky and This is where I leave you.&&Adam Driver is a good actor tho&&Mark Hamill is a really successful voice actor to the point where I think there's some people who think of the Joker before they think of Luke when they hear his name. Natalie Portman has been successful as hell before and after Star Wars, as has Ewan McGregor, as has Liam Neeson. John Boyega is doing OK for himself, as is Oscar Issac. Really I think Hayden and Carrie were the only sad stories, for different reasons of course. &&Gleeson's been acting since his early 20s and I think he's fucking fantastic. I follow his career pretty closely and of course I think Ex Machina is his best, but even in movies I don't expect to enjoy much like Crash Pad (shitty romcom) or Peter Rabbit (creepy kids movie) I think he's amazing. 

Love his dad Brendan too :) &&Very jealous bud! Take it all in for me! And I'm holding out faith that enough people like us love Terry's work enough that it'll be released in some form or another :)&&This is why I’m both happy and sad that credentials aren’t required by reddit... the community usually takes care if anyone is full of it. 

I’m am envious, but not jealous of you. Terry is a hero to some. If it can’t be me previewing the film, I’m glad ic can be you. 

Give Mr. Gilliam his fans’ regards. 
Long live Monty Python &&Just spitballing here, but supposing at you rmeeting you pitch a secret online streaming viewing just for people on this thread, to start a viral internet campaign for it to be released.&&Record it for us and put it online. Don’t be a pussy. It’s your duty &&Neither did *The Zero Theorem*, but that's a super interesting movie. I don't really trust the average movie critic with Terry Gilliam.&&Aw that's a shame, I still have a place in my heart for Terry Gilliam films even if they're not amazing story wise, I just love the worlds he creates, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassuss. Something about them is just so spellbinding.&&I didn't really like it. It was quite good and then it started to get really weird. I saw it in a sneak preview a couple of weeks back.&&I saw it when it played down here at the Sydney Film Festival. I loved it. I had not seen any Terry Gilliam films except 12 Monkeys and his Monty Python Work, so initially I was worried it was going to be hard for me to understand Terry Gilliams sole directorial efforts. But man I loved this film. Having seen his other works afterwards, you can clearly tell Don Quixote has been a massive influence on his body of work. The last 20 mins of Jabberwocky is just one example. I think I loved this film more because of what it means to Terry Gilliam himself. And the very nature of obsession, and passion. It’s by no means his best film, but it’s an adventure film that you don’t see anywhere else today. And it’s a film about trying to be something, moving through the mundane elements of life into something epic, and the cost of that journey, from sanity, to love. And the cost of pulling back from the epic and magical, into reality.

I do think this is where Terry Gilliam should end his career. It’s a capstone to his legacy in a sense. And it’s a wonderful film to ride off into the cinematic sunset with&&There is a giant rights battle going on.

Gillingham ~~took money~~ signed contract from one invester, that investor then wanted too much creative control before handing over the money, so Gillingham pulled out, but the investor claims the contract meant that he couldn't do that, but Gillingham claims he could do it as no money had changed hands.&&I saw it in a theatre in the Netherlands two days ago.&&I saw it in France months ago. It was released In May.&&Yeah I dont think it's ever getting a US release. It's crazy, Gilliam spent the better part of 3 decades trying to make this film, finally got it finished,  and he cant even release it in his home country. &&How did that happen?&&This is wrong-wrong-bo-bong-etc.-etc. According to the current producer, the guy who said that was [literally lying](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-lawsuit-terry-gilliam-1201977742/).&&Totally. Soon as I looked at it I was brought back to the Dali museum in Florida. If your ever in the area it's more than worth checking out. I know its cliche to say but images do not do Dali justice. Some of his paintings are like two stories tall while others literally change based on if your standing down the hall 20 feet from it or right in front of it. Surreal in the truest sense. &&Dali is surrealism. Surrealism is Dali. &&That movie/documentary is called “Lost in La Mancha” and is incredible. Would definitely recommend to anyone. &&You a Drexel Film student?&&Dude is just gonna fuckin leak the thing online, watch.&&That's not entirely true. The decision of the court was that Gilliam owns the legal rights to the movie but that he had to pay a fee of 10,000 euros to Branco. Branco does NOT own the right to the movie, and he exaggerated his ""win"" as if he was right all along when really he's a moron with delusions of grandeur. Amazon is just being stupid.&&I agree. It was still a fun watch.tedious at times and way too long thou&&It seems like the controversy is driving the hype behind the movie. 

The preview made it seem incredibly mediocre. &&Honestly, I feel like being an artist and having your vision constantly mangled by time and frustration doesn't feel very good. I feel bad for anyone who has a really good idea that they'll never see the way they planned it.&&Isn't capitalism great&&If you're a fan of Gilliam films, you'll know critics range between thinking his movies are a pile of shit, and thinking his movies are a masterpiece.

All for the same film!

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the most notable case.&&It's not the best Terry Giliam movie, but if you like his work it's still worth watching.&&Never listen to critic reviews! Especially for Terry films. Go with your own heart and mind open and make your own decisions. 

I fucking hate critics... they are a big part of the reason why all we get now is super hero’s and remakes of remakes now. &&r/expectedonepiece&&He kicked his ASS!&&Oh hey, I found my people.&&Since the events of whole cake island luffy would prob beat him 1v1&&Please Mr. Kennedy🎶 &&That's my underlying message :)  &&In all of his interviews, he comes off as very down to earth.

Perhaps surprisingly, you have to have a really good grip on what passes for normal to have as effective as command over the shocking as he has.&&Doflamingo? No?&&One of the antagonists, actually one of the best in my book, is named Donquixote Doflamingo. I think any fan of the series came to comments to see if anyone would beat them to the punch with a reference. &&Are you talking about Matt the radar technician? &&Is there a word for doofy but also, like, totally kinda sexy? My friend wanted to know 

Edit: I forgot I already have a word for this, fugly + fuckable = fuggable

Edit 2: I mean my friend has a word for this&&Exactly why I laughed in the theater when Kylo took his helmet off in Force Awakens. I believe *doofy* was even the word I used.

He's also the one famous person from my hometown.&&[deleted]&&That is so accurate. &&This is a good comparison&&Lena Dunham is so insufferable that she makes everyone else insufferable by connection.&&The fact that you hated his character is why he was so good&&Ari Shaffer and Adam Driver are the same person, don't let him fool you&&?&&Cauliflower&&> it's my favourite movie of all time 

How many movies have you seen?

&&I prepared myself to take him in and sought Hungry Hearts he was brilliant in it. I instantly warmed up to him in TFA.&&Lovely fucking movie.&&+1. Fantastic movie that I’ll probably never watch again. Fucking brilliant story, amazing acting and directing but god damn is it not boring.&&It's a rom com but a good one. Any film which has Dan Radcliffe mentioning masturbating kittens is alright by me. Well worth a watch.&&It's streamable on Prime Video and it is excellent.&&yeah i bet jarmusch and soderbergh really liked him for his stunt choreography&&I feel like the people who aren’t into Adam haven’t seen Paterson. That movie solidified my fandom in him. Even better, it introduced me to Jarmusch. He is an incredible writer/Director!&&Was going to suggest the same thing. Having family who live in WV, the representation I felt was so no point, and Adam Driver was the perfect pair with Channing Tatum. Probably one of my favorite comedies of recent years.&&His role in Girls wasn't mild mannered either.&&definitely the best character in the new flicks, no questions asked. although I definitely enjoyed what they did with Luke, and I have a huge soft spot for Maz, but if I ever end up seeing episode 9 (which ehhh idk if I will because TLJ was 90% garbage for me) it will be for my boi Kylo&&I’m genuinely curious about this phrase, I have never heard it before. &&The guys in Girls are the best characters especially in the later seasons. A lot of the Girls just started getting sooooo bad to me. But Ray, Elijah, Hannah's dad, and Adam are amazing throughout.

A real testament is in season 1 when you think Adam may be this crazy potentially manipulative crazy person because you're seeing it all from Hannah's perspective. But then it turns out that he's just a normal dude and Hannah is loco. &&The whole family is talented. I recommend checking out, About Time. &&I loved The Zero Theorem , I have yet to meet another person IRL who liked it.&&This is a little off topic but you got me thinking about it. My best friend is a make up artist on film and tv, she's no big deal or anything, just another cog. Though she has met some fairly big actors like Robert Pattinson and Charlie Hunnam that most girls would swoon over, she just doesn't give a fuck about celebrity, so it really doesn't faze her. One of the movies she did though was a Michael Palin flick and when she met him she said she was speechless and he really blew her away as someone who deserved his celebrity.

I guess the point is, if there's any celebs I'd lose my shit over meeting, it would definitely be any of the pythons (or Attenborough), they all just seem like a class act.&&Even Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas sits at 49% on RT.&&> Neither did The Zero Theorem, but that's a super interesting movie.

I'd say it's only somewhat interesting seeing as how the concepts have been covered numerous times. And it being slightly interesting doesn't necessarily make it good. 

Just my opinion, but while I didn't hate watching it I don't think I'd recommend it much. &&Except Time Bandits. Favorite movie of my childhood. Finally convinced my wife to watch it with me last week!!&&Exactly this. Some of my favorite films have been given shit reviews because how dare they break from traditional film making rules and make the audience actually think for 120 minuets. &&Then you'll probably like it. His movies are always very divisive between critics.&&Don't trust the reviews on anything not mainstream. Just watch it and make up your own opinion.&&I am fascinated that you know so much about the financials yet have no clue what his name is.  I'm not making fun, it's literally fascinating. &&*Gilliam&&This guy is the ultimate no-spoiler.&&To be fair, isn't his home country now legally England?&&There is even a movie about how much trouble he has had trying to make this movie. Its called Lost in La Mancha and it was released in 2002.&&Do you know why?

 What about us Canadians? &&What’s the problem with it? Why can’t/won’t anyone distribute it?&&Turns out there’s a guy who says he owns the rights to make movies based on Quixote, and that Gilliam never got the rights from him. 

(This is a recollection from memory and extremely simplified.)

Also Gilliam has been saying recently the lawsuit is incorrect and he does indeed have rights to release it, so I guess we will just have to see how it all shakes out in the end. &&[deleted]&&We also watched a great doc series called *Below The Line* that was also just as great. &&Negative ghost rider. &&Is there a source from outside the battling producer camps that spells out who has the rights? The reporting I can find from after the verdict is surprisingly weak on details. This article repeats Gilliam's team saying they still have the rights to the film, but it doesn't include anyone else backing them up. The only thing that seems to be consistent in every report is that Gilliam paid a breach of contract fine.

https://www.indiewire.com/2018/06/the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-lawsuit-terry-gilliam-1201977742/

If the matter is still open to be disputed in court, if the verdict didn't settle who owns the rights to the film, then a company like Amazon would still want to stay away until ownership is clearly established.&&So it’s like every TG film since F&L. &&I wouldn't say that it is mediocre at all. Just that it had way too much hype, and that a movie can't be perfect with so many problems happening during its creation.

It's a bit long, but definitely worth watching.&&It is not just the controversy that drives the hype, this film has been anticipated since the early 2000s when it still featured Johnny Depp. The documentary made about it, the ""curse"", conflicts with producers and Gilliam himself constantly commenting about the lack of progression ensured it never really went away. The anticipation just kept building.

Gilliam kept fleshing out all the ideas he had for the film in the media trying to keep people interested but when you watch the finished product you are underwhelmed instead. It just feels dated and chaotic, like 4 or 5 movie ideas spliced together, which is probably not far from the truth. It is also far too long and the overall tone changes a few times, from comedy/tragedy to outright drama and even thriller, all against a fantasy background.

It isn't all bad though. It is nice to look at with great scenery and costume design although the film seems a bit empty at times. It might add to the overall dreamlike qualities but it could use a little  more dressing in places. The acting is also great overall, with Pryce being a near perfect fit for don Quixote and Skarsgard acting over the top without getting ridiculous. Adam Driver isn't too impressive though, I'm not sure if he was miscast or just isn't a good enough actor. &&Yes actually &&Baron Munchausen is surely the pinnacle of that. &&I don't know about that, usually critics seem to favor art pieces and foreign films over remakes and reboots.  Although art pieces do tend to polarize them much more. &&i mean, yeah i know, ive read the series, and even got one piece tattoos and stuff.

its just so irrelevant to the movie i wasnt expecting anyone to bring it up i guess.&&I don't know but can you please STOP YELLING AT ME YOU'RE STARTING TO STRESS ME OUT.&&Dude, Matt straight up sucks.&&Your “friend” might be a doofosexual. &&Swoofy? &&It's because he's thoughtful. People who can talk intelligently at length kind of put a different spin on their looks. 

Adam Driver talking about craft and advocating for arts in the military is totally different than Adam Driver shooting rats in the junkyard.&&If you get any good answers, I have a friend who also wants to know. &&He’s sooo sexy. Long hair, tall, killer body. Frequently appears on /r/ladyboners  ;)&&[deleted]&&Uglysexy &&I laughed because the moment was played so perfectly: she calls him a ""creature in a mask"", then he takes it off and it's like...a dude. No scars, no red eyes, nice hair, and her face is so confused. Like, man, are you seriously that dramatic?  


Mishawaka is known for two things: Adam Driver and [CHAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1miD-AWtXqk).&&Were you just hypnotized by his voice?&&The actress who played Marnie... Didn't think much of her on Girls, seemed like a bad actress playing an insufferable character. And then she's amazing in Get Out. Did a complete 180 on my opinion of her.&&I didn't know about Dunham being a massive piece of shit at the time. I just had a lot of friends recommending it and was totally turned off by the whole 'rich white girls having it hard in New York City' theme of the show.&&but I hated all the characters.

no knock on Girls, clearly a popular show, just not for me.&&Business Development Executive&&Big Dick Energy. &&did you say CAULiflower?&&You sucked my arm off&&Have you seen Paterson? It’s an incredible movie, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s someone’s favorite movie.

It made me feel so warm. Beautiful and complex characters you really get to know well, a mild non-dramatic story, incredibly well shot. Also, the relationship portrayed is very similar to my own.

It’s an amazing movie. It’s one of my favorites, definitely not surprising if it’s someone’s actual favorite. Not everyone’s favorite movie has to be one made by Kurosawa or Fellini ;)&&That's a really good question... I haven't counted, of course, but I'd say around 1000.  


The reason why Paterson is my favourite is because it fits my personality and my movie taste perfectly.&&It’s a rom com about a guy playing housewrecker with a couple in a longtime relationship? Is the guy who she’s currently with beating her or something?&&I love almost all rom coms!&&If you're ever craving a vampire movie that's very introspective and not just a horror flick, Jarmusch's *Only Lovers Left Alive* is spectacular.&&Down By Law was my first Jarmush movie.

I don't know if I can find a bad one in his filmography. Check out the Criterion editions of his movies. They love him and the supplements are a film nerd's wet dream.&&Oh shiiit you are in for a bunch of treats. Wait til you see Coffee and Cigarettes.&&Ghost Dog is one of the coolest movies ever made, introduced me to both Jarmusch and Forest Whittaker... oh yeah and the Wu-Tang clan!&&Jarmusch is a genius. &&Jim is the best &&I’ll disagree on that number but I agree that Kylo is the best thing about the new trilogy.&&You'll see it just like the rest of us will.  I have hope that 9 can redeem it. &&Yeah that whole abortion scene really helped humanize Adam later on I think&&That movie literally has everything...except a good plot.&&Right here. I saw it in Toronto at a small theater because no one else was screening it. It was actually great and I really enjoyed it thoroughly. &&I'm not going to rattle off a list, but I've met my share. The problem is the situation.

It's almost always as if somebody famous was serving you at Walmart. Without being rude, they're just trying to get through the whole song and dance; at the end of the day, you're two strangers who have never met.

If some complete stranger was a little too familiar with you, would it be off-putting? Imagine nearly every random person doing that to you.

The worst part is it's typically the ones you want to like, who you feel underwhelmed by. Even if they're assholes or act entitled, it might just be them having a bad day or a defence against creepers.

After a while you get used to it. Where it gets cool is when you have repeated prolonged contact, just like regular people do, so you can actually say hello and relate to one another. :)&&Damn I thought this movie was generally considered to be a work of art&&Well that's just insane&&Uncultured savages, the lot of them&&Whaaat the fuuuuuck&&Not to mention that Grandma's Boy, one of the greatest comedies of all time, sits at 16%.

Terry Gilliam made a deal with a guy who said he would finance the movie if he got distribution rights. Gilliam signed the contract but then decided that the guy didn't get him the money he needed to make the movie fast enough, so he went and found someone else to finance it.

Is much better than

""embrace your inner anti hero""

Edit: for those confused, the first venom trailer had the anti hero line as its tag line &&[deleted]&&The villain is NOT Carnage, it’s Riot.

EDIT: *For those asking, Riot is going to be the main villain of the film (with its host being the CEO of Life Foundation, Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed), but that doesn't mean that the other four symbiotes (Scream, Lasher, Phage and Agony) aren't going to be there as secondary antagonists.*

*Scream is in the trailer. Her host, Donna Diego (played by Michelle Lee) can be seen slowly morphing into Scream around* *1:54*.&&Is it me or does he sound like Mike Tyson at the start&&Prediction of the day: Third act is a big gooey mess. &&Tom Hardy doing his best Fenster from Usual Suspects impression.&&Seeing and hearing Venom really makes me want ""The Darkness"" as an adaptation. &&Two Venom trailers have now been released with no mention that Woody Harrelson is actually in this movie.&&That ""turd in the wind"" line is very telling.&&Not being able to understand Tom Hardy under a face covering part 100.&&""In association with Marvel"", just hammering home the fact that Marvel Studios isn't responsible for this.&&> The world has enough superheroes

Well that's a better tagline than ""Embrace your inner antihero"" 

Also they fix the symbiote pronunciation apparently&&Imma need subtitles for this&&This trailer strongly reminded me of the Prototype game, which was incredibly dumb and amazing fun. Something about how the symbiote cover moved, and the hand-blades, just minor stuff, but, yeah, basically I really enjoyed Prototype :D

Hopefully the movie can deliver the same!&&Did he call that dude a turd in the wind?

I can barely understand a single thing he’s saying. Venom OR Tom Hardy. &&Why is Tom Hardy doing an impression of a toddler? What is that accent supposed to be?&&However this movie turns out, the Venom design is awesome!

Tom Hardy's ~~accent~~ Elmer Fudd impression is *interesting*&&Spidey wouldn't understand a single fucking thing this Venom is trying to tell so it's good to have separated universes&&I really hope it's just the editing of the trailer for why Tom as Brock sounds so... choppy. I refuse to believe that's how his character actually speaks.

That said, didn't understand a damn thing he said as Venom, so at least that's a standard when it comes to Tom Hardy.&&Not excited for a villain fight that'll look like slightly off-color pools of gasoline slapping each other&&Why does Tom Hardy sound like Dunkey?&&The dialogue in these trailers continues to be awful.&&""Human beings are disposable""

I'll take clues he might be the bad guy for $400, Alex&&I cannot say I'm sold by this.&&I got some Amazing Spider-Man 2 flashbacks when guy in a suit who is obviously a villain showed up&&So the dialogue/script is an absolute trainwreck from these trailers so far it seems.

It LOOKS cool, venom definitely looks and sounds the part.

But I don't think that'll be enough. The writing feels so bad right now. &&Is it just me or does Eddie sound a little mentally handicapped? Maybe its the basic as hell dialogue, but Hardy seems to be playing the character as a version of Warrior's Tommy Reardon, that got hit in the head too many times.&&This movie is kind of frustrating to me, because absolutely everything about Venom himself and the action look incredibly cool and stylish. But the dialogue and whatever that weird accent/acting Tom Hardy is doing seems to be atrocious.

I'll probably watch this expecting some fun moments, but an overall poor movie.&&Oh, good, another movie where I have no fucking clue what Tom Hardy is saying. &&Venom looks absolutely terrifying. Whether this movie is good or bad, that design for Venom is just fantastic. The fact they also got the Venom eating people thing down is great as well. 

Also, it definitely looks like Venom is gonna have a very good amount of time in this movie. Not only showing up in the last 15 minutes, like those rumors suggested.

EDIT: also, this movie is definitely rated R. No way it wouldn’t after showing blood coming out of the guys neck that Riot cut.&&""What are you?""

I'm guessing like me, he couldn't understand a single thing he was saying so he went for the easier question. I would've straight up asked the fuck he just said&&I was with it until that final scene, Venom in a brightly-lit convenience store making jokes didn't gel well with the rest of the trailer at all. Hoping it's not a huge tonal mess&&I'll wait and watch a supercut of all the Venom parts on YouTube.&&Holy shit this dialogue is fucking painful. Tom Hardy's monologue at the beginning could be from a Neil Breen movie. &&What's the point of having a 10 second teaser at the start of a 3 minute trailer?&&This looks more it might be a movie adaption of the Prototype games rather than a Vemon movie. &&It feels like this movie will be ""Upgrade"" with a higher budget and superhero trademarks. However I think, at the end of the day, ""Upgrade"" will be a better movie than this weirdness.&&I think Venom looks pretty awesome but this looks not good.&&Looks cool, but you know what would make it really good? *Spiderman*&&I want an audiobook with Venom's voice.&&What the fuck is this accent? Why does he sound like a baby half of the time?

And that scene at the end... the delivery is off, Hardy looks bored. It looks like a bad rehearsal not a scene in a blockbuster movie. 

The first trailer was meh but this one is just awful.&&Sony's marketing team is still going with the ""show the whole movie in the trailers"" strategy from Amazing Spider-Man. And the movie seems to be doing the protagonist vs antagonist with same power set again. &&I've seen enough hentai to know where that tongue scene is going...&&This trailer has huge spoilers. Now I know that there will be two parasites, and one of them will be grey and belong to the bad guy. 

RIP &&This movie feels like it is set in same world as The Amazing Spider-Man, still grasping on to that failed attempt at an extended universe. &&The worst crime is they actually gave critics the quote to use in the trailer itself: ""turd in the wind"".&&I wish Sony would stop making movies. &&Okay, the script might be godawful, but are the voices really that hard to understand for anyone else? I understood pretty much everything both Venom and Eddie said. Sure, they aren't good, but they're not spouting indecipherable nonsense like most of the people in this thread seem to be saying they are. &&So at some point, Venom fights another symbiote that is colored dark grey? That's got potential to be very confusing. Weird choice, especially because in the comics most of the symbiotes other than venom are brightly colored.&&""embrace your inner joint intellectual property ownership""&&At least its much better than ""So thats it huh? we are some kind of Venom squad?&&Or they could've just used ""Embrace your inner Venom"", but yeah, the thing about enough superheroes does feel much better.&&deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.7828  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/02415)&&It sounds like Lance Reddick from The Wire. &&Yes.&&Voicing both the symbiote and Venom&&Carnage will be teased at the end.&&On one hand Im glad they are not ruining carnage for this movie. On the other hand, I hope they change Riots color or its going to be hard to tell Riot and Venom apart. Maybe we can hear Riot clearly?&&I was really confused, because the color looked like Anti-Venom that wouldn't make much sense.&&I was wondering who it was. Thanks!&&I heard Tommy Wiseau. &&""I'm Eddie Bwock, and I'm a repworter."" &&Why does Tom Hardy's voice sound like no human I have ever heard before. &&I'm Eddie Bwock. Ima wepawter&&I can't tell if hes supposed to be playing a mentally handicapped character or not&&I mean they will see Tom Hardy as the first successful symbiote. The main villain will try and replicate it in a shortage of time. In the third act he will take the risk and become a symbiote himself. Initially he thinks he has control but towards the end he will lose it.&&It'll be like a turd in the wind.&&I hate it when the bad guy gets the exact same gear/weapon as the main character except bigger or a different color. Like how unoriginal can you be. Yet seems to happen in every other film. &&Are we still discussing the movie or its porn parody?&&I've got a feeling that the big venom vs. venom fight is going to suck ass &&""Gimmethefuckingsymbioteyoucocksuckerwhathafhuuck...""&&“This is what normal people sound like right? Yeah, it probably is, don’t worry about it Tom”&&He sounds like Rainman.  

""Definitely....we are definitely Venom""&&Is that the one about the hooker with dysentery? &&Only if Mike Patton does the voice.&&Exactly what I thought of. That one scene with the venom head looking at Tom Hardy was straight Darkness. &&Jaaaaaccckkkiiieeeee......you need us jackieeeeeeeeee.&&Woody Harrelson already stated he's only making a small appearance and his character will be left for the sequel, wich sound great if he's playing Cletus Kassidy &&Because he's Carnage and they're saving him for Venom 2? 

This is speculation, I have no idea. &&He's been confirmed to be in it? &&Is that like what happens when toads get struck by lightning?&&The dialogue in this trailer and the last... woof man. ""the guy you work for is an evil person."" &&People are paid money to write this&&""Turds in the wind, all we are are turds in the wind""&&The optimist in me wants to believe that this is a throwaway line for the trailer and wont be used in the final cut. Happens all the time. &&Do turds even roll in the wind?...&&Yeah I was thinking this trailer was actually much better than the last one and then they ended with that line for some reason and I completely changed my mind again.&&All these moments lost in time...&&I am a turd in the wind. Watch how I soar.&&Guarantee that is the last scene of the movie.&&Isn't the phrase ""fart in the wind""? ""Turd in the wind"" just makes no sense. I'm picturing a turd, aloft in the wind, gently breezing along the side walk on a brisk November morning.&&Stupid question but is Venom's voice just Tom Hardy's pitched down? I like it!&&Is it his face being covered, or is it just overly processed/engineered audio? Venom's voice is too distorted to make anything out.&&Everyone understood what I was saying until I put on the mask.&&4u&&Not responsible. Not really sanctioning it. Not fond of it.

This is some award-winning writing right here. &&It's all cut together weird, which I don't think does any of the line delivery justice. Since the entire Eddie Brock opener doesn't flow that well at all. But, he did say that.

I thought he said ""tumor in the wind"", but that doesn't really make sense &&No one cared who I was until I became a drunk baby&&I honestly feel like Tom Hardy no longer remembers what his voice is meant to sound like. Every time i see him he sounds different, even in his english accent. At this point i think he's just guessing. &&Ahm Eddie Bwock.  Im ah weporter

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold!&&It's his Brooklyn accent from ""the drop"".  I'm under the impression Eddy is from BK. Which I imagine he returns too after the end of this movie.&&**Marvel What If:**

**Tommy Wiseau got the Symbiote**&&I honestly can't tell if Hardy is doing a really weird voice or if they edited a bunch of scenes together to make that first line. It just sounds so strange.&&I thought he sounded a bit like Christopher Walken, not fully Walken but almost there&&I noticed this in Warrior too. I think his American accent is bad so he has to hide it under layers of new york mushmouth.&&I love Tom Hardy to the point where I have converted by boyfriend to having a man crush on him too. But yeah, his voice in this movie is really off. I'm still going to see it, but he sounds so weird in these trailers.&&The design is awesome. Going half and half in the face for the ""we are Venom"" line looked real silly though. &&I still miss the giant Spider symbol though.&&See, now I just want to see that crossover.

Venom: **We. Are Venom.**

Spidey: ...You're *vermin*?

Venom: **Venom.**

Spidey: Vitamin?

Venom sighs and retracts his head.

Eddie: Ith vewwy simpew. We'we *Vemmin*.

Spidey: Now you're just messing with me.&&Learning that *completely* changed my expectation of this film (a while ago). &&There was heaps of mix and match dialogue from him as voice over. I think there must be a longer narration that was cut down for this trailer.&&Who will win? Diesel Fuel or Premium Unleaded???&&Well, can't use [colourful symbiotes](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/3402091-the_guardians-venom-separation_anxiety%231-cropped.jpg) if you want a movie being grim-dark.&&I didn’t want to see this movie until I read your comment, but now I’m interested in seeing just how correct that statement is.&&I thought it looked like someone rendered something quickly in the unreal engine and so it looks like it had tons of semen just dropped all over it.&&Got slightly excited for Carnage.  Well, first I thought it was Venom with knife hands in the office room and then the next scene was whoever that was attacking Venom but then it looked like it shed its skin and was carnage? wtf is this movie doing? &&*Venom blocks the bullets being fired at Eddie*

NOT EVEN CLOSE BAYBEEE&&Y'know, Venom's all well and good, but when are we gonna get DA KNACK MOVIE BABYYYYYYYYYYY! 

&&AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND KILLED HIM IN ONE HIT&&Maybe Dunkey *is* Tom Hardy. &&Thank you Venom Souls &&Reminds me of that time when Dunkey beat Sky in Smash &&Well one of the writers behind this wrote 50 Shades of Grey so there's that&&At least someone pronounced symbiote somewhat correct this time. &&THIS GROTESQUE MONSTER IS THE NEXT STEP IN HUMAN EVOLUTION.&&I am still on the fence. But I will say that the Venom esthetic is a big leap forward since the first images came out. All the bike stunts with the tendril still feel cheap though.&&As I am watching the trailer, looks nothing spectacular, just same old run of the mill, the music sounds rehashed from the DK trilogy. Does not look very exciting. More of the same old. &&""I found something.....really bad.""&&What? You're telling me the writer of 50 Shades of Grey was a bad choice for this?&&TURD IN THE FUCKING WIND&&""Eyes. Lungs. Pancreas. So many snacks, so little time.""&&That’s my biggest gripe. That and the overall production design aesthetic they’re going for looks like Generic Action Movie #587567. I can look over a clear lack of decent writing so long as the style is there, but this movie looks like it’s almost entirely devoid of both,  despite the good design for Venom.&&someone said he sounds like katt williams in this movie and now i can't unhear it&&Wait what is the time stamp, I’ve been watching the trailer for a bit and can’t find it. 

EDIT: Ruben Fleischer has also confirmed that Venom is gonna be an R rated movie.  I hope we get a hard R &&That's Venom for you, he does quite the commentary or ""bad jokes"" everytime he face a thug on his solo comic books and mostly is on public areas&&Venom, as I know him, has a sense of humor, so him fucking with that guy lines up with how I see him.&&Have you...read a comic with Venom? He wasn't making jokes. That's how the character is...that last scene could have literally been taken right from a late 80s or 90s Venom story. &&that whole sequence was a little cringey, I've got a bad feeling about this one&&Comic accurate though, that's how Venom is&&I can't wait for this movie to show up on Best of the Worst &&They use the same video on skippable ads &&Between that and the other recent trend of trailers that have the title and release date on the screen for the entire length of the trailer, I'm pretty sure the movie industry has just completely lost faith in the attention span of the average human. &&Well the guy in Upgrade didn't have a drunk baby as the main character, so I think it automatically wins on that front.&&My naems Eddie Bwock, I hav a pawasite&&Also that other symbiote eating that guy going straight for the crotch first&&""Its free real estate""&&WE

Put money on it.  Dread it.&&Carnage isn’t as cool as you remember him. Aside from maximum carnage, comic writers have no idea what else to do with the symbiotes since the 90s&&Venom and Riot look super similar, Riot has a slightly lighter colour scheme than Venom, and has the same build.

*(pre recorded studio audience laughter.)*&&Uh-oh! Big monster teeth! Uh-oh!&&Canyahearmeinaback?&&I've been saying this; get Patton to do the voices of the symbiotes. He'd sound fantastic as Carnage and I could see the more guttural, deep sounds that he does for Venom.

It sounds great if the movie does well enough for them to green light a sequel, I'm getting the impression it's 50/50 currently whether it happens until the movie releases and Sony sees how much money the movie makes&&Hahaha Venom 2. Bless them.&&same thing that happens to everything else.

&&On one hand, sure.

On the other hand, ""turd in the wind"" made the sizzle reel.&&Yeah, stomwinds... you’ve obviously never been caught up in a Shitnado&&I really hope it's like the Deadpool trailers where the lines in the trailer aren't the ones used in the movie. &&I think so, he said at SDCC he recorded his lines as Venom first so that he could react off of himself in the scenes where Eddie talks to the Symbiote.&&It is, he did both voices in an interview recently I believe&&I like it, venom is literally a talking sludge ball, a little gurgle is good. &&Honestly the accent is so strong that I can understand Venom better than I can understand Brock.&&Like a turd in the wind.&&[Infinity Wars Spoiler]

Just not as raspy.

I can see Tom holland pulling that off. &&Then Deadpool walks in...&&Listening on headphones it's really noticeable how much editing they did for his voice. At the beginning there's a section where it sounded like almost every word was taken from separate clips to make one ransom note style sentence.

It also has some kind of filter over it, makes it sound like it's got a crunchy tech sound to it. Kinda weird.&&Vin Diesel will win&&Bahgawd!! That’s ....That’s E85!! With a steel chair!!&&To be fair, Riot, Phage, Lasher, Agony, and Scream are Venom's children. They wouldn't be around yet, as they come after Carnage. I believe he is fighting Grey Venom which is a Venom Clone.

Edit: I'm being told it's Riot which completely throws the offspring timeline out the window, and probably the fact that Riot is an offspring of Venom completely.&&That's definitely why they're doing this, but it's especially stupid because the color red would look really cool and still completely fit the theme. But grim-dark has become stupidly synonymous with NO COLORS AT ALL&&They didn't pick Riot (the grey one) for nothing&&I'm pretty sure the trailer gave away the final villain fight too.

>!That's the main scientist guy played by Riz Ahmed, right?  So he gets a symbiote too, and then fights Eddie in the climax of the movie.!<&&It’s Riot. He’s gray instead of black. Literally any other Life Foundation symbiote makes more sense from a visual standpoint.

I was worried from the first trailer that most of the movie will be Eddie with occasional tentacles, since you generally don't cast a big name actor only to cover their face all the time. But this made it look like Venom himself will get a lot to do.

Still not entirely convinced this will work, though. I just can't tell what tone they're going for. Am I supposed to think he's cool? Scary? Even funny? Should I feel sorry for Eddie, or is the weird accent and delivery supposed to be silly?&&Weely bwad&&It's a bad line of dialogue no matter who is saying it. But what makes it WORSE is that Eddie Brock is supposed to be a fucking JOURNALIST. You mean to tell me a professional writer can't find other words to describe a corporations's diabolical plot involving an alien symbiote other than, ""really bad""? Man, this movie is gonna be rough. &&And the other writer is the same from Gangster Squad... Oh, and it's Sony producing. This cannot be bad whatsoever!&&After airing the rest of his fetishes, all he's left with is tentacles and vore, which I guess he found a platform to explore...&&I'm sorry, *what?*&&I think Mr. Lahey was involved with the making of this script &&https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/d3/b4/acd3b43787ad0f2a158a4164aa8c64c3.jpg&&Honestly that line didn't bother me too much. I could definitely see early era comics Venom saying that. 

""Turd in the wind"" was fucking what though&&It's the same problem they had with Amazing Spider-Man. Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man/Peter Parker was pretty good. Emma Stone was pretty good (because, duh, Emma Stone) and everything else was just suuuuuper generic and I honestly can't remember a single other thing about those movies.&&1:55, you could see some blood. Hoping it’s a hard R as well.&&[deleted]&&Also Eddie Brock is a complete nutjob and a petty ass. Flash Thompson is a much more mature Venom&&His first appearance he confronts Mary Jane and says ""Honey I'm home"" for christ sake.

Also uh, spoiler for a 30 year old comic I suppose.&&> Have you...read a comic with Venom?

I guarantee 99% of the people shitting on this trailer haven't read any of the Spider-man comics with him in it. They probably just know Venom from video games and the Spider-man cartoon from the 90s. &&My biggest problem with that scene is that scary thing with all those teeth threatening to eat this dude alive, and he isn't completely shitting his pants when he asks what the hell he is looking at. Venom being humorous about that threat while the other guy was absolutely terrified out of his mind would have been so impactful. &&It’s a mini ad for everyone who clicks SKIP AD after five seconds.&&oWo what’s this?&&^""Its ^free ^real ^estate""&&The following Sony cash-in is intended for Jim Boonie only.&&No that was bane &&Run from it.&&The current Venom solo comic is really great. Recent runs like Space Knight and Agent Venom were also great.&&The Symbiotes are a great riff on Spiderman's ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"" mantra.  Parker is initially tempted with a power beyond his emotional ability to control and - despite the suit's power saving his life during the Secret Wars - he ends up rejecting it for fear of losing who he is as a person.

The suit then inhabits Parker's moral counterpart in the freelance journalism industry, creating a villain that hates both Parker AND Spiderman (cool, because it plays on the duality of Spiderman as a character and also as a way of revisiting the various petty sleights Parker inflicted on Brock when Parker had the power and Brock didn't).

Carnage is initially interesting because he's Brock's power without even the modest inhibitions of a normal human being.  He's the extreme moral opposite of Parker, a wholly irresponsible individual emboldened by significant new power.  But he eventually plays himself out as just another supernatural punching bag for various Spider-friends to hammer on.

Where the symbiotes shine is as tempters.  They're power without the responsibility.  Where they fall apart is in their Mary Sue-esque imperviousness to consequence.  Venom was a kind-of moral reprisal for Parker's pettiness.  And Carnage was a kind of moral reprisal for Brock's recklessness.  But Cassidy isn't a character that can ever be reformed or feel regret.  Eventually you have to get back to Parker and Brock and play out the whole Power/Responsibility trope between them.  Just piling on new Symbiotes, absent interesting character angles around their hosts, and you're creating an endless assortment of C-list supervillains nobody is really invested in.&&Anyway how’s your parasitic relationship?&&You’re my favorite symbiote &&TOM HARDY BONDED WITH THIS SYMBIOTE IN A CAVE&&BACK TO FORMULA???&&OUT, AM I?!&&I’m already bored of this movie&&Damn this is turning out to be the most predictable action movie ever.&&Being an eight foot tall cannibal means never getting honest critique for your one-liners.&&Shithawks are circlin&&Agreed that's what made Zemo so interesting he even kills the super soldiers, when I saw that I was like ""this dude is serious.""&&Yeah!  Zemo uses cunning and raw revenge to decimate the Avengers.&&I hear a lot of people shit on Zeno because ""he was just a revenge plot,"" but he was so well done that I can't see why it matters. I totally agree with you that it was awesome to see a character just flat out outsmart the heroes *and win.*&&Aye, it's in a few Superhero movies. It's always a bulkier version of the main character's powers. Same thing happened in The Hulk (though that movie was poor throughout so it's not like much was lost!)&&give me the fucking symbiote you cock sucker what the fuck&&Ya, I'm real scared tough guy&&Isaidhe'llflipyou.

&&To the point that it actually seems a rip off.

I didn't see ~~Agony~~ *Scream though, only Riot on that EMT woman.

Edit: I now think the woman at 0:24 is Agony since the Scream symbiote gets its orange-ish streak from the host's orange hair and the woman in the scene looks to have dark hair.&&And I dare to say: [Riot it is](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/venom-riot-first-look-riz-ahmed-1201989595/).&&I don't see why that timeline is thrown off at all. They're all Venom's children (or grandchildren) in that they're birthed from the symbiote, but Eddie Brock doesn't really need to be present for any of them other than Anti-Venom.p

So maybe they already spawned off of the Venom symbiote. This only messes with comic timeline continuity, which is already way beyond borked in the MCU. So not really a problem. 

And yeah, I know this isn't an MCU film.&&They completely took Spider-Man out of the origin of Venom, so are you really that surprised by this?&&Which is weird because the Dark Knight had an interesting color palette (mostly greens and oranges, but still).&&Carnage would be fantastic, just too much to fit in an origin movie &&I thought Carnage was in this?

Instructions clear. In jail.&&WITH NO SURVIVORS!&&It actually threw me off for a moment hearing some of those lines, but mainly because I haven't read the comics since they first came out. But after going back and taking a look, it is pretty accurate for a 90s comic book venom. Bit of dark humor mixed with cringy one liners.

*edit* after a quick wiki search seems he was actually a bright dude 

Eddie excels in academics and sports in an attempt to earn his father's approval but does not succeed. In college, Brock switches his major to journalism after reading an article on the Watergate scandal. After graduating he moves to New York City and obtains a job as a journalist for the Daily Globe. Though he proves himself to be a highly talented journalist, his father still only treats him with indifference&&Carnage is probably only going to be in it at the end. Harrelson said he’s in it for a short bit, but it sets up Venom 2. I hope that’s the case. Rather have a small tease of Carnage and build up his character for a potential sequel.&&I dunno I think he developed a lot when he had a cancer and was Anti-Venom, but now he has regressed back to being Venom again after all that.&&I've always said Venom is more a design, and less a character. He looks cool, and that's always been 90% his appeal.

Man of Steel and the finale of BvS somewhat as well.

The finale of Luke Cage (to an extent), Jessica Jones in Season 2, and a large majority of the seasons of both Flash and Arrow on CW. 

All featured the “villain with an almost identical power set only more evil than the hero” concept. It’s nothing new to Superhero movies and tv, and it doesn’t necessarily make them bad movies/shows or less enjoyable overall, but I really prefer it when they do anything else for the villain.&&He said calmly.&&GIMME FEW GIMME FIE GIMMEHARRYDIDJAPUYYERNAMEINTHEGOBLETODABAJADAZA&&LEEEAARRNNN THHAAATT YOUUU AARREEE MYTT PPUUPPPEEEETTTT&&Oh, you have been blessed in not having been there for *that* shitshow during the ASM days.&&Don't...

I'll be glad if they go for that incarnation of Venom&&It works ok in a Spider-man comic because Spider-man is making stupid jokes at him too. So the villain coming back and saying some stupid joke shit sounds ok.

In the context of a film that ostensibly takes itself somwhat seriously (ie: as the villain is about to eat a person), it comes off as dumb.&&Sometimes i think people here only know Venom from the cartoons.&&Nothing like a little New York water to clear out the sinuses.

You can actually see what's going on. I can only think of the dock scene in the first film being so dark you couldn't see, but then Nolan got the shots pieced together so perfectly you aren't wondering what's going on, you always see exactly what he wants you to see.&&*eye roll*

Bad enough that this film is clearly like every origin film where the hero fights another version of themselves. It's not even the *interesting* other version of Venom.&&Yeah. So no Carnage, but we're getting Symboyite girl (as a mini-boss/turn to your side character) and ""generic evil bad guy who fused half a dozen of them together mega-symboyite"" for your final boss fight.&&I read the Venom arcs but not the one that Brock originates in.  Basically, Spiderman ruins Brock's career as a journalist by accident almost and Brock blames him for getting fired.  So Brock lives in a shithole with nothing but a weightlifting set so he can get ripped and kill Spidey.  Spiderman abandons the symbiote suit, which finds Brock and melds with him because they have a shared hatred of Spidey.  So there's a few arcs and eventually Venom becomes a sort of Anti-hero.  But Brock is never a super coherent character, he's definitely not all there. &&>has been a goofball one-liner spouting dumbass.

And that's why he's my favorite Marvel character.&&IIRC Venom was just over the charts against humans so he's just cocky as fuck and does what he wants. Like the only real thing I remember him being super serious about was hating Spiderman and that was more of an ego thing. Venom *has* to be the best. &&he'll rape ya!&&[deleted]&&“Are you the best part of waking up?” “For you”&&Oh yeah, there's a ton of art theft.

The lower wacker chase scene is well lit, the ferry scene is lit with his cool computer-spectacles, etc. The final scene with Two-Face is pretty dark but that kinda fits the feel of the scene.&&It has nothing to do with color it’s all about contrast. Look at Logan or Mad Max, both films with a pretty mono-chromatic color palette of yellows and oranges but both had a black and white release that are just as watchable. 

There is nothing watchable about dark-colored superhero’s fighting on a dark background in the dark&&Let's see:

* Incredible Hulk (2008)

* Ant Man

* Captain America 1

* Man of Steel

* Dr. Strange? (Kaecilius uses magic too)

Letting these companies get so big is actually bad for society. It limits creativity and stagnates social growth. Look at the music industry over the last quarter decade or rehashed pop culture trends.

Monopolisation, seems to be streamlining and automating jobs.... Yeah i dont see this going to shit at all. 

If dysney monopolises like that. Then fuck it, monopolise everything! Who gives a shit, just as long as society will be not only allowed but, pushed to restructure itself to account for already shit employment markets in the competition with automated systems and behimoth monopolisation. Meaning that socialism, that everyone doesnt want to happen, will most likely need to happen. Because its absurd to just continue to build these societies in capitalist nations built on tiers of wealth, where the inequality has ski rocketed to a point where people dont even have unbiased news, or political representetives who even remember their interests. 

No Im serious, either we say fuck it, and allow the swollen megarich to monopolise, and force them to socialism, they will still be the rich eshelons, socialism =\= communism, socialism comes in many forms and doesnt need to go as far or as deep as the red scare propoganda wants you to think. Or. We do what we did in the 1900s, and repeate the same cycle we already had that lead us to this point, but we know it works.

/s&&> A slightly positive take on it, part of the reason this is happening is because the industry is shifting away from cable, Fox was looking to sell for a reason, and Disney is trying to strengthen it's portfolio for a new streaming service, essentially where the industry is heading.

Right now it sucks *to be Fox*. That’s why they’re selling. It’s really shitty to be a huge media company. Meanwhile, I can name dozens of small companies that are crushing the new media landscape.

E: Read the other responses too. Saying it’s due to “Tax loopholes” is disingenuous. &&Those aren’t loopholes and it is not that simple, at all. The Internal Revenue Code is designed to permit tax free mergers/acquisitions/spinoffs/restructuring, if certain conditions are met. And either way, the tax consequences of M&A are not black and white.

Mergers and acquisitions cause axing all the way up, sometimes the buyer keeps most of their staff, and other times they make people compete for the 1 job in a redundancy scenario. &&Depends on the industry. I worked for large tech companies that made a lot of acquisitions. Cuts were almost always immediate and across all departments. Most cuts were also usually made in the acquired company, because in many cases what the acquiring company is going for is IP (which is not people) and the core group of people who know how to exploit it.
If the acquirer is smart and the acquired company is small enough, they will evaluate each individual from the acquired group and figure out if their talent is worth keeping (the acquired company is generally tasked to do that and generates recommendations - I've even seen people interview to keep their own fucking job). All too often that is not the case.

That's a contact -- let alone getting to the phone interviews or the in-person ones beyond that. And the higher up the chain you go, the more work that's done in the interview process for obvious reasons. I am (I like to hope) top 2/3 in my space of all people. 

About two years ago I came across a great opportunity that would have been easily about 50% more in all areas -- responsibility, pay, position, all of it. Management, effectively director track and a decent shot too; this would have been a particularly prime opportunity. Once we got past about two weeks of daily email discussions with several people:

* Phone interviews: 3 over another week, about 4 hours total
* In-person: 3 over two more weeks, about 3 hours total
* One more phone interview with COO: another phone interview (he was overseas at the time), about 90 minutes.

Came in an extremely close 2nd of something like 15, and they were very upfront about it nearly being a coin toss. 

tl;dr you need to apply like crazy these days but still tailor experiences for each contact, and the higher up you go the more picky they apparently are now, even more than it used to be.&&Absolutely. Centralization of wealth and market power always leads to shittier products and services because consumer demand has less impact on their creative process.

It started with Fox lifting up their skirt and propositioning Disney to merge with them.

*""Hey buddy. You wanna merge with me? I'll make it worth your while.*

And when Disney originally declined, Fox started flaunting other players.

*""Fine! If you won't merge with me, then I'll go merge with Sony. Just think about it; me and Sony... merging.""*

And they are converting Fox stock into Disney stock, which is the mergiest way to acquire.&&You do actually. &&For any non-CPAs reading: the 'basis' of an asset is the recorded value of the asset, for tax purposes.

Your taxable gain is the amount received minus the basis at time of sale. 'Stepping up' the basis means adding an amount to it (usually the amount of the gain that was taxed during the earlier transaction). That means a ""tax free"" merger in which the basis is NOT stepped up will result in taxable gains in the future, when the various assets are sold off.

There's also issues with Sec. 1231 gains/losses and built-in-gains tax, but that's for a whole other comment if it even applies in this case.

If Stargate is to be resuscitated, it would be *Stargate Empire*. The human integration of Asgard and Ancient technology would be woefully incomplete, but the need to extend protection to planets previously protected by the Asgard (now threatened by the Jaffa Empire), as well as the ongoing battle with the Wraith (to protect the humans of Pegasus) would mean continuous over-extension of humanity's reach.

I imagine a good chunk of it is going to spinoffs but I don't see why any of them would have a comparable budget to GoT itself.&&On the flip side. If they manage to pull off more HBO quality content in a higher volume, I'd honestly probably drop Netflix for HBO.&&Ehhhh HBO has consistently made some pretty good shows though. Insecure, The Wire, Sopranos, Girls, High Maintenance and The Night Of (miniseries) are all really good imo- they’re also very different from Game of Thrones and Westworld. I wouldn’t be worried about their new content- it will at least be better than most of the stuff Netflix cranks out. I’d say they have a better background with making successful and diverse IPs.

Unfortunately I am getting laid off today because of a merger with two companies. I have been applying to jobs all week and am getting a little worried.

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys! I am definitely going to be doing a few of these things!&&IT usually isn’t cut that much actually. There’s two different sets of infrastructure now that you have to integrate. You also now have more sites and need the IT people to support them plus more users to support as well. Staff isn’t cut because the A/M adds more IT work. &&Low level IT. Merging the two systems will be a massive multi-year project &&Don't you mean ""murders and executions""?&&When you start getting to core business processes though (to which IT is intertwined obviously) it can really vary. The reason is because you're also importing a lot of their organizational history as well (and nobody wants to be the one who broke something important). For instance you may have support staggered out in such a way that it would cause a massive disruption to immediately consolidate it all into a single group or a small set of groups. 

Where I work, there's been no merger or acquisition but the larger group that's supposed to be subsuming the smaller IT groups is having a hard time doing just that. It's because everyone is already familiar with their old processes and don't want to learn or change their behaviors, proprietary programs they're used to doing work within aren't supported by the central group, normal organizational turf wars, etc. It can go cleanly or it can turn into a mess.

For a worse case scenario for that kind of thing you can actually go outside of IT and into the Solo Cup company which acquired their smaller competitor but eventually found out that they couldn't really integrate the product lines and ended up going massively in debt and being bought out themselves.&&Disney outsources IT&&Executions and murders&&Yeah, I was a PM and watched another person who I worked with (who was senior to me) get shown the door. It was... un-fun. But they also thankfully were given severance and they got to cash out the options they got so I guess it wasn't too too bad.

Yeah, all those folks you named were basically the folks I've watched on my teams over time get canned. Yeesh. One person had been with the company over a decade and I think it was mutual-ish, but still. &&Lol ""shit canned"". I love that phrase even though it has such a bad connotation&&of course you get rid of the senior guys in an acquisition. ""too many chiefs, not enough indians.""

&&It's immediate because it's planned in advance between the time of signing and closing. Those are ""low hanging fruit"" - others will take time to work out as teams are integrated. After the deal is done you still need to run the businesses separately for a few months, practically speaking.
&&Jesus that must be stressful. I get 2 months notice by law. More than a few times friends if mine have had like 2 years advance notice when a department was closed.

I just find it pretty unacceptable to live in such permanent uncertainty.

The current trend seems to be the big corporations are acquired by the bigger ones. We have companies whose size and money on hand is greater than anything we’ve ever seen. They’re only going to get bigger and more focused on the bottom line. &&I'm not sure how this will all play out. However this is going to be a huge boost for Disney and its streaming service it wants to create. Not sure if they will keep Hulu as it is and just dump all Disney content onto it, or if they will rebrand. It all comes down to how much control they actually have. I would suspect they would want to rebrand and Disneyfy it.&&And all of their liabilities.&&This is what I don't get. They already own 30%, and soon 60%.  Why waste all the time and money on a Disney streaming  service when they could just dump them all on hulu. Hell charge $3 more for the Disney package.&&It all comes down to how much control they actually have. With the merger they might have majority, but it depends on contracts what they are allowed to do. I wold hope they just rebrand Hulu. They could also still create their own streaming service and keep hulu as it is. Which would suck for the consumer as that is now 2 subscriptions. &&That's ok, I didn't want the freedom to compare competitors anyway

I feel like I'm the only person in the world that doesn't want this Fox/Disney deal to happen... But fox movies still feel DIFFERENT. Everything that Disney has consumed in its galactus plan to devour the world has turned into a ""Disney formula"" of movies that all feel the same with different characters... And now they're gonna be firing a bunch of people in the transition?! (which I know always happens, don't get at me) that's even fewer different voices to stem the tide of sameness. Do you Disney would jump at the chance to make a Deadpool or Logan? This is BAD for creativity, and bad for the wellbeing of many people and their families. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt too... But I don't feel good about it. &&[deleted]&&Monopolization is scary, and especially on the ISP level. Now with Net Neutrality gone streaming can be seriously hampered very very quickly and effective (oh you want to stream other companies products? Then it's a streaming package you need, that's $69.99/month extra, intro pricing.) which doesn't bode well for us. If streaming can be saved I do see one glimpse of hope:

What if we could get a boost in independent tv and movies? Much like how record companies doesn't have much value to musicians at all today, could this ever scale to products as much more complicated as TV and Movies?

I know there's stuff like TV Shows on youtube (unrelated to youtube red), but they aren't nearly as numerous and fun as they could be.

It's usually much easier to find a job after an acquisition/merger because everyone understands it was for financial reasons rather than if you were fired or suddenly quit.

Good luck with the job search!&&Moreover IT doesn't just get handed over seamlessly, there is a ton of shit that is laid out entirely different.

Back in 2002-2003(ish), in the land formerly known as “Circuit City,” they had this neat little thing called a “commissioned sales staff.”  They also had a nifty thing called “Six Sigma,” a cost-cutting methodology developed by the geniuses at Motorola.

Around 2003, the Six Sigma “black Belts” as they are called, decided they should stop paying their sales staff commission, and go to hourly pay.  They then decided that, for the existing sales staff, that they would freeze you at your “average hourly” (that is, your average commissions / average hours worked).

For most people, this was okay. Same pay, less “work,” per se.

But there was a bunch of sales people who averaged over $15/hour because they sold a LOT of stuff (some sales staff at CC grossed six figures!).

Those people...were promptly laid off and replaced with minimum-wagers.

This decision continues to bring Circuit City much success to this very day.&&It happens more often than you think. 

\- VP's don't like it when people that report to them make twice as much money as they do, which often happens in sales. (The reason Ross Perot left IBM to start EDS was that they had capped his commission for this very reason - he hit the cap first quarter)

\- The hard part of closing the sale and developing a relationship is front-loaded, but significant commission often gets paid over years. If you can fire the salesman and keep the relationship you can save a lot of money.&&You'd be amazed at what stupid decisions people can make.&&Capitalism doesn't work that way. Maybe they   make more money by destroying the firm. Maybe having older employees is bad for the merger. Maybe the new boss wants his nephew to reap the commissions. Is the 21st Century and there is still people that believe in the corporation tale. &&It happens all the time. Tenured sales people that take too much home get cut all the time. I've seen it happen multiple times in different companies I've worked with.&&Read through this thread. Lots of people giving personal experiences of senior employees who bring way more to the table getting laid off.

Ohhhh&&So they get rid of all the talented sales people for the sake of making a short term profit ? I wonder what happened when they realised the people who were being paid 100k plus were doing that for a reason and it's almost like that was somehow linked to their ability to oh I don't know sell the fucking product?

That might save hundreds of thousands of dollars that year which to shareholders is no different to profit in the bank. Except the next year thet lose three times that profit because the new sales people cannot sell nearly as well and all the good sales people are gone and never coming back.

Like Touching The Void, get the actual coach, kids, rescue divers, and any one else willing to talk.  I assume most of the kids may be too traumatized to interview, which is understandable, but get the rescuers, it would be amazing to hear their accounts of the operation.  I'm just saying treat it with respect, it could be amazing.  What do you guys predict?
","There’s a 100% chance Peter Berg directs it. Wahlberg will play the cave. 

Edit: the cave will also have a thick Bostonian accent. &&Just hang tight... It'll either be Peter Berg or Clint Eastwood.&&It's not all happy. Let's not forget [the rescuer who died.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/07/06/who-former-thai-navy-seal-who-died-during-cave-rescue/762526002/)&&Yeah....

[about that...](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/thai-cave-rescue-us-film-crew-on-the-case)&&Directed by Peter Berg

The movie should be about the rescue of the Thai soccer team but it's centered around Mark Wahlberg conducting the mission to save them. #rescueporn &&Mark Wahlberg saves a kid at a time and says “say hi to your mum for me.”

Guaranteed.&&The Rock will play the US navy seal who helps out, but the film will be mostly about him. Scarlet Johansson will play the lead Thai boy, and Tom Hanks will play the coach. It’ll get nominated for several oscars &&i don't know was there a movie about the trapped miners yet? &&So here it goes:

Pan to the soccer team winning the match. Coach, who will get turned into head coach not assistant, convinces the kids to go explore the cave. Kids will be resistant to the idea cause its dangerous, but he will convince them. One will even say the monsoon is coming soon but will get shot down.

when the arrive at the cave their will be danger signs all over the place that the kids will point out but the coach implores them onward. btw all the kids will be cast as 16 but will likely be played by 20 something's.

Rains come and que harrowing and dramatic retreat from flood waters. some kid nearly getting swept away but getting saved at the last second.

Kids missing maybe a scene of family members freaking out to hit us in the feels.

Enter our hero, Saman Kunan, who will be retconned to be a childhood friend of the coach, or even better was a teammate of the coach and had a near miss in the cave when they were kids,  takes it upon himself to save them all.

with the help of some british buddies he scouts the cave and finds the kids. Reports his finding to the government. Rescue plans start getting drawn up and eventually they will insert some government functionary to be the bad guy. The bad guy will keep playing up the risks of extraction and keep holding out having them hunker down till the monsoons end. Good guy scientist shows our hero how if the government plans go ahead there is a big risk everyone dies.

Confrontation ensues but government functionary digs in his heels saying its too risky. Our hero and his diving buddies refuse to take no for an answer and sneak into the cave to rescue the kids on their own.

Rescue goes well initially but eventually sharp rocks damage one of the tanks so they are one short of what they need. Our hero gives his tank to the kid, and gives a dramatic I can make it ill hold my breath speech. It looks like hes going to make it, you swear you can see the daylight ahead, but he looks behind and sees a kid struggling. he goes back and gets the kid to safety but gets a big lungful of water for his trouble.

diver buddies frantically try to save him but hes gone. heartwarming family reunions get tempered with sadness of the realization our hero has fallen. super sad funeral scene ensues, followed by triumphant statue dedicated outside the cave with speech by thai king.

end credits.&&Owen Wilson as the expert british diver, Leo as the coach, Scarjo as one of the thai boys&&If it's an American production someone in that movie is going to utter one or all of the following phrases:

Hot American wife to Navy Seal: ""You better come back to me, ya hear?""

""That cave messed with the wrong country!""

""Let's lock and swim!""

Staring incredulously into the cave: ""My god....""

And scene. &&they already are, wich is so stupid, it just sounds oportunistic to me, its like vulturistic journalism, yes everything turned out ok, at least for the victims, unfortunetaly one diver died, but fuck me its just so dumb and its only to make money out of it. 
&&Hope not&&How many white people can they get to pretend to be Thai to star in the movie?

Also, how many references to sex work will the movie try to glamorize?

&&How cool it'd be if it was an original Thai production instead of an overly dramatic, formulaic American movie with a fall from grace, redemption and a romantic subplot, all in name of ""character development""&&Starring Edward James Olmos. ""How do I reach these kids."" &&Scarlett Johansson will play every member of the soccer team.&&and it will somehow star Tom Hanks&&""In memory of Saman Kunan""&&With Elon Musk thrown in there as the hero  who saves the day. (Sponsored by Tesla)&&Know what I would like to see?

Someone make this movie, use unknown actors and stick hard to everyones nationality in the movie.

If somoene was an American in real life - American actor, someone Thai in real life - Thai actor.&&tbh I'm just looking forward to seeing which popular white Hollywood is actor is going to play the Navy SEAL who rescues the soccer team.&&Absolutely, the whole thing wrote itself! Here in Thailand for the past 16 days the whole country went through an emotional roller coaster, 9 days of hopelessness, 1 day of extreme happiness and hope, 3 days of realising the water level is going up and the oxygen is going down and the relief of the rescued of all 13 people! 

And unfortunately, sadly, we have lost a brave hero Saman Gunan (RIP)who sacrificed himself to save the boys.

Everything in this story just wrote itself like a movie.

I'd really like to see what Hollywood will create from this.

&&Eh, it's one of those things where I think ""there doesn't need to be a story about this."" Even with respect, there comes a particular uneasy feeling adapting something like this event to the screen. Let's just be grateful the operation was successful and that there are brave people who helped make it so.&&I say we don't&&ITT: the same joke hundred of times...&&Everyone will be white.... unless they throw a badguy in the mix. He will either be asian or arab&&So is Marky Mark gonna play the coach or Elon?&&Yes.  Let's monetize all the things!  Who cares about the personal tragedy and loss of life.  We need money and popcorn.

Fucking pathetic.&&Yup they will. And I won't be seeing it. &&Sean Bean plays Saman Kunan, Thai Seal who died.&&Starring Scarlett johansen as male Thai coach &&Starring James Franco as ~~the coach~~ ~~one of the boys~~ all of the boys.&&There will also be a love interest.  The main person in charge will be having some relationship issue with the spouse.  Once again, work pulls him/her away from family.  Their kid is barely hanging on academically and socially.   If only that parent would try to save his family and kid instead of somebody else's.  But in the end, after the rescue, they remember just how important family and kids are.  They embrace in a long tearful hug as credits start to roll. &&The question is - will Elon Musk be played as a eager billionaire looking for the free PR, or the righteous try hard that did what he could, but ultimately was useless.&&The coach will be played by Matt Damon. &&Hollywood will make a Thai movie with no Thai boys lol. &&Can't *wait* for the whole cast to be white people.&&They already recruited Scarlett Johanson as the soccer coach&&I'm sure Hollywood will find a way to hamfist a white dude/American into a protagonist role for it&&Too much asian masculinity for the Hollywood execs. Execs will have to make 7 out of 13 of the kids asian girls. The rest are white children so they can stroke their white male power fantasy over asian women while emasculating the Thai coach and making him the scapegoat. 

Queue in Marky Mark ""I beat Vietnamese guys and call them chinks"" Wahlberg to flex his muscles and save the day.&&Starring Elon Musk as Elon Musk&&A new story by M Night Shyamalaladingdong.&&S long as they don’t turn it into a pile of pooh like The 33. I couldn’t even get through that movie it was so bad. &&Title: WTF Are We Doing Here&&It's a winner, a made for tv movie winner.   It has a young boys soccer team. Has an initiation rite, a soccer coach that egged them on to get into the cave, boys who want to prove themselves. The rescue; a death of a rescuer; sports related; military related; set in an exotic location; moonsoon season. A B list white movie star--whom movie executives think audiences will identify with better in an asian related film--playing the role as the australian doctor. a maniacal foreign businessman with a home owners rescue device looking for product placement on the  home shopping network; a feel good ending where the rescued kids get a parade thrown for them in toronto. throw in [rachel ward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5xnyClQ_kk&t=39m) for a cameo. i'm sure ABC would be all over this.


why toronto, well, they can't get visas for a new york parade, but that's not going to affect the movie.&&Of course. As if white people would pass up the opportunity to cash in on PoC's suffering &&Alright, who is Tom Hanks playing this time?&&And it'll star Tom Hanks. &&I’d prefer a documentary, than a movie with embellishments &&I was just saying to the wife yesterday night that Tom Hanks should play the coach.&&What do you guys predict?

That Clint Eastwood would secure the rights and have the actual kids play themselves with Bradley Cooper reprising his role as Chris Kyle.&&Can't wait to see the CGI cave monsters and the satanic underground civilization! &&Hopefully Robert Downey Jr. plays Elon Musk! &&And here's the movie poster  
  
https://i.redd.it/898rud3jv5911.jpg&&If it were up to me I'd make a documentary about it using existing footage, as I'm sure there's plenty. I'd much rather see it in a documentary format than a film, and it would tell the story, and then we'd catch up to people in a few years time, seeing where they are now. It's an amazing story of hope and the goodness of humanity, I'm just scared that going through something like Hollywood will ruin it and tell the story for the wrong reasons. Also I would call it ""Brilliant"",  the words of the diver who found them after confirming they were all alive.&&Told from the perspective of the 1 white guy on scene, much like that Ewan McGregor film “The Impossible” that showed how inconvenient it was that the Tsunami ruined the white people’s holiday. &&And not a single actor will be Asian... &&It should be about Elon Musk and how he saved everyone and built a submarine to do it, and i would like to suck hes peenies, also i think he is secretly ironman, maybe that could also be in the movie. Good i would commit seppuku with Elons penis if somebody gave me the chance.&&The Rock will play the soccer coach&&and I won't have any interest in seeing it&&I am not trying to be negative, or Racist... but I thought about this and I am going to say... No they wont.
Because Hollywood would never go out and find 12 young Asian kid actors and then another 10 or so adult Asian actors as leads.

Unfortunately and unfairly... Hollywood will first ask ""Can we make these kids or some of the leads into white kids?""
And when they cant, then they will scrap this and not make the movie.

I think about the movie about those guys trapped in the collapsed mineshaft a year or two ago, and that was a pretty good movie I thought... yet it was in and out of the theater in like 2 days... and that had some GOOD Hispanic actors in it.

Sadly or unfairly... this movie will never be made.&&My son is half Thai and only 10 weeks old. I should probably start planning to exploit him and this might be the perfect opportunity! &&Wrong!  Then those kids would never get away!&&[deleted]&&“Hey Thai soccer player it’s me cave...how’s your ma doin?”&&RDJ starring as the other Tony Stark, Elon Musk.&&Naaa...  OP's mum will lay on her back and play the cave.&&Wahlberg will say that if he had been there, they would never have gotten lost. &&Or Clint Eastwood is gonna have all the kids go back in the cave and play as themselves.&&I came here to say exactly this. Peter Berg and Marky Mark were first to mind. &&We want the kids to keep all their eyes, let's keep Wahlberg out of this&&Dwanye Johnson will play the coach and it will be called The Rock and a Hard place.&&[deleted]&&WRONG!...The cave is black, dangerous, and sexy......Denzel is the cave.&&All joking aside this is sadly likely to be true, all the crazy supremacist whitewashing in movies. Remember that Asian Tsunami movie several years ago? Asians dying in the background and the movie starred all white people (as white tourists).  All the British news agencies keep repeating the British divers, it’s so silly how much white media is into propping up white supremacism &&Daniel Day Lewis will play the monsoon...&&Cave Mahky Mahk will make sure one of the kids loses  an eye&&Wouldn't be the first time he fucked up an Asian person...








/s &&I can see the camera shaking already.&&As the boys are swimming out, you hear the voice of Mark Walberg, as the cave, cheer them on, ""swim my boys, the light will guide you"" and then they pop out of his cave hole.&&But in Peter Berg’s film Mark Wahlberg singlehandedly saves all the kids. Also, the kids are white.  &&I wonder which Thai boy Tom Hanks will play.&&No way it'll be Clint Eastwood, there's no way to shoehorn American patriotism into it&&Don't count out my man Baltasar Kormákur. He made The Deep,  Everest, and Adrift recently so he is no stranger to those survival type movies. Especially ones involving water. &&Jesus Christ, I can just see Clint approaching the actual kids: “I know you might be traumatized now, but if you’ll take a cool half mil to pretend to be yourself in front of a camera...”&&In the Clint Eastwood version, there're only American Heroes doing the rescue, but not before they have to bully the Thai government into letting them rescue the kids.&&Elon Musk played by Tony Stark, I mean RDJ.&&Unfortunately that will inevitably just play as perfect time for dramatic effect in a film and will not at all display the gravity of his sacrifice. They’d have to dedicate the whole movie and a lot of the proceeds to his family and future cave dive rescues for it to be even remotely acceptable. &&Played by Kevin Costner. He has aquatic experience from Waterworld and water rescue experience from The Guardian. And dying experience from Man of Steel. &&I would say that the movie should focus on his sacrifice.&&I hate to be that guy, but.... The fact that he died will make it even more appealing to movie studios&&Played by Sean Bean. &&> ""I see this as a major Hollywood film with A-list stars,"" **Michael Scott**, managing partner of Pure Flix films, told AAP in Chiang Rai.

After Threat Level Midnight I could see this being a huge success. &&As someone who works professionally in ""Hollywood"", I really wish there was more clearly defined idea in the public conscious of what that actually is. As far as I'm concerned these guys are not Hollywood. They are bottom feeders who pray upon the Christian market by churning out absolute rubbish ""faith based"" films. In fact they aren't really even producers. They are sales agents. Someone makes a faith based film and comes to them to help sell it, generally that means to some streaming service or Red Box. Occasionally it means to a bigger, more legit distributor who will actually get the film on a handful of screens if they think it'll make a little money. They have no real working relationship with any legit Hollywood studios, producers, writers

&&>Scott believes the cave rescue story, which will be centred around the two British divers who discovered the boys, is the perfect project for Pure Flix.

OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE &&""Pure Flix is based in Scottsdale, Arizona and Los Angeles and describes itself as a faith and family production and distribution film company.""

Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me dog.&&Oh, its a shame that the story is being lost on a studio like pure flix this could've been cool if done by someone who knew what they were doing. &&Awesome. Traumatized children, exhausted volunteers, tragedy in the dead diver, traumatized parents, etc........Let’s go big everyone about making a fucking movie about it less than 24 hours after they’re rescued /s&&Pure Flix doesn't count&&I'm hoping for Jerry Bruckheimer. We can have slow-motion shots of little kids around the world playing soccer in solidarity, and parents crying, set to an epic score by Trevor Rabin.&&It should be centered around the coach played by Scarlet Johannson.&&And Mark is simultaneously the Thai Seal who dies trying to get the kids air.&&And all the kids will be speaking in fluent English throughout the whole movie &&And instead of a story about kids trapped in a FUCKING CAVE, it becomes more about mark walhberg and his bullshit relationship problems with his estranged wife who “doesn’t understand what it’s like to be part of a team that depends on you night and day.”&&[deleted]&&""Are you here to rescue us, sir?""

""Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself.""&&""Say Thaï to your mom for me"" FTFY

Various producers paid various miners for the exclusive rights to their stories causing huge conflicts over who could be portrayed in which films. 

Many of the friendships among the miners we're permanently shattered.&&yep and it wasn't very good. They made the dumb decision of hiring well known actors and have them speak english.&&The miners themselves started writing their story while they were still in the cave... and then the movie included that part. It was very meta.

It was a very bizarre story. It went from a rescue mission to fighting over who had the rights to tell their story.&&>Kids missing maybe a scene of family members freaking out to hit us in the feels.

&&Thank you, i cant believe we are the minority opinion here.

But that’s not going to happen because the film will fall short without a lead White actor. Which is exactly why this thread is full of tongue-in-cheek jokes about who’s going to be cast instead. &&The all white soccer team.  I fixed it for you.&&Tom Cruise.  The lone Seal to find them.  The lone Seal to get them out.  I He will not use O2 tanks as he will hold his breath the whole time.&&Yeah, I understand the pessimism going around, but it's an incredible story that writes itself and deserves to be told. The most important thing at this point is getting a movie that's accurate.

I know he gets a lot of hate, but my personal vote for director if it is someone ~~American~~ (well, I guess *western* would be a better term) would be Mel Gibson. He's the one I would trust the most to use an actual Thai cast and even use the proper language.&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&No, no. Only the main characters will be white (maybe throw Benedict Wong in there). If Hollywood is feeling extra diverse, they'll throw in a half-white, half-Thai actor who looks ethnically ambiguous. But most of the background characters are gonna be Thai. Go Hollywood!&&You forgot the part where they throw in an Asian girl for diversity, who then falls for a white guy&&Thai, from the southern provinces.&&Of course. The average western movie goer can't feel empathy for a group of Asians. The kids have to be white. Though there will be an evil Thai government official who says that the kids are already dead, and anyway, they can't afford a rescue operation, they have a big festival coming up.

But Dwayne Johnson is an ex Navy Seal who lives in Thailand now, and he overhears that some brave American kids are stuck in a cave, so he gets his pals together and mounts a rescue operation.

Then Thailand becomes the 51st State, and creepy old guys all over America rejoice. &&""Here's the pitch: I just want to make a *small* change of location to a cave in Kentucky and lots of focus shots with American flags in them as we are introduced to a quiet little town in the middle of a veterans' parade. When one of the vet's kids gets trapped in a cave due to the incompetence of their tropishly stoner baseball coach (played by James Franco) it's up to a team of Navy SEALs lead by Mark Wahlberg to rescue them. We'll get one of the black actors to play the best friend who dies during the operation. Oh and the villain is trying to build a rocket building factory over the cave so he's trying to sabotage the rescue and make it so the land will be cheaper after they close the cave due to tragedy. He's on a timeline to make a deal too so he's always going to have a cellphone and look angry. We'll call him something like ""Elroy Odorous"" and have him played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The movie ends with the media condemning him, maybe even have a scene with the cops arresting him for something, I don't know. And can we make sure the last scene has a big flag in it? I want them all in BDUs and saluting. Merica', thank you gentlemen.""&&> But in Peter Berg’s film Mark Wahlberg 

As soon as someone said ""I bet they'll make a movie out of this"", my first thought was that Mark Wahlberg better start working on a british or thai accent to prepare for the part. 

Imagine being just handsome enough to be a leading man, but also ordinary enough that you can play any Joe Anyguy role believably.&&Every person on the team, coach and kids, played by Marky Mark Wahlberg. Donnie Wahlberg plays the rescue team lead. Paul Wahlberg plays the rarely seen head coach. In the end, they celebrate being rescued by eating hamburgers. &&They'll also make the soccer coach female so that there'll be an exotic asian love interest there for the white hero who saved all the kids. &&The tall one.&&Team America: World Police drives a submarine through the wall in the final minutes of the film, saving the kids and coach. ""America, Fuck Yeah"" blasts over the end credits.&&Easy - plenty of americans think the Navy Seals involved are American anyway so he'll just do it with Americans playing the Seals.&&Which is kinda sad, because Letters from Iwo Jima was great, partially because it didn't indulge in Eastwood's typical jingoism. &&If Musk had managed to save one kid, that would have been enough for Eastwood. He would them write the movie, ignoring all the non-American help and have the American Innovator save all 12 kids because of his American Exceptionalism&&Everest made me ""NOPE"" away from Mt. Everest..... forever. &&I have kind of imagining this movie.  They could have some really cool moments in it.  

Imagine, the first time the kids loose there light.  Instead of improvising so we can see the actors, just go to a black screen.   Only audio.  Just black in the screen.

The next time we see the kids is when the diver pops his head up.

Now, if we see it from the divers perspective - which would be awesome - the kids are becoming bone thing, shielding there eyes and just look like shit.  (last time we saw them they where physical fit.  There is no inbetween shots)

BUT... if we see it from there perspective then the light should be blinding.&&What a strange idea that was. &&It'll be the lowpoint of the plot, right before the miraculous rescue against all odds.&&ACT I: Problem present itself (kids trapped in cave).

ACT II: Protagonists attempt to solve the problem and suffer demoralizing defeat (diver dies and more rain coming).

Probably it would be shot in English and there'd be a Thai dub for those audiences (which is how The 33 was done). Nor was The 33 whitewashed. While they did not cast Chileans they didn't cast Caucasians either.

*Juliette Binoche and Antonio Banderas with the former President of Chile Sebastián Piñera in La Moneda Palace, Santiago, Chile. Antonio Banderas, who portrays ""Super"" Mario Sepúlveda, is the public face for the miners who sent videos to the rescuers to update them on the miners' condition. The actual Sepúlveda expressed his enthusiasm and approval towards having Banderas in the role. Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro plays Laurence Golborne, Minister of Mining. On 17 June 2013, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez had joined to lead the cast of the film, but later left due to scheduling conflicts with American Idol. She was replaced in the strong female central role by Juliette Binoche.*

*On 10 January 2014, Cote de Pablo joined the cast of the film; she plays the wife of one of the trapped miners. On 27 January 2014, Gabriel Byrne joined the cast of the film, to play the role of Andre Sougarret, the engineering genius who masterminded the miraculous rescue of the 33 trapped miners. Next day on 28 January, Bob Gunton joined the cast of the Chilean miner filming, then shooting in Colombia; he plays the role of Chilean President Sebastián Piñera.*

0/5 I want my money back &&I skimmed through it, but one scene really stood out:     

""Fuck!""      
""He's septic!""     
""You don't know what that means!""      
""Fuck!""      
""You OK, bro?""      
""My car is gone!"" (he's lying in bed as he says this)      
""It's cool, it's a Honda""      
""Hyundai!"" (mispronounced as ""hun-die"")      
""Fuck!""      

They clearly had some expert script doctors on this one.&&""Accidentally on purpose"" - Louise&&Why can't they make mistakes like this with movies people actually want to see?&&Aaaaand it's been taken down.&&Why tf does the person uploading the trailer to youtube also have access to the full unreleased film??&&Mirror plz&&This movie is absolutely awful. &&Im suprised that they did not think ""hmm this 1.5 to 2 min trailer takes quite long to upload, let me doublecheck this"". Or of course they just started the upload and walked and walked away. Either way a perfect example of an intern mistake.&&Fuck me that was awful.&&The fact that it is up for more than 10 minutes means they did it on purpose. &&Oh wow, its no wonder why they uploaded it. It would be stealing to make people pay for this trash.&&This must be heartbreaking for anyone who put work into making the film&&[deleted]&&Okay so what is khali the killer about &&What the hell.&&Longest trailer I've ever seen.&&Thats because otherwise no one will watch it.&&Perhaps it was supposed to be a straight-to-video or in this case streaming release but they forgot to flip the 'pay-per-view' flag.&&I want a refund.&&The thing that gives it away as being a fake marketing stunt is that the video is age restricted as requested by the uploader.&&Just finished this a minute ago, and the link on YT is now disabled. Despite some of the other comments here, personally I really enjoyed it. Quite an unexpected treat. EDIT: Having had more of a look it seems this film is almost universally disliked, at least as far as this thread goes. I thought it was quite heartwarming and also funny in some places... Faint praise I know but it was alright. &&This is their new marketing strategy... show the whole movie and sell tickets to see the trailer.

Could work...&&I think it’s removed, anybody download it? Or have a new link?&&... How?

... Like why would the team that handles uploading trailers to social media even have a compiled digital copy of an unreleased film? >.>&&You rlly have to think though. Did they do this accidentally, or is it just another really smart piece of gorilla marketing? &&Anyone got a mirror? lol&&> takes 36 hours to upload

""This is normal"" - Sony probably&&😂&&Meh, the trailer gave away the whole movie...&&Ouch. I hope they catch the mistake before someone reuploads&&I suspect that this was set to upload automatically since it went up at midnight-ish west coast time and someone just picked the wrong file beforehand. It's the day before a holiday and still only about 630AM in CA so it appears no one has noticed the gaffe. Of course, it could be entirely intentional but giving away an entire movie for free is an odd marketing ploy.&&No accident. They're pretending to have uploaded accidentally, to drum up interest. And it appears to be working.&&Finders keepers&&yeah they accidentally had the movie in a perfect format for youtube.&&yeah I don't believe that this was a mistake..&&Let me save everyone some time, don't watch it. I waisted 1hr 29 minutes of my life&&What's interesting is the data they can collect off this. When people stopped watching, parts people skipped, and the obvious ones like quantity of views, demographics, etc.&&Considering it's six hours later and it's still live even though it's on the front page, I'm gonna go ahead and say ""PR Stunt""&&“Accidentally”&&""Damn, YouTube is slow again today""&&Did the person uploading not notice the upload time? “Man, my computer sucks!”&&They just took it down.&&Sony just tried to manipulate us into thinking that was by accident. Look at all the attention it is getting now. &&Is the movie really that bad? I mean, its not The GodFather, but i'm about 30 minutes in and its not bad for free at least.&&This seems like a smart marketing ploy for a terrible movie. Doesn't look like its had great reviews. But fuck if I don't want to see it now that I watched half before it got removed. &&Every time something like this happens I assume it's because the studio knew the movie was going to fail and wanted to save face.&&Sony while uploading the trailer: ""Why is this taking so long? ""&&So is this movie about the great Khali or not?&&Sony about to hunt you boi &&Well they took it down...

Anybody want to tell me how it ends?&&How do you make that fuck up and not notice? There had to be like several checks on YouTube alone before the video goes public that should have tipped someone off.&&“A hit man who has decided to retire takes on one last job, but his careful plans begin to fall apart when he develops empathy for one of his targets.”

So original /s&&anddddd. you killed it.  :/&&The director Jon Matthews is a great guy. He wrote, directed, and produced this film himself. Sony bought distribution rights and fudged up (or did they?)

His thoughts on this \/

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkx61JIDeOY/?hl=en&taken-by=jonmatthewswv&&Hey Bob, why is this 2 minute trailer taking 5 hours to upload? I dont know Gary maybe our wifi is down. &&did no one grab it before they deleted it?? why is it not upvoted here ffs&&They probably reviewed the movie, and realized it was SO fucking bad, the publicity from ""accidentally releasing"" it would be greater.&&They must have bandwith if they didn't notice that the upload took a bt longer...&&""accidentally""&&Ignorant people in this thread. This is the trailer. The whole movie is 34 hours long.&&LOL..someone is crying right now.&&I'd guess that in order for the automated ContentID system to work, a copy of content is required from the content owner.  

Surprised that an institutional interface would be an ordinary YouTube upload, but perhaps it is and such content is merely flagged as private....No need to build and maintain a system to do it twice.       &&should I watch it? Ive never seen nor heard of this movie before. I downloaded it just in case.&&Does anyone have a download link for the trailer? &&doesn't seem like a movie worth watching though&&That's some guerrilla marketing right there&&for what it’s worth when you’re uploading content for a company like Sony across multiple platforms, you don’t use the normal upload screen. you pay a service to blast your content out to multiple websites. so for everyone picturing an intern staring at the YouTube upload screen for four hours, that’s prolly not how this went down. unless this is a PR stunt, they probably published the wrong content to the wrong platform &&Accidentally? This is the best press this movie has gotten so far.&&accident or deliberate? looks terrible from the skips I saw&&Smart move? The exposure this story will get will generate more interest in the movie than a trailer, for sure.&&""accidentally""

They will probably make more money off it on YouTube then just pushing it to amazon.  &&My head is scratching and shaking. How did that even happen? Didn't they realize how big that download was?&&This stars **Richard Cabral**, who was in all three seasons of ""American Crime"" on ABC.  All his ink is real, he's got a fascinating story...

[How Former Gang Member Richard Cabral Went From Prison To Prime Time](https://www.npr.org/2015/09/16/440516605/how-former-gang-member-richard-cabral-went-from-prison-to-prime-time)&&Man oh Man. Every couple of years something comes out from Sony that shows how incompetent of a company they are. There was the 2005 Sony BMG Rootkit scandal. There was the PSN hack of 2011. Then there was the infamous 2014 Sony Pictures Hack which cost them $35 million. Now this stupidity. Even though not really in the same ball park, it seems like Sony is being run by a bunch of amateurs buffoons.

Edit: Spelling&&Wow thanks sony, this literally ruined the whole trailer for me&&Aaaand downloaded. &&YouTube premium is finally paying off!&&Based on the reviews and the fact that it's still up. I'm guessing this was done on purpose.&&> Chapter 1: Grandma and Justin Bieber. 

I don't think there was any accident with giving this movie out for free...&&This cannot be an accident. Even if the movie isn't going to release in theaters, it's file isn't your typical compressed-to-death torrent download. It's a motherfucking DVD/BluRay master, meaning that it's file size in GB should be in the triple digits, and the file itself in a non-uploadable format. &&Is this Sony's way of f**king up the director and writer?&&Wanna know why this is a bullshit marketing move? Check out the thumbnails for the rest of the channel. They're all personalized. 

This video has nothing. Nada. They didn't even go through the effort of making it look legit by uploading the thumbnail they would have put on the actual trailer.&&No, you don't accidentally upload an entire movie instead of a trailer. &&i told you its ""copy of copy of copy of copy of khali final 3 trailer.wmv"", not ""copy of copy of copy of khali final 5 asdadada.wmv"".. stupid interns&&Literally just went down&&Just got taken down &&Video is finally unavailable. Damn, LOL. I guess they keep the trailers and the final in the same folder, haha.&&Can we do this now with a movie worth watching ?&&Well it's gone now&&Well Sony just lost a metric fuck ton of money. How many of you here downloaded it before it was killed. &&How do you accidentally upload an entire fucking movie? Do those people not check the size of the file or anything?&&3/10&&It's a publicity stunt for some crappy movie that came out last year. Ignore it.&&“Why’s the fucker taking so long to upload?”&&I once went to see one of the Hobbit movies in IMAX. During the trailers, a Star Trek trailer came on. Cool! I like Star Trek. 5 minutes later, I'm thinking ""Jesus this is a long trailer"". 10 minutes later. Um, am I at the right place? 15 minutes later. Well, I guess I went to the wrong theater by accident, past the point of no return now. Time to settle in and enjoy Star Trek. 20 minutes later and Star Trek ends and my movie begins. Turns out I went to some ""sneak peek"" showing without even knowing it. Major confusion. Ended up that the camera malfunctioned for Hobbit too. Not the best theater experience.&&I dunno. I watched it, and i admit that it wasn't great but also wasn't the worst film out there. I realized after about 8 minutes in it was a weird combo of drama, and comedy. I'd recommend it as background noise for someone.&&Cant even check its comments anymore.&&Marvel did this with Toy Story 2&&""Accidentally"" upload 30+gb file instead of a 1 or 2 gb trailer and no one noticed? SeemsGood&&Fuck sony&&When I was like 5 I was watching a Disney movie and it had a trailer or commercial for lion king on the disc. My papa was fast forewording and it seemed to be taking a while and he said ""they put the whole damn movie on there"" and since I couldn't understand things like sarcasm or hyperbole I thought for like 6 years that Aladdin or whatever had the entire lion king movie on it.&&trailer.mp4

fullmovie.mp4

WHICH ONE IS IT???&&Unfortunately, marvel studios has very competent people working there for their films.&&With horrible reviews and no press, this was obviously a stunt&&I started watching the first 15 minutes, planned on watching the whole thing. I paused it to go downstairs for water and cane back and it was pulled... oh well, whatever. &&Jim why is it taking so long to upload this trailer.

I don't know man, net-neutrality? &&Movie looks like shit. Too bad because richard cabral is a good actor. He was great in american crime.&&""accidentally"" &&I worked on this movie! Totally bizarre seeing this post haha, I assumed it had crashed and burned in obscurity. &&How do you ""accidentally"" upload a whole movie?&&Man this is taking a while to upload&&PR stunt.&&when your internet is so fast you didnt know you were uploading the whole movie instead of the trailer.&&Please don't waste you're time watching. I just wasted 2 hours

Edit: Annnnnd it's gone!&&It was all a ploy by Sony. Before this, nobody even knew what this was. Well played, Sony.&&maybe it was intentional PR for them  &&Do you want to lose money? Because that's how you lose money&&Tony... it was the only way.

Edit: Stark to Tony.&&I tried. It's not worth it.&&I skimmed it. Looks amateurish to be generous. &&This isn't a big expensive mistake, that's for sure. This movie looks like it has about $3 of set budget. 0$ of CG. Let's not even talk about famous actors that Sony paid for. 

I'd bet $20 that calling it a trailer and going 'OOPS' was just a publicity stunt to get people to watch the movie for spin-off profits because the movie sales are just too weak.&&Its okk (15 min in) My brother is an aspiring actor and I suppose I should get used to watching these sort of films lol&&2real4me&&I bet they did this ""mistake"" just for free PR&&Just watched it. It wasn't' worth watching free. &&[deleted]&&127 hours&&Did you r/didthemath ? Is that the same proportion of a trailer that is ~ 1.30mins long for a ~ 90 min movie? 

Edit: why the downvotes? Just asking a question &&Kind of like the trailer in Pootie Tang?&&Fuck.&&Well there's Ambiance for you.&&Haha, reminds me of the ending to Pootie Tang.&&Ackshually, they have rules in place to define what a trailer is and what maximum length they are allowed&&Well the thumbnail image that YouTube chose could suggest that it's a Bollywood movie... and they're like 5 hours long, so...&&The pootie tang approach&&Damn Sony Marketing&&damn it, now i can't watch the movie.&&Someone needs to tell them to stop giving the whole movie away...&&They could have uploaded the entire *Primter* movie as the trailer, and I still wouldn't know what was going on.&&Clearly, and it worked. Now we know about this movie.&&It's a PR [stunt](https://www.cnet.com/news/whoops-sony-uploads-entire-film-khali-the-killer-to-youtube-instead-of-trailer/) for sure&&It's an accounting stunt so they can blame piracy and accidental release for the bad sales.&&Sony is stacked full of geniuses, how else would they have the vision to create such classics as the Emoji Movie, Ghostbusters Reboot, or the 19th installment of the Underworld or Resident Evil franchise?&&No way this is a mistake. That just doesn't happen. 

When movies are sent to theaters they are in DCP format which can be 100s of GB. The only way this could have happened is the trailer editor hands a hard drive to the social media guy and the social media guy searches and finds a file for a cut meant for internal distribution. SONY pictures doesn't just have ""movietrailer_yt.mov, FINALFINALFINALCUT_3_Revised.mov"" right next to each other.&&Yeah. Except joke's on them. I downloaded it while it was up. Haha! :D&&Its removed now&&the only redeeming factor is I really like the main character so far.

The rest of it is average at best, cheesy-stereotypical at worst &&Why . . . why would you watch it?&&I was kind of wondering if it was actually worth the watch. Almost watched a trailer, but it was like a hour and a half long. What’s it pretty much about?&&Not sure about the full movie, but I watched a 1 hour 30 minute long trailer of the movie and it sucked.&&Nah. I want a refund! &&You have Youtube Premium?&&I still want a refund.&&It's still up.  I can't help but think they'd realize their mistake pretty quickly and take it down if it was an accident.&&I remember The Wolverine origins movie got leaked by the tec company and after seeing a bit of it I went and saw it in the cinema. 


I always wondered if it helped the movie sales or worsened them. &&I also can't imagine this being an accident. I mean, someone had to go through files looking for the trailer (choosing) and then see how long it takes to upload (waiting). I mean, this could have easily been avoided. YouTube would've said 'X minutes/hours left to upload'. Not rocket science to know you're uploading the whole movie.&&3.8 outta 10 movie on IMDB, makes some sense to try and drum up publicity.&&It's been at least 3 hours and it's still up. Doesn't seem like they're too worried about it. &&This isn't even the first time Sony has done this - they did the same thing with Amazing spiderman 2  shortly after it's cinematic release. &&Bingo. No way someone is going to make this mistake, it doesn't make sense.&&Been 7 hours and it's still not pulled.  Not an accident.&&No, it was supposed to be released on DVD&&Video unavailable on YouTube. Put that shit on download somewhere. &&Do you still have it ?&&Mind to upload it somewhere? Youtube link is gone&&Yeah the movie gives too much away.&&Imagine having internet so good you can upload the entire movie faster than you can realise what you did.&&Maybe they uploaded it and then fell asleep

/s&&Edit: Finished the whole thing. I don't think any part of this movie works. The attempts at running gags don't work. The drama doesn't work. Trying to make the main character sympathetic doesn't work. The ending definitely does not work. I'm not sure what this movie is trying to accomplish, but it doesn't do it.

~~I'm a good way into the movie. It's definitely up there as one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. I hope it gets taken down so I don't have to finish it.~~&&Maybe not...no one was gonna watch the movie anyways, so perhaps the ad revenue from Youtube will make them more money than the shitty dvds in the one dollar bargain bin at the supermarket.&&Or someone was pissed off at their boss/Sony and posted it on purpose. Uploading a 1 hr. 30 min. film to YouTube takes significantly longer than a 2 min. trailer, so I doubt it was accidental.&&Are there really people here who think this was accident?

""Whoopsie we made a fucko and uploaded 90 minutes instead of 2""&&It's bullshit viral marketing&&[deleted]&&You do good work, my friend. &&Only made it a couple minutes myself....who the hell watches shit like this?&&I hope that's on a scale of 1-1000. &&It's not that unbelievable. It could be as simple as one file called kalithekillermovie and another called kalithekillermovietrailer and the wrong one getting sent to the upload guy, who should have checked but didn't bother. &&[deleted]&&They probably have really good internet&&Why are these kinds of goofups always the intern's mistake? I've seen people with more skill and experience screw up in the most idiotic ways.&&Why does the intern have access to the whole movie? There is zero reason for this to happen. Once you upload you have to make it public before people can see it.&&I got about 30 minutes through before giving up..  it is definitely a movie made for a certain taste in film. 

The reviews are either 10s or 1s... not really much inbetween!&&Having watched enough of it, I'm pretty sure those people were already broken inside long before production wrapped.&&A killer named Khali.&&If it's online, it's already too late&&It's still online. Pretty sure after 6 hours we can say it's not an accident.&&Pretended? You can watch it yourself now.

If giving the movie away to people who watched it within the first ~6 hours is a marketing strategy, it's a hell of a risky one&&Haha just as I copy the hyperlink too. At least I got to scroll to the ending &&Reduce any book, movie, or play down to one sentence and you're going to see a lot of repetition. Harry Potter was not an original story idea, but the execution of it was quite good.&&One of my favorite little details about Infinity War, this line is actually the one and only time Strange refers to him as ""Tony"" - after watching Iron Man and co. fight Thanos some 14 million odd times, I guess he grew to respect him and figured they were on a first name basis.&&I usually give movies 30 minutes. I got almost 5 minutes in and gave up. &&It's almost like this is a viral marketing gimmick for a film they didn't expect to generate a lot of buzz on its own or something.&&Isn't this ""accidental"" upload of the whole movie a perfect excuse for shady accounting? If the movie is not worth it, then this seems like a great way to mitigate the loss.&&It all comes together in the last 5mins. Totally worth it.&&Shit....let's call it what it is, this movie is a dumpster fire&&It's definitely a PR [stunt](https://www.cnet.com/news/whoops-sony-uploads-entire-film-khali-the-killer-to-youtube-instead-of-trailer/) 

(The movie was released in 2017 so why upload a ""trailer"" now?)&&> calling it a trailer and going 'OOPS' was just a publicity stunt

I don't know what I'm talking about, but seems quite impossible for this to happen by accident, for many many reasons.&&What if it's actually 1300 hours long and just feels like it's 130 hours long?&&I'm still bummed that they never finished the trilogy. &&the Movie To Trailer ratio is \~69,2 minutes per 1 minute of trailer

90 \* 69,2 = 6228 minutes total, 6228 / 60 = 103.8

thats 103 hours total so pretty close&&The views for this movie increased ten-fold about 4 hours after I made this thread which makes me realize that I just helped a major movie company advertise an otherwise ignored film.

Woah.&&It was north korea&&Now we know who the real pirates are!&&damn it, now i cant watch the trailer&&I forgot the name already...&&It is up to all of us to get the word out.

That this movie is garbo.&&Yes we do! Time for them to rake in the profits. &&I love how they quote comments on this exact post in that article. Reddit wrote most of the article for them. At least they linked to here and gave credit instead of pretending that *they* wrote this witty comments like BuzzFeed does.&&[I'd say it worked](https://i.imgur.com/QmvIEQX.png)&&I'd say the jokes on you for downloading this garbage..&&Yea Khali is a good character and his ex is distractingly hot but the rest of this film blows.&&Because I enjoy watching movies, even bad ones.&&I do. I watch it and skipped several time. It took 5 minutes of my life away. :-(&&It’s worth it for Cobra Kai and no ads, IMO. &&Yeah, they know it wouldnt do all that great so they can generate extra interest by leaving it up.&&Now it's down.&&It's down now&&Wasn't there that issue with the Tom Cruise mummy movie? The trailer didn't have all the audio attached or something, and the theory was that it was to bring attention to the movie. &&I would imagine it hurt. Those leaks were in bad shape and the movie was already bad enough. &&Watching the workprint was fucking hysterical esp with the liner notes detailing what needed to be done. &&Ajaha. Yeah I was in China and saw that. Love those random changes where they weren't done with cgi&&The leaked version was good because it was funny. Little things like ""claws grow"" and seeing the green screens and cables. Like shitty half effects and stuff.

The real version was just bad.

Tfw np dbz release of the leaked version that was good.&&Yeah movie was finished/watchable but there were missing textures and effects, etc. In some of scenes it was just grayscale and wire frame type stuff.&&To be fair, I think that, depending on where the upload took place, this barely took a few mins due to highspeed corporation internet and the worker probably left and went somewhere else to do something different in the meantime.&&Yea the movie doesn't even have a Wikipedia page, the release would have been a complete non-event, they probably knew they'd make a loss either way so might as well get some publicity out of it&&Also they got hacked and then conveniently just had to release that North Korea movie in special ways (because it was going to bomb otherwise)&&Would probably do better on YouTube if they just monetized it.

I don't know of any straight to DVD movies that actually did good.&&See, this clearly worked! This ""accident"" just made you curious about a movie no one has ever heard before. I am pretty sure there will be a few guys willing to pay a small fee to see what that was about.&&!RemindMe 4 hours&&A lot of businesses, especially large ones, have symmetrical fibre connections, meaning the same download and upload speed. If you can download this whole movie within a minute, it’s absolutely possible that the upload was the same speed and they didn’t notice cause it went really fast.

This isn’t likely a mistake though.&&I know it doesn’t particularly mean anything but it has 3.8 on IMDb 😑&&advertising seems to be disabled o.O&&Yeah this doesn’t happen on accident. The people that touch the trailer for uploading to the internet are not touching the full length feature. There’s a million other reasons why this would never happen&&Or Sony wants to destroy someone's career by letting this movie produce zero revenue. &&Should upload Venom if you really wanna get back at them. This movie isn't gonna hurt anyone lol&&Eh I dunno, we have 10gb internet connections at work, I click a file, look out the window for a minute, drink some water, and it's done for just about any file size going to/from a decent host like Google.&&It's been at least 6 hours since it was put up. If it was accidental it would have been taken down by now. &&I could see it happening, if the time on their end shows up as 1:29 or something.&&This is the same as those artists who say, ""My dad doesn't think he's a good artist, lets show him some love!"" Then in the comments there is always, ""Oh wow! I'd like to buy one of his prints."" Then BAM lets put up their website to make some sales.

When in reality either the person is promoting themselves pretending to be a relative or both people are in on it. Since the dad doesn't think he's good, yet he has a site with available prints. 

So yeah, this is probably another way for Sony to make a horrible movie into a meme for those people who ""unironically"" love bad movies. &&... but they just released the product for free. 

I’m not saying it wasn’t intentional, but saying it’s marketing seems a little counter productive. &&Oh, I love the idea of big corporations having the same shitty document titles. 

kalithekiller_final_version_2.mp4&&It depends on where you are. In America, the correct pronunciation is ""Hun-Day."" In the UK, they pronounce it as ""High-Un-Die"". I don't speak Korean, but I have heard that their pronunciation is similar to ""Hyoon-Day"". I own two Hyundais and pronounce it the American way, since that's where I live.&&In Korean, you would say ""Hyun-day."" it's easy enough to say properly in English. &&Why do people always assume that everything is done by interns?&&What a fitting title!&&In my opinion this is more than  just repetitive, it’s cliche. So common that it’s almost a parody of itself. Like “workaholic  learns too late that what was most important in life was family all along”&&It also heavily implies the events of the movie went exactly how they needed to for them to win, considering strange saw into the future.&&I was just thinking about this in the car ride not 20 min ago. How many timelines did he look into, where that timeline he also looked into 14 million futures? How does that work? Were there 14 million times he looked 14 million times and found nothing so he did something else? That would make his effective search size closer to 14 million squared. Would it be possible for him to see a timeline, where that Strange saw *his* successful plan, causing a paradox?&&[deleted]&&[deleted]&&Yeah. Little sad, cause I know the main actor can act. He was great in American Crime.&&*15 minute rule(not including title credits if there are any)....have to watch at least first 15 minutes otherwise I feel my opinion is unfounded.&&A friend of mine gave Finding Dory 20 minutes and gave up. No convincing has gotten him to finish it.&&Yah accidentally uploaded a video that is 12gb instead of 500mb...hmm sure&&This seems painfully obvious to me. Are we cynical?&&how would releasing a bad movie that won't be carried on word of mouth for free be more beneficial than releasing it on netflix or the likes?&&Springtime for Hitler in Germany&&Eh? In what way? Isnt like they have we accidentally fucked ourselves over insurance&&That makes absolutely no sense.

""We made a shitty product! The only way to make our money back is to release it in exchange for no money!""&&At least a dumpster fire has a defined start, middle, and end. &&I would think they are trying to get their money back via YouTube views. The “leak” and making posts and press about the mistake is a way of getting the word out there is a movie for free on the internet. &&It was supposed to be the trailer for the DVD release. It said so in the title.&&Yeah the big clue would have been the upload delay.

I suppose if Sony Motion Pictures has a flakey connection to YouTube (what? why is everyone laughing?) it's possible the staff are used to just starting an upload and coming back later?&&Then boy was that a good movie! Went by in a blur!&&huh?&& where did you get the numbers for that ratio?&&How does it make you feel that, might've been their goal all along.
&&r/Hailcorporate&&which is why they ""accidentally"" released it &&Im reading through the comments, chuckling to myswlf and see this.  And realize I also already forgot the title of the movie&&I'm looking at my screen and trying to remember it without scrolling up or looking at the title bar. I know it's like Killer Khiri or something, but I would give myself a 25% chance of that being right.

And I actually clicked through and watched 20 seconds of the movie too! 

(Reddit made me wait 6 minutes before posting this, so I opened a new tab and checked the real name and I was way off, I actually would have bet it for SURE started with Killer.&&Name of what?&&[this definitely Drew attention to it though](https://i.imgur.com/QmvIEQX.png)&&You might like the podcast How Did This Get Made.

It's the funniest thing you'll hear. It also says a lot about the effort put into the movie, considering the trailer was 1000x more entertaining than the movie. &&Was the Tom Cruise Mummy any good? I mean just as a popcorn flick not comparing it to the original trilogy?&&Would that be the the same case now with Venom? The trailer had no CG.&&Yeah, I wasn't very interested in the movie to begin with, but after watching about a third of the movie from those leaks, I had absolutely zero desire to see the actual thing.&&""claws grow""&&They should honestly release it in a special box set. I'd buy it.&&But why would said worker even have access to the entire film on their PC?&&Yeah I had the same thought, in my experience business connections have a much higher upload rate than a residential service, although I’m no expert I assume that’d make the upload a lot quicker &&Wouldn't the bottleneck be on youtube's end regardless still causing for a longer upload time then a 2min trailer?&&A dedicatedine is going to take significantly longer to upload a couple gigabytes of movie compared to what?

The size difference is such that you *will* notice the difference&&I used to have a roommate that would always rent random movies I'd never even heard of on redbox and we'd watch them a couple times a week. I figure there's at least dozens of guys like  that keeping these projects going.&&I think that the straight to DVD DC Animated films sell alright.&&I think the Mary Kate and Ashley movies made millions.  I think most were direct to DVD.&&I used to do some work for Universal Pictures Home Entertainment who did lots of direct to DVD/digital download releases, and they largely did pretty well.&&Ever heard of The Boondock Saints? &&Super Troopers. [Edit: Was not] Straight to DVD, pure fucking gold.

Edit: And as /u/captain_carrot said, Boondock Saints is another phenomenal movie. While not technically straight to DVD, it should be considered as such. (It was shown in only 5 US theaters) &&Nah, I just like capitalizing from people’s mistakes. &&I'd like to play halo 2 on one of those &&Funny thing is for me at least is that YouTube caps at about 35MB/s on the upload on my gigabit connection. I wish it used it all.&&OwO&&I wonder if any actor/actress or person contracted to this film who earns a percentage of gross revenue or some other variable has a case to sue for loss of wage?&&This sounds way too much like “The Producers” and I love that&&Oh shit, that's a really interesting perspective.  &&People didn't learn their lesson with the whole fabricated BS around The Interview&&Was the film worth much before?  I’ve never heard of it.&&I think it’s unlikely - this could cause some serious grief when dealing with things like the SAG theatrical release requirement etc, really not worth it for a tiny buzz like this&&tbh I think fuckups like this are way more likely in big corporations, because you end up with 5 people doing a 1-person job&&  kalithekiller_final_version_2 (Another Copy).mp4.backup&&There was a commercial at some point where they said ""It's Hyundai, like Sunday."" &&Because companies want to save as much money as possible and nothing beats free labor force&&It's not exactly being cryptic with that fact&&wibbley wobbley timey wimey&&That’s true my brother got arrested one time when he really had to pee but I warned him we were on minute 18 and it was a risk. I had to go bail him out after the film. Can’t complain, though, those cops are doing the lord’s work.&&I got up to the end credits before tapping out. I couldn't do it.&&Catching fireflys in east LA?  WTF????  its almost as if the writer had no concept of fireflys or people living in east LA.&&""Hmm this is taking like... 90x longer than it should to upload a one minute trailer. YouTube's such a piece of shit these days""&&They probably have a gigabit connection, I doubt it took them longer than a minute to upload the file.&&No it's pretty painfully obvious. This is the equivalent of some porn star trying to claim she slept with someone without realizing that he filmed it and is now selling access for $20/month. She also heard you could use the promocode SOHARD for $5 off.

Like seriously, the _entire movie_ instead of a trailer? Those things don't even go to the same people. There's no way that mistake happens.&&Considering it's never accidentally happened to a Big blockbuster, I'm gonna say no, we're not cynical, This seems pretty obvious.&&Is it ""cynical"" when you're right?&&Because now when the movie performs poorly, they can point to this and blame internet piracy for some sort of insurance? &&Insurance? Claim the only reason it didn’t sell well enough was because everyone already saw it?&&Winter for Poland and France&&Except, that one was intended as a flop, but turned out a success.&&[deleted]&&And a dumpster fire sounds like it'd actually be pretty fun to watch. &&A movie? For free? On the internet?!&&Those movies can't be a healthy option if you've got a life to keep up with.&&You know, where he ends up with no arms and no legs and changes his name to Mat?&&I know, it's just the the fact that I actually had any influence to help a MAJOR movie company feels like a big achievement in my less than stellar 16 year old existence.&&I think it's called ""Chiller Killer"", something about a guy who hides in the fridge and jumps out and kills people.

&&DJ Khaled the killer or something.&&Likewise.&&There's a movie? &&Same. I have no clue where to even start with remembering. &&This is not a picture of the ex. I am disappoint.&&I really enjoyed it, it was very well done. Johnny and Daniel are in every episode and are a huge part of the plot which I enjoyed. It gave you Johnny’s side of things which I thought was great, the callbacks were tasteful and used more as Easter eggs and less as a crutch. They have the whole first season and just got renewed for season 2 which will absolutely bring back Johnny and Daniel as the mains as well. I thought the way the story played out kind of surprised me in the end, and at the very end they have a post credit style scene that got me as excited as a Marvel post credit scene. Honestly 9.5/10 would absolutely recommend if you even remotely enjoyed Karate Kid!&&I was hoping they'd reuse that for mission impossible&&Yea, that was weird. &&[Aaaaaaggghhhhhh...aaggghhhhhh](https://youtu.be/kRqxyqjpOHs)&&I loved it. Entertaining with some fantastic CGI. The female protagnist lead was irrelevant,  but Tom Cruise was great and Sofia. I loved how you could see the glass shatter and dissolve into sand for the mummy face wall sad there isn't more &&Wasn't that good. It was all over the place and wasn't sure where it wanted to be.&&That happened to be an awful film. I think the rough calculus is piracy CAN help if you're great, CAN hurt if you suck, all other things being equal. Like ""X-men Origins: Wolverine"" having a fanbase that's excited enough to download an early version and then figure out it's fucking terrible. &&Sony has an internal database they share with YouTube, they accidentally uploaded that blender film to it and DMCA'd the creator's of it.&&Someone in the editing crew, perhaps? Then again, I would expect a marketing team member to be the one uploading. The story of an accident doesnt add up, here.&&Good Logic!&&I work in dedicated hosting where our biggest clients move terabytes of data like it's nothing. As in 1TB in 25 minutes across 10GB dedicated lines.

A movie file, even in 4k, would upload in a few seconds. 

&&I think that big corporations probably get favourable treatment.&&Click upload. Go take a break. It's pretty simple to do.&&I do the same.  There are dozens of us.  &&My dad would do this and after a while he wasn't allowed to pick the movies anymore. &&I have 2 criteria for movies. I'll watch if it has:

A Sword

And/or

Matthew McConaughey

So your friend's method is perfect for me

&&Plenty of people do that or are just hugely indiscriminate in regards to what they watch. My dad is sort of like that, he has a ""media box"" and just streams movies off of it in his free time, but I swear that 9/10 things that he watches are random DTV trash that no one has ever heard of.&&I sometimes pick something random that I've never heard of on Netflix, which is sort of a zero effort version of this. Rarely make it ten minutes in, but there's always a chance you'll stumble upon some some decent low key flick. I've seen a few sci-fi indie films that I wouldn't call a 'gem' but are roughly as good as an episode of The Outer Limits or something. Pretty much forget about them later but they pass the time while I'm surfing or folding laundry or whatever. &&My stepfather is one of those guys!&&people always give them shit for looking cheap. These are STV movies, they make nothing so they're made for next-to-nothing, of course they're gonna look cheap&&Probably VHS&&Strange that I watched Super Troopers at the theater&&You want low latency, not high bandwidth.&&\*notices bulge* ""What's this?""&&https://i.imgur.com/gKb7AOP.jpg&&It depends on what release options were specified in the contract. If they mentioned online streaming distribution but not the site or cost, Sony would just point out that they never said they wouldn't release it online for free.&&It was a total flop. 3.8/10 on imdb and people have never heard of it&&You'd be surprised at how many people missed it.

Also those little kids had their hearts broken and didn't understand it.&&New headcanon. He's warned about the danger of paradoxes when he first uses it. Maybe he was specifically only looking at timelines where he never thought to look into the future. He could have seen every time he just acted without thinking about using the eye, but there could be endless other timelines where he does. But in order to avoid paradox, they can all only look at those 14 million. And clearly, those are tye dumbest timelines, why the hell wouldn't you try to get a sneak peak? So their odds only look so abysmal because we're looking at the special ed version of Starnge's timelines.&&Minute 18 is after minute 15, so he was allowed to leave. Why lie about the arrest :p&&couldn't even make it halfway through the 2nd viewing&&True gigabit with no hesitation could push 12 GB in about 1:43.

Whether you're right or not isn't really a factor (and indeed being right a good percentage of the time is likely to make a person even more cynical).&&Are insurance companies that easily fooled?&&Is it really piracy if they uploaded it for free? :)&&How does that make any sense either?

&&Alternate ending: he’s thrown into a pool and called Bob. &&All jokes aside, you might be interested to include this thread as an experience in your CV if you are hoping to pursue a career in social media marketing. &&So the Sony marketing team is now pretending to be 16 year olds?&&Why do you think you single handedly did this&&Youtube views are not indictative of selling movie tickets especially for a reason like this due to pirating. *worked on the creative side of online marketing for a few major movie studios. &&15k people , chilll&&I posted video from the online chess scene which is really small. It reached M views. Months later streamers and owners of big chess wrbsites referenced that video.

It helps if you try not to be too dramatic about it.&&Nah the first word started with 'Kh' so that can't be right. Wasn't it Kharma Killer?&&Awesome, thanks for the info. I'll definitely check it out!&&I remember being genuinely creeped out by the beginning of that trailer. Something about the silence and the white noise.. then you get to the OOFs and it's gone immediately.&&Thanks for making my morning. &&God that was so bad, like to the point where if people on the internet lied I would have thought it was a fan edited trailer.

&&Those first 30 seconds were genuinely good though. Like as an actual trailer&&Yeah, what was funny was that I remember seeing the leaks and people saying ""yeah, but it's just an early version, the real thing will be better."" (Especially in terms of the VFX) Then I did eventually watch the real movie on a plane at some later date (because the bar for what I'll watch on a plane is much, much lower) and the movie was still just as bad. Even the VFX had only marginally improved, if at all, in most cases.&&You are still limited by Youtube's Servers and processing. Youtube doesn't just process the video instantly because you have a fast connection.

In Thailand in a cave with 12 boys, not like that, but still trapped.&&YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HE CUTS OFF THIS TIME!

STARRING ROB SCHNEIDER, IN, ""THE MAT""&&So Mr. HyporciticallySane, what type of experience do you have?


> ""Well, I posted this thing on reddit once, so there's that.""

What marketing techniques did you use when making that post?

> ""I typed a url and said a thing... then it got up voted""

You're hired! &&lol no&&He lead a speculative grassroots marketing campaign for a global media company! 

Thats pretty impressive if you don't look too hard!&&He didn't do anything but share a link...&&If he points out what he learned from that and how powerful he realized social media marketing can be, it is an absolutely valid topic to talk about in an interview. I would definitely tell it as an anecdote!&&Nah, your thinking about that song, ""kharma kharma kharma kharma khomelean'&&You either misremembered that movie, or I saw an even worse early version 

The one I saw still had notations to like his claws saying ""make more shiny""

The trick with the reloading of the gun by throwing it in the air and catching was shown to simply be the guy holding the mags and a PowerPoint like effect of a gun spinning on top of them 

The plane flying through solid grey blobs that were supposed to be clouds were a highlight as well

I'm not saying the movie itself was good, but the ""improvement"" in vfx was large enough&&I specifically remember one scene where the guy whose mutant power is that he shoots real good reloads his guns by throwing them in the air and holding the clips and the guns falling back onto the clips. In the leaked version it looked really bad. The CG was shiny, the guns clipped through his hands. It looked really rough, bad B movie levels of CG. 

Then when I saw the complete version they hadn't changed it at all. &&a counter point to this would be that a LOT can be achieved with good editing. supposing you aren't getting a final edit of a movie through a leak, a film maker could completely turn a film around in the ~6 months before release. Obviously that's not the case here, but still. &&Unless you have priority processing.

I can guarantee you that there are at least two kinds of server cabinets. 

Normal whatever's and high value.

The normal servers get to share processing loads and algorithm sorting. These process 99% of the uploaders.

I can almost guarantee the higher value uploaders have higher priority. HA clusters with full RAID 10 and SAN/NAS redundancy. 

The big entertainment companies get high priority everything.

I do this for a living. We host customers that are as big as Sony. Trust me, they pay for the good shit&&The bigger operations have a pay to play setup with priority processing. Buy a few million in adverts a month and Google takes care of you.&&Dozens of dozens&&OMFG that's exactly the genre my dad goes for too. Worst part is he falls asleep and then I'm stuck watching it. &&It's pretty bad when even the pedos are putting furries in their place.&&I mean if you can't send kids into an existential crisis after seeing everything they love be destroyed, what's the point?&&Nothing wrong with that&&I thought I was your brother....&&I still got a tattoo of the films poster across my back, but not the full arm sleeve I was going to get too :/ so disappointed.&&Dude, that's not how to word it all. Have you never written a CV?

> What type of experience do you have?

I played a key part in helping expose an under performing media project which led a 1000% increase in views, a 1500% increase in social media engagement in all materials surrounding the project and an untold increase in earnings for the project.

>What marketing techniques did you use when making that post?

I targeted an audience enthusiastic in movies by identifying key social groups within the community and exposing the project through intrusive marketing methods and encouraging the community itself to promote the project through positive reinforcement methodologies.
        
&&Isn't that the story of Gallowboob?&&I hire these kinda kids, and this is exactly the thing we would look for (and try to verify.)&&I mean. The agency I work for would definitely hire someone who could consistently get high views for things on reddit. &&Khaled: A DJ's Story?&&For sure, I get that. I'm not drawing anything from the experience with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, just sharing my personal perspective on what happened with that movie. That's also the only time I've ever watched a leaked or pirated version of a movie because I understand exactly what you mean.&&Like fans of Worm and Ward.&&Hey Nico it's me, ur cousin, lets go bowling!
&&I can only say I gave myself light electroconvulsive therapy to erase the part of my brain that remembered I had seen the movie so I could watch it again as if I'd never seen it and I can't remember 8th grade chemistry anymore.&&Hi can you help me write my CV?&&Dude, if you're not in the professional employment field, you've missed your calling. &&The bullshiter in me (missed my calling and ended up a software engineer) wants desperately to have your babies. &&Uhh you may want to put this in your CV as well.

"Shinobu Hashimoto, Screenwriter on Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai' and 'Rashomon,' Dies at 100",30090,90blqi,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shinobu-hashimoto-dead-screenwriter-seven-samurai-rashomon-was-100-1128623,333,1532049055.0,,"Two all-time classics. *The Seven Samurai* is up there in the greatest films of all time conversation. It's actually pretty crazy that a Kurosawa screenwriter was still alive in 2018. He also wrote *The Magnificent Seven*, *I Want to Be a Shellfish*, *Harakiri*, *Japan's Longest Day*, and 70+ other films. One of the most accomplished screenwriters ever. Kept writing into his 90s.

He also wrote *The Hidden Fortress*, which was a major influence for George Lucas' *Star Wars* series.

Absolute legend.&&Man, what a career. Kind of nuts that Rashomon was his first screenplay&&Lived to 100. Really hard to complain about that. &&*Ikiru* is one of the best-written films of all-time. The way it's structured, the dialogue, the characterizations...sublime.&&everything is based off this guys screenplays, EVERYTHING.&&Holy shit, he was alive? wow i loved rashomon. May he rest in peace.&&I think about Japanese who were adults during WW2. Japan's film industry is but one example of the country rebuilding from the ashes of the war -- they were making films that by the 1950s they managed to export.&&RIP a brilliant and wonderful talent!&&Well I guess it’s time for me watch all of his films again. See you in three days. &&Harakiri is possibly the greatest script of all time. Dude was phenomenal&&A huge influence on film has been lost &&I just watched The Seven Samurai for the first time yesterday (what an absurdly long film!). The writing holds up perfectly well and many of the Samurai and farmers felt like believable human beings.&&Ikiru is my favorite work of his. It’s an oddly life affirming story about death. &&Seven Samurai could be mistaken for a modern film if it wasn't in black and white, especially compared to the leave it to beaver bubblegum fluff we were turning out at the time. Fantastic movie&&Seven samurai is one of those movies that just about whatever I’m doing gets put on hold for later so I can watch it and savor it.&&What a long life&&Respect&&Wow 100, rashomon is probably one of the most influential stories ever told and most people don't even realize it.&&He actually has a solid book also that he discusses working with Kurosawa and his earlier career.  Great book for understanding the process of screenwriting.&&A legend has passed. &&I was really dissatisfied with Rashoman’s ending. It was just too abrupt&&RIP to a legend. I just got into Kurosawa recently and Seven Samurai, Rashomon and Hidden Fortress are already among the absolute best movies I've ever seen. My ongoing Kurosawa marathon is gonna be a bit sadder now that one of the writers involved has passed away.&&First dead celeb in a while who died at an age where you think, yeah, well, you were 100, fair play. 
Massive fan of his work and so glad he got to live such a rewarding an d prosperous life!&&F&&u_u Not to take away this great mans legacy, but If you love Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa, Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress do yourself a favor and watch Samurai Rebellion. &&I need your help all I have to eat is Raw sharks&&He also co-wrote I Live in Fear, another Kurosawa movie that is currently my favourite (I'm still going through them). &&This just in Cinefix youtube channel in talks to do a tribute video of Seven Samari. Well it would be awesome since they Love the fuck out of the Movie. RIP Shibobu.&&The world has lost an absolute legend. Two absolute classics! May he R.I.P.&&I had no idea someone who worked on those films so closely was still alive, would have been great if they did an interview with him for his 100th birthday.&&What a legend.  
Genre defining master.&&Ran is easily one of the best films also&&RIP MASTER SHIMOBU HASHIMOTO.&&white silken window  
rain rivulets grey to black  
sticky floor washed clean&&Like Kurosawa, I make *mad* films.  Okay, I don't make films, but if I did, they'd have a samurai&&Seemed to have been a life achievement to reach this age... I want to get 99+ to actually see the next total eclipse in central Europe (germany)&&Someone said that he didn’t die at all, and another person told me that he was killed, and a *psychic* told me yet another side of the story...&&Damn, I have been wanting to purchase Rashomon for awhile now, and I think it's time. Yasuraka ni nemuru, Senpai.&&Good damn, what a bummer. &&Man, I didn't even realize he was still alive but this really bums me out. Seven Samurai is my favorite movie and the Magnificent Seven had been my favorite as a young kid.&&My God, some of the films this man worked on were incredible. If you're on the fence, please check at least three Kurosawa joints out, folks. &&So wonderful lived long enough to make century mark &&RIP Shinobi&&Lived a long, full and complete life. Respect&&Rest In Peace, legend..&&He was alive until now? Wow, RIP&&I Want To Be a Shellfish is one of my favorite films. RIP&&Rashoman is a masterpiece.  RIP&&Rashomon has got to be one of the greatest films ever&&R.I.P.&&Great man&&AWWWW SOSAD&&A large number of the films he wrote screenplays for were remade, most famously 1954's The Seven Samurai, which inspired The Magnificent Seven (1960), itself remade again by Hollywood in 2016.

&&Some of the best movies of all time, including Ikiru. There was a thread recently just talking about him.&&So sad that he died. I absolutely love  The Seven Samurai and Harakiri and I highly recommend these two films to everyone.&&100? *Perfectly balanced.*&&Dude on the thumbnail is like a samurai Jordan Peele&&I didn't seem to enjoy The Seven Samurai as much as most of you here, but I do respect the influence it has had.&&Wow! Wow, I had no idea he was still around until now. He helped create the backbone of cinema, truly someone who will go down in history.&&Wow! He was alive still!?  I wonder what he thought about the newest Magnificent 7!?  He had to be proud that people are still re-creating his art!&&Rest well, Shinobu Hashimoto.&&What an incredible resume &&F some good movies man. respect&&As we all know, his works are the source or inspiration for a ridiculous amount of modern media...

I've never seen Rashomon... What might I have seen that was based on it?&&Man i just bought these films on Blu-ray.  The Criterion collection.  &&RIP. Rashomon was a fantastic film. &&Absolute legend. His life is very inspiring. &&One of the directors with the most films in the criterion collection &&Another celebrity gone too soon!&&Those movies were so good. May he RIP. I'm glad to have lived in the same lifetime as him.&&gone too soon ;(&&Was looking for a reason to play the harikiri blueray.. Think he's interviewed about the film in the extras.. &&Wow. Hope he rests in peace and hope his family and loved ones have the mental strength to cope through such a tragic time.&&I didn't realize he was still alive, damn. The Seven Samurai is one of my favorite films.&&https://youtu.be/4H4x0O0Vvw4&&Funny, I don't remember him writing Rashomon&&It’s always great to see that someone good lives for a long time.&&Nice round age to die. I'd be content with that, 100 is clean.&&Wow I can’t believe he was still alive. I remember seeing both those movies they were incredible and timeless classics. Simply amazing writer.&&Wow.. my condolences to his family.... “ Rashomon” helped inspire me to get into film, watching it as a freshman. I loved it, and “ Seven Samurai”, is a classic.

R. I.P., good sir.&&I've never seen anything by this dude but he seems like a honest guy 👍&&Pretty much the last tallent in Japan. Jesus fucking Christmas. Modern Japanese pop Cinema is beyond fucking horrible. Early Japanese Cinema is what teally cemented my love of movie and helped me see it as art instead of just entertainment. Now.... I can't even see Japanese films as entertainment. Just shit. There is a decent film here and there. But good good the drivile coming out. Been in Japan 11 years now and it's just mind boggling the garbage coming out.... And even beating the mindless Western blockbusters. Shitty movies besting out starwars adn avergers. So conflicted. Garbage beating mindless crap. Oh I miss you golden age of Japan cinema &&Its amazing he lived so long.  I loved Seven Samurai.&&RIP to this legend.&&Two of the greatest films ever made he also worked on Harakiri which is also a masterpiece either way he was a legendary screenwriter he will be missed.&&Like kurosawa I make mad films. K I dont make films, but if I did they'd have a samurai. &&And when the newest One Piece chapter where Luffy starts meeting his crew Seven Samurai style. This is sad.&&That's not how I remember it. &&He ate a pinecone everyday you know?&&It’s pretty weird how r/movies circlejerks Kurosawa (and especially Seven Samurai) given 95% of its userbase will not have seen the film or probably ever intend to. I blame every frame a painting for this.

Or maybe they think he’s anime?&&I love how everybody acts like they saw the movies.&&Peace, peace, peace, peace 🙏 &&I didn't like 7 Samurai, I'm embarrassed to say it. Thought it was boring. Guess I'm missing the artistry or something not sure&&[deleted]&&Weird timing, he was supposed to testify to the Mueller commission a week from today...&&Did anyone find Rashomon hard to watch?&&It took 12 cops to bring him down.&&Japanese people japaning until 100 and went to japan the afterlife. I wish I coud live like that, japaning my way into a long life of glory until death&&What a DICK!&&Any of you happen to catch Samurai 7? Great anime. Based off of (bet you can't guess...................) 



The Seven Samurai &&Damn what was my favourite tom cruise movie :(&&Harakiri as well! Did not know that.&&Wow. It’s a shame this isn’t gonna yet very much attention at all. Screenwriters are vastly underappreciated.&&He's given credit for The Magnificent Seven because it's a remake of Seven Samurai, I don't think he was actually involved directly at all.&&>  He also wrote The Magnificent Seven,

Is it poetic or ironic that he wrote a movie that was a western version of a movie he already wrote?&&A little off, but I recommend The Emperor and the Wolf: The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune, it's a really in depth book about the two of them and their tense working relationship. It's very well written and puts in a lot of context.&&I could watch it every year. Ironic that Denzel's doing an AMA on the day he dies.  That was not a good remake.  Guess you can only get two classics out of it.....&&And even if you haven't seen Seven Samurai, you know the story. Magnificent 7, Crouching Tiger Sword of Destiny, Bug's Life, 13 Assassins, etc, etc.   

Though, it's a great movie. If you haven't seen it, its super fun, and I love all the adaptations too!&&According to IMDB, he hadn't written anything since 1986, assuming that's not a remake of something either. The more recent writing credits are simply for remakes of his previous works; he wasn't actually involved in them. 

&&I fucking loved the hidden fortress!&&into his 90s? that's impressive&&Absolute legend. Must repeat. If you want to repeat it. Please do.&&The Seven Samurai is The Magnificent Seven.&&Truly respect to our artistic roots!&&Thanks for the info buddy.&&They forgot that 7 seven samurai was also a major influence for star wars as well (The hidden fortress + 7 samurai = new hope). George Lucas kinda doesnt include ""originality"".&&shit can't believe he is dead.&&Wow he wrote Harakiri as well? One of my favorites of all time. RIP&&He inspired the adaptation of \*The Magnificent Seven\* he didn't actually write it did he? I remember watching \*Samurai Seven\* (the anime) when I was younger though. Never realized what inspired it until a few years ago though. Such amazing influence.&&The Seven Samurai is up there with the greatest films of all time, absolutely, for too many reasons to go in to here.

Time to again watch this masterpiece. 

Rest in peace&&Him and Akira Kurosawa were a big part of my childhood. I must have watched *Seven Samurai* and *Yojimbo* half a dozen times each with my brothers.&&In what way did The Hidden Fortress influence SW?  &&I didn’t know he wrote The Magnificent Seven. He’s not credited for the original or the remake. Are you sure?&&This man is an all time legend. &&And we really don't know much about it in the West, why?&&Not to take away from the guy, but Kurosawa also co-wrote that script, and had by that point written another twenty others, so I'm sure that helped. &&Thats not how I remember it&&But from my perspective it was bit his first, but his oldest. &&I wish I could die at 100.&&For sure, dying's a bummer in general but 100's pretty good innings all things considered.&&Yup. Also Hideo Oguni, the third part of the Kurosawa writing trio, had a huge influence on that script. Notably, he was the one that suggested it start [with the main character dead, and everyone unraveling his life at his wake.](#spoiler) &&I agree. I initially warched Ran, 7 Samurai, Rashomon, Yojimbo from a DVD bundle my cousin game me.  I wasn't really compelled to watch Ikiru, after reading the summary. But I was pleasantly surprised how much I really got into that movie when I finally got around to watching it.

I'm convinced Kurosawa was showing off when he made that movie. He chose the most boring job he can think of, and tried to make a movie that puts you into the edge of your seat. I think succeeded.

It's crazy anyone that played such a major role making those movies are still alive until recently.&&Has one of, if not the best female characters in that time period.&&It's also fitting that the snippy comment replies to yours are like the men debating at his wake, missing the whole damn point of it all.&&Easily my favorite Kurosawa, and I’ve watched basically all of them. It’s practically a spiritual film in the company of something like *Babette’s Feast*, and it’s set in what is functionally the real-life and grounded equivalent to *Brazil*—the office and life of s low-level Japanese bureaucrat in the autumn of his years. It’s best watched cold. An astounding film.&&I set *Ikiru* alongside *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich* as  one of the most insightful examinations of how to live a life worth living.&&Did u read it in Japanese?
&&Yeah I thought that scene where the cartoonishly sad-looking guy made sad faces for 20 minutes was extremely well written.&&Backdoor sluts 7?&&Even Shakespeare!&&Yup, we all know The Hidden Fortress’s influence on Star Wars, but few people know it was also remade as Primer.&&Most recent thing being The Last Jedi, which has a few scenes that pay tribute to Rashomon.

(Preemptively: please don't start arguing about Star Wars, I was just bringing up a bit of trivia)&&>I loved Rashomon

That's not how I remember it. &&The actress [Machiko Kyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiko_Ky%C5%8D) who plays the wife in the film is still alive at 94.&&She was alive! I felt it!&&I love Kurosawa, but given the runtime on most of his films, better give it a week. &&I've only watched so few ""perfect"" films and Harakiri was one of them.&&How would you say the movie compares overall to Kurosawa’s best?&&The man is gone, but his influence is not. &&Dont worry another remake of spider man or another Star Wars film will be out soon. Trust me....&&If it wasn't in black and white you'd think it was made in the last 20-30 years.&&Seven Samurai is the first Western of all time!&&F&&OwO Whats this?&&not an interview but...

(°Simpsons joke intended.)&&http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/A_Matter_of_Perspective_(episode)

Star Trek TNG, where Riker is accused of murder and both sides use the holodeck to show their versions of events.  On most points they factually agree, but the subjective nonfactual renderings of word emphasis and body language imply very different interpretations.  The prosecution paints Riker putting his moves on a married woman there,  getting into a fight with her husband and blowing up the station in a jealous rage while transporting out.

The ep could have been better if the audience could actually believe Riker (or whoever was accused) could have murdered someone.  Or change the charges to negligent homicide by Riker doing some nonprofessional Riker thing against regs and this time it got people killed.  Surely his peculiar method of mounting chairs could eventually result in loss-of-life.

&&Funny because one of his most famous movies is about not knowing who is telling the truth.&&""Train yourself, distinguish yourself in war... But time flies. Before your dream materializes, you get gray hair. By that time your parents and friends are dead and gone.""

I had to look it up but I would have been close anyways.  && Shinobi is another word used for ninja&&Yes, people will try to deny this, but they do so in vain &&Harakiri and Sword of Doom are both phenomenal.&&I love that one. I am not actually surprised to see that the writer that worked on a lot of Kurosawa's classics is also responsible for that one.&&Shame it’s no longer on Netflix. I use to watch it and “Thirteen Assassins” all the time when I couldn’t decide on anything else to watch.&&I'm not so into old films. I think the paces are so different from modern films that it's annoying. However, Harakiri is the one I really really enjoyed.

Edit: Yeah keep downvoting because I dislike the paces of old films&&It makes me happy when they become more recognized. For example, movies written by Taylor Sheridan.&&You said a mouthful. People know actors but screenwriters are frequently unknown although they are largely responsible for the most important part: the story. I guess directors are better known but they too somehow are less known by far than actors. This is not new -- it has been about the movie stars for 100+ years.&&Case in point: I saw this thread and thought ""Those are some great films he wrote, RIP"", actually looked him up and found out he also wrote ~~my~~ the **greatest film of all time** - Samurai Rebellion.

&&And people will actually praise the director for a film's writing. Sure, it's possible the director changed the scene, but it was most likely the screenwriter. And editors get even less appreciation.&&“Not much attention”

&&Luckily it’s now on the front page!&&Maybe not in the US, but it was a top story on asahi.com yesterday (website for one of the largest newspapers in Japan).&&You got that right. Unfortunately, we probably won't hear more about this until the reboots starring Mark Walberg.&&He should be given credit for A Bug's Life as well then.&&Neither really. All three writers of *Seven Samurai* were also given writing credits on *The Magnificent Seven*, but they didn't actually participate in producing the script.&&He didn't. He was given credit BECAUSE it's a remake. He did not actually right The Magnificent Seven.&&Kurosawa's *Something Like an Autobiography* is a very fun and interesting read too. He goes into his early days as an assistant director and screenwriter, and also discusses how movies like Seven Samurai were written (shit-faced at a hotspring, with him and his co-writers scripting their own versions of a scene after discussing it, then combining the elements they liked from across their takes).&&Hey, *Battle Beyond the Stars* was... uh... also a movie. *Samurai 7* was pretty good, if you're into that kind of anime. Also, *A Bug's Life* was basically 7 Samurai with bugs.&&Three Amigos&&Bug's Life, eh? I never noticed that, but then it's unfortunately Pixar's weakest movie so I don't think about it much at all.&&You could say the same about Roshomon as well in a way.

Every Movie/TV episode that tells one story from different character POVs is taken from Roshomon.&&He didn't. The last few credits he got on IMDB are only for films that were remakes of one of his previous works. Something like ""based on characters created by..."" or ""based on a screenplay by..."". His last original screenplay (at least supposedly, because he is the only listed screenwriter) is from 1986, when he was in his late 60s.&&The Magnificent Seven was John Sturges’ homage to Seven Samurai.&&This is why I liked their homages to samurai movies in the new trilogy&&Huh? The Seven Samurai and Rashomon have been on the The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time for decades. Every cinephile knows them.&&Watching Kurosawa films, especially the Seven Samurai and Rashomon, are pretty much mandatory in every film schools across the whole world.   A non-movie enthusiast may not know them, but for anyone in the film industry these are basically Shakespeare. &&Maybe you dont&&That's even more pressure if anything else.

It absolutely blew me away. It's captivating from the very beginning and very unconventional. The way it meanders through emotions makes the movie feel like a rollercoaster ride. And that portion at the wake, holy wow, I was just trying to absorb it all in at that point. It's honestly been on my mind daily and i'm so grateful I got to see it in a theater setting. That and First Reformed have left happy this month.&&Fun fact: Tatsuya Nakadai, who starred in *Yojimbo* and *Ran*, is alive and well, and still acting in films! &&Kurosawa is a bottomless well of masterpieces.

It's over 30 of them. Just the directed ones. More if you count all he was involved with.&&I'd honestly take it over Seven Samurai, which is my favorite Kurosawa. Kobayashi was outstanding in his own right and it's a shame he'd only be recognized as a master in North America later than the usual Kurosawa, Ozu, and Mizoguchi. He's genuinely on par with all of them. 

If Harakiri isn't his finest, it would be the brutal 9 1/2 hour long war epic The Human Condition. &&It's at least as good as Kurosawa's best films, I'd even rank it a bit higher. Harakiri is one of the best films ever!&&I would personally put Harakiri over any of Kurosawa's films.

Edit: Except maybe Ikiru. &&My top three Kurosawa are Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and High and Low, in that order. I have Harakiri and Seven Samurai tied. I think all of these are unqualified masterpieces&&And 10 more original films will come out right alongside them. &&Kurosawa was stupid ahead of the curve with his directing style, and especially his editing. Like, his films just *move* in a way that still feels modern.

Guy was a god-tier writer and director, but probably an even better film editor.&&Now, this is just incorrect. There have been Westerns since the beginning of film. The Great Train Robbery was made in 1903!&&Surprising that a genre largely associated with the west was pioneered by an eastern film.&&Samurai Rebellion is one of the greatest samurai movies with Toshiro Mifune in it - thats whats this. &&Wow, those are two of my all time favorite. Can't really get what is all the hype arouns kurosawa though to be honest&&Wanted to let you know that while I'm upvoting you, I still emphatically disagree with your preference&&His movies are just breathtaking. I will watch anything that Sheridan writes. &&Young actors are way more marketable, that's why. And it's easier to act, than to write, a full film.&&[deleted]&&It's also of the most beautifully shot. Love that movie.&&Wow, I'm assuming I need to sweep in and watch this one then. Any other encouragement you can give me? (I have like 20 films on my watch list)&&Exactly. Directors are seen as the “leader” of the movie when the story and the characters written by the screenwriter is the most important part of the movie imo. And you’re right about editors, a good one can elevate a movie tremendously and a bad one can ruin it.&&Haha you’re right, this comment kinda backfired. In my defense, the thread was at like 17 upvotes when I commented. I’m glad to be proven wrong in this case.&&And Guns of Navarone, and the Ocean's 11 movies. Any that involve recruiting a skilled team to accomplish a task.&&Remake is a little harsh.

What’s the word for the same plot but completely different settings and characters.&&Wait so they give writing credit to people who wrote the story a movie is based off of even if those people didn't write the actual movie?  Weird.&&Hardcore Kurosawa fan, freaking loved Samurai 7.&&I like *Battle* (own it on blu-ray... I think) in all its campy 70s glory (John Boy in Space!). 

*Samurai 7* is never available on my platforms.  Maybe my video store has it (yep, still got one of those - Cinefile in West L.A.). &&You need to watch A bug's Life and then look at Pixar's catalogue again, because there is *no way* you can argue it's their weakest film. Not when Cars 2 exists. Or Toy Story 2, even.

&&Frame stories have been around a long time, as well as unreliable narrators. Rashomon is particularly about the same exact tale from different perspectives, which I think is pretty rare. Courtroom dramas, maybe, and of course the Paul Newman remake.&&Yeah exactly this. Imagine getting the nod from Bowie half way through his Space Oddity tour.

I figured you guys wouldn’t handle my comment well though haha. &&I love when people on Reddit don’t feel like discussing the topic at hand, so they instead decide to make inferences and armchair psychological evaluations about the comment writer.

I thought the funeral scene was way too slow and long. I don’t like when movies get brought to a halt for 20-30 minutes, regardless of the subject matter. You’re free to disagree with that. And you’re also free to do more palm readings on me if you’d like haha

Fucking amazing show.&&Top actors get paid better than top screenwriters afaik -- movies are advertised based on stars, not writers. Off the top of my head, writers that people know are not even screenwriters usually: King, Clancy, a few others are part of the advertising.

I guess I try not to think about that atrocity. Toy Story 2 was great IMO.&&Yeah, sorry, maybe my wording wasn't as specific as it needed to be, ""tells one story"" was meant to imply ""telling one specific tale from different POVs"".

You're definitely correct that the idea of framing someone and unreliable narrators predate Roshomon.&&Cocaine &&Came into the comments to say this! *Rashomon* is the name of an anthology of short stories, and is the name of one of the short stories in the collection, but is not the title of the short story adapted as Kurosawa’s *Rashomon*. The story we know as Rashomon was originally entitled “In a Grove.” 

Rashomon, if translated, means “city gate” but even in Japan is used as a proper name for a particular city gate featured in the film and the original short story. 

All of this is to add a crucial detail: Elements of “Rashomon” are used in *Rashomon*, but they basically amount to the scenes set at the Rashomon.&&That's a good point. He was an extraordinarily gracious man.

Even in comparison to his Japanese peers. 

&&It never gets better, man. &&Yep  :)&&I think it’s appropriately balanced with the comment above. &&I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you knew that posting a snide comment about a film in a thread full of praise and remembrance about the screenwriter would get a ton of downvotes and negative comments.

Anyone else care to explain?&&Agreed completely. I watched hell or high water after reading someone mention it on reddit, and immediately went and watched wind river after (had seen sicario long before) and was absolutely blown away. Amazing storytelling, and most of the story seems realistic, none of the over the top stuff that would never work in real life that's so common in films. &&Sicario made me so uncomfortable in the best kind of way.

Sheridan is almost single-handedly reinventing the Western epic for modern audiences. Thing is, we're all so far removed from the era when ""cowboys and Indians"" were a cultural force that we have a hard time seeing it when it's repackaged in a slightly updated way.

Take *Sicario*. Themes of revenge governed by a world that only knows violence. That's Western to the core. Emily Blunt (the ""Sheriff"" figure) starts as an altruistic character, but the violence she commits and has committed upon her changes her. I mean... it's practically *Shane* or *High Noon*.&&I have seen Sicario and loved it, though not seen the sequel yet&&This is really embarrassing that I loved Sicario so much, but haven't seen those other two. I need to get on that.&&Sounds like we have the same plans for Monday, friend :-]&&This may seem wildy off topic, but this is part of why the dark tower movie was so awful. The first part in the series, ""The Gunslinger"" could have been an amazing and relatively self contained gritty Western like any of the best of the genre. One of his shorter novels, that book vaunted me into my own ""man with no name"" phase of movie/narrative interest. The book is basically a realization of King's love affair with that kind of anti-hero. I'm so disappointed that instead of getting ""No Country For Old Men"" with Roland Deschain, we got ...

Like, I always assumed that the original predator was some 16 year old kid undergoing a right of passage.

*Screams in Predator, tears off tie and sets self destruct mode*&&>Why can we never see them?

I think the answer is obvious...&&>So Predator's manufactured the species of Alien in ""Alien"" just for the purpose of hunting them, because Padator's are, um, Predators.

I don't think the AVP movies are considered canon within the individual properties. I don't even think they're considered canon within other AVP media!

That said, I believe those movies explained that the Predators created the Aliens for training. They had to hunt them in the pyramids to be considered worthy or something.

And the Predator homeworld was shown briefly in AVP Requiem. For whatever that's worth. Probably not much. &&I always assumed they live in a post scarcity society with society being fully automated. As a result, the predator people needed to refocus their society to avoid becoming complacent. Enter their race wide mission to become the perfect hunters.  Which was probably a popular and mainstream sport for them already but now shifted to a more important part of their lives.

I swear i remember hearing about predator philosophers tho.&&They could just be one particular caste, or segment of Predator society. Maybe not all of them are hunters. Maybe they've reached the apex of their technology and culturally regressed into savagery. Maybe they never even invented their own tech and instead appropriated or inherited it from another, more technologically advanced species?

The Predators didn't 'manufacture' the Xenomorph, they just used captive Queens to breed more warriors to hunt.&&They can apparently live up to 1000 years, and have a training period early in their lives that's about 50-75 years long. Leading me to believe that's enough time for everyone in their species to have the equivalent of a doctorate in what ever field of study they choose. The hunting period of their lives also takes up another 150 years to complete, eventually proving to the rest of their clan they are wordy enough to breed with their females. Which might also be the ones in charge of producing their tech. After that predators take on administrative roles where I presume they become trainers, counselors, scientist, and philosophers. If you also presume most of their tech maybe stolen from some other more advance species they came in contact with, allowing them to expand farther technologically than they would have otherwise, then you can come to understand why they are a space faring civilization. &&As funny as that would be, I think a better idea would be that they shared a planet with another, much more technically advanced race, and then enslaved and utilized their technology. &&How girl get pradator?&&More like they manipulated certain colonies of Alien. The actual xenomorph's and other related biological monsters were made by the engineers from Prometheus, which was about the only coherent thing from those movies. &&Predator: ""I've had it with these mothafuckin aliens on this mothafucking spaceship.""&&https://youtu.be/r0X4QK4Rbrc

I'm really curious to see what this is about. In one of the recent trailers we see the smaller Predator is captured, at some point, and they're running tests on him or something before he escapes. He's dubbed 'the fugitive', and something makes me think the name is in relation to other Predators; maybe the Big Bad is some kind of Predator law enforcement or bounty hunter?&&Maybe this movie is more about Predator scientists and how they get their work done all while stressing out over deadlines? &&It's really not looking good.&&>I really hate how some movies always try to one up the previous installment. ""You thought that Predator was scary, look at this bigger one!""

Agree completely. It's so unnecessary and it just reeks of shitty fanfic-tier storytelling. Like the group of Predators in the 2010 movie could have just been normal predators from a different tribe and it wouldn't have changed a thing. In fact it probably would have made more sense (I dont think predators ever took prisoners before that movie?) and it would have allowed more hints at the nature of their society.

But instead they *have* to be these Ubermensch Predators... and here we are again in 2018 with a 12 ft tall monstrosity that throws around normal Predators like a ragdoll.&&This is actually a very profound statement.  Dude I think you hit the nail on the head!&&It really is crazy how many films today are franchise films and how few are original.

I want them to go super dark with this. &&It's a right of passage. They kill for status. The Alien is the ultimate prey. Predators are essentially a giant war clan. I'm sure they have some predators for ""normal jobs"" but they are likely ones that lost status. For Predators, the hunt is everything. Oh and this whole ""evolving"" sruff from this upcoming movie is bullshit. They sent novices to earth to train and prove themselves. If Predators really had a problem with humans, they'd send in their Predator Team 6 and clean house.&&And Predators is just a Predator bachelor party and the bigger evil predator is their version of Deebo&&I always laughed at how idiotic the Predator culture was that was laid out in that barely-better-than-fan-fiction nonsense that ended up as novels and comic books.  The idea that a spacefaring race would revolve around hunting was soooo dumb.  As opposed to what the films implied, that the Predators were just high-tech big game hunters (sometimes with a code of honor... sometimes not).

It was the equivalent of aliens seeing that story about the guy who shot Cecil the Lion and then writing a fictional story about Earth, where all humans were dentists from Minnesota. &&Sexual Predator predators&&Predanitors &&That's master of custodial art predators to you, dick.  &&Jandators &&Predator editors&&id watch a 5-10 minute short on youtube of a regular predator going through a boring predator life, but a full movie sounds like terrible idea

There's some controversy over whether what we saw in Covenant was the true origin of the Xenomorphs, or whether David was attempting to reverse engineer them. Personally, I hope it's the latter. The Xenomorphs are scarier if they're not human-made. &&Erm... The Alien and Predator universes are separate. The *AVP* films are no longer canon and both franchises - including films, books and games - remain separate from one another.

*Prometheus* and *Predators* were both attempts to ""re-write"" the lore of both franchises after the travesty that *AVP* caused. In fact, it caused so much travesty amongst critics, fans and film makers like Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Sigourney Weaver that since then Fox has had very little faith in the Predator franchise. It was 18 years after *Predator 2* that we got another Predator movie. And it's been 8 years since that one as well. &&Haha Big giant men.  I wish we did get to see more of the Engineers. Would be a great addition to the series&&I don't think the Android actually created the Xenos, sure he may have engineered his own version but we see Xenos (as we see them in Alien) have existed in some form or another even before in Prometheus. There are carvings of Xenos in Prometheus and the Deacon looked more similar to the Xenos than the Neomorphs seen in Covenant.&&I think it would dampen some of the mystery about their species if we were suddenly able to logically explain everything they do. &&They are called Engineers.&&Seriously, that's their whole thing.&&I mean the Elites almost succeeded against the Prophets when their species first encountered one another, and I'm pretty sure the Elites were using the equivalent of our mideviel knights and Prophets were willing to use their forerunner tech. The elites were just far better combatants and physically much better in every way. So I really wouldn't put that out of the realm of possibilities, as unlikely as it is&&Like the Saiyans and the Tuffles on Planet Vegeta (formally known as Planet Plant)&&So, the Kazon, then?&&No they weren't.  David made them using the template of another creature he stole from the Engineers.

Which is completely fucking stupid, but it's the new movie canon because... good lord Ridley Scott, how did you make both Alien: Covenant and Blade Runner?&&This isnt true. David created the xenomorphs during the events of covenant. &&In Star Trek they run into Klingon scientists.

They were highly regarded but not honored as true Klingons because of their nature to be anti-war or ambivalent towards war.

Kind of like Jocks need the equipment the scientist made for them because they don't want to get injured but they'll still not respect them and call them geeks 

Like, thanks for the gear and the ships and here is some money but go fuck yourself we still all hate you&&I think the shows mention a period in Klingon history where their culture was well rounded and balanced, like 2000 years before 
 the TOS period. Then their planet got invaded and they hung on by a thread, and just barely beat back the invaders but in doing so went total war with their planet, culture and history. Conveniently enough I think they developed most of their regular tech (math, physics, nuclear fission, refrigerators) before that war and stole the rest from the invaders to become capable of travelling outside of their solar system. 

They're sort of like the Covenant of Halo, they develop tech slowly as fuck because it inconveniences them/culture/religion reasons, but its not a big deal because what they have has worked for at least a few thousands years barring minor upgrades, and no one really fucks with them too much until they meet humans.&&Dunno why you were downvoted, it's a fair statement - we didn't see non-warrior Klingons until relatively late in the show history. TNG, and especially DS9 and VOY really pushed for them to be a one-dimensional mono-culture species.&&I think it's a reboot after the last reboot. I don't fucking know.

&&Do you remember Predator 2? There is a xenomorph skull on the wall of trophies in the Predator ship. Predator 2 is still considered canon so I don't see how these universes are separate.&&AvP came out in 2004, 14 years after Predator 2.  AvP may have been shit, but it wasn't what killed the Predator franchise.  The gap between AvP and AvP 2 was 3 years, and then AvP 2 and Predators was 3 years.  Less than half the time between Predator 2 and AvP.   AvP actually kickstarted the Predator franchise back into a thing.  We've seen 4 Predator-inclusive films since 2004 (14 years).  We saw 2 between 1987 and 2003 (16 years).  

I think your causal analysis is a little skewed. Predator was never that strong of a franchise to begin with. It survived mostly *because* of the AvP franchise of comic books and video games.  Without AvP, the Predator would just be ""That one badass Arnold Schwarzenegger movie from the 80s with the alien"" and ""That second one with Danny Glover.""

'Sides, both Prometheus and Predators were bad films, Prometheus just slightly less-so.&&> The Alien and Predator universes are separate.

Well, they merged in like 1990 for comics and video games and stuff.

I can't say I've seen it since the theater, but I just recall it being exactly what I was looking for in an AVP film: a place where both species are duking it out on Earth and humans are the fallout, and a movie where no character felt safe or like they had plot armor and were making reasonably intelligent attempts to survive without any glaring plot holes or rampant stupidity.

Ticks off all my boxes for a good horror B movie there, with the add in fun of watching Aliens and Predators kill each other for an hour.  I really disliked the first AVP but I thought that one was fine.&&That's so strange.  I could almost swear I read about aliens vs predators back in like 1993 in Game Pro or Game Informer, yet Google insists it came out 2004.  This is some fucking Mandela shit lol.  

Like I'd like to claim that I made up the idea of aliens fighting predators back then, but AvP is what introduced me to the two series (I think). I dunno, I'll have to see if I can find that old magazine and see why I thought this. &&Ahhh so I wasn't going crazy.  The game did come out in '93.

It's not just a copy-paste.&&You're probably right, it's most likely a rip-off, but I thought it worth pointing out that it might be the same artist since people seem to think graphic designers just vanish into the ether after having a single work published.&&I don't feel like you need to play on easy.  I started blind on Legend and it's been tough, but only had to restart the whole game once when I found out that the Avatar project ends the game if they complete it.  I wouldn't do Iron Man though, that shit is not OK.  I think the UFO mission is way easier early on than later.  I just hired a bunch of extra rookies and sent them out first.  Lost a few, but no one important.  You definitely have to pray to RNGesus.  My biggest problem early on was not getting enough scientists and engineers.&&I have been trying to set stuff up better.

YOU GOTTA SPEAK UP!!!&&Turn around bright eyes...&&That's the Predator doing its tap dancing practice.&&1) Those more closely resemble alien tails than human spines (you can magnify it and they have the diamond shape of the tails rather than the circular shape of the spine). Unless you made the poster yourself we have no confirmation of what they're supposed to be.

2) The movie isn't out yet, we have no way of knowing whether or not xenomorphs are in the film. My guess would be there is probably some nod to them somewhere.

3) I am also a huge Predator fan who follows this stuff closer than most other movies.&&Good call&&*dips out the back and gets swarmed by aliens*&&Sounds very wholesome, thank you.&&Then The Squirrel Master came out of left field and told me I'm his bitch!&&It was alright (and damn was Wolf badass), but it definitely suffered in the cinematography department. The lighting was waaaaay to dark throughout the film, alongside a very large amount of jump cuts in fight scenes. Not the worst horror B-movie ever, but certainly not the best.&&I think it was an improvement, but could have been better. 

There’s an avp book that I liked. Aliens come down, and predators show up in a ship. This teenager accidentally kills an alien after they kill his family, and some predators see it; so they put him in some gear. Anyway, it’s all out war with predators, vs aliens, vs humans. After all that’s done, the predators take the kid home with them. It ends with the kid being pissed off when he finds out the predators are the ones who brought the aliens down that killed his family. 

Not a big fan of teen movies, but I think that would have been a better movie than requiem. &&> Am I the only one that actually liked Requiem?

There are probably tens of you.  

I'd agree as a schlocky B-Movie it achieves its purpose. Divorced from the Aliens and Predator films that preceded it, it would probably be okay.  As a large-budget film in a series where the best story is a comic book from the early 90s... not so much.&&Too dark to see what's going on IIRC and maybe the plot wasn't good. But the fights couldn't have been that bad.  
But it's the hospital scene that's quite terrifying that I just want to avoid thinking about it.&&AVP Requiem is one of my least favorite movies of all time. Basically the entire movie took place at night so I could barely see any of the action and it fell into the classic 'annoying teenagers getting killed off' main cast structure for its genre. Also, the group of teens first get attacked in a pool and the only one that can't swim to safety is the only black guy, I thought that was pretty funny at the time.&&Were they referring to the comics? (Don't remember when the comics came out)&&As I’m watching, they seem really fucking stupid.

Once something is done once, you can't do that again!&&I was always under the impression that the people that make the designs for these promotional pieces are the same people that do the graphics/design for the media itself.

Saying it out loud, I realize how stupid that is. Making a graphical asset for a game or a CGI effect for a movie has very little skill overlap with making something that looks good in a poster.&&Thats why better players usually dont do overwatch ambushes (or dont use all of their soldiers for it). Always have at least one soldier not overwatching so you can do some 100% damage (via grenade or skills for example) to clear badly damaged enemies.

Xcom is a game about risk management. If you find your approach doesnt produce reliable results, adapt and change your approach.&&Overwatch gives you a negative to shooting, don't rely on it. It's good in certain situations but it sounds like you're trying to lure groups into overwatched areas, generally not a good idea.   


Try to stay in full cover, and position yourself to at least have 1 soldier in a position to flank. Move systematically. Focus, eliminate, move forward cautiously. Running is never advised if you haven't revealed the entire map yet. Stay in the blue movement, keep your actions. Half health enemies do full damage. Take them out accordingly.   


Grenades are fantastic in Xcom 2, use them wisely. They damage trhough walls and cover, sometimes.   


Stay spread out enough that you aren't vulnerable to getting squad wiped from a single grenade or other AOE type attack. But close enough to cover each other.

With that information you can be pretty sure that the most popular firms, Five and Done for example, are used by many different production companies and may reuse concepts that work well. &&**YEAH, BROTHER!

EDIT: To add something more substantive to my comment, I do hope we get to spend more time looking at the monsters, and less time looking at all the things that aren't the monsters.

I am SERIOUSLY worried they are going to spend over half the movie trying to force some kid story arc into a MONSTER movie. 

I don’t want to watch a monster movie and have to listen to some little kid cry about shit. &&""random kid""

You mean the main character of the movie?&&I'm gonna have to agree and join you with my pitchfork. This is either fake or the studio let the intern do their graphics

>edit: Ok. Just checked the twitterz and this is most def real. I'll put the pitchfork away, but hold firm that this looks sub par.

>>edit 2: I see what some are saying, but here's my problem...MBB is totally out of place. The background is stylized and blurred, while she is extremely sharp. It's almost as if the graphic artist made the background (which I like), and it was tentatively approved, and then someone in marketing was like, ""wait, where's our star?! The internet loves MBB!!"". And the artist was like ""Fine. Fuck u. Here."" And just slapped her on there. &&It’s comically bad: between the overlayed type layer, the blurry photo of Godzilla and the random out of context MBB looking in the opposite direction.

Surprised I found it so far down.  &&The 8's a 9, it's a pretty bad poster that you need to zoom in to tell.&&There's a quote by comic book artist Matt Frank, who worked on many of the Godzilla comics, that sums up my sentiment to this kind of statement:

>""So I’m going to take a minute to calm down and politely disagree. I find many Godzilla movies have extremely compelling and entertaining human stories. Mothra vs. Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Ghidrah, Monster Zero, GMK, Sea Monster, and quite a few others have wonderfully compelling human characters and feature strong, capable acting. That’s not to say that exceptions don’t exist - I find the human drama of most of the Heisei series to be pretty difficult to sift through, especially in Destoroyah. While I feel that the drama of G’14 isn’t particularly well handled, I think that the raw onscreen power of Cranston in the first 45 minutes or so is worth watching, and the simple, straightforward editing and storytelling of the final battle is only made better by the well-integrated soldier scenes. There’s an immaturity and impatience that audiences seem to have for Godzilla features that I find bordering on offensive when, for the most part, they won’t even give the human sequences a chance - “I don’t give a shit! I wanna see the monsters!”

While I disagree with him on 2014's drama being poorly handled, I absolutely agree with him on the idea that ""don't focus on the humans"" is at best immature and impatient, and betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of how kaiju films work.&&I agree, however I have to say that in the 2016 Shin Godzilla film the human element felt as good of a plot point as Godzilla himself did. So it's not that it can't be done but rather it takes more care and effort to make it worthwhile.&&It’s just a banner. I’d expect teaser posters and what not to start flowing out during and after comic con. &&The movie has been finished filming for like months now. Like, I’m pretty sure it wrapped last summer.&&Me too. Super hyped&&Have you ever seen any of the japanese Godzilla movies&&I kinda like it. As an avid godzilla fan, making the monsters way too prominent can be a movies downfall. &&Finn and mbb&&Tbf this is her first project outside of stranger things &&Yes. This, the previous Legendary Godzilla movie, and the 2017 Kong movie you’re referring to are all set in the same universe. And you can expect Kong vs Godzilla in 2020. &&Yeah. It's a monsters cinematic universe &&The original one (1954 Gojira or 1956 Godzilla King of the Monsters - very similar title to this one I know) is a must.

The original King Kong Vs Godzilla is a good one because they’re going to be in the same film again in 2020. 

(To catch up on these recent iterations, watch Godzilla 2014, Kong Skull Island, and this new film next year)

Some other highlights from the series include:

Godzilla Vs King Ghidorah 

Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla (1974)

Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack (aka GMK)

Godzilla Final Wars

Oh, and Shin Godzilla, the latest Japanese one (also recent) is excellent.


I’m not the best source on it, the folks over at /r/Godzilla can give you better info. Hope this helps tho!&&But he doesn’t. He goes 
SKREEEEEOOOONK!!&&Still pissed about Bryan Cranston. Almost walked out of the cinema when that happened. &&Well he did play Vetinari&&I'm sorry, what? How did I miss this?&&Negative. He’s playing a character from a terrorist organization/Black Market that harvests and collects materials from the Monsters AFAIK&&So Loki became Tywin Lannister?

That's tight. &&Mothra with an 800ft wingspan, damn that’s massive. &&All of the monsters are damn huge - although I guess that was to be expected, with how large Godzilla was in the 2014 film.

I'm loving the little bios on them. Can see how they've updated and made them their own.&&He grew 9 meters since 1991!
&&That's big!&&Do we know how large King Kong is supposed to be?&&I just clicked on all the red glowing monarch bases and then on Godzilla and got upgraded to level 2.

She usually did in the older movies at least. I'm expecting either a 3 way team up against King Ghidorah, or a 2 V 2 with Godzilla and Mothra vs Rodan and King Ghidorah.&&In the old movies was mothra on Godzilla’s side? &&As is tradition. The only way you can drive off a Kaiju is luring more kaiju at them.&&This movie is basically a reboot of a really old Godzilla movie(can’t remember the name!) where Godzilla fights all of them individually, but in the end, Rodan, Mothra, and Godzilla team up to fight King G cause he’s apocalypse incarnate. The first 3 are more like anti-heroes to King G’s villain.&&Mothra and Rodan have teamed up with Godzilla in the past.  They’re in the friends camp of the monsters for sure, but who knows how this movie will handle it.  &&I just want him to appear in more than 11 minutes of this sequel. Considering that's all he got in the two and a half hours of the first one.&&I want to say they learned their lesson. Pretty sure the same team was behind Kong: Skull Island and that star studded cast let their people shine before killing them off.&&That was so disappointing. He had me so hyped during the trailer and they just [kill him off in the first 20 minutes and we have to deal with cardboard action man for the rest of the movie](#spoiler)&&The lead is a girl.&&Herself....

""Well I guess I can't kill myself yet.""
 
My whole life.&&Interesting to see other people have this mindset sometimes. Before Infinity War came out I actively had the though ""oh man I really hope I dont die before Infinity War""&&Hahaha so true &&Can't tell you how much I relate to this. Hear about the next movie I'm stoked for that's likely 5 years away and then briefly think about how I hope myself or a loved one who I want to see it with will still be here.

It's the little things!&&Haha i do the same. First it was Avengers, then it was The Force Awakens, Then it was Infinity War. Now i got this and Game of Thrones to keep me keeping on. &&/r/2meirl4meirl &&I have no choice but to live until 2025, when Avatar 5 comes out.&&Yea, actually &&Denis Villeneuve can't mess this up now with his track record. This is the big one, the sci fi that inspired others. &&I fucking loved him in Ingrid Goes West. Such an underrated movie &&He's also incredibly happy to be working on the movie and super-hyped to see how it'll turn out, which you can see in this interview:
http://collider.com/oshea-jackson-jr-den-of-thieves-godzilla-king-of-monsters-interview/

The way he talks about Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah makes it sound incredible.&&It's crazy how close in acting style he is to Ice Cube. 

He was the best part of Ingrid Goes West for me. &&I really liked him in Super 8!&&I feel like Bloodline doesn't get enough love. That whole cast was pretty great, especially Ben Mendelsohn.&&Early Edition....anyone?&&CAN'T LOSE&&*This is our dirt! This is our mud! This is ours, baby!*

It's like having Laurel without Hardy.&&omg&&I just want them to release Final Wars as the last movie. And not a remake. Just the original, in all its badly voice-acted goodness.&&Um, that’s exactly what I thought when I saw this. “The actress from Stangers Thing is in this — I want to see this!” Damn, they got inside my head!! ;-p&&God, I really hope that's not the plot.&&But it's not like the original Godzilla movies didn't LITERALLY have that as a plot point and it was fine; it's all about the execution and how much of an affect it has on the pacing &&The colors are great though. I hope we will get a poster as cool as the one for the first film. &&I immediately thought, “who’s the girl and why do I care?”&&Probably to coincide with the Stranger Things season 3 hype.&&No shit, I hand't heard that&&Holy shit now i want this.&&yeah for real&&Cranston was awesome as always in the movie. But the drama/monster ratio was too big. Godzilla was like 15 min or less in the movie. I'm not saying there should be no human element to these movies, but it should be secondary. &&You can focus on the humans ... but make it GOOD. Cranston's part of Godzilla '14 was good. And then as soon as he exits stage left, the human drama becomes boring and uninteresting. So yeah, I start wanting more monster action when I'm falling asleep watching the humans.&&And everyone else went ""holy shit, that's the king of the monsters""&&Skreonk.&&All of the human shit after that was so dull. But Godzilla breath made it all worth it&&It would have worked *if* they'd given the son a character worth following. But they didn't.

All the emotional content, all the reasons to begin this journey, were connected to the father's experiences. So, when he dies, we're pretty much just left with a random dude who wanders around.

That fucking sucked.&&There is a moment in *Ali G Indahouse* where he dances to ""This is How We Do It"" whilst wearing tight leather pants and a leopard print spaghetti strap. I would link it if Youtube isn't blocked at work. &&Sooooo, Ron Perlman?&&It hasn't been confirmed, but after the end credit's scene with them being brought into Monarch and being shown the monsters from this new Godzilla movie, and the fact that Charles Dance looks like an old Tom Hiddleston, I think that's exactly what is happening.

I thought Kong's massive size increase in Skull Island was to get him sized up for Godzilla.&&It'll probably be like Godzilla v Mothra and Mothra takes a liking to Millie Bobby Brown's character so she becomes the one who speaks for Mothra. Godzilla is about to hurt Mothra but there's something to interfere and Godzilla lets Mothra go.

Gareth Edwards later said that they made a mistake by killing off Cranston's character.

I go watching monster movies to see monsters fight. 

I'm in the minority, but I preferred the slow build-up in Godzilla to the constant battles in Skull Island.  By the end of Skull Island (the last battle was literally: same as before, only bigger), I was exhausted.  They had already used up their bag of tricks.

For G'14, the build-up of the MUTOs being inherently dangerous to G was worth it, although the acting for GI Joe was wooden. But, when we got to the battle, it was worth the action.

It reminded me a lot of Pacific Rim versus Uprising.  Uprising was just one ridiculous action set after another.  PR actually built a world and presented a climactic battle.&&Godzilla 2014 was paying homage to the 54 original. So its tone was completely warranted and it was successful in what it did. Now it's going to be an all out fight.&&Dude I totally agree with you. But I also want some interesting humans. Skull Island proved that you can have them just fine as long as they're basically cartoon characters.&&This is also everything wrong with the Transformers movies. Who the hell cares about the puny humans' problems. Level the whole city for all I care. &&I didn't mind Aaron Tyler-Johnson in Age of Ultron, but his character was really bland in Godzilla. &&I agree. It's hardly ever the actor. A decent director with a good script can get something good from nearly any actor. His character was just written so generic; he felt like a placeholder until they could punch up the script and then just forgot. &&He's a talented actor so I was surprised by the decision to kill him off immediately. &&Plus we could have had Cranston in sequels. Such a godawful choice to kill him off. Completely makes the beginning where he watches his wife die pointless too. &&To be fair, that’s how 90% of the old Godzilla movies were. The focus was on the drama and politics of humanity dealing with an allegory for nuclear holocaust. Then he became kawaii and started defending humanity for a decade, but let’s not bring that&&The entire film was like that.  When the second MUTO wakes up and attacks Las Vegas we get a couple snippets of action.

I'm just glad the final battle in San Francisco was satisfying.&&At least they didn't fuck while Wolverine was watching from the bushes&&Yes.&&""I just wanted to point out that even though we managed to save the city today...

The writing was all over the place. &&No regrets&&You joke but I unironically want to see this rendered in big budget Hollywood CGI.&&Gets even less in the ‘54 original. Idk where people get off saying Godzilla is supposed to be onscreen more. Traditionally he doesn’t get seen that much &&Yeah that’s the weirdest part of the complaints to me. People acted like we got no monsters, the MUTOS were on screen plenty.&&The kiss of death was so absurdly hype in the theater on opening night. Thought everyone blew their load when you first saw G's tail start lighting up and the atomic breath started flying towards the male MUTO, but that final kill. 👌👌👌&&Si.&&Man i hope there's more monster screentime, this will be one hell of a movie if they do get it.

Edit : Welp i'm fully hyped now.&&And eventually King Kong.&&Dont worry you won't see any of it because they'll be too busy squeezing a love story into it. &&What was the shoutout? I can't remember. &&High five bro! Can't wait to see some Mothra action for the future. I'm wondering for powers if they'll keep her more to the original set, of if they'll go with the balls to the wall laser antenna Motha Leo had in the spinoffs. &&Also in the classroom in the beginning of the movie as the reactor is melting down, the chart in the corner of the room has a moth with Mothra's patterns at the top of the chain.

Based on everything I'm reading on the movie's site, this is, legitimately, the Mothra we always needed. She was due for a reboot, anyways. It's about time.&&It doesn’t make sense to me why this is the second movie and Kong vs. Zilla is the third. That’s just going to look lame compared to him fighting these wild monsters.&&I love how they are treating these monsters. For being based off of a francise of men in rubber dinosaur suits fighting each other, it's pretty damn impressive to watch them grow this into an in-depth cinemic universe.&&The way they have written these creatures makes me question how humans even survived when they were around.

I own every single Godzilla movie and it’s nice to finally meet someone with culture as well. There was also Baragon in that other version of All Out Attack against KG.&&He's gotta be at least... three times bigger than this.&&Yup they in the same universe, kong is good movie, enjoyable one time watch atleast need to watch it once&&Mothra is the cream of the crop! Nobody does it better&&Mothra is John Cena and Godzilla is Braun Strowman.&&This is actually spot on. Godzilla might be The Undertaker.&&And they’re having a standoff meowing aggressively at each other and inching closer. Eventually grappling and violently crashing against the walls and hissing occasionally. &&Haha that line is perfect. He's a great combo of guru and everyman. He knows all the weird shit about the island, but he's still kind of outraged about the whole thing. 

Fuckin giant ants. Skullcrawlers. This island is insane and we're all going to die! Hah!&&The one F bomb in the movie, and it’s picture perfect.&&Honestly the best line in the movie. He's so annoyed that those ants sound like birds&&I thought the movie was less grand larceny and more Brie Larsony. &&He got me crying at the end.  &&I didn't remember the trailer at all when I saw Kong because I saw it wayyyyy late. 

So I forgot JCR was in Kong, when I was expecting the tough as nails tortured American GI to appear and JCR showed up, oh man. I was suddenly sold on a movie I was kind of on the fence about until that moment. &&You shouldn't have come here!&&Uhm Jar Jar?&&The slow build is fine and I agree that we don’t need wall to wall action.

But the main problem with the movie is that we spend most of our time with the most bland and boring characters I don’t care about. The most interesting ones are killed off way too early. 

If you’re trying to make a more human, character driven picture you need to create strong characters. But I have to admit “let them fight!” was an awesome moment.&&While a good build up is important, they went way, WAY too far with that in Godzilla 2014. I bet if they had at least shown the fight between the male MUTO and Godzilla in Hawaii (instead of leaving it on 2 seconds on a tv screen),  lot less of people would have complained about it.&&Dude, [the HALO jump scene](https://youtu.be/lmZJiBZtahk) was soooooooo fucking good.  Seeing this movie on the big screen was such an awesome experience.&&I agree. I didn’t even realize the last fight in Skull Island was the last one at first because it didn’t feel any different than the rest of the movie. It basically had the opposite problem of Godzilla. 

Though I’m a fan of Godzilla even though Aaron Taylor Johnson is a charisma black hole &&fucking thank you. an annoying amount of people on here compare the asinine bullshit that was Kong: Skull Island favorably to Godzilla 2014 and i don't get it. wall to wall action is boring as shit, i don't care what anyone says. the characters in Godzilla were cold toast but at least they weren't actively annoying and at least i wasn't actually happy when they got killed (like in Kong). and at least the monster fights had scale and weight to them, you could feel the sheer size of the monsters... in Kong they were like cats fighting. at least it had buildup, which paid off amazingly. in Kong the sight of monsters fighting started to feel like day-old gum after a while.&&Also in one of those movies, he played Elizabeth Olsen's wife and in the other he played her brother. &&He's Kick-Ass!&&He's a great actor, but they wasted him.

Cause we don't actually do that in real life. Everyone wants the hero's journey in some form or another, and they want their happily ever after. But nobody gets that. Best we can do is look back at our lives and try to structure them in some way resembling the three act structure.&&U ok?&&The army of the dead make their way South to King's Landing. 

The Dothraki take King's Landing by riding their horses over the walls on a magical bridge made of flame from the dragons.

Dany rides Drogon and Jon rides Rhaegar into the fray. Drogon grabs Cersei by the legs, Rhaegar grabs her head, and they rip her in half. 

The dragons launch her corpse towards the Night King, and, as it turns out, his one weakness is white-hot incestuous lust, and he explodes on contact. All at once the army of the dead turn to ash. 

Jon and Dany then disrobe, the dragons fly back to back, and the new King and Queen make sweet passionate love in mid air. 

In the closing shot, Sean Bean comes back to life as a Force Spirit and watches their lovemaking with a look of quiet approval. &&GRRM promised a bittersweet ending.

Great memories with this Godzilla franchise so far.&&I remember thinking to myself ""They DID add it!"" because it's been missing during the entire movie.&&The director basically said he knows the criticisms from the 2014 movie and they’re going to fix them.

It reminded me of pacific rim but if it took itself less seriously and had way better actors to work with who nailed the goofy tone. Had a great time. &&> But the main problem with the movie is that we spend most of our time with the most bland and boring characters I don’t care about. The most interesting ones are killed off way too early.

Yeah, on this we agree.  The characters in Skull Island were (mostly) colorful (at least O'Reilly and Goodman were), but it was just an overbearing film to sit through in the end.  If Godzilla needed improvement, it was to flip Binoche and Cranston into the starring roles.&&The Hawaii cut was a bit too cute, but I think it worked well.  I mean, when I went to see Skull Island, everyone by the end of the movie was just tired of watching it.  When Godzilla lit up, though, people were punching the air (including a pair of old ladies in front of me).  There's something to be said for that.&&Ya Heisei Godzilla is the best ones. Vs. Biollante to Vs. Desotroyah are my favorite Godzilla movies. Showa is too campy and Millennium is entirely too edgy. There's good ones sprinkled in but none are as consistently good as Heisei&&Or show the fucking fight on a TV screen in the background while uninteresting characters talk.

I haven’t seen Skull Island for what sounds like the same reasons you didn’t like it. Maybe when I’m in the mood for a mindless monster movie.

To each their own I guess.&&The second Godzilla grabbed the MUTO and gave him an atomic breath trachiotomy, I was yelling in the theater.

Looking back at ‘Demolition Man’ - the movie that thought Arnold Schwarzenegger would become president thanks to an amendment allowing foreigners to become president and predicted self-driving cars way back in 1993.,26547,91kxcn,http://www.mandatory.com/culture/1399177-25-years-time-finally-give-demolition-man-kudos-2,1869,1532463094.0,,"And Taco Bell wins the Fast Food Wars to become ""fine dining"".

The best line in the movie.  &&The guy at Walgreen's told me to ""be well"". Tripped me out &&This movie is absolutely fantastic, and not just because Wesley Snipes looks amazing with blonde hair. Always makes me a tiny bit sad when I see it being broadcast on tv and they censor the line about Jeffery Dahmer. It fits Snipes' character so well.&&This movie deserves a good deal of credit for casting Rob Schneider and then using him as little as possible.&&The movie also said that Schwarzenegger first became governor of California which he ended up doing in real life. 

EDIT: Ok some people have been questioning this.  I could have sworn that there was a line in the movie that said something like ""after he became governor of California, the constitution was changed blah blah blah so he could become president"".  I even remember hearing radio DJs commenting on this when he became governor.  But I can't find a clip of it.

I hope to God that line was improvised, because that little girl was awesome for replying with that.&&You have been fined one credit for the verbal morality statute thank you.&&I thought the quick-expanding foam to hold you in place during a car crash was pretty cool. Except that the foam can't arrive fast enough during a car crash, John Spartan's car crash involved his car flying for quite a long distance for the foam to fill up his main cabin.

One thing that always left me wondering (not the shells, okay the shells, but not.)  When John is first settling down into his domocile, he gets a phone call from a naked woman fresh out of the shower.   I would imagine this to be illegal.  It leads me to question the lives of, and adherence to the Cocteau plan from others assumed to be living within the confines of the law.

What's with this ""finally"" business??&&This movie appears to be a loose translation of ""A Brave New World"" by Aldus Huxley. Sandra Bullock's character is Lenina Huxley, and Wesly Snipes actually yells out ""It's a brave new world!"" at one point. Instead of babies being born in jars, they had prisoners in blocks of ice.

I was at Wednesday night church, outside in the parking lot during a break when in pulls a limo. The window rolls down and a hand waves our gaggle of tweens over. Snipes and Sly are in the back and in his most iconic voice, Sly asks ""uh ay yo kid, where can we find a nice bah to gettuh drink?"" I was 14, at a church... How the hell should I know?

The movie came out when I was a young horny teenage boy.  I thought Sandra Bullock was HOT.  And it *blew my mind* when the dream/sex sequence showed Sandra Bullock's perfect breasts!  I loved it so much that I vowed to buy that on DVD, laserdisc, or whatever was available at the time.  I was going to freeze-frame that hotness.

Fast forward to the film being out on DVD, and... no nudity.  The scene was changed!  I knew Sandra was a rising star, but I didn't think she had the clout to have that changed!

That has bugged me ever since, if for no other reason than I wonder if I imagined the whole thing.  I have a friend a couple of years older than I am, and he swears he saw the same nudity in the theater.  However, maybe he's just trying to be a good friend, and doesn't actually remember.&&It's worth noting that the movie ended with an accord between the people above who lived in absolute order, and the people below who lived in absolute freedom. Stallone's character even admits that there's good and bad things about both sides, and the ideal society should include a balance of both. 

So the takeaway shouldn't be that social justice is inherently bad, but that any ideal or philosophy taken to an extreme may develop issues of its own. &&It’s called authoritarianism and it has had a presence throughout human history. &&I know, right? Especially in the scene with that guy at the kiosk, begging it to complement him.

It's like, rather than make individuals resilient to the insults of reality, they shaped reality to suit the softest and most fragile-minded individuals.

When reality inevitably came crashing back into their lives, they were totally unprepared to deal with it.

I used to think that Idiocracy was the high watermark for its prescient take on a sci-fi-comedy-dystopia, but in the last six or seven years, it's definitely been dethroned by Demolition Man.&&This was the real prescient aspect of the movie - everything else about the future was basic, lucky guessing, or put in for comedy’s sake.  This whole aspect of society neutering itself by neutering it’s men is the real underlying message and vehicle for all the action.  

Funny I don’t think it’s even possible to remake this movie because I doubt there’s a star famous and masculine enough to be taken seriously like Stallone was in 1993.&&Try '20s or '30s.&&Right? I'd take Schwarzenegger in a heartbeat over this clown. &&Agreed, but honestly any celebrity president would be horrible.

Not too different today - with the mainstream media and tech-media complex creating a certain narrative by repressing or relegating certain viewpoints to the underground, or unconscious areas, and labeling those thoughts and politics as less than desirable.

When Cocteau said Pizza Hut I shouted ""what the fuck?!"" My girlfriend was staring at me with her eyes wide and she asked me what was wrong. I tried to explain what was going on bu5 since it was her first time watching it she looked at me like I was crazy. I finally proved I wasn't crazy when the food valet pulled up and in the reflection of the glass the Taco Bell logo was clearly visible. Still bugs me to this day. &&It's funny, when this was on US Netflix it showed Taco Bell, and they said Taco Bell, but the subtitles said Pizza Hut.&&DYK: Both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut are owned by the same company (PepsiCo, whose fast food division was spun off to become Yum Brands).

But once it cools down, you might as well just eat the box it came in. &&fuck yeah HOT 'N READY&&Papa John's isn't even great pizza without the media attentions it's gotten lately.

I will never tire of bacon and eggs.

I thought that was just to weigh it down!&&So it's the PBR of pizza. &&[removed]&&What I said was, give me all of the bacon and eggs you have.&&One of my all time favorite childhood films. I can quote Half the movie! Was amazing to sit down and watch it with my children. Haven't watched it since Robin Williams died though. 'Oh rufio why don't you go sick on a dedicated dogs nose'&&I heard that stuff gets everywhere&&> coarse sand.
